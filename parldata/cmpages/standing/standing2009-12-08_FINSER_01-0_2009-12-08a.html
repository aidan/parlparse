<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09120874000202"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Good morning. I have a few housekeeping
announcements before we begin. First, members of the Committee may
remove their jackets if they wish to do so while I am in the Chair. I
am sure that my co-Chairman will agree likewise. Can we ensure that
mobile telephones, pagers and any other electronic devices are switched
off during the proceedings? They interfere with all sorts of
things.</div><a name="09120874000008"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a money and a ways and means resolution attached to the Bill. Copies
are available in the room. May I remind members of the Committee that
adequate notice of amendments should be given. As a general rule, I and
my co-Chairman will not be calling starred amendments, including any
starred amendments that might be reached during an afternoon sitting of
the
Committee.</div><a name="09120874000009"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee will be asked first to consider the programme motion on the
amendment paper, for which debate is limited to half an hour. We will
then proceed to the motion to report written evidence and then the
motion to permit the Committee to deliberate in private in advance of
the oral sessions. I hope we will be able to take the latter two
formally. Assuming that the second motion is agreed to, the Committee
will then move into private session to enable us to discuss the order
of batting. Once that has been deliberated upon, witnesses and members
of the public will be invited back into the room and our oral evidence
session will begin. If the Committee agrees the programme motion, it
will hear oral evidence this morning and this afternoon, and on
Thursday morning and afternoon. Next week we will move to the Committee
Corridor and revert to the traditional clause by clause scrutiny of the
Bill.</div>
<a name="09120874000010"></a><div class="hs_Para">I give early
warning now, and will reiterate this during the last sitting prior to
the House rising for Christmas, that amendments to be considered on the
first day back after the Christmas recess&#151;5 January&#151;must
be tabled by 4.30 pm on 30 December, because the day after is new
year&#146;s eve and the Table Office will not be available to take
amendments. During the recess, amendments may be submitted signed by
the hon. Member&#151;not by anyone representing them&#151;by post,
or they may be submitted during normal working days and hours to the
Clerks in the Table Office on the third
floor.</div><a name="09120874000011"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope everyone has got that. If you are in any doubt, ask me or the
Clerk on the Bill. We will in any event reiterate it. I call the
Minister to move the programme motion.</div>

is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship,
Mr. Gale, and to move the programme motion, about
which we have had discussions through the usual channels. It is fair to
say that there has not been complete agreement. However, the Government
believe that 10 full sittings for the scrutiny of the Bill is ample
time for a Bill of this size, which has 34 substantive clauses, so we
are talking about fewer than four clauses per sitting. We are committed
to full scrutiny and are happy for the Committee to be allowed time to
consider the issues in full, including sitting late if it is felt
necessary.</div>
<a name="09120874000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">We recognise
that the timing of the scrutiny sessions before and after the Christmas
recess is not ideal, but we need to make progress with the Bill. We
have tried as far as possible to reflect concerns by moving the order
of consideration to ensure that the clauses that are likely to attract
the most attention will not be debated until after Christmas, which
provides more time for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column3" />Column number: 3</div>amendments to be thought about and submitted. We think that overall we
have a programme that provides for ample scrutiny of all the important
issues involved in the legislation.</div>
<a name="09120874000015"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09120874000204"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I should have welcomed Mr.
Bain formally to what I understand is his first Committee sitting. That
was remiss of me. It is good to have him with us. I appreciate the
Minister&#146;s courtesy in standing when he spoke during our
proceedings. We are in a peculiar position at the moment because
technically we are in Committee where traditionally hon. Members stand
to speak. Once we move into the evidence session, it will not be
necessary for them to do so. I say that for the benefit of everyone,
including myself, because the matter has just been drawn to my
attention. It is a courtesy and I appreciate it. Once we move into
evidence session, only the Chairman will stand to speak, because I wish
to demonstrate that, if necessary, I am seeking to exercise order. I
hope that that is
clear.</div>
<a name="09120874000016"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09120874000205"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): I join the Minister in
welcoming you to the chairmanship of the Committee,
Mr. Gale, as I will welcome your co-Chair,
Mr. Benton. It is probably the first time that an
hon. Member for Glasgow, North-East has taken part in the scrutiny of a
Bill for a while. The hon. Gentleman might not be able to seek much
guidance from his predecessor about quite what to do, but I am sure
that the hon. Member for Leeds, East will give him plenty of guidance,
which, I suspect, will be to remain seated and keep quiet. There may be
time in the future for the hon. Member for Glasgow, North-East to take
part more fully in
proceedings.</div><a name="09120874000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not want to spend too much time on the programme motion as we are
all keen to scrutinise and question the Minister, but I shall make a
couple of points. We voted against the programme motion at the
conclusion of our debate on Second Reading and, while the Minister says
that the Bill is short, the reality is that it covers a large number of
issues ranging from giving the Financial Services Authority new
statutory objectives through to credit card checks, consumer finance
education and groundbreaking work in class actions and consumer
redress. It is for those reasons we do not believe that sufficient time
has been allocated by the Government to get the Bill through to the
other place, which they clearly want to do as soon as
possible.</div><a name="09120874000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
also note that the scrutiny sessions are starting at 4 pm rather than
4.30 pm. While that gives us more time, it means that members of the
Committee who wish to participate in statements on the Floor of the
House will feel excluded from that process. We are compromising
parliamentary scrutiny by having such a start time. Not enough time has
been allocated to the deliberation of the Bill. There are big issues to
be dealt with, and we shall try to make as much progress as possible
within the relatively tight allocation of
time.</div><a name="09120874000019"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09120874000206"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Colin Breed</b> (South-East Cornwall) (LD): It is a pleasure
to be under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale, in our
proceedings this morning. The Bill is short. Indeed, it could be
shorter because certain aspects of it have quite a lot of duplication.
However, it has some main principles and they will take us some time to
debate. Having looked at the programme motion, I think that it has been
reasonably portioned out. The time between now and our coming back in
January gives us the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 4</div>opportunity to look at matters particularly after the evidence sessions,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09120874000208"></a>The
Chairman:</b> First, I welcome the witness from Her
Majesty&#146;s Treasury, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury,
Mr. Ian Pearson. Thank you for joining us this
morning. Before calling the first hon. Member to put a question, I
remind the Committee that all questions must be within the scope of the
Bill. It will be for the Chair to determine whether that is
so.</div><a name="09120874000027"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
1</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000209"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Bill covers a large number of different areas
but there are clearly some, where legislation is being passed, in which
there is much more work to be done. For example, the Bank of England
has not completed its work on a macro-prudential regime and further
consultation is still going on about living wills. Are some of the
measures in the Bill premature? Should we not wait until some of that
work is concluded, so that we know exactly what powers the Bank and the
Financial Services Authority need in connection with some of the those
macro-prudential
issues?</div><a name="09120874000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> I do not believe that it is premature to
introduce a Bill of this nature. As you will appreciate, Mark, what we
are really doing through this legislation on the financial regulation
side is providing a framework and, in some cases, new and additional
powers. We are not providing detail. The Bill is not the first word on
financial regulation and it will not be last word either, but I am
confident it provides a structure that provides the necessary powers,
duties and responsibilities, which can take account of those areas in
which things are still going on, as you rightly say. That can be
accounted for and dealt with in the overall architecture of the Bill as
it
stands.</div><a name="09120874000029"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
2</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000210"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Is it not the case that we have had to revisit
elements of the Banking Act 2009? Another statutory instrument to be in
front of us shortly is to correct an error in the Banking Act. The
danger is that we are making legislation in haste and that we will have
to come back to amend the Bill, to get it
right.</div><a name="09120874000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> There are two points. First, I would be very
wary of anybody saying that any legislation is always perfect and will
last forever. I do not think that  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div>that is the nature of modern Government. Secondly, we have had extensive
consultation on the Bill already, through the publication of the White
Paper &#147;Reforming Financial Markets&#148;. A lot of work has
gone on. We think it right and appropriate to introduce the Bill to
make improvements to the overall financial architecture in the UK. We
think that there is broad support for that to happen as
well.</div>
<a name="09120874000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
3</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000211"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Is it not also clear that the Bill is being
introduced at a time when, on the international framework for financial
regulation&#151;whether through the G20, or the EU through the recent
de Larosière proposals&#151;there is a lot of work going on at
international level? How confident are you that the Bill creates a
framework that slots into that developing international work, given
that those international limits are yet to be
fixed?</div><a name="09120874000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> I am confident that the Bill is appropriate
and can accommodate developments in the international sphere. It has
been explicitly designed to be able to take international developments
into account. It is right that in a lot of those areas we work closely
with our international partners. It comes back to my central point that
the Bill provides a framework within which some of the detail that
still needs to be agreed internationally can be accommodated. As we all
know, there is a distinction to be drawn between what is done through
primary legislation, what is done through secondary legislation and
what is done through codes of practice. The overall architecture, as it
stands, can accommodate further work that is going on, whether it is
through the Bank of England or the Financial Services Authority, or
work that is going on internationally as
well.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
4</b><a name="09120874000212"></a><b class="B">Mr.
George Mudie</b> (Leeds, East) (Lab): On Second Reading, some
pertinent questions were asked about the difference between the Council
for Financial Stability and the present tripartite committee. Can you
tell us what the Council for Financial Stability brings to the table
that the tripartite committee could not?</div>
<a name="09120874000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> What we are doing through the Council for
Financial Stability is formalising arrangements that have already been
in existence. As is well known, the tripartite authorities have been
meeting on a regular basis ever since that system of regulation was
drawn up over a decade ago. Clearly, during the financial crisis there
were far more intensive meetings between the tripartite authorities,
but what we think that we are creating through the Council for
Financial Stability is a more formalised structure that provides
greater clarity and understanding, and will formally discuss financial
stability issues. However, I would not want anybody to think that those
areas have not been discussed previously and that this is a completely
new invention. Of course the FSA, the Bank and the Chancellor have been
meeting on a regular basis, as everybody would expect them
to.</div>
<a name="09120874000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
5</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000213"></a>Mr.
Mudie:</b> Apart from formal meetings, where are the
additional qualities to help financial stability if it is simply the
same people meeting more often and more formally? That does not sound
as if, apart from meeting more often, they will bring any additional
qualities to deal with, or spot the risks to financial
stability.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div><a name="09120874000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> There are clear formal responsibilities
under the structure of the new Council for Financial Stability. There
are requirements in terms of meetings. It has to meet at least
quarterly. Certainly I would expect it to meet more frequently than
that during current circumstances. There is transparency in terms of
publishing minutes and in both these areas it is  right to have
a body that sits together and formally looks at these things. Having a
Council for Financial Stability under this new structure enables us to
do that. It enables people outside who look at these things to have
confidence that this is an issue that is being grasped and looked at
with great thoroughness as everybody would expect of
us.</div><a name="09120874000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
6</b><a name="09120874000214"></a><b class="B">James
Duddridge</b> (Rochford and Southend, East) (Con): The Bill
will probably not get Royal Assent until next March or April. We will
then have a general election and it is possible that there could be a
different Government. So when will the Council for Financial Stability
be set up and will that work happen during the election period or will
it be
suspended?</div><a name="09120874000038"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> Again, the key point to make is that what we
have through the Council for Financial Stability is something that is
formal, based in statute and with terms of reference. It is transparent
in the way that its discussions are minuted and it is also accountable
to enable proper parliamentary scrutiny. To answer the specific
question, the council will be set up in advance of Royal Assent. It is
planned that its first meeting will be in January. Again, if I could
get back to the point about why have this, what is it going to do and
why is it different, the key thing to recognise is that this will be a
body that is formally responsible for considering emerging risks to
financial stability in the UK in the global financial system and for
making sure that we have a co-ordinated and appropriate response by the
authorities. It will meet in advance of Royal
Assent.</div><a name="09120874000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
7</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000215"></a>James
Duddridge:</b> I am a little worried that it is going to be
set up in January. Given the parliamentary majority, it is probable
that the Bill will get Royal Assent. However, during the evidence
sessions and Committee sittings some interesting points about the
council&#146;s composition and responsibilities might be teased out
which will not be able to be implemented if the Minister presses ahead
in
January.</div><a name="09120874000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> I appreciate your worries, James. I think
what we are talking about here is changing from the existing standing
committee structure to having a Council for Financial Stability. There
will be, as you know, terms of reference, which have already been
published. It will obviously perform the same tasks as the existing
standing committee. I do not think we are talking about a revolution
here. Again, people who have looked at this recognise that the Council
for Financial Stability is not an unreasonable thing for the Government
to set up. People want to make sure that the emerging risks are fully
and appropriately
considered.</div><a name="09120874000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
8</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000216"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> Perhaps some of us actually want  to see a
revolution. We are creating a duty on the FSA to undertake a financial
stability strategy. We will have a deputy governor responsible for
financial stability and we are going to continue with the three that we
have got. The Chancellor is going to chair it. Do you foresee the
possibility that the chair could be outvoted?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 7</div><a name="09120874000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> As with the way things have operated to date
in the tripartite structure, the FSA, the Bank and the
Treasury&#151;the Chancellor&#151;have always met to discuss how
the issues are best handled. You are right to say that the FSA&#146;s
being given a new power with regards to financial stability is an
important part of the Bill. The Bank of England has that power as well.
People can try to make too much of the fact that different
organisations have the same sort of power. It is absolutely right that
the FSA, the Bank of England and the Treasury are all concerned about
financial stability. It is not the case that one authority has to be in
charge in this. Each has its own responsibilities, and we need
effective co-ordination. Again, I think that the Council for Financial
Stability builds on the existing standing committee and structure, and
is a significant improvement. We will undoubtedly debate this in more
detail when we get to the relevant
clauses.</div><a name="09120874000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
9</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000217"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> You would have to accept, Minister, that the
previous tripartite arrangements were hardly the greatest success, so
if we are building on something that was not much of a success, some
significant changes are needed. We need to identify precisely where the
real ultimate end responsibility is. If you have three different bodies
or three different interests&#151;three different views
perhaps&#151;someone, somewhere, has to be the final arbiter and has
to decide what action will be taken to prevent any systemic risk and
suchlike. Is that the Council for Financial Stability, and if it is,
will that be done through a majority
vote?</div><a name="09120874000044"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> I do not think it likely that the council
will have votes. The practicalities are that things do not operate like
that&#151;they have not operated like that
before.</div><a name="09120874000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
10</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000218"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> That is part of the
problem.</div><a name="09120874000046"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> You say it is part of the problem, but I do
not think it is. If you think of a voting system in which decisions are
made on the basis of a 2:1 vote between the Chancellor, the Governor
and the chairman of the FSA, I do not think that that is very helpful.
What is important is that we have effective co-ordination, and a
consensus between the tripartite authorities on the best course of
action. We are talking about discussion and
co-ordination&#151;</div><a name="09120874000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
11</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000219"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> Not
decision?</div><a name="09120874000048"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> The council is not formally a
decision-making
body.</div><a name="09120874000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
12</b><a name="09120874000220"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Love</b> (Edmonton) (Lab/Co-op): May I press the
Minister on that? The criticism that the Treasury Committee made was
that under the old standing arrangement, no one had responsibility for
stability, but under the new arrangements all three bodies have
responsibility and it is still unclear who has ultimate responsibility.
Does the Minister accept that criticism, and how do we overcome it in
the case that Mr. Breed mentioned, where there
might there be differences of opinion between those three
bodies?</div><a name="09120874000050"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> No, I do not accept that criticism. I think
it of fundamental importance that all three organisations have
responsibility for financial stability. Just saying &#147;The Bank
should have it and nobody else 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 8</div>should worry about it&#148; would not be the right thing to do,
either. Having just one single body in charge of financial
responsibility would not fit with the system of regulation that we have
in the United Kingdom. We can debate this; there is clearly a
difference between the political parties on the nature of
regulation.</div>
<a name="09120874000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">One view is
that we should have a system of regulation that has a Financial
Services Authority and the Bank of England, and there is another
view&#151;without wanting to over-simplify the Conservative party
position&#151;that everything should be done by the Bank of England.
We have consistently maintained that having just a single regulator
does not produce any improvements. Looking at the experience of failed
banks and the international experience of regulation, the Bank of
England regulating everything&#151;from the biggest to the smallest
banks, from credit unions to small building societies, from insurance
companies to independent financial advisers&#151;is not a sensible
regulatory model, and that would be asking too much of the Bank of
England.</div>
<a name="09120874000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that
the shadow Chancellor has said that he wants to back the FSA into the
Bank of England. I think that would cause massive disruption and
produce no greater added value. It is best to take our approach, which
is to improve the regulatory architecture in place at the moment
without engaging on major structural reform that I do not believe
produces benefits. Maybe even the shadow Chancellor is beginning to
think again about
that.</div><a name="09120874000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
13</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000221"></a>Mr.
Love:</b> Let me continue to press you on experience. The
Treasury Committee&#146;s numerous reports on the banking crisis have
shown that the standing committee and the memorandum of understanding
did not operate effectively in the circumstances that we faced, and
that is the reason why changes are being made. Minister, you say we
need effective co-ordination. What gives you the confidence that the
new Council for Financial Stability will deliver effective
co-ordination between the three bodies? That was clearly missing under
the standing committee arrangement, and the memorandum of understanding
just did not operate. Although I agree that we ought not to move to a
single regulator, or to some of the other proposals that have been put
forward, we do need to be confident that the Council for Financial
Stability will not meet the same difficulties that arose under the old
arrangements and the memorandum of
understanding.</div><a name="09120874000054"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> I have read and noted the Select
Committee&#146;s comments regarding the standing committee and the
way it operated. In large part, our response, in the Financial Services
Bill, recognises the need for improvements in the way the tripartite
authorities work together, and we are trying to address the issues
through the Council for Financial Stability. There are clear terms of
reference for the new body and I am confident that we have learned
lessons, which are in the legislation that we hope to take through both
Houses
shortly.</div><a name="09120874000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
14</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000222"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am not entirely sure that it is clear who is
responsible. We have gone from a situation where nobody seemed to have
explicit responsibility for financial stability to having the Banking
Act 2009, which gave that responsibility to the Bank of England. The
then Exchequer Secretary seemed to think that the FSA already had
responsibility for financial stability wrapped 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 9</div>up in the market confidence objective. Now, in the Bill, the FSA is
being given explicit responsibility for financial stability, but there
is no sense of delineation between the Bank&#146;s responsibility and
that of the FSA. Before, people were able to say, &#147;It is not our
responsibility, because none of us has responsibility&#148;; now they
can say, &#147;It is their responsibility to deal with this.&#148;
We have moved from one confused situation to another over the course of
legislative changes&#151;both those already made and those that are
in the Bill. I am still not clear who, in a crisis, is accountable for
financial
stability.</div><a name="09120874000056"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> I can well understand that there is a
superficial attraction in being able to say that one body is
responsible. I am trying to think of some good analogies to help the
Committee. Maybe that of a football team is appropriate&#151;it is
quite popular to use football analogies these days. Who is responsible
for scoring: a centre-forward, a midfielder or the left-back? It is
actually the team&#146;s responsibility, and it is the responsibility
of the Bank, the FSA and the Government, through the Treasury, to
ensure financial stability. We have to work together as a team, and the
Council for Financial Stability helps us do that in a more open and
transparent
way.</div><a name="09120874000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
15</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000223"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Using your analogy&#151;it is not the most robust
of analogies&#151;ultimately, if a football team fails, the manager
gets sacked. We have a team being managed by several different people,
and it is not clear who will carry the can if the team fails to score
and lets too many goals in. Your analogy demonstrated the weakness of
the argument, because no one is clearly in
charge.</div><a name="09120874000058"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> It is important to recognise that there are
shared responsibilities involved. The Treasury, as the UK&#146;s
finance and economics Ministry, has its set of responsibilities; the
Bank of England has responsibility for monetary policy as an
independent central bank; and the FSA has responsibility as an
independent financial regulator. We have on previous occasions debated
that architecture. The Bank, the Government and the FSA play different
positions on the football pitch and they all have their particular
responsibilities. When it comes to something as important and as broad
as financial stability, all the team players have responsibility; it
would be wrong to pretend otherwise and a mistake to say that it is
just one person or organisation&#146;s responsibility. That does not
reflect the modern
reality.</div><a name="09120874000059"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
16</b><a name="09120874000224"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Tyrie</b> (Chichester) (Con): Do you think that the
tripartite committee system worked well in the run-up to Northern
Rock?</div><a name="09120874000060"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> We certainly learned lessons from Northern
Rock.</div><a name="09120874000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09120874000225"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> One can always learn lessons, but I am asking
whether you think the tripartite committee system worked well, had a
mixed record, or worked
badly.</div><a name="09120874000062"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> That is one particular rating scale that
could be deployed. Northern Rock got into
difficulties.</div><a name="09120874000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09120874000226"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> I am asking you about the tripartite committee, not
Northern Rock. How did the tripartite committee do?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 10</div><a name="09120874000064"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> I think that anyone would have to say that,
collectively, we could have done better. I do not have any problem in
saying that. When it was clear that Northern Rock was having
difficulties, action was taken. Discussions took place within the
tripartite committee and we took the decision that we did on Northern
Rock. That decision was the right thing to do, and you will be aware
that your party did not support it at the time. Your party&#146;s
stance would have created huge problems for the economy and would have
cost thousands of
jobs.</div><a name="09120874000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
17</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000227"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> What was the specific way in which the tripartite
committee could have done better? Where specifically did it go
wrong?</div><a name="09120874000066"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> In my view, the way in which Northern Rock
was regulated could have been improved.</div>
<a name="09120874000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09120874000228"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> In which
respect?</div><a name="09120874000068"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> Its business model and some of the decisions
taken by the management at the time certainly should have raised more
eyebrows and led to more action on the part of the
regulator.</div>
<a name="09120874000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
18</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000229"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> Do you think that there was a liquidity crisis,
Minister, or a solvency
crisis?</div><a name="09120874000070"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09120874000230"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b>
Yes.</div><a name="09120874000072"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> I do not think it is an either/or. The
situation with regard to Northern Rock, and the difficulties it got
into, were to do with some of the risks inherent in its business model
and with some of its decisions. First and foremost, responsibility for
any bank that gets into difficulty has to lie with the management of
that bank. Clearly there were inadequacies in how the bank was run;
risks were taken that should not have been taken. If your questions
are, &#147;Should those risks have been spotted earlier?&#148; and
&#147;Should action have been taken by regulatory
authorities?&#148;, well, yes, I think more should have been done
sooner, before the problems at Northern Rock came to
light.</div><a name="09120874000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
19</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000231"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> As I am sure you know, no liquidity data at all
were being collected by the tripartite committee, so it could not
possibly have been aware of a liquidity crisis&#151;a point made by
the Treasury Committee. The informal arrangements in that respect,
therefore, have to be said to have failed. Why do you think the
formalisation of those arrangements will guarantee the collection of
the necessary
data?</div><a name="09120874000074"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>Since Northern Rock and other
developments in the financial system, there has been a lot of
discussion between the relevant bodies, and a lot of lessons have been
learned. What we have in the Council for Financial Stability is a body
through which we can discuss and co-ordinate action to make sure that
we have the necessary information, so that decisions can be made in the
interests of financial
stability.</div><a name="09120874000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
20</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000232"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> Who is responsible in that new body for making sure
that the data are collected? Who specifically? Which individual is
carrying the
can?</div><a name="09120874000076"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> As I was trying to explain, each
body&#151;whether Bank, FSA or Treasury&#151;has its own particular
responsibilities.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 11</div><a name="09120874000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09120874000233"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> So it is pass the parcel again, is it
not?</div><a name="09120874000078"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> No, it is not pass the parcel, but to
pretend that there is one person to blame, or one organisation with
sole responsibility, misses the point. Surely the point is that
financial stability cuts right across the boundaries of all
organisations. It is something that we are all involved with and, in
such circumstances, it is right that the tripartite bodies work
effectively together to ensure financial stability for the future, and
that they have the capacity to co-ordinate action when action is
needed.</div><a name="09120874000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
21</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000234"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> Do you not think that it will strike people outside
this place as quite extraordinary that when every experienced
commentator has said that what went wrong above all was that no one was
in charge, you are now putting in place an arrangement in which no one
is in charge? There has been a chorus from every corner of the
specialist community&#151;the City, the Bank of England, which has
made this point, and the FSA, which has briefed privately on it and, to
some degree,
publicly.</div><a name="09120874000080"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> No, that is not true. What we are doing
through the Bill is taking action to ensure that we have the best
standards of financial regulation in this country. The FSA, as the
independent regulator, is responsible for making sure that it has the
right information to be able to carry out its supervisory functions.
Again, I think that you are missing the point when you say that there
is one body that will be in charge. If the best suggestion that you can
come up with is that the Bank of England should be in absolute charge
of everything, from the smallest financial adviser operating in
Darlington to the biggest international bank, I think it is a recipe
for disaster and a very dangerous thing to
do.</div><a name="09120874000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
22</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000235"></a>Mr.
Mudie:</b> I still think, following on from where Andrew left
off, that someone has to make a decision and be the decision maker. You
have ruled out voting. One of the faults with Northern Rock was that
although the FSA saw the danger and got Lloyds to make a bid, it could
not persuade the Bank of England and the Governor to enter into
negotiations with Lloyds to have it take over Northern Rock&#151;it
could not persuade the other partner in the tripartite committee. How
will the new committee get around that? The FSA sees something that
needs to be done by one of the other two partners and says, &#147;We
are responsible for it; you do it&#148;. I do not believe that the
Chancellor will take instructions from the FSA, and from history, I
cannot see how it will be different with the Bank of England. How will
differences like that be resolved by that
committee?</div><a name="09120874000082"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> I do not want to get into the detail of
Northern Rock&#146;s history. In direct answer to your question,
those sorts of issues need to be discussed between the tripartite
authorities, even though it is often the case that initially there
might be differences of views. The only way to come to a settled view
as a whole is to discuss and agree collectively on the best course of
action, recognising that each partner has its own set of
responsibilities: the Bank for monetary policy, the FSA as the
independent financial regulator and we as the Government have our own.
We need to sit down and discuss matters when banks get into
difficulties, or more generally, to discuss financial stability, then
collectively decide on the best way to proceed and to handle the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 12</div>particular issues. What we are talking about, particularly with regard
to the Council for Financial Stability in the Financial Services Bill,
is how we can have an effective, transparent and accountable system to
ensure that we are horizon-scanning and dealing with any particular
risks to financial stability. Those risks come from different
directions, and it is right at the end that the Bank, the FSA and
ourselves are all around the table to discuss
them.</div>
<a name="09120874000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
23</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000236"></a>Mr.
Mudie:</b> I do not want to dwell on with that; I am sure that
we will deal with it later in Committee. The situation we are
discussing is one in which the FSA, having responsibility for financial
stability, says to the Bank of England that it must do something that
is within its remit of what is important, in the eyes of the FSA, to
ensure financial stability. As we saw with Northern Rock, 24 hours is a
long time in that situation, and people do not have time to get round
to having a broad and sensible discussion. Someone says, &#147;This
must be done&#148;, but the Bank of England says, &#147;No&#148;.
How will this committee&#151;clearly, it will work with the
tripartite committee&#151;bring decision making to that sort of
situation, which is what we are talking about when we are looking at
the dangers to financial stability?</div>
<a name="09120874000084"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> As I said, the Council for Financial
Stability is not a decision-making body. It is a body that will discuss
risks to financial stability and will co-ordinate action where
necessary. It perhaps is not helpful to speculate on whether there
might be difficulties in future with banks or building societies. You
are perfectly right to say that when you have situations such as those
with Northern Rock, Bradford &amp; Bingley, and the Dunfermline
building society&#151;organisations that we knew were in massive
difficulties&#151;there can at times be some differences of view on
the best way to handle the situation. That is probably quite normal,
but the key thing is that the bodies meet and collectively agree the
right action to be
taken.</div><a name="09120874000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
can use Northern Rock as an example, but it is an example of action
actually being taken. As a result of action being taken we ensured that
nobody lost any money&#151;depositors were safe&#151;we protected
the bank, and Northern Rock has since paid back substantial sums of
money to the Government. Now, with hindsight, I think that pretty much
everybody thinks that it was the right thing to do. At the time, the
judgment of the Conservative party was not to support action being
taken&#151;it wanted Northern Rock to fail. We took the judgment that
there would be risks to financial stability if Northern Rock was
allowed to go to the wall, and that there would be additional
consequences such as people being thrown out of work and all that is
involved with that. We took action, and it was the right sort of
action. That shows, ultimately, that decisions are taken in the
interests of protecting depositors and securing financial stability,
but we need to ensure that we have the most effective
structures.</div><a name="09120874000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
we are trying to do through the Financial Services Bill as a whole is
to ensure that we have an improved system of financial regulation in
this country. We are also&#151;we will probably get on to
this&#151;talking about improving consumer protection. There are
measures on that in the Bill, but we are talking here about how we
improve our system.</div>

24</b><a name="09120874000237"></a><b class="B">John
Howell</b> (Henley) (Con): The Minister must recognise that
what we are struggling to see where the additionality is. The only
piece of additionality that I have spotted so far this morning is for
outputs&#151;we are going to have minutes from this, whereas we did
not have them before. I am sure that minutes are very valuable and I
welcome that transparency, but I do not see how that leads to better
outcomes&#151;indeed I am not quite sure what the expected outcomes
are, except that there will be a broader definition of financial
stability. We have two activities: keeping matters under review, which
we see as largely a paper-based exercise, and co-ordination. So what
you have actually given us today, Minister, is a general outcome of
financial stability and a few bits of output that have gone into that,
principally in producing better minutes. However, in the middle of this
we still have this black box of not knowing what co-ordination will
look like, how it will be made effective, and how the relationship is
between the terms of reference and the financial
stability.</div><a name="09120874000088"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian

Council for Financial Stability, as I am sure you
recognise.</div><a name="09120874000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
25</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000238"></a>John

important part of this
Bill?</div><a name="09120874000090"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> No, I am saying that it is an important part
of the Bill, but not the only part. In talking about improving
financial regulation, you have to look at the parts of the Bill dealing
with the objectives of the FSA, at what is in the Bill about recovery
and resolution plans, and at what is there about remuneration and the
action we are taking to ensure that excessive risk taking is not
incentivised. All these are important improvements to the system of
financial regulation. It is not just about the Council for Financial
Stability, important though that part is; it is about the rest of it
too.</div>
<a name="09120874000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
26</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000239"></a>John
Howell:</b> You have accepted that this is an important part
of the Bill, but do you not accept that it undermines the Bill if we
are left with a huge amount of uncertainty about one of its major
planks? There is this black box in the middle and we do not know what
it is in it. I am not even sure that the Treasury knows what is in it.
It would be interesting to see whether there has been any modelling of
how it will work in a real-life case and whether that could be
presented to us. That would allow us to trace through what the new
council is doing and how it will contribute to financial
stability.</div><a name="09120874000092"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> I do not agree that there is a black box. We
are building on the best bits of the standing committee structure,
ensuring that we have a Council for Financial Stability with clear
terms of reference and pursuing through discussion and co-ordination an
agenda that ensures that the council can work effectively as a body.
That is the key thing. It is not a black box. It is the key players who
have an interest in financial stability sitting round a table, meeting,
formally assessing risks to financial stability and collectively
discussing how they co-ordinate action that needs to be taken, given
their respective roles and responsibilities. That seems to me to be
what you would want of a system of regulation, monetary policy and
financial and economic decision making. You would want that network to
be together and working well. That is what the Council for Financial
Stability is designed to achieve.</div>

Roy</b> (Glenrothes) (Lab): With permission,
Mr. Gale, I should like to go back to the team
analogy. If responsibility is not clear, there are issues about the
effectiveness of intervention and action. My fear is that, by default,
we have an own goal. How will this ensure more effective teamwork and
more rigour in terms of impact? I think that an exemplar or a case
study might help us to understand how this will operate.</div>
<a name="09120874000094"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> Let me try to add a little to what I have
said about the Council for Financial Stability. The key differences
between the Council for Financial Stability and what we had previously
are really to do with the fact that the council&#146;s
responsibilities are laid down with a high degree of formality compared
with the standing committee structure. The transparency with which it
will operate in most circumstances&#151;I say &#147;most
circumstances&#148; because there will be some examples where it
would not be in the interests of financial stability to disclose
actions that are, or may have been, taken&#151;its accountability to
Parliament and the fact that it will be subject to proper parliamentary
scrutiny are all important. They are the major differences between it
and the current standing committee structure. Again, I know people want
one person to blame for all of this, but it is not as simple as that.
When it comes to financial stability, the Bank, the FSA and the
Government all have a responsibility. We simply need to make sure that
we have the most effective way of co-ordinating that. In our view, the
Council for Financial Stability will be an improvement on the existing
structure, so we believe that that is the right thing to
do.</div>

28</b><a name="09120874000241"></a><b class="B">Mr.
William Bain</b> (Glasgow, North-East) (Lab): Clauses 1 to 4
require the council to produce an annual report for Parliament. Are
there any other means by which greater parliamentary accountability can
be secured? What specific criteria will Parliament be able to use to
assess the performance of the council to determine whether it is
achieving its goal of greater financial
stability?</div><a name="09120874000095"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> Certainly, as you rightly say, there is a
requirement for an annual report in clause 3. I have no doubt that the
Treasury Committee will want to scrutinise the work of the Council for
Financial Stability. It is clearly not for me to suggest to that
Committee what its work programme should be, but I would be very
surprised indeed if that was not a major part of what it wanted to do.
I would be very open to exploring whether there are other ways for
Parliament to make sure that it has the capacity fully to scrutinise
the work of the Council for Financial Stability. The council has to
produce a financial stability plan and I would expect the Treasury
Committee to scrutinise that. We could look at other ways for the
council to be scrutinised as well. What is already in the Bill is an
improvement on the existing structures, which are certainly not as
transparent as those that we are proposing.</div>
<a name="09120874000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
29</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000242"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Is the problem for the Minister delineating the
respective responsibilities of the three bodies involved, because there
are a number of factors that contribute to financial stability? We can
argue that the Treasury has responsibility for macro-economic policy.
Clearly, the FSA has little impact on macro-economic policy, but it is
the prudential supervisor of the Government&#146;s arrangements for
individual institutions&#151;the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 15</div>Treasury is not. Is that not part of the problem with which the Minister
has yet to grapple? Is it about trying to say that those are the powers
that you, as an institution, have to tackle financial stability and
that that is the area in which you can be held to account? The Bank of
England was given the financial stability objective in the Banking Act
2009. I do not think that it was given any additional powers in the Act
to enable it to fulfil that objective. It was certainly given
responsibility for payment systems. The actions it can take to tackle
financial stability relate to a limited range of options and to its own
remit. The challenge for the new council is to say that this is what
you, as the FSA, are responsible for on delivering financial stability;
this is what the Treasury is responsible for on delivering financial
stability and this is what the Bank is there to do. I do not think that
the Government have got to the point where they are able to articulate
the different areas of responsibility of the different tripartite
authorities to deliver that objective.</div>
<a name="09120874000097"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> You are right to say that what we have got
is a structure in which Government have responsibility for
macro-economic policy, an independent financial regulator has
responsibility for prudential supervision, and an independent central
bank has responsibility for monetary policy. What I am trying to
explain to the Committee is that financial stability cuts across all
those areas of responsibility. That is why we all have an interest in
ensuring the stability of the financial system. It is absolutely right
that the FSA and the Bank have got their own clear aims,
responsibilities and duties. I do not think it is right to say that the
Bank of England was not given new powers. It was given new powers for
resolving failing banks as part of the Banking Act 2009, which we
debated.</div><a name="09120874000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
debates that we had at that time were about the different roles and
responsibilities, which can sometimes be a bit difficult to comprehend.
We need to understand that the UK system has an independent financial
regulator, an independent central bank and a Government finance
Ministry&#151;the Treasury&#151;that all have different
responsibilities. We also need to understand that all three of those
bodies need to play their part in ensuring financial responsibility. I
do not think that that is conceptually a difficult thing for people to
comprehend. We need to make sure that we all discuss potential risks to
financial stability. That is what the CFS will do as a body, and it
will do it in a more open and transparent way than the existing
tripartite standing committee
arrangements.</div><a name="09120874000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
30</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000243"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> But if the threat to financial stability was a
consequence of the Government&#146;s macro-economic policy, there is
not a great deal that the Bank of England or the FSA could do about it.
If that was the cause of the instability, they would both object to
sharing responsibility for
it.</div><a name="09120874000100"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> I do not want to speculate, but if the Bank
took that view, I am sure that it would want to make it known to the
Government. One of the features of the new system is that that would be
minuted and made publicly
available.</div><a name="09120874000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09120874000244"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> But it would not feel that it had responsibility
for financial stability where the cause of that instability was
Treasury policy.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 16</div><a name="09120874000102"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> We are getting hypothetical. I need to drag
you back to the point that all three bodies have an interest in
financial stability. All three have to be round the table discussing
financial stability and risks to the stability of the financial system.
They also need to discuss, where necessary, how to co-ordinate the
actions that need to be taken. I think that anyone would reasonably
expect that to happen. I simply do not agree with the argument that
there is not clarity about roles and responsibilities. There is
clarity. It is very clear what the Government do, what the Bank does
and what the FSA does. The fact that they need to work together on a
regular basis is something that we are very clear about, and the fact
that that needs to be transparent and structured is one of the reasons
why we want to set up the Council for Financial
Stability.</div><a name="09120874000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
31</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000245"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> I want to move on to the FSA. We have covered the
CFS quite a lot, and I suspect that that will form a great deal of
debate when we look at the
Bill.</div><a name="09120874000104"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> So we have done clauses 1 to
4!</div><a name="09120874000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09120874000246"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> Under the FSA, we are talking about an intensive
and intrusive approach to supervision. Would that include on-site
inspections both in the UK and abroad? If so, are the resources
currently available to the FSA capable of undertaking such
work?</div><a name="09120874000106"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> Certainly, the phrase that you use is
something that Adair Turner has said about how he wants the FSA to act.
It is clearly up to the FSA as an independent regulator to decide for
itself what information it requires and how that information is best
obtained. I would not want to say to the FSA that it has to collect
information in a certain way. It is up to the FSA to manage its own
resources. I am certainly not aware that it has told us, as the
Government, that it does not have the necessary resources to do the
job.</div><a name="09120874000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
32</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000247"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> I am aware that those away with the Select
Committee last week looked very much at the regulation of banks in
Europe. There they were very keen on on-site regulation in both home
and host branches, which is very intrusive. It is very demanding in
resource terms both in the numbers of people, the costs and everything
else. As for the United Kingdom FSA, bearing in mind the sheer number
of bank branches both in the City and other parts of the country, it
would be a quantum leap in the amount of work that it would have to do.
Is that what the Minister expects as part of the new supervisory regime
at the
FSA?</div><a name="09120874000108"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> It is the responsibility of the FSA to
decide how best to undertake its supervisory functions, in what form it
requires information and whether that requires the on-site collection
of it, or whether it will be through the normal system of requests and
reporting of information. That is a decision for the FSA, but it must
have confidence in the quality of information that is being supplied.
It will obviously want to make its own assessments of that, and find
out whether there is a risk of its being provided with information that
it is not entirely accurate. It, of course, has powers to do all the
things that you are talking about, and it has to make its own judgment
of how best to exercise them.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 17</div><a name="09120874000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
33</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000248"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> If the FSA has to exercise its own judgment, what
body will decide whether that judgment is correct? Will it be the
Treasury or the Council for Financial
Stability?</div><a name="09120874000110"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> At the risk of getting back into a debate
that we have had for some time and as I have tried to explain, the FSA
has its own clear responsibilities just as the Bank and the Treasury
do. When it comes back to the broader point about financial stability,
everybody shares an interest in ensuring financial stability, but each
organisation has its individual responsibilities. As an independent
financial regulator, it is the responsibility of the Financial Services
Authority to ensure that the companies it regulates are not taking
excessive risks and are operating under the terms of their
authorisation by the
FSA.</div><a name="09120874000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
34</b><a name="09120874000249"></a><b class="B">Ms
Celia Barlow</b> (Hove) (Lab): In terms of the introduction of
recovery and resolution, do you agree that it is too important an issue
to fail? What is being done to ensure that it will not fail? Do you
think that it will trigger significant structural
change?</div><a name="09120874000112"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> Recovery and resolution plans are an
important feature of the Financial Services Bill. They are sometimes
called living wills. We believe that it is right&#151;indeed, it is a
decision that has been welcomed&#151;that we ask banks to ensure that
they have such plans in place. A lot has been made about the fact that
banks are complex organisations. We can have a debate about
Glass-Steagall if the Committee wants to go in that direction, but we
are trying through recovery and resolution plans to have, in effect, an
operating diagram that will enable the tripartite authorities to take
action if a bank gets into difficulty. It is very much a new area,
which is why work is being piloted at the moment in relation to
recovery and resolution plans. That is one way in which we are
addressing the too-big-to-fail argument.</div>
<a name="09120874000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
35</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000250"></a>Ms
Barlow:</b> You say that it will be a tripartite
responsibility, but will the FSA be able to instigate structural change
in the banks and do you have a time scale for that? I refer to the
banking sector rather than individual banks.</div>
<a name="09120874000114"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> Certainly the authorities see recovery and
resolution plans and tougher prudential requirements on systemic firms
as part of a key policy that is comprehensive and will deal with
systemic risks. If you like, there are four parts to this. There are
strength and market discipline, through better corporate governance,
policies on remuneration in the Bill with enhanced prudential
supervision by the FSA, including requiring systemically significant
firms to hold high levels of capital. There are stronger resolution
arrangements through the recovery and resolution plans and improvements
to the overall framework. It is a package
overall.</div><a name="09120874000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
time scale, as you know, the Bill allows the FSA to introduce the plans
gradually and in a proportionate and risk-based manner. We are
legislating to ensure that the key firms are targeted first, which is
why the Bill specifies that the FSA must make rules for firms covered
by part 1 of the Banking Act 2009&#151;that is, banks and building
societies in the first instance. On the detail, rules on plans for
those firms will be prepared by the FSA in 2010, expanding to other
firms at a timetable set out by the Government by order.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 18</div><a name="09120874000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">I mentioned
the pilot project that the FSA is undertaking. It is currently working
to an ambitious timetable with a small number of large UK banks, with
the intention of producing draft components of recovery and resolution

<a name="09120874000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
36</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000251"></a>Mr.
Love:</b> With your approval, Chairman, I would like to look
again at the FSA and robust action as well as picking up on the issues
that we have just talked about. The Bill will allow the FSA to adopt an
intensive and intrusive approach to supervision, but there are some
concerns about its track record. Some people highlight the fact that it
is funded through a levy on City institutions and most of the staff are
people who go back and forth in the City. There is, therefore, some
concern that they are perhaps not as entirely independent as necessary
to get the type of robust action that we see in the United States, for
example. Has any of that been a concern for Ministers?</div>
<a name="09120874000118"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> I simply do not agree with the argument that
the FSA is not taking robust action at the moment. It is. It is right,
of course, to make the point about how the FSA is funded and the fact
that some people will be seconded to the FSA and some will be
recruited. That is true, but it does not prevent the FSA operating as
an independent financial regulator and doing so in a robust way. From
the chairman, chief executive and board right down through the
organisation, the FSA is taking a more intensive and intrusive approach
to regulation. The impression I get from the conversations that I have
with people in the City is that they feel that they are being watched
closely.</div><a name="09120874000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
37</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000252"></a>Mr.
Love:</b> Let me press you on that. I strongly welcome the
statement made by the chief executive of the FSA about it taking a much
more robust view. I will raise two issues. First, the FSA was very late
in agreeing that there might be an adverse impact to short selling,
although it did eventually. Secondly, on insider trading, we are seeing
robust action in the United States, while the FSA has a lamentable
record on insider trading, which according to all the figures that we
see continues to be a daily occurrence. I do not underestimate the
challenge of bringing people to justice, but it seems that the United
States is rising much more to the challenge than the FSA has done. I am
interested to see if the FSA will make effective use of its new powers
to ensure that we get the sort of robust regulation that there is in
the United States.</div>
<a name="09120874000120"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> The practice of short selling is not
necessarily market abuse. It is a normal technique that is used in the
industry and should not be put in the same sentence as insider
trading.</div><a name="09120874000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
38</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000253"></a>Mr.
Love:</b> Let me explain. Generally, most people in the
industry consider short selling a positive feature of market activity.
However, I think it is also accepted that when it is being done
comprehensively by many institutions it can have a negative effect.
That negative effect seemed to be very late in impressing itself on the
FSA, which continued to argue for a long time that short selling was a
positive feature of the market place. That is all I would say. The FSA
seemed to reflect the City point of view rather than make a rather more
independent judgment about the impact of short selling. As the FSA will
be given new powers in the Bill to deal 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column19" />Column number: 19</div>with short selling, I assume the Government accept that in certain
circumstances negative effects can occur from short selling and would
want the FSA to intervene. I want to be reassured that the FSA
understands that argument and will robustly intervene when it feels it
necessary.</div><a name="09120874000122"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> You are right, Andy, to say that in the Bill
we are providing new powers for the FSA to prohibit or require
disclosure of short selling. We are doing that because we believe that
in certain circumstances short selling could exacerbate market
instability and pose a risk to financial stability. I want to make a
distinction between the power we are giving to the FSA and the general
practice of short selling, which is not illegal and is an established
market practice. There has been some concern that we are placing short
selling in the market abuse section of the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000. I want to be clear that what we say in the Bill on
short selling&#151;through new part 8A to the FSMA&#151;is entirely
separate from the section on market abuse. Short selling is not market
abuse but it could, in the wrong circumstances, pose risks to financial
stability.</div>
<a name="09120874000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the point

the FSA to root out illegal

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
39</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000254"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> May I ask about the recovery and resolution regime?
We have a regime in which the Government will not be in a position to
put in money to keep a bank afloat if it gets into trouble. Once the
measures come into effect, will things such as the deposit protection
scheme, the special resolution regime and living wills be sufficient to
deal with bank failure in future or will indemnities, guarantees or
indeed direct investment still be required?</div>
<a name="09120874000125"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> What we are trying to achieve through
recovery and resolution plans is a way of dealing with the moral hazard
problem and the too-big-to-fail argument, and provide a way if action
is needed to take it in a clear direction because we understand the
links among different parts of an organisation&#146;s business. That
gives us a more effective way of ensuring successful resolution that
does not damage financial stability. Clearly, the preferable course is
to ensure that there is a timely warning when a bank gets into
difficulty, so that action can be taken without the need to look at
recovery and resolution plans. There are still the tools of the special
resolution regime as part of the Banking Act 2009. Recovery and
resolution plans&#151;and resolution plans clearly&#151;will
benefit the tripartite bodies when they are making decisions about the
operation of the special resolution regime, if a bank gets into
difficulties in the future. Clear recovery and resolution plans will
help the future operation of the
SRR.</div><a name="09120874000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
40</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000255"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> So, you believe that this sends a clear signal to
markets that, with this in place, there will be a proper process to
wind down or restructure banks in the event of financial problems, so
they should not necessarily expect banks to be bailed out by the
Government in future.</div>
<a name="09120874000127"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> The recovery and resolution plans are
almost, in my mind, a manual for surgery. They will enable a surgeon to
take action to carve out the bad bits of a business and take
appropriate action, while maintaining the good parts to ensure the
overall health of the body. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 20</div>That capacity is there through the recovery and resolution plans. I do
not want to speculate on how they might get used but the intention is
that they are like an operating manual. They enable effective action to
be
taken.</div><a name="09120874000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
understood the huge problems that can be caused by the collapse of an
organisation such as Lehman Brothers; with all the different
relationships, it has taken an incredibly long time to understand the
transactions, let alone the linkages between them. Having recovery and
resolution plans will enable decisions to be taken on action in the
event of companies getting into significant difficulties and that
action being needed. But clearly the best thing will be for them not to
be in that situation in the first
place.</div><a name="09120874000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
41</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000256"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Indeed, but given the complexity of some of these
institutions, the operating manual is not something that could be
written on the back of a fag packet. Presumably, it will be quite a
complex document. What sort of cost has been estimated? What is the
cost to institutions of drawing up these living
wills?</div><a name="09120874000130"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> I am not sure whether there are any costings
available. Obviously it will depend to some extent on the size of the
institution involved. If I can get any information, I will certainly
make it available when we come to deliberate on the Bill in
Committee.</div><a name="09120874000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
we are trying to achieve through the recovery and resolution plans is
to have a way of identifying key relationships, so that we can reduce
the impact of firm failure, and to ensure, as far as we can, that firms
do not require extraordinary support from Government in the future.
That is clearly part of it. If we can take action that limits the
impact of firm failure, perhaps we will not need to take some of the
big decisions that we have had to take in the
past.</div><a name="09120874000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
42</b><a name="09120874000257"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Charles Walker</b> (Broxbourne) (Con): What will be the
mechanism for reporting the risk? All this seems to revolve around
risk&#151;identifying and pricing it. It seems that the British
Government and other Governments bailed out a lot of banks because
banks could not handle or understand where their risk resided in their
financial instruments. What would be a mechanism for people in
regulatory authority to identify the level of exposure to risk that
banks
have?</div><a name="09120874000133"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> You are right, Charles, to say that we have
spent a lot of money supporting the banking system in the United
Kingdom. I do not need to cite the figures&#151;I think everybody
recognises it. And you are right to point out that some banks took
excessive risks. That is why we have this Bill, with the clauses on
remuneration and the strengthening of financial regulation&#151;the
whole package that is in the Bill. Clearly, when you are talking about
individual risk, it is the responsibility of the Financial Services
Authority, as the independent financial regulator, to look at the risks
of the individual businesses that it authorises under the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000. When it comes to risks to financial
stability as a whole, the Bank, the FSA and the Government all have a
responsibility to look at those risks, as I tried to explain
earlier.</div><a name="09120874000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
43</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000258"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> I suppose my concerns rest on the fact&#151;I
think that my colleague, Mr. Love, highlighted
this&#151;that you have these increasingly complex financial 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column21" />Column number: 21</div>instruments being invented by whizz kids, only they are not whizz kids
because they do not really understand their own creations and
inventions. That was part of the problem. Will it be the case that the
FSA, or the regulatory regime, will say, &#147;If we do not
understand how these financial instruments work, you will simply not be
allowed to trade them&#148;? If we do not understand how they work,
we cannot identify the level of future risk that the UK taxpayer will
be exposed to if they all go incredibly wrong and this sort of leverage
pyramid begins to crumble away
again.</div><a name="09120874000135"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> There are a number of things that I want to
say in response to that. The first thing, which I think we should
always remember and never lose sight of, is the fact that
responsibility for assessing risks in a business should lie, first and
foremost, with the managers of that business. Quite frankly, some of
the management in the banks that got into difficulty was poor in doing
that, or reckless in not properly taking account of the risks to its
business. I also think that on top of that, shareholders have a
responsibility to ensure that their investments are being properly run
by competent managers. There have been some issues there and things
that we can discuss. There is also an issue about whether there has
been adequate financial regulation and assessment of the risks of the
business as well by the independent regulator.</div>
<a name="09120874000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">You tempt me
to talk about product regulation as well when you talk about whizz kids
designing products. As you are aware, we tended to focus not on product
regulation but on regulation of the business as a whole and look at
risk in the context of the risk to the business as a whole. There are
certain instances where it would be right to look at the regulation of
individual products. Also one of the lessons from the past couple of
years is the need to look at the risks inherent in some business models
as well. I am not sure whether in both those areas these were
adequately and properly assessed either by managers, shareholders or,
indeed, the regulator.</div>
<a name="09120874000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
44</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000259"></a>Mr.
Love:</b> The research paper provided by the Library explains
how these RRPs would ensure that banks have the protection of other
financial institutions and that as part of their business planning
they</div>
<a name="09120874000179"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;should produce
plans that would show how, legally, administratively and financially
they would plan for a severe financial crisis and ultimately, how they
would arrange for the company to be wound up&#148;.</div>
<a name="09120874000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">That seems quite
onerous. While I understand that these plans will be vetted and agreed
with the FSA and so the associated costs are difficult to highlight at
the present time, you must have some idea from the discussions that
have taken place of the likely drawbacks of placing such onerous
conditions on these institutions. Are you confident that those
drawbacks will not be so severe that they have a negative
effect?</div><a name="09120874000139"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> I do not have detailed costings on how much
work will be involved in preparing recovery and resolution plans. We
have sufficient information to make a judgment that this is the right
sort of policy, which is why we have recovery and resolution plans in
the Bill. Our experiences in the past couple of years show that we need
to find a way of addressing the moral hazard problem. We need to find
ways in which we can reduce the impact of firm failure. We think that
recovery and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 22</div>resolution plans could do that. My understanding is that the FSA will
consult on the cost-benefit analysis of recovery and resolution plans
when it makes it rules as it normally does as part of its rule-making
process. So those costs will be looked at in more detail and
identified. I am very confident that this is the right policy to adopt.
The detail of how it is implemented will be a matter for the FSA, but
it will consult on the
costs.</div><a name="09120874000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
45</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000260"></a>Mr.
Love:</b> Let me ask two questions relating to that. One of
the big concerns&#151;not at present, but looking into the
future&#151;is that there might come a time when the debate between
the industry and the FSA will be on what the level of effective
regulation ought to be, and that the industry will say, &#147;This
cost-benefit isn&#146;t working for us; you need to reduce the cost
to make it beneficial.&#148; That, of course, leads to the road that
we went down in the lead-up to 2007. Are there any concerns in relation
to the regulator maintaining its line in ensuring that the benefit that
comes from this is worth the costs that it is going to
incur?</div><a name="09120874000141"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> We have been very clear as a Government that
there must be no return to business as usual. We have, I hope, all
learnt the lessons from the crisis in financial services both globally
and in the UK. We cannot return to regulating in the same old way as
before. That is why recovery and resolution plans, along with the other
changes proposed by the Bill, really mark a step change in how we
regulate financial services in this country. I do not therefore think
that it will be a case of returning to the old days, and I do not think
that the FSA is likely to think that these plans are not necessary and
that they can be sketchy and not particularly detailed. We need a level
of detail that enables action to be taken if firms get into
difficulty.</div><a name="09120874000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
appreciate the point about whether, when we get to some point in the
future and we have not had a banking crisis, we will all forget about
it, and whether these plans should continue to be updated. My response
is that we need to be continually vigilant. We want to make sure that
the FSA, as an independent regulator, maintains that level of
vigilance. I do not want to go back over old ground, but I think that
the Council for Financial Stability offers us a formal structure to
ensure that we continue to be vigilant on the
issues.</div><a name="09120874000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
46</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000261"></a>Mr.
Love:</b> May I press you? One of the themes that always
arises from any change to financial services is the concern that it
will place us in some form of disadvantage internationally, because the
City will no longer be able to compete with New York, Shanghai, Tokyo
and so on. Are you confident that there is no disadvantage in the Bill
to the RRPs and that they will not be faced by other, equivalent
financial services centres? Are you also confident that such scrutiny
internationally will not again lead to the argument that we need to
reduce the cost, because not as much is being done internationally and
the restrictions being placed are not as onerous as
ours?</div><a name="09120874000144"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> We want to have world-class financial
regulation in the UK. We also want the world to have world-class
financial regulation. That is an absolute requirement, such is the
interdependence between banks in the financial system. We are very much
leading the way with the FSA&#146;s pilot project on recovery and
resolution plans, but the G20 has agreed that systemically important 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 23</div>firms should have developed internationally consistent recovery and
resolution plans by the end of 2010. What we are doing in the Bill is
introducing the powers to make sure that that happens, but we are also
working with our international partners on the detail of the recovery
and resolution
plans.</div><a name="09120874000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are leading the way in many respects; everybody else is going down the
same route. I do not therefore think that the problems that you rightly
identify as a potential risk actually exist in this instance. We need
to get to the stage where we have world-leading financial regulation in
the UK up to the best international standards. However, we need to
ensure that those standards are consistent and are also applied across
other jurisdictions. Our work with the G20 is all aimed towards that.
There is a high-level consensus that recovery and resolution plans need
to be put in place. We now need to work within that consensus on making
sure that we collectively get the detail right and have the standard
applied
consistently.</div><a name="09120874000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
47</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000262"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b><b class="B"> </b>May I change the subject somewhat? The Bill
includes some ground-breaking measures on consumer protection.
Conscious that we are finishing shortly, I would like to raise a few
questions on those measures. On the proposals on collective
proceedings, given that the financial services sector is quite heavily
regulated, in the sense that you have a regulator, a compensation
scheme if firms go bust and an ombudsman to deal with individual
complaints, what is missing in the regulation that requires collective
proceedings?</div><a name="09120874000147"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> We see the collective proceedings provisions
contained in the Bill as a back-stop for an important opportunity
through which individuals can get redress collectively. You are right
to point out that the FSA already has some wide and strong powers to
benefit consumers without requiring any form of collective proceedings
or redress scheme. Certainly, where claims are generic or numerous,
there may be no advantage to people being asked to opt in&#151;you
will be aware that there are proposals in the legislation for the
ability to opt in and opt out. However, having a way of ensuring some
sort of collective redress, without going down the litigious route of
class action that you see in the United States, benefits citizens on
consumer
protection.</div><a name="09120874000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
48</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000263"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> There are two separate issues here, are there not?
The first is litigious, which is the collective proceedings route, but
consumer redress is a different issue. You said that collective
proceedings is a back-stop. What has the regulator failed to do? What
is missing from its powers that require consumers to go down the
litigious route, either individually or, in this case,
collectively?</div><a name="09120874000149"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> As I said, the FSA already has considerable
powers, but there is a view out there&#151;representations have been
made to the Government&#151;that a form of collective proceedings can
help in some potential cases where there are numerous complaints on the
same theme and where an individual may need to go to the courts to get
redress.</div>
<a name="09120874000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
49</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000264"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Should not the FSA be given greater powers, rather
than require consumers to take the product provider to court? Should
not the FSA get greater powers and be expected to tackle the issues,
rather than rely on consumers to take legal action?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 24</div><a name="09120874000151"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> As you will be aware, there are powers
contained in the redress part. The FSA also already has some
wide-ranging powers. However, with all such things, it is a matter of
saying, &#147;Yes, it&#146;s right that the FSA should have the
powers to take action where something that is clearly to the detriment
of consumers is taking place&#148;, and I would expect that to
happen. However, I do not think that we should close off the legal
route. It already exists under the existing system&#151;individuals
have the ability to go to court to seek redress. The legislation
provides for a collective way in which that could happen. If you are
making the point that the FSA needs to act in some of these areas as
well, I do not
disagree.</div><a name="09120874000152"></a>

50</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000265"></a>Mr.

powers
fully?</div><a name="09120874000153"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> No, that is what you are saying. It is
certainly not my view. What we are doing, though, is novel. Individuals
have always had the right to go to court if they feel that a particular
grievance on a financial services issue has not been dealt with in the
normal way. You will be aware of a number of instances when that has
happened. If there are lots of those examples, the ability to have a
representative body that undertakes an action on behalf of individuals
is a useful addition to the existing system. However, I would not want
to say that this is the key method by which individuals who believe
that they have been wronged can achieve a solution. You would expect in
the first instance appropriate financial regulation and normal
complaints procedures and for such things to be dealt with. That is why
I called it a back-stop. You would not expect this power to be used
very
frequently.</div><a name="09120874000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09120874000266"></a>Mr.

frequently.</div><a name="09120874000155"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> You would not expect the power to be used
very frequently, but it is right that it is there. It should be seen as
more of a back-stop&#151;more a measure of last resort, rather than
one of first
instance.</div><a name="09120874000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
51</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000267"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> You described this as novel. Would applying the

restricting it simply to the FSA and financial
services?</div><a name="09120874000157"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian

52</b><b class="B"><a name="09120874000268"></a>Mr.

sector and not on a broad-brush
basis?</div><a name="09120874000159"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> In the first instance, we believe that it is
appropriate for the measure to cover financial services. In other parts
of people&#146;s daily lives there are other ways for them to get
redress through the court system if they have complaints. But I want to
stress that we are not talking about a system that will give US-style
awards or be a vehicle for ambulance-chasing firms to round up lots of
people and say, &#147;We&#146;ll do a class action on your behalf
and take a cut.&#148; That is not what this is about at all. The
&#147;loser pays&#148; principle will apply in part, but certainly
nothing in the legislation is about US-style punitive awards. In
general, the measure should be seen as novel, yes, but also as giving
an additional set of rights, so that collective proceedings can be
undertaken, which would be a more effective solution for a number of
individuals who together think that they have been financially
wronged.</div>

Howell:</b> On collective redress, can you tell us to what
extent the proposals take into account the emerging situation in the
green paper that has been produced by the European
Commission?</div><a name="09120874000172"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ian
Pearson:</b></i> My understanding is that, under the
collective redress scheme, the FSA will ask firms to carry out a review
of their past business where it appears there might have been a legal
or regulatory breach. The scheme&#146;s rules will set out how the
review must be undertaken, including the standards against which a
firm&#146;s conduct must be tested and how redress is to be
determined. The FSA may require firms to provide it with information to
enable it to monitor whether firms are implementing the scheme
correctly, and it will have powers to carry out investigations and/or
appoint a third part if necessary. Consumers who are not satisfied with
that approach can take their case to the financial ombudsman&#146;s
service for independent adjudication to ensure that the rules have been
followed. We do not believe that there is any conflict between the
proposals and European law. You referred to the green paper, which sets
out some early thinking by the Commission on collective redress. My
understanding is that no proposal has been put forward, but the
Commission clearly understands that it is an important area. We want to
take action now rather than wait for any EU action later down the line.
We think it likely that any EU action would complement rather than
conflict with this
provision.</div><a name="09120874000173"></a>
