							<b class="B">Damian
Green</b> (Ashford) (Con): When we adjourned, I was dealing
with my amendment to new clause 8 and specifically with the
Minister&#146;s reason for thinking it unnecessary for the
Information Commissioner to have some kind of oversight of material
that should be deleted from the report given to Parliament by the
proposed new inspectorate. I was about to say that I found his
explanation somewhat unconvincing. It appeared to rely on the fact that
rather than have the Information Commissioner exercise some kind of
oversight in advance, it would always be possible for him to do so
after the publication of the report.</div>
					<a name="07032054000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is simply implausible. By
definition, the material that had been kept out by the Home Secretary
would, at least on the surface, have been kept out for reasons either
of the personal security of individuals or of national security. In
that case it is hard to see how in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column469" />Column number: 469</div>practice the Information Commissioner would have access to that
information, still less that anyone could make a successful freedom of
information request that might trigger some activity by the Information
Commissioner. I just did not follow why the Minister thought that that
would be an effective second line of defence of the ability to
scrutinise the material that the Home Secretary thought was unsuitable
to be given to Parliament. As with my amendment to new clause 6, I hope
to press my amendment to new clause 8 to a
vote.</div>

Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality (Mr.
Liam Byrne):
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his
amendments. They have given us the opportunity to explore one or two
issues in some helpful detail. My concern remains that the new
arrangements that we are putting in place can conduct their business
efficiently and effectively, without being drowned by bits of paper
from Government Departments seeking pre-clearance from the Information
Commissioner before we put things into the public domain, particularly
where they relate to issues of personal security or national security.
On the other hand, I do not want the new regulator to be snowed under
with cases put up by people who are simply trying to avoid removal or
deportation from this country. We are broadly in a similar place. I
will reflect on his comments before thinking through whether further
Government amendments should be brought forward. I understand that the
hon. Gentleman wants to press the amendments to a vote in order that I
do not forget that
point.</div>

							<a name="07032054000245"></a>Damian
Green:
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 108, in
clause 44, page 23, line 19, after,
&#145;17&#146; insert &#145;and section
27&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07032054000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
amendment is designed to make the Bill more effective in one of the
areas where I think there is no division on either side of the House
and indeed it may be particularly appropriate that we debate this while
in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column470" />Column number: 470</div>the Chamber we debate the bicentenary of the abolition of the slave
trade. This amendment would make it easier and certainly quicker to
attempt to stamp out the modern form of slavery which is people
trafficking.</div>
					<a name="07032054000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The effect of
this clause is to add to the commencement section of the Bill section
27, the offences that relate to people trafficking. As currently
drafted, only clause 17 of the Bill, support for failed asylum-seekers,
comes into force the day the Bill becomes an Act. What we seek to do is
to add a reference to section 27 so that we can get a move on with
attacking people trafficking.</div>
					<a name="07032054000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Everyone on
the Committee has participated in debates about the despicable practice
of people trafficking. The Government have signalled their intention to
tighten up the law, indeed to sign the Council of Europe convention
that will enable them to do so, and we welcome that and we support them
in that move.</div>
					<a name="07032054000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister will recall that when we discussed our amendments to clause 17
we were keen that this House should send a very clear message that we
are all serious about toughening up the law and we think that this
amendment is a very clear and easy way of doing that. It would ensure
that the provisions relating to people trafficking are brought in at
the earliest opportunity. We believe this would act as a deterrent and
it will also enable the conviction and punishment of as many people
traffickers as possible. I am sure the Minister will agree that the
sooner we can start on that course of action the
better.</div>
					<a name="07032054000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The earliest
opportunity to start doing that is the day this Bill passes on to the
statute book and that is what this amendment would achieve. I hope
therefore that it will be regarded sympathetically by the
Government.</div>
					
					<a name="07032054000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07032054000246"></a>
							<b class="B">John
Hemming</b> (Birmingham, Yardley) (LD): The amendment seems
very sensible and one which I am sure the Government will
support.</div>
					
					<a name="07032054000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032054000247"></a>Mr.
Byrne:
						</b> I did indeed look upon this amendment with a great
deal of sympathy because I think the Committee has been united in the
debates we have had on this subject over the last few weeks. There has
been a very clear determination that the law in this area needs to be
strengthened. I therefore sought some strong arguments as to why we
should not accept this amendment. Only one thing swayed my mind and
there is only one reason that I therefore ask the hon. Member for
Ashford to consider withdrawing this amendment.</div>
					<a name="07032054000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The advice that I have received
is that there is a risk&#151;a small risk but a risk none the
less&#151;that the courts would potentially not look favourably on
our attempts to prosecute under this offence if we did not observe the
convention of seeking a brief interlude in which to publicise the fact
that this new offence had been introduced.</div>
					<a name="07032054000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am told that it is usual to
bring in offences after a period of two months. I do not want to
risk&#151;and I am sure nobody on this Committee would wish to
risk&#151;any potential prosecution for an offence such as this going
wrong because we did not observe this protocol. If the risk is there we
should be alive to it. My concern is that when this offence is
introduced we are able to maximise the effectiveness of our
prosecutions using this offence. If there is a risk that puts that
potential in jeopardy, I think I should accept that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column471" />Column number: 471</div>

no excuse. There will be huge tracts of the statute book about which
Committee members know nothing, but none of us would be able to say
&#147;Well, the prosecution should not happen because I did not know
I was breaking the law.&#148; In this instance, the people who will

							<a name="07032054000255"></a>Mr.
Byrne:
						</b> The Under-Secretary of State for the Home
Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, North (Joan Ryan),
flags up an issue on trafficking that did not emerge until after
publication of the Bill. The amendment seeks to bring the Bill
perfectly in line with our devolution arrangements. It proposes the
simple remedy of delimiting the extent of the relevant clauses to
England, Wales and Northern
Ireland.</div>
					<a name="07032054000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">The effect of
the amendment is limited. My hon. Friend and I needed some reassurance
of what the practical implications would be. The amendment will allow
us to preserve the existing situation. If there is people smuggling or
human trafficking into the United Kingdom, or from Scotland into
England or from England into Scotland, an offence would still be
committed in each of those three situations regardless of whether the
offence was undertaken by a British national or by a foreign national
and of whether the crime was organised in the UK or abroad.</div>
					<a name="07032054000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the clause remains
unamended, prosecution of the trafficking offence would need to be
undertaken in a court in England. We therefore look to the Scottish
Executive, at some time after the elections, to bring forward proposals
to ensure that the remit of the Bill, and particularly of clause 45, is
extended to Scotland so as to ensure that the offence can be prosecuted
in Scottish courts as well as English courts. I am satisfied that there
is no practical diminution of our intent to prosecute the offence in
the UK. We have devolution arrangements in place, and it is important
that Bills passed by the House should be in line with
them.</div>

						</b> The issue of devolution has bedevilled the Bill
from the start of its Committee stage almost to the finish. If I
understand the Minister, he just said that for the provisions of the

Scottish Executive after the elections to pass
them.</div>

Green:
						</b> I misspoke. I, too, meant to refer to the clause.
Presumably, until that happens the protections afforded by the Bill
will not be fully available to the people of England, Wales and
Northern Ireland or, presumably, Scotland. As he said, he will depend
on the good will of the Scottish Executive after the Scottish elections
to agree to the things that the current Labour-led Scottish Executive
has failed to agree to. I find that position, as I have done
throughout, a slightly unusual one for a Government to find themselves
in. However, many of the provisions of the Bill are useful, so I hope
that, whatever the make-up of the Scottish Executive after the Scottish
elections, Ministers will find that their powers of persuasion are more
effective with the new Executive than they appear to be with the
current one.

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032054000261"></a>Mr.
Byrne:
						</b> This is a debate that we have, to an extent,
already had. The purpose of the clauses is to create the new offence of
assaulting an immigration officer, to establish penalties and sanctions
relating to that offence, and to ensure that there is the power of
arrest, and to make the technical and consequential amendments that are
required to ensure that it is possible to give effect to warrants to
enter premises, to search individuals who are arrested and to seize
material. They not only bring the new offence into being, but align it
with the similar offences of assaulting an officer of Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs and assaulting a police officer.
The proposed penalties, which have been well debated by the Committee,
are fairly standard and well established.</div>
					<a name="07032054000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before I sit down I underline
the point that we have had a useful debate in the Committee, in which
we have spent some time celebrating the contribution, pride and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column474" />Column number: 474</div>professionalism of our immigration officers. The Committee can take this
opportunity to send an important signal to immigration service staff
that we take their work extremely seriously and will ensure that they
have the protection of the law where and when they need
it.</div>

						<a name="07032054000262"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
James Clappison</b> (Hertsmere) (Con): I have just one
question. We notice that the offence in the new clause will be triable
only summarily. If an immigration officer is assaulted and any harm is
caused to him, which one imagines there might well be in many cases, it
then becomes an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and
triable at the Crown court, because that offence carries a maximum
sentence of five years and can be tried in either the magistrates court
or the Crown court.</div>
					<a name="07032054000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a case in which the offence
becomes triable in the Crown court and is tried there, what will happen
to the summary-only offence of assaulting an immigration officer? Will
it be able to stand as an alternative on the indictment in the Crown
court for the offence of assault occasioning actual body
harm?</div>

judges, through sentencing guidelines, that if somebody is convicted of
assaulting an immigration officer and occasioning actual bodily harm,
the fact that it was an immigration officer who was assaulted should be
regarded as an aggravating feature of the offence? That is to say, the
fact that it was an offence of causing actual bodily harm to an

already have these powers. Section 51 of the Immigration, Asylum and
Nationality Act 2006 gives the IND the power to cost recover. Section
42 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act
2004 gives the IND the power to over-cost charge. The clause allows us
to over-cost charge on the basis of the value of the service that we
provide to the migrant who applies for leave to enter.</div>
					<a name="07032054000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are currently a number of
limitations to the powers, however, and I should like to sketch out two
or three of them for the benefit of the Committee. First, we do not
have the power to charge for the introduction of sponsorship
arrangements. That is significant, because we are shortly to introduce
a points-based system, which means that sponsoring organisations,
whether businesses or colleges, will have a much more important role.
At the moment, there is no law that allows us to charge for such
arrangements, and they are expensive. They allow us to put in place an
enforcement and compliance network of people throughout the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column481" />Column number: 481</div>country to ensure that sponsors behave appropriately. Given the
conversations that we had about illegal working and bogus colleges, it
is important that that network is robust and effective, so I would like
the power to charge for introducing sponsorship arrangements.</div>
					<a name="07032054000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second limitation is a
vires issue, which affects UKvisas. UKvisas is allowed to charge for
its services under section 1 of the Consular Fees Act 1980. There are
constraints on what it can charge for, however. In effect, it can
charge only for administrative services that relate directly to
consular activity, rather than for any aspect of enforcement of an
effective immigration system that entails cost.</div>
					<a name="07032054000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want to do two or three
things over the next couple of years to render our immigration system
stronger. They include introducing sponsorship. The advent of the
points-based system means that a lot of decision making will move
abroad, so there will be no UK cost base against which we can charge.
That means that there will be a volume shift of business overseas. It
could be as high as 10 per cent., or it could be a little bit lower.
The risk is that the UK cost base will be spread over a smaller number
of applications. Given that many of the costs are fixed, one does not
have to be a Nobel prize-winning economist to understand that there is
therefore a risk of in-country fees going up.</div>
					<a name="07032054000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The education and business
communities and indeed the Select Committee on Home Affairs, of which
the hon. Member for Hertsmere is a member, have consistently said that
they want not divergence but convergence between out-of-country fees
and in-country fees. A week or two ago, the CBI
said:</div>
					<a name="07032054000211"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
current system clearly needs to be reformed. If rises in visa fees are
necessary to fund these improvements, employers will see it as a price
worth paying&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07032054000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Home
Affairs Committee
said:</div>
					<a name="07032054000212"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
calculation of visa fees and in-country fees should be
aligned&#148;</div>
					<a name="07032054000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">at least in
terms of what costs are taken into account and the impact assessment
that accompanies them. We want to ensure that there is a degree of
flexibility, so that there is not a great deal of divergence between
out-of-country and in-country
fees.</div>
					<a name="07032054000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause
allows us to do three things: it allows the IND to cross-subsidise
between in-country fee streams, it allows us to cross-subsidise between
out-of-country and in-country fees, and it allows us to over-cost
charge where necessary for new sponsorship arrangements. The fees to be
proposed for such over-cost charging will, of course, be subject to the
affirmative procedure, as they are today, and we will have to consult
on fees where we plan to recover over costs. Crucially, the new clause
will allow us to set fees at the market value and retain the
flexibility to protect key segments of the population, as we proposed
to do recently with students and
visitors.</div>
					<a name="07032054000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not in
our interest, of course, to hike up fees to such an extent that people
do not want to come to this country anymore. That would be hugely
damaging for the British economy given that each year foreign students
pay about &#163;5 billion in fees to our
universities
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column482" />Column number: 482</div>and foreign visitors bring about &#163;13 billion into the economy. I
think that tourism is about the fourth or fifth biggest market sector
in the economy.</div>
					<a name="07032054000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposal will not, I am afraid, provide the IND with carte blanche to
go crazy and put up fees as much as it would like.
That would damage the economy and the country, and I think that the
Treasury would have something to say about it. However, with new clause
16 we are seeking to acquire a degree of flexibility to help us render
the charging scheme fit for the
future.</div>
					
					<a name="07032054000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07032054000298"></a>Damian
Green:
						</b> The new clause is simply headed
&#147;Fees.&#148; It is a very short name for a very long
clause.</div>
					<a name="07032054000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
describe the Minister&#146;s performance just now as elegantly
cynical, which is part of a trend. The Government have found a
potential gold-mine about which nobody has complained too much, because
the proposal is for a stealth tax on foreigners, which is politically
more acceptable given the previous raft of stealth taxes that they have
imposed on the rest of us and given that they will use the money to
fund the activities of the
IND.</div>
					<a name="07032054000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">So far we have
not had any numbers. I shall be interested if the Minister will tell us
how much extra revenue the Department has calculated will result from
the flexibility that he is adding under this new clause. I dare say
that we will have the same debate on visa fees when that comes before
the Delegated Legislation Committee in the near future because the same
principle applies.</div>
					<a name="07032054000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have no objection to the proposal in principle. The Minister&#146;s
last point was a good one: clearly, it is not simply a question of what
the market will bear from individual applications or even classes of
application because&#151;I assume&#151;he is not proposing to
disaggregate it to such an extent that the Department will guess what
each individual visa will bear. Presumably, if Goldman Sachs wants to
bring in a bond trader, it would be in its economic interest to pay
millions for that visa, whereas even the most brilliant student at the
best university would not justify that kind of
payment.</div>
					<a name="07032054000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">As well as
figures, it would be interesting if the Minister would give us an
indication of the degree of flexibility that he is proposing and,
therefore, of who is likely to be funding the measure. As he said, the
new clause refers to sponsors and, therefore, to UK businesses,
academic institutions and, presumably, UK individuals. To put actual
figures in the new clause would be illuminating for the
Committee.</div>

							<a name="07032054000299"></a>John
Hemming:
						</b> It is reasonable to have a certain amount of
flexibility and so the new clause has its rationale. There are some
strange situations regarding fees charged at the moment and there needs
to be some flexibility for
cross-subsidy.</div>

						</b> We have had to rely on members of the official

are scheduled about the precise charges proposed for next year. I live
in hope that that forensic analysis is yet to
come.</div>
					<a name="07032054000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman made two important points, one about the degree of
flexibility and the second wanting me to estimate the kinds of moneys
that I might have in mind for the next financial year. We are putting
forward no proposals for individual-specific pricing, although that is
an interesting idea, which may warrant a bit more explanation. I am not
sure that we would quite have that latitude within the provisions of
new clause 16. More important, on the question of the amount of money
that might be raised, when we published our enforcement strategy a week
or two ago, I was optimistic that we might raise up to an
extra &#163;100 million through the measures in the next
financial year. That is important because it means that we will be able
to fund extra detention space and immigration officers and to
strengthen our systems of immigration and of immigration policing.
There are of course volume risks, but those are conservative
assumptions. With that, I recommend the clause to the
Committee.</div>

						</b> I take the opportunity before we conclude our
business to thank you, Mr. Illsley, and your co-Chairman,
Mr. Amess, for such courteous and efficient chairing of
business&#151;so efficient that we have finished slightly earlier
than anticipated, despite the level of analysis and the depth of
discussion. I also thank the Clerks, the <i class="I">Hansard</i> reporters, the
police and others who have been connected with the conduct of the
Committee. I think it has run extremely smoothly. In my Back-Bench
career, I served on something like six Bill Committees in a reasonably
short space of time, but this is by far and away the smoothest running
Committee that I have sat
on.</div>
					<a name="07032054000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was grateful too
for the exemplary organisation of the public evidence sittings. Like
many members of the Committee, I enjoyed the part that we played in the
constitutional innovations that the Leader of the House steered
through. I think that they were a valuable aspect of the scrutiny of
the Bill. I also thank the Whips for the way that they have helped us
stay on course. I would like to thank not only the Opposition
Front-Bench spokesmen but all members of the Committee for the helpful
and constructive way in which they have approached the debate. Finally,
I thank my officials, who have worked extremely hard, often very late
at night, over the past six months in order to put the Bill before the
Committee. The Bill has been dispatched after a good deal of careful
consideration. I thank the entire Committee, particularly the
co-Chairmen.</div>

It has been a life-enhancing experience to be on a Committee chaired by
the two of you. Similarly, I particularly thank the Clerk of the
Committee for her hard work and guidance during the discussions and the
tabling of amendments and so on, and of course the <i class="I">Hansard</i>
reporters and the police. The Minister talked about constitutional
innovations, but I think that thanking Whips in public is possibly a
constitutional innovation that I, as a Conservative, will have to go
away and think about before committing myself to. It might be
dangerous.</div>

Ministers for such clear exposition as they have been able to give on
some of the amendments and clauses. As we all know, this has been not
only a well run Committee, as the Minister said, but a good-natured
one. I hope that, in its way, it has done some good work in moving the
Bill forward and scrutinising it so that we can return to it,
refreshed, at its later stages and seek to improve it even
more.</div>
