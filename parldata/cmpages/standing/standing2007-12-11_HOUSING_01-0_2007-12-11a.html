							<a name="0712124000320"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> Good morning. Before we begin, there are various
preliminary announcements to make. First, while I am in the Chair, if
hon. Members wish to remove their jackets for their comfort they may do
so. It is up to Mr. Benton whether he extends the same
courtesy. Will all hon. Members please ensure that their mobile phones,
pagers and all electronic devices are switched off? For the purposes of
this Committee, laptops are not allowed to be
used.</div>
					<a name="0712124000008"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a money
resolution in connection with the Bill and I am advised that copies are
available in the room. Adequate notice should be given for amendments,
because, as a general rule, Mr. Benton and I will not call
starred amendments.</div>
					<a name="0712124000009"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
process of taking evidence in public that we are shortly to embark on
is relatively new, so it may be helpful to hon. Members, as it has been
to me, to be advised as to the procedure. The Committee will first
consider the programme motion on the amendment paper. That process will
take up to half an hour. We shall proceed to a motion to report written
evidence, followed by a motion to permit the Committee to deliberate in
private in advance of the oral evidence sessions. I would like to think
that we could take those latter two motions
formally.</div>
					<a name="0712124000010"></a><div class="hs_Para">Assuming that
the second of the motions has been agreed to, the Committee will move
into private session for discussion prior to the evidence taking. Once
the Committee has deliberated, the witnesses and members of the public
will be invited into the room and the oral evidence session will
commence.</div>
					<a name="0712124000011"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
concentrate minds, the witnesses have been invited to attend at 11
o&#146;clock. That means that you have half an hour, but if you
choose not to take it, it will help the witnesses. If the Committee
agrees to the programme motion, it will hear all evidence today and on
Thursday, moving on to the more familiar proceedings of
clause-by-clause scrutiny as a Public Bill Committee in sittings
commencing in the new
year.</div>
					<a name="0712124000012"></a><div class="hs_Para">You will notice
that the first evidence session, when we come to it, will be with the
Local Government Association and London Councils. That session must
terminate at 11.45 am under the terms of the programme motion, if you
agree to it; so the witnesses do not have very long. Regrettable and
discourteous though it may seem to some people, at 11.45 am the Chair
must terminate the evidence session. You should be aware of that when
we come to take the
evidence.</div>
					<a name="0712124000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without
further ado, I call upon the Minister to move the programme
motion.</div>

					<a name="0712124000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a
privilege to serve yet again under your chairmanship, Mr.
Gale. I say &#147;yet again&#148;, because the first Bill Committee
on which I served was that on the Gambling Bill, which was splendidly
chaired by your good self. You also chaired the previous
Session&#146;s Finance Bill Committee, on which I served.
Mr. Gale, I do not know what heinous crimes you have
committed that cause me to follow you about, but, for my part, I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column3" />Column number: 3</div>am absolutely delighted that your decisive and wise chairmanship will
help us enormously during the Committee&#146;s
deliberations.</div>
					<a name="0712124000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also
welcome your co-Chair, Mr. Benton, whose constituency I was
privileged to visit last week, and whose chairmanship I also respect. I
welcome all other right hon. Members and hon. Members to the Committee.
I would imagine that occasionally some hon. Members have to be, shall
we say, persuaded by the Whips to serve on a Public Bill Committee, but
for this Bill my party has been fighting them off, as we have been
over-subscribed by those wishing to participate. We had an excellent
debate on Second Reading and I look forward to expanding on and
developing some of the arguments that were teased
out.</div>
					<a name="0712124000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">With some
trepidation, I welcome to the membership of the Committee my right hon.
Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich and the right hon. Member
for North-West Hampshire, who is not present this morning. Their
experience as former Housing Ministers is second to none. I am filled
with a great deal of trepidation precisely because of their first-class
knowledge and experience in the field. I am certain that they will
ensure that I raise my game during the Committee. I also thank and
welcome the Front-Bench spokesmen of the Opposition parties, the hon.
Members for Welwyn Hatfield, for North-East Bedfordshire and for
Chesterfield. I like and respect the hon. Gentlemen enormously. I
invariably disagree with them, but know that they will scrutinise the
Bill with the rigour that it
deserves.</div>
					<a name="0712124000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">I mentioned
on Second Reading that the Bill is wide-ranging and detailed; ambitious
and yet technical. It is an important vehicle to enable our vision to
be realised of more homes, better homes, and greener and more
sustainable homes. The creation of the Homes and Communities Agency
will bring together land and investment to facilitate the building of
new homes with a view to helping us to reach the target of 3 million
new homes by 2020. The establishment of the new regulator, Oftenant,
will ensure that tenants of social housing get the very best that they
deserve in core housing
services.</div>
					<a name="0712124000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have a
good and diverse range of witnesses for the Committee sittings today
and on Thursday. The usual channels have worked extremely well to
ensure a good balance, and the Committee will be able to hear and probe
different views and perspectives on housing, regulation and
regeneration. Once we have taken oral evidence, the programme motion
provides for 14 sittings for detailed clause-by-clause consideration. I
am keen to work with the Opposition parties on particular parts of the
Bill on which they wish to concentrate, so that they have the ability
to express appropriately their concerns. I am content that the 14
sittings within the programme motion will allow that to happen. The
usual channels have ensured that the programme motion is accepted by
all, so it remains for me only to ask the Committee to support
it.</div>

Good morning. The aim of part 1 of the Bill is to secure an increased

right way of going about
it?</div>

						</i> I think that it certainly would be
beneficial to bring together the two roles of the Housing Corporation
and English Partnerships, but we do not want to create a sort of
behemoth quango that is slow to work on the ground. The view of the
Local Government Association is that housing is crucial to creating
successful places and that councils are the best placed bodies to
deliver strategic housing. They not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div>only have a democratic mandate, and therefore some consent from their
communities, but they are best placed to bring together all the
different elements to ensure successful and sustainable places, not
simply to churn out
numbers.</div>

ground of how this new agency will co-operate with other stakeholders,

Bill includes the requirement for the HCA to be on the list of partner
authorities that have duties to local authorities. In your view is that
sufficient to allow it to engage effectively with local
authorities?</div>

								Sir

						</i> I think that these things are partly
about the rules, but they are more importantly about culture and
behaviour. You can have a duty to co-operate, which is something that
local government requested and is pleased to see on the statute book,
but ultimately the proof of the pudding will be how the agency operates
day to day. That has to do with relationships, culture and behaviour.
That is not something that can be legislated for. Councils are very
clear that they wish the agency to be a partner and they do not wish it
to seek to dictate, which is one of their concerns, particularly over
planning
issues.</div>

								Nick

						</i> I certainly agree with all of that. We are very
pleased that the HCA is to be added to the list of partner authorities.
I agree that relationships are key. In London there are particular
concerns about how the HCA will interact with the
Mayor and local authorities. I understand that the HCA will be part of
the Mayor&#146;s strategic housing investment panel. Obviously we
will want to ensure that regional priorities do not overshadow local
priorities. The GLA put forward a proposal that the HCA should be a
functional body of the Mayor. We do not support
that.</div>

								Sir
Simon Milton:
							</b>
						</i> We have some concerns. Indeed, the LGA
will seek to promote an amendment, or further discussion during the
passage of the Bill, to clarify the relationship between the Housing
and Communities Agency and local councils, specifically over the
aspects of the Bill that seek to delegate to the HCA powers to assume
control over development and plan-making at local level. The situation
is a hangover from the days when we had urban development corporations,
which had those powers. There is no doubt that there are some good
examples around the country of regeneration carried out by such bodies,
but I would like to add two
points.</div>
					<a name="0712124000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, councils
now are not the same as they were back in the &#146;80s, when those
bodies were set up. I think that councils are now more than capable of
fulfilling the strategic planning function in
regeneration.</div>
					<a name="0712124000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
if we are to get consent from communities for the type of regeneration
we want, it is best done by bodies that have a democratic mandate, so
we would wish the HCA to act in support of councils, where asked to.
There may be occasions where councils would invite the HCA to take over
some of their roles on specific projects, but we would seek, through
the Bill, to have that matter clarified and we would like protections
to be in place so that councils did not see their powers taken
away.</div>
					<a name="0712124000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
suspicion on the part of some councils that the view will be that if
you do not deliver what the Government tell you to deliver on housing
numbers your planning powers will be removed and given to the HCA. That
would be completely unacceptable to local government as a
whole.</div>

Andrew Love</b> (Edmonton) (Lab/Co-op): I am sorry to come in
a little late, but I wanted to pursue Mr.
Day about the answer he gave to the previous
question. There is a great deal of concern in London that a number of
local authorities are not complying with or not living up to the
overall plan that the Mayor has laid out about the need for affordable
accommodation. I did not think that the answer Mr. Day gave
us about the role that London Councils should play in that plan was
adequate, so I thought that I would give him a second chance to tell us
how we can ensure that all local authorities are playing their part in
the overall plan for affordable accommodation in London.</div>

								Nick
Day:

						</i> Within London Councils, there is a range of
views that have been expressed about how best to meet London&#146;s
housing needs, which obviously are very extensive. We are in the
process of introducing a set of housing objectives that flesh out some
discussions that have been going on internally. I am not in a
position to talk through those at the moment, but that is
something we are looking to introduce in the new year. The debate is
about trying to find the best ways to meet London&#146;s housing

My constituents, in Ruislip-Northwood, are not asking, &#147;Is my

&#147;How on earth do I get my voice heard in this process, where the
hierarchy in planning seems to be national planning, the Mayor in some
form or other, and then my local authority?&#148; Do you think that
the creation of the agency, given where it sits in that hierarchy,

further?</div>

								Sir

						</i> I suspect that it will
make very little difference to the understanding of your
constituents, because there will still be a hierarchy and they will
probably still feel that the politicians they have elected closest to
their locality still do not have complete control of the system.
Clearly, there is a national Government policy, for which it is
perfectly proper to have regard; in London, there are also regional
mayoral policies, and there will also be local authority policies, so
it is not surprising if ordinary citizens find that hierarchy
confusing.</div>
					<a name="0712124000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
argue, as you would expect, that as the local authority has the closest

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Sir Simon
Milton:
							</b>
						</i> Certainly. If we look at London, as it was
the focus of your questions, clearly the Mayor is charged with a London
spatial strategy&#151;the London plan, which sets out an aspiration
on housing. It is not a firm target because the Mayor does not deliver
to the target, but there is an aspiration that councils should seek to
achieve 50 per cent. affordable housing on new development. How
they go about doing it will vary from council to council. There
have been some celebrated spats over that policy between the Mayor and
individual councils in the past year and if we examine the detail we
find that the local authority is delivering merely to a formula that
works best in its local
area.</div>
					<a name="0712124000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">My London
authority, Westminster, has one of the largest sites currently coming
forward for planning: the site adjacent to Victoria station. You all
know it very well; it is not far from here. The developer wants to put
in 800 new flats, not a single one of which will be affordable. In this
instance, the council says that it wants affordable housing and the
Mayor says that is unnecessary. It is not a simple story&#151;that it
is always about the Mayor wanting more affordable housing and councils
wanting less. The very term &#147;affordable&#148; is defined
differently, varying from those, such as my own authority, who have
always defined it as being social rented housing, to the London plan,
which assumes that it includes social rented, shared ownership, student
accommodation and other forms of affordable
housing.</div>
					<a name="0712124000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is very

Shapps</b> (Welwyn Hatfield) (Con): On that last point, in one
of the clauses the Bill appears to try to redefine social and
affordable housing in order to call all affordable housing social
housing, thereby massively increasing the stock of social housing. Is
that an issue of concern to you, or is it something that you have
noted? Do you want that clause of the Bill to be
amended?</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Sir
Simon Milton:
							</b>
						</i> Through you, Chairman, my answer to
Mr. Shapps is that what we are all concerned about is
numbers on the ground. We can argue over policies and percentages, but
if you do not get the homes built it is all a complete waste of time.
The issue about affordability always boils down to viability: what you
can actually get from a particular site. Developers will always seek
solutions that optimise their financial return&#151;quite
properly&#151;and councils will always seek to achieve what is in the
public good.</div>
					<a name="0712124000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
no doubt that across London there is a need for all forms of housing
and, on a site-by-site basis, you have to try to achieve the best
outcome you can, which will deliver the maximum number of units,
including the maximum number of affordable units. In some areas that
will be primarily social; my council has always had a policy that
affordable was 25 per cent. but it all had to be social rented. In
others, you could have a higher percentage but the number of social
rented units does not go up.</div>
					<a name="0712124000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Each borough needs to understand
what its housing needs are and to be allowed to have a policy that
seeks to deliver against those needs within the Mayor&#146;s overall
aspiration of 50 per cent. affordable which, by its definition, will
have to cover much more than social rented. If you were to define 50
per cent. social rented you would not see development in most of
London.</div>

authority in either a London setting or a multi-area agreement setting,

						</i> Let me take the example of the
multi-area agreements. You painted a scenario in which one authority
was seeking to drag its heels. In those circumstances, I would wish to
understand why that local authority felt differently from the other
local authorities in the agreement and what obstacles and blockages
were making it feel that more housing was inappropriate&#151;it would
almost certainly be because of a lack of necessary infrastructure in
that area. In those circumstances, I would expect the HCA to act
positively to remove those blockages to ensure that the money was there
for the exit off the motorway, or for the additional schooling or for
the things that are needed to make the development work.</div>
					<a name="0712124000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I go across the
country&#151;I have been to many councils of all political
persuasions&#151;I have not found any lack of appetite for housing
or, indeed, any refusal to consider housing. I am seeing frustration at
the inability to get all of the bits of the Government puzzle to work
together to deliver. Even in Milton Keynes, which, as you will know, is
a housing growth area, the chief executive complained to me that the
Department for Children, Schools and Families has arbitrarily removed
funding that had already been agreed for new schools. Without those new
schools, Milton Keynes cannot deliver the additional housing that it
wishes to have and for which it has all the other pieces in place. I
would expect the HCA to understand such blockages and to act to remove
them, rather than arbitrarily telling the council, &#147;Well, we are
going to overrule you
anyway.&#148;</div>

						</i> Our position on Oftenant, if that is to
be its name, is that we feel that there should be no difference for a
tenant, regardless of who their landlord is. They should be subject to
the same forms of regulation, which is why we believe in a common form
of regulation across the social rented sector. Since we now have a duty
to co-operate on the registered social landlords, which is something
that local government 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 10</div>asked for, we feel that it is morally right that we should be subject to
the same regime as them, rather than expecting to do as we wish and not

of fairness
there.</div>

line, councils will be bolted on, but by that stage the culture of the
regulator will already be set, and it will be difficult to change it.
There is a risk that we will, in effect, have two tiers operating. That
is why we believe that the provisions should be for everyone from the
outset. We do not believe that the Government have convincing arguments
as to why that should not
happen.</div>

intervene where a body subject to regulation has failed to meet a

regulator being able to intervene, if an authority fails to provide

						</i> No, we are not. Let me explain a point
that I should have made. We are in an era in which the pattern of the
regulation of local authorities is changing. We are moving from
comprehensive performance assessment to comprehensive area assessment.
Part of the rationale for that is a recognition by Government and local
government that there has been too much inspection and regulation. That
was costing too much and was getting in the way of delivering good
outcomes. We have reached a position where there are 198 performance
indicators that we have to be measured against. Although there will
continue to be a number of inspectorates involved in inspecting and
regulating local councils, they now have to work through the Audit
Commission and the CAA
process.</div>
					<a name="0712124000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">I apologise,
because I should have made it clear in our views on Oftenant that we
expect it to work within the CAA framework. In other words, Oftenant
will be on a par with Ofsted, the Healthcare Commission and the
Commission for Social Care Inspection, because its views on us and our
performance will form part of our comprehensive area assessment and
will not be a separate and additional form of regulation with the
potential for intervention from outside.</div>

						</i> On reflection, we may not have expressed
that point in the best possible way in our evidence.
I return to the fact that there are obviously many occasions and
examples of excellent working relationships between local authorities
and RSLs, and I certainly echo the comments that we do not want big
regulation or lots of draconian interventions. However, we are
concerned about circumstances in which the relationships between local
authorities and RSLs are not so good. There are issues in London with
many RSLs having stock in various different boroughs, which can involve
quite small numbers. There can be up to 80 RSLs operating in one
borough, many of which will have a stock of perhaps 10. The question is
how to take a strategic response to local needs in those
circumstances.</div>
					<a name="0712124000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 was
progressing through Parliament, we put through an amendment that was
not taken up. It 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 12</div>was about putting RSLs on the same platform as the partner authorities
in the 2007 Act; if a notice were served by a local authority for them
to come to an overview and scrutiny committee, they would have to
respond. That would be a way of trying to engage RSLs locally, where
the relationship may not be working so
well.</div>
					<a name="0712124000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, in our draft,
which I feel may not have been very well put
together, there is a desire for some form of leverage that local
authorities can use with RSLs. Local authorities had a lever in the
former arrangements for the financial allocation of resources, which
has been lost. We need to think about how we can ensure that local
priorities are recognised and that there is
engagement.</div>
					<a name="0712124000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
since picked up in the Bill that RSLs have a duty to co-operate, if
they are asked to help in the development or modification of a
sustainable community strategy. The question then is what about the
next stage, which is implementation. There are things there that we may
seek to strengthen in the local authority&#146;s
role.</div>

work with the Housing Corporation and the London Housing Federation,
which has been very helpful, looking at sets of performance indicators
that should perhaps be available to local authorities across the piece,
as Professor Cave proposed, and rationalising the RSL arrangements.
Ownership is one way of doing that, but it is quite complex. We are
also examining some innovative methods, involving transferring
management arrangements and leases, so that we can get a more
consistent approach to meeting the local standards that are needed. My

in its area and trying to corral all the different partners and
stakeholders, including RSLs. Those bodies may have different
strategies, and I am afraid that RSLs will have to either learn how to
cope with that or look at their own stock and decide, &#147;Actually,
it&#146;s not terribly sensible to have small numbers of units dotted

						</i> I have a few more examples of issues where
perhaps we could think more about the local authority&#146;s role.
Local authorities are not one of the bodies that the regulator has to
consult over the disposal of stock. We are very keen to ensure that, as
Professor Cave suggested, performance information is available at a
local authority level. I am sorry if this is a rather technical point,
but if you have a RSL that has its stock across a number of local
authorities, it may perform well in general, but if you feel that there
is an issue in one particular area, for example with decent homes, you
would want to be able to take into consideration the performance of
that RSL in that local authority area. At the moment, that information
is not always available. Unfortunately, due to the way in which the
CAA&#146;s set of 198 performance indicators is set out, the two
specific housing performance indicators&#151;decent homes and tenant
satisfaction&#151;apply only to councils and not to RSLs. We are very
keen to see that
changed.</div>
					<a name="0712124000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
other examples of situations where I think that local authorities do
not have such a strong role. When it comes to deciding when to
intervene, the regulator should &#147;have regard to&#148;
information from local authorities, and we might want to strengthen the
wording there. Also, when it comes to enforcement action, there is a
list of organisations that Oftenant should have regard to. Local
authorities are the only organisations where there is a caveat, namely
that it should be where Oftenant considers it relevant to do so. There
are a number of areas where we would like local authorities to be
recognised more strongly in the Bill.</div>

						</i> When you are
examining regulation, you need to take into account lots of different
issues and not just the tenants&#146; perspective, although clearly
that ought to be the most important issue. The private rented sector
operates in a market and, as with any market, regulation has an impact
on the way that market operates and on what becomes available and not
available. I would be keen to find ways in which we can improve the
situation for tenants of all forms of social housing, yet avoid
unintended consequences. I fear that the private sector market is
different from the public sector market.</div>

of the views of lenders who are funding RSLs, so we need to be
cognisant of the views of lenders and have a private sector that works
from a financial point of view and not end up with units withdrawn from
the rented market because we have unintended consequences from the way
we have regulated them. I would be surprised if you could find a single
regime that would work equally effectively and without negative impacts
across private, RSL and council stock. If that could be done, clearly
there would be benefits in being able to compare and

						</i> I echo support for the provision around taking
properties out of the HRA. Obviously, the complexities lie around what
happens to the properties that remain either within that local
authority in its HRA or in other authorities that have not transferred
properties. Considering those implications as well as some wider
implications around local authorities&#146;
&#147;place-shaping&#148; role might have an impact too, and we are
looking at that.</div>

						</b> Where stock has been transferred to RSLs, they can
keep the rents and 75 per cent. of the right to buy and the overhanging
debt is written off at transfer. The suggestion from the six pilots
that the Government have been looking at is that councils that still
manage stock will have to buy out the overhanging debt. The impact
assessment for the Bill says that that is not viable; the amount that
they would have to borrow to buy out the debt would mean that they
still did not have any money to invest in housing, to build new
housing. Have you any thoughts about the terms on which the change to
HRA should take place?</div>

								Sarah
Webb:
							</b>
						</i> The short answer is that the Bill has the
potential to do that. We could make sure that it does so a
bit more and I will come back to that. From the very
start of this process, we have been supportive of the concept of a
national housing agency, now called the Homes and Communities Agency,
and of a regulator that is based on customers. The agency has the
potential to create a step change in housing supply, which we need, and
which will have an impact on customers. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 18</div>Similarly, the regulator has the major benefit of orientating our sector
towards customers and less towards providers; more towards outcomes and
less towards processes. In general, we are very supportive of the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="0712124000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a list of
things that we would like to comment on. Would you like me to go

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Sarah
Webb:
							</b>
						</i> I will absolutely do that. In relation to the
HCA, the most important thing that we are concerned about is the
suggestion that in selling land, the new agency should be required to
get best consideration. That is something that happens at the moment,
and it makes public sector organisations compete for and drive up the
value of land, which is of no benefit to any of us. We urge a change on
that. We have some suggested words, such as &#147;best
outcome&#148; or &#147;greatest public benefit&#148;, which do
not require the best financial consideration to be achieved. We also do
not believe that that should be referred back to the Secretary of
State.</div>
					<a name="0712124000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">On a related
point, we see the Bill as a useful opportunity to redefine the term
&#147;social housing&#148;. It might seem a bit pedantic, but we
are facing considerable residualisation of social housing as a concept,
and there is a lot of stigma attached to people who live in social
housing. This would be a brilliant opportunity to ditch the term once
and for all, an idea which everyone in the sector supports. As it is
defined at the moment, social housing refers to people who cannot
afford a market solution. While we have been reassured by officials
from the Department for Communities and Local Government that they do
not mean to make social housing available only for the absolute
poorest, there is the potential, as the Bill is currently worded, for
that to be the case.</div>

								Sarah
Webb:
							</b>
						</i> For us, the most fundamental point about the
whole Bill relates to regulation. We are a unique organisation in that
we represent people from across the whole housing sector&#151;we do
not represent social housing, but within social housing, we have
members who are in housing associations, arm&#146;s length management
organisations, local authorities and also the voluntary and private
sectors. I have never known as much consensus as that which exists
around the idea 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column19" />Column number: 19</div>that Martin Cave was absolutely right to head for what was called domain
regulation, which from a customer perspective relates to whether you
are a tenant of a housing association, a local authority or an
arm&#146;s length management organisation&#151;we will park the
issue of the private sector for a moment. Certainly, in relation to the
different types of social landlord, you should have the same
protection.</div>
					<a name="0712124000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
does not deliver domain regulation. We have been talking to the DCLG
about how it might do that, and we understand that its intention is
that it should. The DCLG has said that it wants to set up a review to
bring in local authorities. You have previously heard from the LGA,
with which we have been working and which we support. Everyone I know
is supportive of the attempt to try to get domain regulation from the
word go.</div>

						</b> You have said that we could go back to the issue of
the private sector. When a council needs to place someone in the
private sector because there are only a number of places available, do
you think that there is any case that in such circumstances there
should be domain regulation protection for the
tenant?</div>
					<a name="0712124000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Sarah
Webb:
							</b>
						</i> I would argue with that. In principle, some of
the most vulnerable tenants in the country are the tenants of private
landlords. Our view is that the Bill is such an important prize that we
would not do anything that would undermine its going through, because
we want to see what it proposes happen. Theoretically, however, we
should be aiming for protection for tenants of private landlords as
well. Certainly, what you have suggested could be a halfway house to
that, but the need for domain regulation is fundamental from a tenant
protection
perspective.</div>

								Richard
Capie:
							</b>
						</i> I hope that this is not about the merger of
English Partnerships and the Housing Corporation&#151;it is about the
creation of a new agency. It may be building on the, in some instances,
strong foundations of those agencies, but it is certainly about
achieving more than the sum of their parts. We are also looking at
stripping out some of the delivery functions contained in the DCLG and
moving it towards being a much more strategic, policy-focused
Department, as well as one that has had some direct delivery
responsibilities in the past. Bringing those functions across, as well
as bringing the responsibilities of the Academy for Sustainable 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 20</div>Communities into the new agency, will not be a sufficient starting
point, because it is not just about gluing different pieces of a jigsaw
together.</div>
					<a name="0712124000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">We found it
quite encouraging that the Bill goes back to first principles and says,
&#147;What do we actually need in order to deliver on the ambitions
not only in the housing Green Paper, but looking ahead? What are the
powers that our new agency would need, perhaps learning from some of
the mistakes that we have seen in the past?&#148; That is
encouraging. The challenges to do with supply are only part of the
equation. We are delighted to see that the Planning Bill is also being
considered by this Parliament. We know that the delivery of our
ambitions for homes in both market and social housing will be
contingent on good quality planning and also on land supply. There are
some big issues around
that.</div>
					<a name="0712124000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
also want to mention the critical role of the Government in local
authority strategic housing in particular, which we have been pushing
hard on for some time. The key considerations include not only how the
HCA operates, but how it interfaces through the tasking framework with
both the regional architecture, as it was set out in the sub-national
review, and local
government.</div>

								Richard
Capie:

						</i> I think that it is a power that we would like
to see executed with caution, if it were executed. It is certainly not
the first point of recourse. Obviously, where local authorities are
capable and enabled to execute their planning powers to the fullest
extent, that should be the proper avenue. However, we are also talking
about situations where complex land arrangements might cross local
authority boundaries, in which case it might be advisable or desirable
to vest the planning powers in the actual agency in order to expedite
the supply needed. We have been clear that we see the local authority
role as absolutely critical in that, and that it should only happen
where absolutely
necessary.</div>

						</i> We would like the wording to be amended, so
that the default position is with the local authority, assuming that it
is an effective strategic enabler, whether at the local authority level
or the sub-national level. One of the reasons that we have had failure
of supply, as you have indicated, is where that has not happened.
Actually, the new agency&#146;s power to step in is quite important.
However, it should step in not as a default, but only if a local
authority has not exercised its rights
first.</div>

states:</div>
					<a name="0712124000290"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in the CIH
response to the consultation on housing and regeneration, CIH asked the
Government for the new agency&#146;s remit to go beyond housing
delivery and to cover sustainable communities. CIH considers that the
Bill does not go far enough in this respect and the HCA should have a
much clearer duty to ensure communities are sustainable and
cohesive.&#148;</div>

								Sarah
Webb:
							</b>
						</i> We have been concerned for a while about the
local authorities&#146; strategic enabling role, in general, in
relation to housing and to sustainable communities. It has been
undermined for a variety of reasons over the past seven or eight years,
but we think that it is key to delivering not only new supply, but the
place-shaping role we have discussed. It is only really the local
authority that can take on that role and responsibility on behalf of
the community.</div>
					<a name="0712124000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
the debate about the new agency has been going on for the last couple
of years, things have happened at the Audit Commission. We have been
supportive of the concept of the comprehensive area assessment, but the
problem is that we are not sure what it looks like yet. Originally, the
CAA was not an option, so we were looking for the new agency to provide
a clear role for local authority strategy. Since the inception of the
CAA, we think that it is the best place for that role, but we are not
sure whether it will be used. Whether or not it could be put in the
Bill, there is an argument for local authorities being required by law
to produce a housing strategy or something that links with it, because
that is the only way to ensure that sustainable communities are
delivered and that the best use is made of the resources of all the
individual organisations that put money into an area. The local
authorities will have a &#147;conductor of an orchestra&#148; role,
but it will not happen without, ideally, legislative
underpinning.</div>

						</i> There are two elements of the legislation that
we find encouraging. One is tucked away at the back of the schedules:
it is an amendment to the Local Government and Public Involvement in
Health Act 2007, which names the Homes and Communities Agency as a
partner authority under that Act. It is a very encouraging step and
something that we are pleased to see. Secondly, objective 6 of the
regulator&#146;s objectives talks about the contribution that social
landlords will be expected to make to non-housing activity. Again, we
see that as an important component in stressing the contribution that
can be made to sustainable communities. We have been encouraged by both
those

						</i> That is interesting. It is possible to want to
plan for it, but not to use the powers to ensure that it delivers. The
most likely reason in my experience for anticipating that you will have
a mixed community but not getting one is because, crudely, you give in
to the developers who say, &#147;I don&#146;t want any social
housing in this scheme,&#148; or, &#147;I only want two houses at
the back of the estate that look completely

						</b> In my community, we have a huge
buy-to-let market, so when one is building new private sector homes,
one is not necessarily providing for owner-occupation but possibly
providing for further rented accommodation in a high rent area, which
may well mean that people are not able to work and to pay rent 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 22</div>for the roof over their heads. Thus, when you add that to the social
rented housing in an area, what you actually have is a community that
is not mixed, because owner-occupation is either not there or is
reducing.</div>

						</i> I agree with that. I live in Sandwell in the
west midlands, and Sandwell does not need any more social rented
housing, as it has an excess of it. My very crude approach is that if
we know nationally that 75 per cent. of people own and that 25 per
cent. rent, which is roughly the proportion and has been for a while,
we should start off with every estate having roughly that proportion,
but very few do so. Most of them are skewed one way or the other, and
it is as important to unskew the social rented sector as the
owner-occupier sector. Buy-to-let is another area that I could rant
about for

all social housing, is so important to me&#151;if I had to pick one
thing from the Hills review, it would be the lack of mix. I feel that

						</i> I will start with a generality and Richard can
come in with the specifics. It seems crazy to me, in an environment in
which there is never enough public money to go round and there is an
affordable housing crisis, that one bit of the public sector is
competing with another bit of the public sector. You can have two
housing associations competing among themselves and with Wimpey or
Barratt Homes to buy a bit of land owned by a local authority. All that
does is drive the value of the land up. It reduces the ability of the
housing association, if it wins, to produce affordable housing for
rent. Housing associations need more grants, which involves public
money. I start from the perspective that that is part of my definition
of insanity.</div>

						</i> We all welcome the Government&#146;s
initiative to go across Whitehall and ask every Department to identify
surplus public land. That is very helpful, because we know that we need
more public land to build on. Having identified that land, the question
is how that land is disposed of. We see evidence across Whitehall of
Departments wanting to maximise the return on their assets. That means
that somebody else ends up paying more for that land when they acquire
it, so one part of Government is paying for
another.</div>
					<a name="0712124000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
example is how English Partnerships has been required to obtain best
consideration and circumstances around its land supply. That has meant
that the Housing Corporation has ended up paying more grants from one
part of the public purse to subsidise the homes that are built on that
piece of land. We have an opportunity with this Bill, in bringing
different agencies together, not only to operate in a different way,
but to consider new investment frameworks in which the state can look
at investments rather than grants and see a return on its investments
over a period of time. I hope that that will have an influence on how
you consider how to use land going
forward.</div>
					<a name="0712124000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will make
one comment on what Lyn Brown said about mixed communities. Another
thing to bear in mind is that local authorities have considerable
powers under their planning powers and the local development frameworks
to specify what kind of homes they want to see, and considerable work
is going through on that already. A lot of powers can be used to
influence local housing markets in terms of what is being built. There
is also the ability for landlords to look at estate management,
covenants and
arrangements.</div>
					<a name="0712124000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">You might
build a mixed community in the first instance, with 25 per cent. social
rent, 25 per cent. low-cost home ownership and 50 per cent. outright
sale, and then find that the outright sale goes into a buy-to-let
market and that some of that gets let back to the local authority. You
can find ways around that, and there are some good examples of where it
has been done. The powers exist, but there needs to be awareness and
knowledge about what they are and how they can be applied
sensibly.</div>

there is a duty to co-operate with the local authority. I guess that
not all communities are actively engaged with their local authority.
There is a risk that you are assuming that the local authority will be
engaged with all the individual estates or areas within it. I think
that right now we need a national housing agency. We have a national
housing problem. We have a lack of affordable housing and we still have
not made 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 24</div>all the existing housing decent. Never mind standards in the private
rented sector, homelessness or CO<span class="Sub">2</span> emissions from existing

the deliverer of the extra housing that we know we all need. How
effective do you think that the housing needs assessment can be as a
planning tool in delivering these mixed sustainable communities, given
that local authorities will have to work with other local authorities,
with the HCA&#151;which will have an overarching role&#151;with

it was a requirement of the HCA to produce an annual assessment of
housing need. There is not such a thing at the moment. The new National
Housing and Planning Advice Unit looks only at market housing, not at
housing across the board. So there is not an annual definition of
housing need, therefore it ends up being done at local authority level.
That is not necessarily wrong, but a number of them do not stand up to
planning challenge which is a really big problem.</div>

concept of the NHPAU, I hoped that one of its roles would be to provide
definitive guidance on how to carry out those assessments so that they
did not get challenged by private developers. We have reined back from
that and I am not altogether sure that I understand why. The
answer&#151;sorry that it is long- winded&#151;is that it has the
potential to be fundamental, but we have not quite got it right yet. We
have turned it into a bit of an industry for consultants and experts,
which can still result in its being challenged at the local level. It

housing role is about. It is about local authorities&#146; capacity
to deliver some of these things. That is a big issue. We are encouraged
by the announcements in the sub-national review about how the regional
architecture will work. That goes back to Mr. Hurd&#146;s
comments about sustainability and how the agencies may interface with
different local authorities. I think that we will see a very graduated 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 25</div>approach, in which you have strong local authorities that are capable of
doing good-quality needs assessments and market assessments and may
have very capable planners. The agency&#146;s role with them could be
quite different from one in which it is much weaker. It may have a much
stronger hands-on role and be able to support the capacity of that
authority.</div>
					<a name="0712124000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly,
we are increasingly seeing authorities clustering together and making
the most of different resources across local authority boundaries and
operating at the sub-regional level, at which many of these assessments
make a lot more sense, such as travel-to-work areas and cultural and
leisure footprints. Housing markets do not necessarily sit comfortably
within local authority boundaries. Increasingly, we are seeing really
welcome co-operation among local authorities in that

real difference, it is not on the methodology for addressing housing

a planning for housing document, but it is still possible to find
situations in which a much-needed scheme for affordable housing, which
has been supported by the housing department and received a grant,
perhaps through a housing association and the Housing Corporation, is
refused by planning. That is probably the bigger difference. If we
could require planning for housing strategies, whether at the local

a regulator of housing, the local authority strategy would be an
eminently sensible thing for it to regulate. Where we have ended up is
that it is predominantly a regulator of social landlord functions, and
therefore it does not fit neatly within that. We have ended up saying
that there might be a legislative need to require local authorities to
produce a housing strategy. That is not the same thing as the regulator
then regulating that. It is a bit of semantics, but the way we have got

<div class="Column"><a name="Column29" />Column number: 29</div>such as yourself? Is that the right approach? From listening to you, I
am convinced that it is. Do you agree, or should we have gone headlong
into
it?</div>

						</i> We would like&#151;in fact, we did suggest to
the Housing Minister that it was worth us all spending the next month
working out whether we could involve local authorities in this process
from the start. There might be the potential for doing that under this
Bill. If that is the case, we should not miss the opportunity. As
Richard said, we have been working very closely with the LGA at chief
executive and chair level in order to consider ways in which that could
be done. We are seeking guidance on what can be done. We understand the
sensitivities involved with enabling clauses so wide that Secretaries
of State could abuse them&#151;perish the thought&#151;but we would
urge you not to give up on domain at this stage. Only if we all believe
that it cannot be done should we move to plan B&#151;the two or
one-year commission looking at how to bring local authorities into the
framework.</div>

						</i> We were particularly encouraged by the
LGA&#146;s proposals, which set out what looks to be the start of a
very workable solution. I do not think that we need two years to plan
and map this out&#151;certainly not in regard to the fundamentals of
what can be done. If we set up a new regulator that, from the off,
covers housing associations and new providers&#151;probably in the
same way as the Housing Corporation does already&#151;we run the risk
of missing a real opportunity to bring about a fundamental cultural
change and to set up a new regulator that, from the word go, covers all
social housing, with that embedded in its foundations 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 30</div>and operation. We should also consider the perception in the rest of the
sector that this has been set up in order to create a level playing
field, and not with housing associations first and foremost and local
authorities bolted on. We are trying to get away from that. It would be
a grave missed opportunity not to consider how we might do that within
this
process.</div>

						</b> Thank you. Once again, we have been beaten by
the clock. As I said to the previous witnesses, <i class="I">Hansard </i>will be
published within the next few days. If, when you read it, you wish to
place other matters on the record, the Committee will be delighted to
receive further evidence from you. Miss Webb and Mr. Capie,
thank you very much for joining us. We are most grateful to you for
your assistance.</div>
					<a name="0712124000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
housekeeping issue before I wind up this sitting: we are on a learning
curve and I made an observation this morning. I was asked earlier
whether hon. Members should address each other in the traditional House
of Commons fashion&#151;as hon. Friends or hon. Members. However,
this is a quasi-Select Committee. I noticed that Sir Simon Milton
thought it necessary to refer to Members by name, and it strikes me
that we are in danger of creating an artificial atmosphere for guests.
That being so, I shall make a ruling now, which might become a
precedent, that when I am in the Chair Members should refer to each
other as they would in a Select Committee&#151;in other words, by
name. That will not apply when we move to full Standing Committee mode,
when exchanges will be as is
traditional.</div>
