<B>Mr. Chairman:</B> Before resuming debate on amendment No. 47, I have a short statement to make on the availability of Hansard. Because of the number of Standing Committees currently meeting, sittings in Westminster Hall and staff shortages, it is not always possible for Tuesday afternoon's Hansard to be available in time for Thursday morning sittings, despite the best efforts of the staff of Hansard. I know that this causes problems for hon. Members and others following the Committee's proceedings, but I would ask for hon. Members' forbearance. I can also inform hon. Members that the record of our fifth sitting on Tuesday afternoon was not available on the internet this morning. Hansard is never put on the internet before they are available in hard copy. If the comments attributed to the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) by the hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) were made during our sitting on Tuesday afternoon, the hon. Member for Pendle must have been relying on his excellent memory.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Prentice </B>(Pendle): I wish to speak to amendment No. 145. Most of the ground has been covered by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath). My amendment is almost in the same terms as the other amendments. I am sure that the Government will wish to accept the amendment, but it may help the Committee if I speak briefly on the note I have received from the British Mountaineering Council. It tells me that mountaineers are keen to climb over disused surface workings. There are a number of examples across the country of such workings, such as extensive slate mines in Snowdonia and the Lake district, limestone workings in the Peak district and grit stone quarrying on the edges of the Peak district. Those are all important walking and climbing areas. They also provide important examples of our industrial heritage.
<P>
<B>Ms Candy Atherton </B>(Falmouth and Camborne): Is my hon. Friend aware that Cornwall has a magnificent mining and quarrying tradition, which is enjoyed by mountaineers and walkers? I hope that he would include Cornwall in his references.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Prentice:</B> Indeed, it was on my list. I commend the amendment to the Committee.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Chris Mullin):</B> On Tuesday, I gave an undertaking to circulate the details of the access fora—or forums depending on one's point of view I have sent a letter, which all the hon. Members should have received. It states that the details are enclosed, however they are not. Officials will circulate the details today. I apologise for that.
<P>
Turning to the amendments. As the hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) said, the amendments need not detain us long. They seek to add a number of new categories to the list of excepted land set out in schedule 1. I am afraid that I find none of them very helpful.
<P>
Amendment No. 47 would except land that is used to process waste materials. That strikes me as an odd activity to encounter on open country or registered common land, as the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) said—[Interruption.] My pronunciation of ``Frome'' displays my lack of a classical education. It has never struck me that a waste recycling centre might be perceived as open country. We do not expect those facilities to be found on access land. In the unlikely event that they are, we imagine that the operation will fall within the curtilage of buildings.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 48 and 67 except land formerly used for mining operations that is being backfilled. That is seldom likely to occur on access land, for reasons that we have discussed. It is unlikely that a quarry or other excavated area would qualify as open country, still less if it were being backfilled with rubbish, which presumably would be generated by the waste recycling centre so imaginatively located in open country. In any event, applications for restrictions or closures can be made if necessary.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Pendle tabled amendment No. 145, which would amend paragraph 4 to make it clear that the exception of land that is used for the getting of minerals applies only if the minerals are being worked. Amendment No. 203, tabled by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, would have the same effect. However, I reassure hon. Members that the amendments are unnecessary because the definition of excepted land in clause 1(2) is land that is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>for the time being—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I stress that phrase—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>of any of the descriptions specified in . . . Schedule 1.
<P>
</UL></FONT>If land becomes excepted, the right of access is suspended only for such time as it continues to meet one or more of the descriptions in the schedule. The right will be permanently lost only if land is removed from the conclusive map at the review, which is provided for in clause 10. If as hon. Members conjecture, mineral working ceases on access land, the right of access will resume. However, safety issues may make it necessary to impose restrictions or exclusions on land under chapter II, but that will be for the relevant authorities to decide. If the character of the land is changed as a consequence of the works so that it is no longer mountain, moor, heath or down, that will also be considered when the map is reviewed.
<P>
Amendment No. 60 would amend paragraph 4 to except land that is used for waste disposal. We have heard enough about waste processing activities. A real need may be addressed in applications for restrictions or closures. We certainly do not want to create a framework that might promote the dumping of rubbish on open country in order to except the land from the right of access.
<P>
Finally, amendment No. 68 would amend paragraph 10 to assign the same meaning to the word ``use'', which appears in paragraphs 3 to 7, as it has in the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. The definition of use in the 1990 Act is special. It makes a clear distinction, for the purposes of that Act, between development by way of building operations and development by way of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>material change in the use<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
of buildings or land. Material change of use often requires planning permission. The 1990 Act makes it clear that in that context ``use'' does not constitute building or other operations. There is no need to make separate provision for the purposes of excepted land. If we made such provision, it might mean that buildings on land used as a golf course or on land used for surface mining would not qualify as excepted land.
<P>
For the reasons that I have outlined, the amendments introduce unnecessary complexities to schedule 1. I ask the Opposition to withdraw amendment No. 47.
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for his explanation of the various amendments. I am not entirely convinced by his argument that if there is a problem exists, one can apply for an exception. I am not sure that that is necessarily the best way forward. However, the point of his objection, in particular his explanation of the use of the word ``use'' in the Town and Country Planning Act, to illustrate that he does not want to encourage people to dump rubbish for the purpose of creating an exception, was slightly fanciful. I cannot believe that anyone would engage in such behaviour.
<P>
The debate on the amendments, particularly the hon. Member for Pendle's explanation of amendment No. 145, echoes an earlier discussion, in which it was said that practised mountaineers—skilled people who enjoy a difficult and dangerous recreation—might want to climb over such areas because it is difficult and dangerous. Indeed, that is exactly when agreements between recognised, sensible groups of experts and owners would be sensible. It would certainly be better than encouraging casual walkers, or even casual climbers and others who might think it a good idea to test themselves on such buildings, which would be the potential effect of amendment No. 145.
<P>
I agree with the Under-Secretary that creating a right for all that could legitimately be exercised only by a few is not the most sensible way forward. I am grateful for his explanation. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 63, in page 39, line 16, leave out `any such land' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`such works'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 70, in page 39, line 40, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`. Land is not to be treated as covered by works used for the purposes of a statutory undertaking under paragraph 7 above, merely by reason of it being covered by electricity transmission lines.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> These are essentially probing amendments. They are fairly loosely related, so I will need to deal with them individually. Amendment No. 62, would leave out the phrase:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>which does not fall within any of the preceding paragraphs and is.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Paragraph 7 would then begin: ``Land covered by works.'' We tabled the amendment so that we might ask the Minister why the present wording was necessary—it seems unnecessary.
<P>
Accepting the amendment would remove an inconsistency. None of the other paragraphs in the schedule include the words that we propose to delete from paragraph 7. I might have missed something, but it is not obvious to me why that paragraph should contain those words. I would be grateful for an explanation from the Minister.
<P>
I approach amendment No. 63 with trepidation because it covers the great curtilage debate, of which all members of the Committee feel that we have had enough. Resisting temptation, I will deal with the matter briefly.
<P>
We have discussed whether a building or land can have a curtilage and reached what seemed to be a satisfactory conclusion. The Minister said that both sides of the debate were right and that curtilage could attach itself only to a building and not to land; previous debates had assumed that curtilage could apply to land although that was not the case. So everything is all right. I might have traduced the Minister's argument, but that description was as I understood it. I have no doubt that the Committee would be grateful for greater illumination on that important subject, if he cared to refine the argument further.
<P>
Amendment No. 70 would remove what appears to be an anomaly that would unnecessarily restrict the rights of walkers. Paragraph 7 would except land
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>covered by works used for the purposes of a statutory undertaking.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would obviously include electricity supply. There is sense in the measure when considering land from which electricity is generated—that clearly would not be regarded as access land. I again query the drafting because it would appear also to except land under electricity transmission lines and would have the ridiculous effect of dividing land covered by electricity cables. As we all know and as many of us deeply regret, some of the most beautiful open land has electricity pylons marching across it. That might be bad enough for those of an aesthetic bent without the adding to walkers' problems. I am sure that the Minister would not wish to do that. I hope that he can explain the curious anomaly that the amendment would remove. Under the amendment, pylons would not be covered, but the land under the transmission lines would be.
<P>
The three amendments are relatively small, but they each deal with an important issue and seek to improve the Bill's practicality. I hope that the Minister will either consider them favourably or explain why the existing provisions are satisfactory.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath </B>(Somerton and Frome): I am about to display my utter ignorance and ask some questions to which I am sure other Committee members know the answer. I want to ask about the definition of statutory undertaking. I think that the hon. Member for Ashford has just confirmed that electricity transmission will fall within the definition of statutory undertaking, but I do not know for certain, and I hope that the Minister will say whether electricity generation is a statutory undertaking, irrespective of by whom and in what form it is carried out. I ask because electricity generation by wind turbine could be carried out on open land, as defined in the Bill, and I am unsure whether it would qualify as a statutory undertaking.
<P>
<B>The Minister for the Environment (Mr. Michael Meacher):</B> The carrier pigeons that have never taken off. I shall try to deal with each of those somewhat abstruse but ingenious amendments.
<P>
Amendment No. 62 would make a minor amendment to paragraph 7 of schedule 1. I commend the hon. Gentleman for the assiduousness of his reading, which has enabled him to table such an amendment. However, the amendment would have no effect, as the only purpose of the words that it seeks to omit is to ensure that land does not fall into both the preceding exceptions in paragraphs 1 to 6 and the exception in paragraph 7.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> Is that all?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> That is its purpose, rather than any issue of policy or more substantive intention—[Interruption.]
<P>
I should now like turn to the curtilage debate, but the hon. Gentleman may intervene if he wishes to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): I am most grateful to the Minister. That was why I was spluttering and waving my hand about.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Paice </B>(South-East Cambridgeshire): Perhaps my hon. Friend has had a good lunch.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I have not had a good lunch, as my hon. Friend suggests, because I was in the Chamber taking part in the debate on the Armed Forces Discipline Bill.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to clarify the wording of the clause. Why should those words be included only in paragraph 7, which exempts land that does not fall within any other category, and not in the other six paragraphs? To be consistent, it is necessary to include those words in all nine exemptions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> In paragraphs 1 to 6 land is excepted for other reasons. Paragraph 7 relates to land that is excepted for a different reason from those already listed in paragraphs 1 to 6. Hon. Members are making heavy weather of the matter. We merely want to clarify the exception in paragraph 7.
<P>
I want to turn to the curtilage debate, as it has become known. Amendment No. 63 would amend paragraph 7 so as to except land covered by the curtilage of ``such works'' instead of the curtilage of land ``covered by works''. That is a fine distinction, which we have already discussed, that we believe that the amendment would have no material consequence.
<P>
I am sure that Committee members will be pleased to know that officials have been taking seriously their concerns about the issue and have found two further precedents for the phrase ``curtilage of such land'' in addition to the one in the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. A similar phrase is apparently—I confess that I did not know this—used for the same purpose in schedule 6 to the Highways Act 1980 and in schedule 14 to the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. In those cases, curtilage has been used to refer to land covered by works, as it is in schedule 1 to the Bill. I repeat that the phrase is not unique, but we are talking about curtilage of land that has works on it. To that extent, it is a reference to curtilage to works rather than land. There is a precedent.
<P>
Amendment No. 70 would amend the definition of statutory undertaker in paragraph 10 of schedule 1. I am glad that my instinctive response to the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome is correct. That it is what I have been authoritatively informed. The amendment is intended to make clear that for the purposes of the exception in paragraph 7—land covered by works used for the purposes of a statutory undertaking—land is not to be treated as excepted because it is covered by electricity transmission lines.
<P>
I am pleased to welcome the hon. Gentleman to that group of people who are extremely anxious to see the maximum possible for the new right of access. It is pleasing that he is trying to extend it even further, but transmission lines do not cover the land, so the amendment would have no material consequence. I commend the hon. Gentleman for his ingenuity, but for the reasons that I have given, the amendments are misconceived. They add nothing to the intention of schedule 1. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be willing to withdraw amendment No. 62.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Even after that purple peroration, I am glad to give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> It was indeed purple. Do the Minister's comments apply also to the base of the pylons? They cover quite a large area. Is that access land, even thought the base may be wired?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> We would argue that it is access land. I appreciate that the base of a pylon covers a significant area—I cannot give a measurement, but we all have an idea of it—but that is not a reason for exception. I do not think that the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome is suggesting that the bottoms of pylons should be excepted, but that the whole area should be excepted. That would be going too far. Whatever else one thinks about pylons, they do not cover that much land in the totality of open country. It would be wrong to use that as a basis for exception.
<P>
<B>Miss Anne McIntosh </B>(Vale of York): Does the Minister agree that if we got rid of pylons and overhead electricity supply—like the pylons that might be built between Lakenby, Picton and Shipton by Bellingborough—and replaced it with underground cables, paragraph 7 to schedule 1 and the amendments to it would not be required.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The hon. Gentleman is ingenious in raising an issue that will touch a chord with many. For those who enjoy the countryside, pylons are sometimes unsightly. However, the hon. Lady's suggestion goes rather further than the nature of this rather esoteric amendment. She would be advised to make her point elsewhere, and I am sure that she will.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful for most of the Minister's explanation. As I said in my introduction to the debate, I was slightly confused about the purpose of the provision covered by amendment No. 62. I am now completely confused. I shall therefore not proceed with it.
<P>
As for the other two matters, I am grateful to the Minister and his officials for the assiduous research undertaken in finding ever more precedents. I suspect that by the time we get to the end of the clause, curtilage will have been further debated, and we shall doubtless have an exhaustive list of each occasion on which curtilage has been defined in legislation during the past 50 years.

<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Fifty-one years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> That is true. Such confusions make the lawyers rich because the matter will doubtless be fought out in the courts. Those considerations are more pressing in view of the Under-Secretary's comments on the extent to which power lines cover the land. The Government's legal advice was that they do not cover the land, but I guarantee him that while we are speaking, lawyers are trying to find ways to argue that power lines do cover the land. The matter will doubtless be fought out in the courts and at adequate expense to the lawyers.

</P>
<P>
I welcome the Under-Secretary's recognition that some of our proposals would extend the right of access. We have made it clear on several occasions that we accept the Bill's principles and that we want to make the legislation practical. Some of the Bill's proposals about creating access land are inappropriate and impractical, and it failed in its attempt to extend new access land as much as possible. We are happy to prod the Bill from both directions in that regard. I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for his explanation. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 71, in page 39, line 41, leave out paragraph 11.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take the following amendments: No. 72, in page 40, line 1, leave out `that'.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`unless the development has become lawful within the meaning of section 191(2) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The amendments relate to part II of the schedule, and to paragraph 11 in particular, which refers to land that does not have planning consent. I have moved the amendments not in a desperate effort to change the law, but in the hope that they will encourage the Under-Secretary to explain the present position. If the Under-Secretary convinces me that my concerns are adequately covered by the Bill's phraseology, I shall be satisfied.
<P>
Amendment No. 71 would delete paragraph 11, which suggests that developed land will become excepted land only if the development has planning consent. If it does not have planning consent, is not eligible to be regarded as excepted land. I notice that the Under-Secretary is nodding, which suggests that my interpretation so far is right. The situation that I described begs two questions: first, whether access law should somehow function as surrogate planning legislation because it deems that land that does not have planning consent falls foul of a wholly different form of legislation; and, secondly—a matter that we have discussed on several occasions—how one should inform the would-be walker about the relative position of each piece of land.
<P>
I challenge the Under-Secretary over the first point. It is wrong to use a wholly different sort of law to deal with what is essentially a planning issue. Planning law is perfectly adequate to deal with transgressions of planning permission and planning legislation, and it would be wrong to burden the Bill with such a planning regime. Moreover, the provision is somewhat impractical, because, in many ways, it is very narrow. First, walkers will not know whether a building or development has planning consent. How are they supposed to find out? They certainly cannot go and consult a planning register and they ought not to be expected to bring the legislation with them. Secondly, if a building that does not have planning permission, the land on which it sits—and its curtilage—cannot be excepted land, and, if that is the case, the walkers will have right of access all around that building or development. I question the wisdom of that, partly because of the potential risks to the individual. It may not be a common occurrence, but there may be unauthorised quarrying going on, and the Bill would allow people to walk all over the land, even when it is being used for that.
<P>
There is also the issue of development that might never receive planning consent, but which the local planning authority might not see a need to pursue. Government guidance is that the planning authorities should not require applications for development that has already taken place, but is unobjectionable. Paragraph 11 of the schedule would make such applications obligatory, so that the planning aspect were in order in the context of the issue of access. There is confusion here.
<P>
If, by chance, we cannot sway the Under-Secretary into accepting that the whole paragraph should be left out, he might consider accepting amendments Nos. 72 and 73. Paragraph 11 refers to development that has been carried out. Planning consent for that development may have been granted under predecessor provisions to the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, the only Act referred to in the schedule. The land may have been developed after the 1990 Act, but under previous legislation. The schedule also applies to development that has taken place that would require planning consent today, and it seems to us that pre-1990 development has been caught in the requirement for planning permission under the 1990 Act.
<P>
The Under-Secretary may tell us that the 1990 Act covers all previous planning legislation. If that is the case, the presumption on which I am working is wrong and I shall accept that. However, our view is that there is a lacuna relating to development that was carried out under planning legislation that predates the 1990 Act. Amendments Nos. 72 and 73 would allow land developed under earlier planning consent to become excepted land.
<P>
Amendment No. 74 is very straightforward. It would put beyond doubt the fact that land on which development was carried out before the introduction of planning controls in 1948 could be designated as excepted land. That is not clear in the Bill, and it would appear that, because such development did not have planning consent—even though planning consent was not required at the time the work was done—the land cannot be excepted land.
<P>
Amendment No. 75 refers to buildings that have been erected without planning consent. If such buildings remain in place for four years without any action by the planning authority, they become lawful. For a domestic garden, the period is 10 years. That is the effect of section 191(2) and other provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. The provisions do not apply to cases in which planning consent has been granted, but to cases in which the planning authority has decided not to pursue—or has failed to pursue—enforcement measures in the time laid down in the Act, thus allowing the development to become lawful. It may seem to be a rather pedantic point, but the issue is whether, if it is lawful, it is construed as having had planning consent. To me, the two are not necessarily the same. It is anomalous that development that is lawful in planning terms does not count under the access provisions because of the way in which the paragraph is worded.
<P>
It is a straightforward group of amendments, and I shall be more than content if the Minister persuades me that I am mistaken in my interpretation of them. We are not suggesting that the paragraph will take swathes of land out of the access provisions; we simply want more clarity about the development issues relating to excepted land.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire touches on an interesting point—the mischief that the clause is intended to remedy. There are two ways of looking at it. Is the clause intended as a buttress to planning law, using the access provisions to assist with the policing of planning law, in which case the hon. Gentleman's arguments are pertinent and the Minister should respond accordingly? Alternatively, and this was my original reading of the provision, is it intended to stop spurious development being used to prevent access? If so, should it not cover all possible development that would naturally fall outside the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990?
<P>
A person who is sufficiently malevolent use spurious development to prevent access will not be deterred by the fact that one piece of planning law is referred to in the Bill. There must be a catch-all provision to avoid someone spuriously building what they claim to be an electricity generating station, which I think still comes under the Electric Lighting Act 1909 for permission, because it is a permission given directly by the Government rather than by the local authority. There are various ways of permitting development that I believe still fall outside the 1990 Act.
<P>
I should be grateful if the Minister would say whether I am talking nonsense because everything is now contained in the 1990 Act. If I am not, why does he not include in the Bill all the planning provisions that could enable development to take place? Someone who sufficiently mischievous will be able to find a type of development that falls outside the 1990 Act and use that to prevent access.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire is right to try to ensure that the provisions on excepted land mesh in properly with the planning system, but I do not agree with his interpretation on a number of points, and I shall briefly say why.
<P>
Paragraph 11 provides that access land cannot be turned into excepted land by putting one of the developments listed in the schedule on it, as the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome suggested. It is not a question of seeking to impose better policing of development law; planning permission is necessary. If we removed paragraph 11, as amendment No. 71 proposes, people's rights of access would be reduced because of the unlawful behaviour of others in not obtaining planning permission where it is needed.
<P>
I appreciate that we are talking about a fairly abstruse set of circumstances. I find it difficult to believe that anyone would build an electricity generating station to prevent people from walking over the land. I am sure that I could think of more realistic examples.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Perhaps I may intervene while the Minister is reading his notes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Indeed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I always try to be helpful. I saw that the Minister was having trouble with his notes.
<P>
I entirely agree with the Minister that it seems extremely unlikely that anyone would choose to build a power station in order to except his land. However, a person who ignores the fact that he has no planning permission is breaking the law. How likely is it that such a lawbreaker, who should be prosecuted in any case, will pay attention to the provisions of paragraph 11 of schedule 1 to the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2001 or 2002? What is the point of the provision if the guy is breaking the law by building something illegally? What is the point of specifying that he should not therefore have his land excepted?
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman can answer his own question. If such a person builds a development for which he requires planning permission, he is required to obtain permission and can be taken to court or required to remove the building if he fails to do so. In the Countryside and Rights of Way Bill—of whatever vintage—we seek merely to provide that if such a development were to be built without planning permission, its existence could not be used to prevent people from having access. It is no more than that. We do not seek to intervene between the courts and those who have erected a building without planning permission. Such people can be dealt with in other ways. The Bill is about the conditions in which land can be excepted. We want to ensure that such unlikely circumstances should not be used to prevent someone from having access to that land.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 72 and 73 would add references to permissions under earlier planning legislation that has been consolidated in the 1990 Act. The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire was right; the Planning (Consequential Provisions) Act 1990 carried forward the effects of the earlier legislation. He may not carry this information in his head, but section 2(2) of that Act provides that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Anything done or having effect as if done under or for the purposes of a provision of the repealed enactments has effect, if it could have been done under or for the purposes of the corresponding provision of the consolidating Acts, as if done under or for the purposes Of that corresponding provision.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman will realise that I merely wish to clarify matters. I hope that I have not confused everyone. The repealed enactments include the Town and Country Planning Acts 1947, 1962 and 1971, and the consolidating Acts include the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. Planning permissions granted under the 1947, 1962 or 1971 Acts have effect as if they had been granted under the 1990 Act—as I think he suspected.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 74 and 75 address cases where development is lawful even though no planning permission has been granted or was required. If planning permission is not required, or is granted on an application made to a local planning authority or by some other means, paragraph 11 of schedule 1 does not apply. However, if planning permission was required and has not been granted, there are time limits within which enforcement action must be taken. I accept that if the time limit for enforcement has expired, the land should be treated as excepted land, and that that may not be the effect of paragraph 11 as it stands. Amendment No. 75 seems to be intended to deal with that. I cannot accept the amendments as they stand, but I undertake to consider the matter and return to it on Report. I hope that the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The Minister has been extraordinarily helpful. I appreciate that, and I am pleased that he has been able to clarify matters. I am happy to accept that my presumption was wrong on previous planning legislation.
<P>
As for development carried out that is now legal under planning legislation or that took place before planning laws existed, I am pleased that the Minister has accepted that we have identified a problem. I am delighted to accept his offer to come back on Report with a further choice of words. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Green:</B> I was rather alarmed by the exchange in which my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire, who was teasing, and the Minister seemed to cast doubts on when, even which year, the Bill might receive Royal Assent. I was worried because we seem to have been proceeding all day, happy in the knowledge that we were doing so with all due deliberate speed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I was referring not to the speed of the Committee's deliberations, but to the extraordinary congestion and general chaos that are occurring in the Government's legislative programme, which might mean subsequent stages of the Bill in the House of Commons or in the other place being delayed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend makes a powerful point.
<P>
This is a substantive group of amendments, not least because we now move on to a key part of the Bill, which provides people with the right of increased access. The amendments seek to improve the handful of restrictions in the Bill that people must observe when they exercise that right. The purpose of the amendments, and of other amendments tabled by myself and my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire, is to balance the rights and responsibilities—a phrase familiar to Ministers—of those who will exercise the right of access. We also want to make the regime more practical when it finally hits the statute book.
<P>
I note that we are now rejoined by at least one Whip. I advise hon. Members on both sides that speculation as to how long we may be here this afternoon should now be put behind us.
<P>
The amendments seek to stop damage occurring to the boundaries of land by people inadvertently—or, more rarely, deliberately—abusing private property. The amendments sharpen our focus on the desirability of local authorities creating appropriate access points to the open countryside to which greater access will now be allowed. We have already debated defined points of access, but, in part, the amendments seek to push local authorities towards the desirability, even if it not in the Bill, of providing defined points, places where access will mostly occur, in the interests of safety and generally to help walkers. That will facilitate not only safer access, but easier access, especially for inexperienced walkers. I am sure that we would all welcome that.
<P>
Amendment No. 78 would prevent people from climbing over boundaries, walls, fences, hedges or gates when exercising their right of access. I pray in aid the Minister's speech on Second reading. He said that dry stone walls are
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>an essential part of the beauty of the countryside and have been neglected for too long.—[Official Report, 20 March 2000; Vol. 346, c.722.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I agree that they are essential and that too many of them have been neglected for too long. Indeed, the Bill contains provisions to stop people breaking or damaging field boundaries.
<P>
The central purpose of amendment No. 78 is to prevent that damage from occurring inadvertently. The Minister will be aware that dry stone walls are quite vulnerable, more so than other types of wall, and that it is relatively easy to damage them. Even with the best intentions, people are more likely to damage dry stone walls than other types of wall. Hedges are even more vulnerable. It will take only one accident for someone inadvertently—or, in rare circumstances, deliberately or uncaringly—to cause damage to a wall or hedge. It may be a long time before repairs can be made, and such unfortunate incidents may have a long-term effect. The amendment will ensure that people exercising their right of access do not damage field boundaries.
<P>
Clause 33 provides for agreements between access authorities and owners or occupiers to provide reasonable means of access. That will presumably include gates or stiles at suitable locations. One of the secondary effects of amendment No. 78 would be to enforce that provision by stopping individuals hauling themselves over hedges or dry stone walls. A balance must be drawn. We wish to enforce proper means of access, and we wish for agreements between access authorities and owners to promulgate those proper means of access. We should make those enjoying the right of access responsible for using those proper access points and not doing anything that could damage the natural or the built environment.
<P>
I believe that the Government may be prepared to accept amendment No. 79. Subsection (1)(a) lists the various ways of entering fields, but it does not include a stile.

<P>

<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I am not trying to destroy the hon. Gentleman's argument, but does he agree that it would be a great misfortune if amendments Nos. 78 and 79 were both accepted? The first amendment would make it difficult to climb over a stile.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Indeed. The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. I was being realistic, thinking that the Government might accept amendment No. 79 rather than amendment No. 78. I am sure that they will not accept both.
<P>
That would not be very sensible, They will have to choose. They could table their own amendments— something that we are all awaiting—
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> With bated breath.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Indeed. We have so far received several welcome commitments about amendments that will be tabled on Report. I am slightly worried that Report will take longer than the Committee's sittings, if the Government table all the amendments that will, at this rate, be necessary.
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is clearly necessary to include stiles in the list in the clause. They are by far the most frequent means of crossing a field boundary and I can only assume that their omission is an oversight. As I say, I am more optimistic than usual about my prospects of persuading the Minister to accept the amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 98 would, for the reasons that I have already given, add to the list of schedule 2 restrictions affecting persons exercising access rights the climbing of barriers or the attempt to do so. Amendment No. 99 is an alternative. I am happy to confirm that, before the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome leaps to his feet again. It is a softer option, so to speak, allowing people to climb over field barriers unless there is an appropriate entry within 500 m. That would encourage landowners to provide access at designated points, implicitly recommending safe and sensible routes, and—I am sure that this would usually be the case—those likely to provide the maximum enjoyment of the natural beauty or other features. I am sure that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee would consider it important for landowners or occupiers to provide such facilities. A quid pro quo with respect to enforcing sensible access would encourage them to do that. Amendment No. 110 would add the word ``stile'' to the list under sub-paragraph (m).
<P>
The amendments are central to the practicality of the regime to be introduced The Minister may want to pick and mix among the amendments, but I hope that some will find favour.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I apologise to the hon. Member for Ashford for my slightly flippant comment. The juxtaposition of the two amendments was unfortunate, but he makes a sound point.
<P>
Clause 2 provides some basic ground rules without changing the law materially. Provisions exist to deal with anyone who goes on to private property and breaks or damages it. I understand that the Government intend clause 2 to make it clear that people who go on to land have some duties to preserve the integrity of what they find there. That is sensible. The hon. Member for Ashford is right to add stiles to the list. Stiles are often the means of ingress or egress for fields in the sort of land that we have been discussing. The Minister could accept the amendment without greatly damaging the Bill.
<P>
Amendment No. 156 would extend the application of clause 2 a little further. The clause will not greatly extend the statute, but provides ground rules. Some things that will be on land for agricultural purposes have not been defined, including temporary boundary markers such as hurdles. It could be argued that those are not walls, fences, hedges or gates, but they are put up for a purpose and people should not damage them, accidentally or intentionally, as they use the land for access.
<P>
There will be items relating to the husbandry of the land. Good, sensible, responsible persons will leave them alone, realising that they are not their property and that they are there for a purpose. They will walk past and not over such things, and will not decide that it might be fun to see how far one could climb up them. However, some irresponsible people will not take that attitude. The Bill will not stop irresponsible people doing things that we do not want them to do, but we have a duty, in trying to balance the interests of those who have access and those who live and work on the land, to make the ground rules and standards of behaviour as explicit as possible. The amendment would extend what the Minister clearly has in mind and make it slightly more explicit.
<P>
I hope that my amendment or that of the hon. Member for Ashford, or something similar, will commend itself to the Minister, so that the clause is extended to make the boundaries of acceptable behaviour quite clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The hon. Member for: Somerton and Frome pointed out that the key to the Bill is working out how to balance the interests of walkers and landowners. Clause 2 is central to that balance.
<P>
I take issue with the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome on one point only. He said that the clause would hardly change existing law. To a degree he is right, except that the Bill is fundamentally changing the law by making accessible to walkers large acreages that are not currently accessible to them. The clause concerns how people go on to that land. It harks back to our previous discussions of access points.
<P>
On the issue of mutual understanding and sympathy between walkers and ramblers—a matter dear to my heart—I take issue in passing, and in his absence, with my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames), who had rude things to say about the Ramblers Association and disagreed with some of what it has been doing. He may well be right with regard to the Ramblers Association nationally, but my relationship with the Ramblers Association in Chippenham is very warm indeed. It is working with the county council and others on the embryonic access forum in Wiltshire. Those warm working relationships are precisely what is needed for the Bill to work.
<P>
I was lucky enough to serve on the Select Committee on the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs when it undertook its recent study into field boundaries. It produced worrying conclusions about walls, relating both to dry stone dykes, with which we are familiar in the north of England, including Yorkshire and elsewhere, and to a more particular concern in my area. Cotswold stone walls are inclined to crumble as water tends to get into them and is then frozen. One of the effects of such crumbling is to provide a foothold in the wall. It is easy to climb over a Cotswold stone wall, as there are often holes that one could use as footholds. Of course, such climbing is quite wrong, as it causes the collapse of walls. That can be seen throughout the Cotswolds. The problem is worrying, as the skill of rebuilding such walls is dying out.
<P>
The amendments seek to safeguard the robust dry stone walls in northern England and the less robust ones in my area. They also attempt to preserve some of our ever-decreasing hedgerows. The Government give much lip service to looking after hedgerows, which are disappearing at a significant rate. However, if walkers blunder, climb or clamber through hedgerows—[Interruption.] Labour Members appear to find that funny, but I do not think that it is at all funny. Some of the more rampant and outspoken ramblers are likely to clamber through hedgerows. Some people believe that a hedge is a thing to breached and will want to get through it to reach access land beyond. The amendment seeks to tell those people that they should find proper access.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mark Todd </B>(South Derbyshire): Does the hon. Gentleman share my view that the Bill provides a perfect opportunity to strengthen the protection of hedgerows as hill boundaries?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> We have not yet discussed any provisions in the Bill that strengthen field boundaries and hedges. I am not sure whether such provisions would come within its terms, but I shall happily listen to the debate on that as we proceed. The Bill as it currently stands would further weaken the field boundaries about which the Select Committee was concerned. The amendments would enable us to go along with generalised access, but to have at least some due regard to field boundaries.
<P>
I feel some sympathy for the Liberal Democrat amendment in that respect. A number of other features apart from dry stone walls, hedges and fences need to be protected. For example, horse troughs are often located on a wall or fence and might seem attractive to the unthinking rambler as a means of gaining access to access land. However, a horse trough is an extremely expensive thing to buy and is susceptible to damage. In my own area, the hunts—I am intentionally launching myself into a controversial area—provide an important part of the landscape. My constituency has four fox hunts and two beagle packs. All four of the hunts provide hunt jumps between fields. The provisional hunt jump is expensive and difficult to build on dry stone walls and in a variety of other places. If amendment No. 146 is not accepted, the hunt jumps may appear to be an attractive way of entering access land and are likely to be damaged. Although such damage may appeal to Labour Members who do not like hunt jumps, the activity to which they relate is an important part of the rural economy in areas such as my own.
<P>
The amendments would clarify the way in which people gain access to access land. That is a good thing both from their point of view and from that of the farmers over whose land they will walk. They would also go some way towards encouraging the mutual understanding and sympathy between walkers and owners that should be central to the Bill.
<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd </B>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy): I find myself in agreement with the hon. Gentleman's last sentence. The phrase ``right to roam'' has been one of the most damaging things to the public perception of the Bill and has sent shock waves through rural communities. Having read the Bill, I realise that the rights that it provides are nothing of the sort, but rural people are fearful that their areas will be overrun. We know that that is nonsense, because we are discussing the Bill in detail. However, many members of the public do not realise that the word ``right'' must, jurisprudentially, carry an obligation with it.
<P>
I hope that we are now reaching a crucial issue: for the right of access to apply, there will have to be an equal obligation for the user. I think that the amendments are sensible in that regard, whether or not they are probing. If the Minister responds as positively as he has done so far, the debate will be very worth while. As we are not dealing with linear access, people who use the right will be able to clamber over a wall or other boundary. I am not saying that they will, but we should consider all eventualities; indeed, that is the whole point of the Committee. Some less experienced people might want to clamber over boundaries and will bring down walls and cause other damage. I am considering the matter from the objective point of view of trying to improve the Bill. We are discussing important provisions, and I believe that the amendments are worthy of careful consideration.
<P>
When I was a young man, more than a year or two ago, I remember that there was a countryside code. It was well publicised, and everybody who lived in rural areas knew about it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> It just goes to confirm what many members of my party believe: whenever I get up to speak, alarm bells go off—
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> And everyone leaves.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> The right hon. Gentleman has seen it before.
<P>
The countryside code—or country code—was well known when I was a youngster. The cardinal points included advice not to jump over fences, to use and shut gates and to keep dogs on a leash—much of what we are discussing today. Those are entirely reasonable requests. I am not being pompous or lofty—I live in the country. I want us to ensure that people who have the right of access carry with them the obligation to observe a code. That will help the Bill to work well.
<P>
People have been given the wrong impression by the tag ``right to roam''. It has scared off rural dwellers and the agricultural community. I came to the Committee with an open mind and have found the Bill to be more reasonable than anticipated. Let me declare an interest. My late father was a police officer who should have been a farmer, but there was no room on the family farm. He started farming again when he retired, which was to my great misfortune because, on Saturdays, I had to farm instead of playing rugby. Fences, which we had to repair, were often unintentionally trampled down by people who wanted to gain access to the rivers Conwy and Llugwy at Betws-y-coed for canoeing. Hopefully, we can avoid such incidents. Part of our function is to ensure that those who exercise their rights to access will also observe the reasonable obligations to treat the countryside properly.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Ashford said, dry stone walls are part of our heritage. They are difficult and expensive to repair, but we have a vested interest in ensuring that they are maintained. Given that the Bill provides overall access instead of linear access, it behoves us—although I do not intend to stifle debate or anyone's right of access—to ensure that we give out the right signals. I hope that we will produce leaflets and information so that people are aware of their obligations. We want the Bill to work without upsetting the harmony in rural areas.
<P>
I support the amendments. I hope that the Under-Secretary, as we have come to expect, will cover them in detail.
<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> It is appropriate that I should follow the hon. Member for Clywd—sorry, I mean the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy. We are not doing well with our geography.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I hope that the hon. Lady will not roam.
<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> We roam only in the gloaming where I come from.
<P>
I support the amendments. A learned book has come to my attention in the Library. ``Private Roads: The Legal Framework'' by A. W. and C. Barsby explains:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A private road can become a highway, and therefore subject to a public right of way, without becoming maintainable at the public expense, and without ownership passing to the local authority. In this situation the owner of the road has in one sense the worst of both worlds: the public is entitled to use the road, but does not contribute towards its upkeep.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My point picks up where hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy left off. I represent one of the last areas to have stone walls. On Second Reading, I referred to my constituent Mrs. Blair—no relation to the Prime Minister—whose husband is in the unenviable position of being responsible for maintaining 13 stiles without assistance. Those stiles are vulnerable to damage. Who will pay for the damage caused by someone who climbs or walks over a hedge, stile or stone wall?
<P>
I want to draw the Under-Secretary's attention—when he has a moment—to sections 56, 57 and 58 of the Highways Act 1980 which refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Enforcement of liability for maintenance.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendments and the comments by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy highlight the fact that the Bill does not say who should be responsible for repairing damage. I put the Under-Secretary on notice that if he does not support our proposals, I shall try to fill the gap in the Bill at a later stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I shall start with the points of the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy. He said that rights carry with them obligations. I agree completely. As I am sure that he will concede, the Bill contains many obligations on walkers exercising the right that it will confer. He is right to say that we live in a society with a highly developed sense of its rights but not enough sense of its responsibilities. I was glad to hear him say that the Bill had turned out to be much more reasonable than he and many of his constituents had feared.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> So far.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not be disappointed.
<P>
The Government are adamant that walkers in the countryside should not cause damage to the land or to anything on it. That is why clause 2 states up front that the right of access applies only provided that there is no damage to any wall, fence, hedge or gate and that there is no breach of the restrictions under schedule 2. The purpose of clause 2(1) is to make it absolutely clear that people will be able to benefit from the new right only if they do no damage or harm. That is the basis on which the new right is made available.
<P>
The problem with the amendments is that they are likely to restrict unnecessarily the passage of walkers entering, leaving or crossing access land. If we were to accept all the amendments, such walkers would be lucky to get out of the car park. [Interruption.] They would be some of the most heavily regulated people on the planet. Many of the suggestions have come from the party opposed to too much regulation.
<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> Having just heard a wonderful remark made by one of my hon. Friends from a sedentary position, I wonder whether the Under-Secretary is calling for car parks to be brought within the remit of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The hon. Lady often makes points that are not entirely relevant to the clause under discussion; this is another occasion on which she has done that. If she will forgive me, we will leave car parks until we reach a car parks clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Will the Under-Secretary direct me to the car parks clause, so that we might consider any necessary amendments that might improve it?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. All that I may safely say is that we have not yet reached a suitable moment to discuss car parks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I am grateful for your help, Mr. Malins.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 78 and 98 would prevent walkers from climbing over a gate or fence. What would happen if a landowner padlocked a gate or enclosed a moorland public footpath with the sole intention of frustrating access? That has been known to happen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> If the landowner padlocked the gate, he would be prosecuted or there would be an injunction and the padlock would not last long.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> One occasionally comes across padlocked gates on rights of way. One cannot hang about waiting to see whether a prosecution might follow; one must decide on the way in which the gate is to be crossed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> With respect to the Under-Secretary, the debate seemed to be about people using open gates. We are not talking about access that is blocked off, because that would be pointless. I am a little surprised that he is taking this line. I respectfully ask him to move on to consider open gates. We might then proceed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I am sure that we shall move on, but for now we must deal with closed gates, because the situation sometimes happens. Provided—and I stress the word—that a walker does no damage, I do not see why he or she should not be able to climb over a gate or fence. Amendments Nos. 78 and 98 would prevent that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The hon. Gentleman posits an example in which a gate is locked and a rambler climbs over it to achieve access. That action would become illegal if the amendment were accepted. If one were being prosecuted for illegally climbing over a gate, the fact that the gate was locked would not be a reasonable defence in court.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> With regard to the Under-Secretary's assertion that there is nothing wrong with climbing over a fence or gate, I should tell him from my experience that a fence will soon fall after that has happened more than a few times and that a gate will be pushed out or line or skewed. The amendments are designed to avoid such damage.
<P>
<H5>4.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Yes; we are talking only about circumstances in which there is a locked gate. I am not attempting to encourage people to climb fences, especially not when there is proper access. I hope that I will not be misunderstood on that point.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The subject is like the boycotts of Barclays bank—the debate is taking off
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The Under-Secretary has said that he is referring to a situation in which a gate is locked, but that is not what the clause refers to. It specifically says that someone may go on to land only if
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>he does so without breaking or damaging any wall, fence, hedge or gate.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is no consideration of whether a gate is closed, locked or wide open. The point of the amendments Nos. 78 and 98 is precisely the point that the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy has made: damage arises, even if it is by accident. There is nothing to require a person to use a proper access point, such as an open gate or stile, even if it passes through a hedge and is 10 yd away. He may take whatever line he was on and go over a fence, locked gate, hedge, stone wall, or whatever. Damage could arise in the way that the hon. Gentleman said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> If I may be allowed to progress a little further, the hon. Gentleman will see that I am coming to that point.
<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> Under clause 31(5) of the Highways Act 1980, gates are required to be locked once a year. Is the Minister saying that that subsection is to be repealed?

<P>

<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> No, I do not think that I am. All that we are saying is that we will not make it an offence for someone to climb over a gate or fence, although we naturally want to discourage that. I accept the point made by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy—that behaviour is not desirable, and if a lot of people do it, fences will fall down. The point is not controversial. One comes to obstacles occasionally in the countryside and must decide to climb over them. That is all that we are considering here. If I move on, we will find that we have slightly more in common.
<P>
Walkers will naturally prefer nearby stiles or gates to obstacles that must be clambered over. Amendment No. 99 might seem reasonable in suggesting that users should not climb a fence, for example, if there is an unlocked gate or stile within 500 m; but with a little reflection, the effect of the amendment becomes apparent: walkers would need to make a lengthy diversion of up to 2 km to find out that there was no means of access 500 m in one direction, nor 500 m in the other direction, with a 500 m walk back each time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> Is that not why they are in the countryside? Is that not helping walkers who want to walk?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Does the walker have to walk those 2 km merely to establish whether there is a means of access nearby, which is what I infer from amendment No. 99—I appreciate that it is not what the Opposition are aiming for—or does he have to return to the starting point to satisfy the test?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The Under-Secretary has set up a series of straw men. I presume that most walkers can see some distance; they will be able to see a gate further along the fence. The idea that they would have to traipse 2 km in either direction is frankly absurd.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I was naturally giving an extreme example, but one can certainly foresee circumstances in which people cannot see 500 yd or 500 m in either direction. What happens if there is a river between the walker and the gate? Amendment No. 99 could condemn walkers to pace the walls of upland Britain for ever, looking for a way through.
<P>
I hope that hon. Members will forgive me, but the Government are not going down that road—or path, right of way or bridlepath. In practice, much open country will be genuinely open in nature, with reasonably easy access. Where access is more constrained, I hope that landowners will take the initiative and seek agreements with local authorities over the provision of stiles or other suitable means of access. As the Committee knows, chapter III gives local authorities the power to install and keep open means of access to access land. That, in part, answers the hon. Member for Vale of York (Miss McIntosh).
<P>
I sympathise with the Opposition's concern that walkers should not climb walls if perfectly satisfactory means of access can be found within a short distance. That is only right, but it must be a matter for common sense, and co-operation with the access authorities, rather than making prescriptive provisions in the Bill. In the end, if walkers cause damage to walls or fences, not only will they lose their right of access, they will have committed an offence.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 79 and 110 propose adding stiles to the list of items that must not be damaged when entering land. At present, the list does not include stiles, mainly because the provision is intended to prevent damage because caused to boundaries by people trying to access land that has no means of access.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Will the Under-Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> If the hon. Gentleman bears with me, he might learn something to his advantage.
<P>
I am not sure how much damage could be caused by anyone using a stile properly, unless it is in need of repair, in which case the local authority should be able to assist, using the powers in the Bill. Nevertheless, I agree that if a stile is provided, those exercising the right of access should take reasonable care not to damage it. I am therefore happy to accept amendment No. 79. However, it would not be appropriate to include stiles under item (m) of paragraph 1 of schedule 2, as suggested in amendment No. 110, which is concerned with people breaking through boundaries such as walls. One cannot break through a stile, given that the purpose of a stile is to allow someone to gain entry. However, we accept amendment No. 79.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I am sure that I speak for my hon. Friends when I say that we are glad that the Under-Secretary has accepted amendment No. 79. None the less, there is a logical flaw in what he said about the clause and schedule 2. The word ``gate'' is included in both, and the argument that the hon. Gentleman advanced with regard to stiles, namely that it is a means of access and therefore should not be included, applies equally to gates.
<P>
Mr. Mullin: I shall reflect on what the hon. Gentleman says. For the time being, however, amendment No. 79 deals with stiles, which is what we are conceding. [Interruption.] I shall reflect on it. I shall answer when my reflections have reach the appropriate conclusion.
<P>
I have now reflected. A gate can be locked; not so a stile.
<P>
It is unnecessary to include in the clause damage to farm equipment, as amendment No. 156 would. We are concerned that walkers should not cause damage when they try to enter or cross land. Many other things that walkers must not do are set out in schedule 2, including causing damage to the land or anything on the land, which is provided for in paragraph 1 (k). Of course, such harm may well constitute criminal damage, which is subject to severe penalties.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I do not disagree with the fact that the amendment extends the provision into areas covered by criminal damage, but I believe that it is helpful to set out the rules. Will the Under-Secretary answer the specific point about temporary structures, set in place for agricultural purposes, that effectively form a boundary, such as hurdles and electric fencing, which might be construed as falling into the same class as fences and hedges, although they could not be so defined?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I would imagine that an electric fence could be considered to be a fence. Obviously, lawyers can argue the point, but I would have thought it reasonable to include an electric fence in the scope of the Bill. There is no need for an outright ban on climbing locked gates or fences, especially where there is no other way to gain access to the land. We want to encourage landowners and local authorities voluntarily to ensure effective means of access, for example by providing stiles or gates. Where such facilities are provided, I have no doubt that people will be only too glad to use them rather than having to negotiate a fence or wall. However, there might be circumstances in which the only realistic way to gain access is to climb over a fence or gate. Provided the person causes no damage in the process, he or she should be able to enter the access land in a reasonable and practical way. Therefore, I all the amendments, with the exception of amendment No. 79.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I should accentuate the positive, so I shall start by thanking the Under-Secretary and welcoming his acceptance of amendment No. 79. I hail that as a minor victory for the forces of conservatism and common sense, although that is slightly unfair to the hon. Members for Somerton and Frome and for Meironnydd Nant Conwy, who might not wish to be entirely associated with that remark, although they both spoke sensibly in support of the amendments.
<P>
I now turn to the other amendments, which the Government have rejected. The Minister will be aware that he set up a series of straw men. He said that he had to reject one of the amendments in case someone were to act illegally, but he knows that that is nonsensical. People who act illegally should be prosecuted. Not to include a provision in a Bill in case someone acts illegally is not the way to make good law. That was not one of the Minister's more convincing arguments.
<P>
I want to mention some practical examples. If there is no specific prohibition on climbing over dry stone walls, for example, children and teenagers in some areas will enjoy running along the top of them. If that becomes a good local sport, serious damage will be done to such walls in a short time. That is a practical consideration. Features of the countryside that we all value could be damaged unless we protect them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> But if children were to run along the top of a dry wall—that is a little difficult in the case of dry stone walls—that would constitute a reason for throwing them off the land.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I return to the point raised by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy. At one time, there was a countryside code, which anyone who was about at the time would follow. In these more mobile times, when many people who live in urban areas enjoy the countryside, which the Bill aims to encourage, some people will not know the rules. Therefore, it seems sensible to set out some basic ground rules, which people might wish to absorb before going to the countryside. After all, it takes only one act of damage. The practicalities are that if relatively small-scale offences are committed, a warden, owner or occupier is unlikely to be in the vicinity to do anything about it. A few simple rules are the best way to preserve features such as dry stone walls.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> The hon. Gentleman knows that I agree with him on that, but will he consider the fact that clause 17 provides for access authorities to make byelaws expressly for the prevention of damage to land or anything on or in it? Does he expect access authorities to make byelaws to prevent damage, and is not the problem that walkers will not know about them because, without designated access points, there will be no way to let them know that certain activities are not allowed in certain areas?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> In practice, that is likely to happen, and I anticipate that the Under-Secretary will say that the provision could be covered by byelaws. However, if we want to encourage more people to enjoy the countryside who are likely to be inexperienced about the ways and mores of the countryside, it would be a good idea to set out a few basic rules. Most people probably know not to leave gates open if they find them closed, but many people who want to behave responsibly may assume that dry stone walls are strong historic structures that can withstand any use. There are practical consequences to rejecting the amendments.
<P>
The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome said that it is difficult to stop the irresponsible. Of course that is true, but if the Bill succeeds in its objectives, people who visit the countryside will not be wantonly irresponsible; they will want to know what is the best way to behave in the countryside. I agree with the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy that ``the right to roam'' is a bad phrase, which has done more harm than good, because those people for whom the Bill's purpose is an ideological cause are vastly outnumbered by those for whom walking is a basic means of enjoyment. We should give consideration to the latter group as we scrutinise the Bill.
<P>
We have had a useful debate, which has teased out some key principles and important details. I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for accepting amendment No. 79 and I shall not press amendment No. 78 to a vote. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Green:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 80, in page 2, line 27, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`exclusions or'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a small, stand-alone amendment. I seek some guidance from the Under-Secretary but it seems important to ensure that those who exercise their new right of access are legally bound to observe the exclusions as well as the restrictions listed in chapter II of the Bill on exclusion or restriction of access. It seems that people are legally bound to observe the restrictions but not the exclusions. The amendment would tidy up the drafting and link chapters I and II because there seems to be an anomaly in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> This is a misunderstanding, which we can easily clear up. Amendment No. 80 attempts to clarify that users should observe any exclusions that apply to access land under chapter II, as well as any restrictions imposed under that chapter. I understand that the hon. Member for Ashford wishes to ensure that the right of access does not apply to land from which the public are excluded under chapter II because of a slip of the draftsman's pen. However, I would refer him to clause 2(2), which provides that the right set out in subsection (1) is subject to the provisions of chapter II. The effect is that the right of access will not be exercisable if there is an exclusion under chapter II. Clearly, if the right of access cannot be exercised, the question of observing any limits on the right under clause 2(1)(b) cannot arise.
<P>
The legislation already achieves the amendment's intended effect. If the land is closed, there is no right of access; and if there is no access to the land, there can be no requirement to observe any restrictions or exclusions. Therefore, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful for that brief but comprehensive and clear explanation. I accept what the Under-Secretary says, and beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>` ``access fee'' means payment of a sum not exceeding £7 for a day's access or production of a membership card in lieu of such payment.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The amendments operate together to address something that we believe the Bill overlooks, although I am open to persuasion from the Under-Secretary that that is not the case. Many of the Bill's provisions try not to override the existing situation. For example, the legislation will not do away with existing voluntary access agreements and, as the Under-Secretary mentioned, it will not supersede many aspects of existing law relating to access. However, in some areas, people have access to land, subject to payment of a fee. The fee can take one of two forms: an access fee or a fee for membership of an organisation which then entitles the member to access. That happens particularly with nature reserves, many of which are in open country.
<P>
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds has several nature reserves; for example, the Arne reserve near Poole harbour, which comprises more than 1,300 acres of land that is mainly heathland and so clearly comes within the Bill. Access is allowed to members of the RSPB and to others who pay an entry fee. There is also the Minsmere nature reserve, which I know very well because it is in my home county of Suffolk. It, too, is owned by the RSPB, provides access by membership and falls clearly within the remit of the Bill. The Norfolk wildlife trust owns Weeting heath, where access is provide by membership or on payment of a fee of £2.
<P>
The Bill seems to allow free access into such areas, most of which are owned by charities that will lose important fee income as a result. Membership and associated fees will also be devalued. If the provision is extended to coastal land—as clause 3 may allow—many more nature reserves will be caught in the same way. The power to exclude access for land management purposes does not appear to allow exclusions for the purpose of letting the public in for a fee. The amendments would maintain access that is currently available through direct payment of a fee or through membership. They would also maintain the ability of organisations to require a payment for entry, either directly or through membership. Their principal purpose is to protect the income of the bodies that tend to run nature reserves. They do not seek to remove any right of access, but to maintain the status quo for a relatively small amount of land that is significant in local terms and for the individuals concerned.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire means well with the amendments, but I am concerned about the proposed operative date. In their current form, the amendments would mean that any landowner in the country with any sense would open his land for a fee of £7 per person, on the day before the Bill received Royal Assent. Such landowners would then have protection for the entrance fee for ever and a day. There would be no right of access; instead, there would be a requirement to pay landlords for access. That is a serious defect in the amendment, although it could be corrected to achieve the hon. Gentleman's aims if the operative date were made retrospective from today to some earlier reference date. The use of the date on which the Bill takes effect is a serious defect.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The amendments bring to our attention an important point of principle. We have no objection to reasonable charging by landowners for facilities associated with access to the countryside, such as car parks, toilets and visitor centres. If they are making charges now, they will be able to continue to do so for the same purpose. However, that is entirely different from forcing people to pay for access. I am sure that all hon. Members would agree that the National Trust is a very responsible landowner. It owns more than 200,000 hectares of land in England and Wales, including 66,000 hectares of common land, and levies charges for facilities that are provided to complement access or to manage it. Such charges apply at many of its more popular sites. However, nowhere does the National Trust make people pay for access. When we set out our plans for a statutory right of access in our consultation paper, ``Access to the Open Countryside in England and Wales'', we said that walkers should not normally be required to pay to enter land to which a right of access is granted. The Bill reflects that principle, which I am keen to maintain. We want access to be available to all and not just to those who can afford it.
<P>
It has been suggested that owners of access land may currently be charging for access, but I am not aware of any landowners who are making significant charges for access to open country. The proposition sounds economically dubious. Landowners may make charges for facilities associated with access, but that is another matter. I ask hon. Members who know of land where such charging is a problem to let me know about it so I can consider the circumstances specifically and in more detail. I shall not go beyond that assurance now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The Minister seems unduly suspicious. The amendment is not intended to provide a loophole enabling landowners to prevent access, but to safeguard worthwhile organisations that currently charge for it. My hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire mentioned three of those organisations: the Arne nature reserve near Poole, the Minsmere reserve and the Weeting Heath reserve. All three sites will be access land and currently levy charges whose proceeds go to the RSPB and to other worthwhile nature organisations. What will happen to such sites?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I shall be pleased to consider those examples. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not think that I am being unduly suspicious in not responding immediately to information that is suddenly presented in Committee. I shall consider the matter.
<P>
In our view, charges that are currently being made for facilities can continue, but charging for access itself is contrary to the general principle of the Bill. I should like to consider how to reconcile those matters before the Bill is considered on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Todd:</B> Perhaps a clearer definition of what is meant by facilities would be helpful. I have visited places where the provision of wildlife observation facilities is a critical part of access. Another relevant question is whether people gaining access to a site can do anything other than enjoy the facilities located there. We must consider whether someone gaining access can use it in any meaningful way without enjoying the facilities provided at some cost by the people who run the site. I thought that Opposition Members made reasonable points that deserve further explanation, and I welcome my right hon. Friend's comments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> As I said, I am willing to consider the matter further. It involves a general principle that I do not want to breach; at the same time, I do not want to interfere with existing provisions that work satisfactorily.
<P>
I agree with the point made by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome. The proposals made by the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire deal with access land that is subject to a charge on the date on which the Bill receives Royal Assent. They would ensure that the right of access would not apply on such land or would apply only on payment of a fee. I agree that the proposals it would have the perverse effect that the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome suggests—that landowners who did not want access would open up the land on the payment of a fee just before Royal Assent. That would clearly defeat the purpose of the exercise. Accepting amendment No. 236 would mean that if landowners levied a charge for access between now and Royal Assent, the right of access would not apply.
<P>
I welcome the many expressions of commitment from the Opposition. They say that they do not intend to frustrate the purpose of the Bill, but I am sure that they will accept that the amendment risks doing just that. However, although I am not willing to accept the amendment, I am prepared to look at cases where charges are made. If it is suggested that the charges are not made for the facilities, however we define that—again, we need to exercise our common sense—I shall certainly consider the point and, if needed, return to the House with further proposals.

<P>

<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The Minister slightly redeemed himself with those latter words, but I was somewhat taken aback by his opening remarks. I do not know of any private landlords who are opening land for access and charging a fee for commercial activities. There may be a few, but I do not know of them. However, that was not the subject of my remarks. I was talking about nature conservation bodies that own areas of land in the form of nature reserves, for which they charge—but they charge for access, not for facilities.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd) rightly said that facilities such as bird watchers' hides are an integral part of such nature reserves, because they provide the only way of enjoying the benefits of visiting such places—including Minsmere, which I know very well. It would be a disaster for the wildlife in such places if people were to wander off the beaten path—but that is a separate issue.
<P>
Many organisations charge an entry fee either for each visit or for membership. For instance, many people belong to the RSPB and other bodies, including the National Trust, because it gives them free access to all the organisation's properties; some of those are buildings, which are outwith the Bill's provisions, and others are areas of land. It is a serious matter, and I am astonished that it has not been brought to the Government's attention before now. I am grateful that the Minister, in his latter remarks, redeemed himself and offered to consider the matter again.
<P>
I come back to what the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome said. Neither I nor my hon. Friends claim the wisdom of Solomon. The hon. Gentleman was right to have pointed out the error. We all make mistakes. I was not trying to give people an opportunity to evade the terms of the Bill. Earlier, of course, when we were talking about cultivation, the ball was in the contrary position; I suggested that the Bill provided for people to go out and cultivate downland. I accept that the wording of the amendments is wrong.
<P>
I am grateful to the Minister for his offer to reconsider the matter. I stress that we are not trying to damage the Bill. We want only to protect the interests of some very worthwhile charitable bodies, which carry out excellent work in nature conservation. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
