it.</div><a name="08020611000021"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B"> 81</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000440"></a>The
Minister for Energy (Malcolm Wicks):</b> Having asked
questions in the past and more recently answered them, I am well aware
which is the easier role and am pleased to be undertaking it,
unusually, at the moment. When I discuss the energy market with
parliamentary colleagues, as I did this morning in a Westminster Hall
debate, I find that there seems to be a sharp divide of opinion between
those who feel that we have an energy market that is not only
competitive, but probably the best in Europe, to the benefit of
consumers, and those who are doubtful about that and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column38" />Column number: 38</div>who feel that there is a lack of competition and that it is more like an
oligopoly than a competitive market. I would be grateful if the
witnesses could give their opinion on that
issue.</div>
<a name="08020611000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08020611000441"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Who would like to
respond?</div><a name="08020611000023"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Al</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">i</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">stair
Buchanan:</b></i> I am happy to start by picking up the point
raised by the Minister with regard to comparisons with Europe.
Certainly, at the wholesale end of the market, we have seen a very
exciting development in the last three to four years, particularly in
gas infrastructure. We have seen 21 companies from around the world
invest &#163;10 billion in our liquefied natural gas storage pipeline
infrastructure, thereby taking the UK from around 105 BCMs of demand
and 105 BCMs of supply to potentially 180 BCMs of supply by the end of
this year. With regard to Europe, we still see profound delays in the
development of some of their LNG facilities, such as in Wilhelmshaven
in Germany and Rotterdam in the Netherlands.</div>
<a name="08020611000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps what matters more to
consumers is what is happening in prices and in terms of choice. With
regard to choice, the experience of the UK&#151;I would expand this
comparison beyond Europe&#151;is that about 50 per cent. of customers
have taken the opportunity to choose their supplier. We are clearly
very keen to access the 50 per cent. who have not. By contrast, in
Germany that figure has been about 4.5 per cent. The best country to
compare us with would be Spain, which has hit levels of around 20 per
cent. of choice, and the Nordic region, which has around 10 to 15 per
cent. There is genuinely no other country that provides the degree of
choice or has encouraged and led customers to feel confident enough to
choose. As far as price is concerned, on domestic gas prices today, we
remain among the lowest of the 27 member states, and on electricity
prices, we are around the average.</div>
<a name="08020611000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">To answer your question,
Minister, with regard to investment coming into the UK, domestic choice
and prices and industrial benefits, which for the decade between 1994
and 2004 were extraordinary by contrast to European industrial
counterparts, we think that the market works and has been very good for
the
UK.</div><a name="08020611000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08020611000442"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Does anyone else want to
respond?</div><a name="08020611000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Allan
Asher:</b></i> There are some really good features of
the competitive market in Great Britain, and
energywatch is keen to make them work even better. That includes
switching and things like that. However, I think that it is too much to
think that it is as good as it could and should be. With regard to some
of these key metrics, such as prices, I was looking just yesterday at
the Department for Business, Enterprise and
Regulatory Reform&#146;s website, which publishes very detailed
statistics on European prices every quarter. Complicated 80-page
reports are published every quarter, and many of the comparisons are
quite favourable. However, what really leapt out at me was that the
Department&#146;s figures show that domestic electricity consumers
around Great Britain are currently paying 15 per cent. above the EU
average price, and on this report, we are the seventh cheapest out of
15 countries in Europe. I use that to show that this is with a market
that is most vigorously competitive, yet in Europe they are not;
Governments still use their utilities as secret stealth tax
officers and things like that.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column39" />Column number: 39</div><a name="08020611000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">On prices and on switching, as
Alastair rightly says, just over 50 per cent. of people have
switched&#151;I think it is 52 per cent., which is great&#151;but
48 per cent. have not. The efforts that we have gone to over seven
years have been drawing less and less fruit. Only a third of people
over 60 have switched, and our efforts to get more are not going
anywhere. Many features of the market are just not working. Six million
consumers on prepayment meters are paying &#163;200 a year more than
they could get on the same company&#146;s direct debit tariff. It
goes up worst of all in the north; it is &#163;480 more if you have a
direct debit in the north than on the company&#146;s best
tariffs.</div> <a name="08020611000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">I guess
that, with some of those elements, there are some features of the
market&#151;not all, but some&#151;that are clearly not working for
consumers, and we should understand that and be prepared in the Bill to
do something about it.</div>
<a name="08020611000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08020611000443"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Does anyone else wish so speak, or are we all
done?</div><a name="08020611000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
82</b><a name="08020611000444"></a><b class="B">Charles
Hendry</b> (Wealden) (Con): May I start with a specific
question, primarily to Ofgem, after which I shall broaden it to a
slightly larger issue? Suggestions have been made that Ofgem&#146;s
remit should be changed, specifically to give it an environmental role
or to deal with social tariffs. Would you let us know how you think
that would work? Is it possible to have two primary duties, or do you
think that there should be only one primary duty and a range of
secondary
duties?</div><a name="08020611000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Al</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">i</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">stair
Buchanan:</b></i> Yes, I can take that further. You
probably do not want to hear this, but I think that
broadly there are five models that you might want to look at. I should
say at the outset that we feel that we can do our job with the remit
that we were given in 2003. In that year, we were given social and
environmental guidance by Ministers. Importantly, however, remember
that any significant financial matter has to be dealt with by the
Secretary of State&#151;by the Department for Environment, Food and
Rural Affairs or the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory
Reform. We were given guidance in 2003. In 2004, Parliament gave us a
sustainability duty. Helpfully, under the Lazarowicz Bill last year,
there were significant improvements in administration&#151;for
example, of the renewables obligation certificates scheme.</div>
<a name="08020611000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The five options that have been
raised over the past few months are these. The first route is a
sustainability duty, which is primary to an economic duty. The second
route is the concept that Ofcom has, which is that you have a citizens
duty, as well as your consumer one. Ofcom appears to manage that very
well; it appears to understand how it would handle conflicts between
the citizen and the consumer, and it has a route march setting out how
conflicts should be resolved. The third route would be to use
additional guidance. That may be something that the Government may want
to consider.</div> <a name="08020611000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
fourth route would be to look at our secondary duties. Currently, our
primary duty is to promote and protect the consumer effectively
wherever possible, through competition in the markets. Our secondary
duty tells us that that we have to be mindful of a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column40" />Column number: 40</div>certain group of consumers&#151;vulnerable consumers. Particularly
highlighted are the elderly and those who live in rural areas. Perhaps
you want to revisit that&#151;for example, by considering whether
children should be included in that category. When I was speaking to
the Scottish Affairs Committee on fuel poverty in
Scotland, that certainly seemed to concern them. Finally, you have the
reinstatement as a secondary duty of sustainability.</div>
<a name="08020611000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think those are your five
models. I believe that Ofgem currently can carry out its functions with
the duties and roles that you have given us; but clearly, it is going
to be something that you want to debate quite actively in the next few
months.</div><a name="08020611000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Winser:</b></i> Our view is that the current provisions are
probably there or thereabouts. There might be a
question about interpretation of them. Certainly,
Ofgem has moved towards taking forward the responsibilities for
sustainability, and we applaud that. That may have a bit to go,
considering the scale of the task ahead of
us.</div><a name="08020611000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is also a
question about the interpretation in terms of time. Looking a long way
ahead, we would quite like to see Ofgem&#151;we are working closely
with Alistair&#146;s people on this&#151;take a long view and think
about where the carbon and renewables targets might be leading us and
ensure that we are together and making the right regulatory changes to
ensure that we can get to those targets in the long term. It is about
looking a long way
ahead.</div><a name="08020611000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
83</b><a name="08020611000445"></a><b class="B">Paddy
Tipping</b> (Sherwood) (Lab): Mr. Buchanan, you
gave a curtain-raiser to your appearance before the Committee today in
an interview with the <i class="I">Daily Record</i>&#151;I think that it is
headlined &#147;Power to the People&#148;&#151;in which you said
that customers in Scotland could save &#163;200 million by switching,
which you advocate. You also advocate better targeting and
identification of customers at risk and better welfare rights advice.
By contrast, Mr. Asher, you are keen to see social tariffs,
which already exist on a voluntary basis, put on a mandatory footing.
Which is the better way to go
forward?</div><a name="08020611000039"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Alan
Asher:</b></i> From my point of view, I should like to praise
companies such as British Energy&#151;Scottish Energy, as it trades
as in Scotland&#151;and EDF Energy that are doing some really
excellent things in social tariffs. Scottish Power has announced that
it is introducing a social tariff, although, sadly, it is for only
those over 60, but the rest of the companies are doing not very much at
all. Some are spending a tiny sum: npower, for example, is spending
less than 4 per cent. of all the money that is going into social
tariffs. It has said plainly and publicly that it just will not do it
unless it is required to.</div>
<a name="08020611000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed, until
now, even British Gas and EDF have said, &#147;We just can&#146;t
stick at these voluntary contributions. If the other companies are
going to undercut us in the market, we will have to withdraw these
really good social tariffs.&#148; I fear that for the Committee, this
is one of the last chances. If Parliament says to suppliers, &#147;We
think that two doing something and one doing a little bit is
enough&#148;, the good social tariffs that we see in the market will
soon disappear. Companies will get the view that all is okay, and they
can go home until next time. However, if the Committee were to insert
just an enabling power&#151;not to impose anything, but just so 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column41" />Column number: 41</div>that Parliament has the power if the companies start to pull out and
leave consumers in the lurch&#151;that would make all the
difference.</div><a name="08020611000041"></a>

84</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000446"></a>Paddy
Tipping:</b> May I ask Mr. Buchanan for his
comments?</div><a name="08020611000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Al</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">i</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">stair
Buchanan:</b></i> There were two parts to the question. We
are very keen to take the switching message to Scotland, and I know
that Allan is as well. Switching in Scotland tends to run 2 to 3 per
cent. below the 18 per cent. churn that there was last year in England.
One of the substantial problems there is the housing issue. Housing
renovation typically costs 10 times more with some of the poorly
insulated housing in
Scotland.</div><a name="08020611000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Looking at
fuel poverty, there are three elements to it&#151;50 per cent. is
income, 15 per cent. is housing and 35 per cent. is the fuel bill. I am
not trying to belittle the fuel bill, but it must be taken
holistically. We are representing what we can do. We want to facilitate
the opportunity to switch on the fuel price side. Clearly, housing and
income sit with the Government and the instruments that they have.
Taking Government as a lead into the targeting issue, it is extremely
difficult to target the fuel
poor.</div><a name="08020611000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Warm Front
programme ensures that one third of the fuel poor do not have access to
it, which is an alarming statistic. With that in mind, Ofgem has
launched a very good initiative with Citizens Advice&#151;I have some
of the guff with me&#151;to ensure that its staff are well trained,
so that they can ensure that they get people to get the best deal. Part
of the problem is the confusion about what is the best deal. We have
also funded research with Bristol university, ward by ward throughout
the country, to try to analyse, through what we call our find
and fix programme, who the fuel poor are.</div>
<a name="08020611000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some practical issues could be
addressed, such as returning to the days when a Department for Work and
Pensions secondee would visit a fuel-poor person with the local
company. Some macro issues, such as smart metering, can be addressed,
and I hope that they will be. There will be a debate about social
tariffs; but holistically, if you consider equalising the tariff, or
setting a particular tariff for the fuel poor, it will be worth
inquiring into how many people that might tip into fuel poverty. If you
add a certain amount, assuming you do not expect the companies to pay
for it, in which case I am sure that you spoke to them this morning and
asked them to do so, it will be worth inquiring into how much more it
will cost everybody else and what implications it will have for fuel
poverty.

<div class="Column"><a name="Column42" />Column number: 42</div><a name="08020611000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">To Allan Asher of energywatch,
we asked about social tariffs, and I said that it spent tens of
millions on social tariffs, to which he said, &#147;Yes, but we spend
billions on energy efficiency, and isn&#146;t the most important
thing for the fuel poor not to give them more money to pay high bills,
or to make them pay slightly less, so that they pay less when they heat
the open air, but to spend billions on energy efficiency? And
aren&#146;t social tariffs therefore a distraction?&#148; In that
sequence, can you respond to those two questions?</div>
<a name="08020611000049"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Al</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">i</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">stair
Buchanan:</b></i> I am very happy to do so. You may have
noticed that we were invited to see the Chancellor a few weeks ago, and
the letter that was sent to us invited us to address what we called a
shopping list of ideas on fuel poverty, so it is encouraging that the
Chancellor wants to consider those issues. Among our shopping list were
to get smart metering rolling, to examine the DWP&#146;s work with
companies on the ground, to get the Minister to join Ofgem when it
hosts a fuel poor summit&#151;we are delighted that he will join us
in April&#151;and finally, an idea that was not new.</div>
<a name="08020611000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">We published the idea in April
2006 at the time of the energy White Paper. I was invited to offer
ideas, and we took the idea that we offered in April 2006, which was
that if the companies have been given a vast amount of free hand-out
because of the EU ETS free hand-out scheme&#151;and they have
been&#151;is there any opportunity for the Government to use some of
it for fuel poverty? The answer may be no. I do not know whether the
Government can do it; there may be issues about hypothecation, but that
is not my problem. We gave an idea. We are not a lobby group, but a
statutory organisation, and I am not lobbying for that idea. However,
it is an idea, and it was part of the shopping list that we gave the
Chancellor a few weeks ago.</div>
<a name="08020611000051"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Allan
Asher:</b></i> Ten seconds on that question, and then I shall
turn to the question that you asked me. The &#163;9 billion is not
the companies&#146; money but consumers&#146;
money. That is where it comes from. In a highly
competitive market, the companies should be investing that &#163;9
billion on low-carbon infrastructure, as intended, and nobody would
complain if they did that. However, it is obvious that some companies
are returning material portions of the money to shareholders. That
should not be happening. The money should be competed away, and in an
efficient market they would not have to claw it back, because
competition would force them to lower their prices. In a competitive
market, companies would not be able to get away with giving
shareholders sums of money above the long-term average cost of
production of the
power.</div><a name="08020611000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
question, which is on social tariffs, is an important one. Again, the
companies are not spending billions on energy efficiency. The money
comes from consumers. It is part of the energy
efficiency commitment, which is a sum levied on everyone in this room
who pays gas and electricity bills, and it is going up to around
&#163;60 per consumer. It will come from us, and the companies will
direct it more or less to energy efficiency
measures.</div><a name="08020611000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The scheme
has been really good. It has saved a huge amount of carbon, but do not
for a moment think that the money is company money&#151;it is
consumers&#146; money. Until now, there has been a target requirement
that about half of it should be spent on measures for fuel
poor customers: insulation, light globes and so on.
There will be a bit of a change in the future. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column43" />Column number: 43</div>money&#151;not all of it&#151;plays an important part in poverty
alleviation. It is highly complementary to social tariffs, not in
competition with
them.</div><a name="08020611000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are many
ways in which we currently levy consumers for various things. Consumer
prices, the climate change levy, the energy efficiency commitment and
the European energy trading scheme&#151;all of those come from
consumers. Why is it only when we talk about some direct sum to the
most grindingly poor in society that we find it offensive that money
should be directed to them? I am puzzled by
that.</div><a name="08020611000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
86</b><a name="08020611000448"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Alan Whitehead</b> (Southampton, Test) (Lab): I have some
questions on investment in transmission and in plant. First, clause 40
relates to offshore energy transmission and gives Ofgem several
responsibilities in respect of encouraging grid replacement and
enhancement on an offshore basis, particularly through offshore wind
renewables. Are you happy that the powers that the Bill provides are
sufficient to develop those processes in the time scale that is clearly
necessary?</div><a name="08020611000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
are you happy that the general imperative to increase investment,
particularly in large renewable plant, will be undertaken on the basis
of the present arrangements and brief of Ofgem, when probably at
present the quickest and most competitive replacement for plant that is
retiring is a combined cycle gas turbine power station with no combined
heat and power or any other saving device attached to it? The general
point of the question is whether the Bill is sufficient to enable the
shape of energy reinvestments to happen in the way that we now feel
that we need to direct
them.</div><a name="08020611000057"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Winser:</b></i> On the offshore transmission regime, we do
have concerns about the approach that is laid out in the Bill, which is
to auction the provision of offshore transmission. That has not been
done before. It seems to us that it is a complex, innovative and
uncertain way of approaching this task, which is very significant, as
the Committee will have discussed. Getting to the sort of level of
renewable deployment that we need to get to by 2020 needs some quick
and certain action. There has been talk of 33 GW of renewables
offshore. Twelve years is a blink of an eye against such a
challenge.</div><a name="08020611000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">In National
Grid&#146;s view, we need to deploy simple,
co-ordinated, well tried and tested, regulated
transmission build. In short, we do not think that the proposed
approach to auction transmission offshore is going to be quick, certain
or in customers&#146; best interests. We do not think that it will
help us to get to the carbon targets. We think that it will introduce
delay. It would be better merely to extend the regulated transmission
provision offshore for ourselves and for the Scottish transmission
companies.</div><a name="08020611000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Al</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">i</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">stair
Buchanan:</b></i> May I start with an overview in respect of
your concern about whether Ofgem can handle the new challenges? Over
the past five years, we have shown in our price control decisions that
we are very minded to the renewable task. In the price control review
of 2004, on the local electricity network, we increased capital
expenditure by 50 per cent. In the transmission price-control
review&#151;National Grid&#146;s review, two
years ago&#151;we increased capital expenditure by nearly 100 per
cent. The renewable elements within that have been clearly identified,
and if they are such a large sum, we actually set the sums of money
aside for that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column44" />Column number: 44</div>project. So there are four projects, effectively all in Scotland, under
the banner of transmission of renewable projects, for which the
consumer is going to provide &#163;560 million in addition to our
normal five-year price control review. So we are extremely minded to
it.</div><a name="08020611000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Crudely, I believe
that Ofgem, as an organisation, has been able to evolve because we have
gone from the privatisation compact of &#147;RPI minus x equals
save&#148; to &#147;RPI minus x equals spend&#148; to ensure that
we have a reliable, trustworthy and renewable connected network that
the consumers want. I feel confident about that.</div>
<a name="08020611000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the specifics of the
offshore regime, the Minister put his stamp on the
non-exclusive competitive approach in March last year. The structure is
now in place.</div> <a name="08020611000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
answer your excellent questions as a business manager, yes, I am
pleased that we have got the powers that we need to be able to do our
job as set out in the Bill, which means that we will be able to push
this forward quickly. I am also pleased that it is going to be paid
for, so there will be no worry about administration costs dragging down
the
process.</div><a name="08020611000063"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Smith:</b></i> I should just like to make a couple of points
about what happens when the transmission hits shore and becomes part of
the distribution system. The build will be in remote places. We will,
at the same time, have to look at our distribution network and whether
we need to beef up the network or put new networks in
place.</div><a name="08020611000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">I had a
conversation in this room a couple of weeks ago on the Planning Bill.
These things need to sit hand in hand, because we cannot end up with
wholesale pieces of the network sitting in planning for long periods.
We also have a major skills shortage, and we need to address it. It is
all about considering a series of stacking issues, rather than just
focusing on one level of
investment.</div><a name="08020611000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
87</b><a name="08020611000449"></a><b class="B">Anne
Main</b> (St. Albans) (Con): I should like to take you back to
two things on your shopping list: smart metering and fuel poverty. Are
you disappointed that they are not included in the Bill? Following on
from that, you mentioned that some 52 per cent. have switched their
energy tariffs between providers. Have you done any analysis of that?
Because having mentioned that statistic, you threw in the fact that the
most disadvantaged&#151;still the most disadvantaged&#151;were
those on pre-paid meters up north somewhere, I think that is what you
said. Have you analysed who is switching? If so, is this something to
do with access to the internet or information or just being savvy
enough to negotiate a complex system of tariffs? I would like to bring
the two things together and ask if the lack of smart metering in the
Bill is something that you feel is a lost opportunity to allow more
people perhaps to switch tariffs or to engage with the best
tariffs?</div><a name="08020611000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08020611000450"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Who would like to take that
question?</div><a name="08020611000067"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Alistair
Buchanan</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">:</b></i> I am happy to start the
answer to that question.</div>
<a name="08020611000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">A few weeks ago in Parliament,
Paddy Tipping hosted a meeting on smart metering. The reason I start by
referring to that meeting is that I might have been unhappy at the lack
of smart metering in the Bill had I not gone to that meeting. At the
meeting, the director general of energy at the Department for Business,

<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 45</div>Enterprise and Regulatory Reform made it quite clear that the Government
will make a statement on smart metering in the near future. Therefore,
I am excited by the fact that a statement will be made on smart
metering at some stage in the near future.</div>
<a name="08020611000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ofgem has an open position on
this issue. We favour the introduction of smart metering. There are two
models that have been put on the table; what is called the franchise
model, and the market mandate model. We favour the market mandate
model, but we are particularly keen to see a decision made on this
issue. Clearly, to an extent the decision and the timing of the
decision might be confused by the two-year pilot scheme that Ofgem is
currently running, but I was very encouraged by the announcement at
that meeting.</div> <a name="08020611000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
answer your switching question, and I am sure that Allan has even more
up-to-date data than I have, you are absolutely right; around that
central figure, there is a range of very interesting issues. One such
issue is that, on gas pre-payment meters, the level is down at about 36
per cent. We must think about how we address that.</div>
<a name="08020611000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of vulnerable and
fuel-poor people, you get quite an interesting range around that
figure. On the latest data that I looked at before coming out here this
afternoon, single mothers with dependent children are switching above
that level, whereas elderly people are switching below that level. So,
it is difficult to make generalisations once you start to break the
data down to see which part of the vulnerable customer group does not
appear to be taking advantage of this opportunity. We have to look at
the breakdown of that data and see how we can access those people who
are not doing so.</div>
<a name="08020611000072"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Allan
Asher:</b></i> We say &#147;smarter metering&#148; rather
than &#147;smart meters&#148;, because we are not referring to a
lump of technology. Instead, smarter metering is the process of
equipping consumers with much better and much deeper
information about the services that they acquire, with up-to-date
information on prices and quantity, the ability to have time-of-day
tariffs, accurate bills and all of that. Most likely, it will be
provided by a lump of hardware somewhere, but the point is the services
offered by smarter metering and not the machine.</div>
<a name="08020611000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key for us, though, is that
smarter metering allows us to do two hugely important things. First, we
will at last be able to get rid of what I think are these dreaded
&#147;poor pay more&#148;, or PPM, meters; you might know them as
pre-payment meters, but we know them as the &#147;poor pay
more&#148; meters. I gave you the example in the north of people
having to pay &#163;486 a year more if they happen to be trapped with
a PPM rather than being able to get somebody&#146;s internet tariffs.
That would disappear overnight; you would be able to switch from one
tariff form to another.</div>
<a name="08020611000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">There would be lots of other
switching blocks as well. At the moment, if you are in debt you cannot
switch and there are millions of consumers in that situation,
especially if you are in Scotland. If you have a telemeter, that is a
technology whereby hundreds of thousands of people simply cannot
switch. We know that the elderly do not switch, and we know that
anybody on a pre-payment meter cannot switch using the website. Six
million people are prevented from effective switching. Smarter metering
solutions will tend to make a lot of that switching easier.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 46</div><a name="08020611000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is also what I consider to be the clearly emerging evidence from around
the world that shows that, if consumers get this accurate, timely
information about their consumption and their options, they will use
less energy. People respond positively. At the moment, however, one in
three of our current bills are wrong, because they are based on an
estimate of consumption and not on an accurate read.</div>
<a name="08020611000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">How can people make the market
work, or how can they conserve energy, if the information is so poor? I
received my own bill yesterday. The last four bills that I have had for
gas were based on estimates, even though I have an outside meter. I
have no idea what my actual expenditure was. Smarter metering would
almost immediately eliminate that as long as there is also a preference
for eliminating pre-payment
meters.</div><a name="08020611000077"></a>

88</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000451"></a>Anne
Main:</b> A sub-question on that. You mentioned your four
times estimated gas bill, and gas comes up regularly as an issue. Do
any of you have views on electricity display devices being a possible
distraction to moving forward to smart
metering?</div><a name="08020611000078"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Allan
Asher:</b></i> I just observe that the data that the EDD
gives you is only about electricity. It does not have current prices
and it cannot give you access to new prices or energy-saving tariffs.
It can be costly and it certainly will be a big diversion on suppliers.
I think that consumers who want EDDs should be able to buy them. But
why should there be a tax on consumers to install in all homes devices
that do not meet any of the tests when there is a roll-out of meters?
It is a huge waste of money and, I fear, a huge diversion in the debate
when we should be focusing on getting things right and making the
market
work.</div><a name="08020611000079"></a>

89</b><a name="08020611000453"></a><b class="B">John
Robertson</b> (Glasgow, North-West) (Lab): I would like you to
explain the &#163;60 that the consumer is paying? Do the companies
claim that they are spending the &#163;60 or do they accept that the
&#163;60 comes from the consumers? If so, should the &#163;60 from
the consumer be matched by the companies to ensure that there is proper
development of energy-efficient designs and energy-efficient housing
and so
on?</div><a name="08020611000081"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Allan
Asher:</b></i> The current sum is more like &#163;30, and
it comes from what is called the energy efficiency commitment. We are
just finishing the last phase of that and then it will change into a
new scheme in which the commitment will double to &#163;60 per
customer for two fuels. As part of their licences to operate, the
companies are required to commit a certain sum, averaged out at that,
on measures for home insulation, energy efficiency, advice and various
other things. It is not disclosed separately. Perhaps there is a case
for that, but currently it is not.</div>

90</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000454"></a>John

What are you doing to ensure that there is some kind of visibility for
the money that is taken from customers that is then supposedly matched
by companies, and how do you ensure that the money is invested in a
proper
manner?</div><a name="08020611000083"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Alistair
Buchanan</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">
</b></i>There are a number of issues there. Let me
start with our administration role. We administer the energy efficiency
commitment, the carbon emissions reduction target scheme and the
renewables 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 47</div>scheme. That is not what you would regard as a regulator&#146;s job
because it is more like an auditor&#146;s job but I believe that we
do it very well. On behalf of consumers, we have to ensure that those
markets are administered fairly and according to the law. We also have
to ensure, as best we can, that there is no fraud in those markets
because large sums of money are involved. That is a very important act
that we do on behalf of the consumer. We are also keen to ensure that
the consumer has that information. One of the issues with regard to the
price increases that consumers had to endure in January is that perhaps
for the first time they are having to address the fact that they are
paying for renewable environmental schemes. Some &#163;80 of roughly
&#163;1,000 dual fuel average household bill is now a combination of
ROC, which is about &#163;10, your energy efficiency, which is about
&#163;35 to &#163;36, and your European Union Greenhouse Gas
Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS), which is around &#163;30. So, it is
very much part of your bill, and there is only one way that that is
going, and that is up. The ROC will go from &#163;10 today to
&#163;21 by 2019 or 2020. I am not saying whether it is a good or bad
thing. This is Government policy. I believe that consumers are starting
to address what they are paying for. Allan raises a very reasonable
issue, which is whether the companies start to put that on the Bill. As
an aside, in my previous job, when I used to be involved with and
follow German events, there was a German company called EnBW&#151;one
of Germany&#146;s big four companies. It tried to put environmental
taxes on to its bill and the Government passed an action to make sure
that it could not. At that time, in 2001, it was an uncomfortable, high
profile issue that the German Government did not want on the bill.
Maybe its time has come,
however.</div>

distribution and transmission in the
UK?</div><a name="08020611000094"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Winser:</b></i> From a transmission perspective, we would
expect to see a substantial increase in flows from the north of the
country to the south coming out of the encouragement of
renewables, in particular wind power and offshore wind. We are
projecting a very substantial increase in flows north to south. That is
the predominant flow and has been for many decades. The demand centres
are in the south and a large number of the renewables will be very
remote from that. We are projecting those increases and we are working
with Ofgem with regard to which projects should go ahead now to
reinforce the transmissions systems to carry those flows. We are also
going to work with Alistair&#146;s people on what other project
should be built ahead of the demand to make sure that renewables can
come on quickly.</div>
<a name="08020611000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">A large
number of renewables are held up in planning&#151;about 70 per
cent.&#151;and hopefully the Planning Bill will address that. The
next problem will be getting enough transmission capacity to get them
to the load centres.</div>
<a name="08020611000096"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Smith:</b></i> The other interesting challenge that we
face&#151;to a greater extent than the rest of Europe due to our
large population growth&#151;is that large population centres have
grown up. That has a knock-on effect for the distribution network. The
transmission system is pushing south. There are large new centres
coming on line, particularly in east Anglia, which has not got large
amounts of wire. We have remote energy generation in terms of offshore,
and possibly nuclear. We have the North sea coast, the Teesside wind
farm and so on, so a lot of work will have to happen to strengthen the
existing network or to put in new build. If we take the example of
Beauly, we know that it can take an awfully long time. That started in
2001, but will not come on until at least 2012, so the plans are long
term.</div><a name="08020611000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
96</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000461"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> This is more a question for Mr. Smith
than for Mr. Winser, because it is about distribution at a
local level. If there were a radical shift towards a more distributed
system and if there were 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 49</div>more geothermal heat substituting for gas, more
small-scale community combined heat and power, wind power coming on
stream or more tidal flow in various locations, could your members cope
with the pace of change that we are probably looking for, or does more
need to be done in the Bill or
elsewhere?</div><a name="08020611000098"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Smith:</b></i> No. There are a couple of things that we
talked about. The Planning Bill is important, and there is still a big
skills issue that we must address. We need people who can build the
network. The majority of it was built during the 1950s and 1960s, and
those people are retired or coming up to retirement. We have a big
plan, and we are already doing a lot of work on building the skills and
getting the right people.</div>
<a name="08020611000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is an
issue with the price of copper, and ensuring that we have the necessary
plant and equipment because 30 or 40 years ago, we probably had three,
four or five manufacturers in the UK, but they are no longer based
here, so we need long-term plans for 10, 15 or 20 years out to ensure
that we have the right equipment, the right people and the right
profiling to get everything in
place.</div><a name="08020611000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
97</b><a name="08020611000462"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Hugo Swire</b> (East Devon) (Con): The discussion has moved on
a bit, but I want to revert to something that Mr. Asher said
about prepay meters and the way in which companies are
behaving. Have you ever encountered&#151;or is this a common
problem&#151;consumers who pay by direct debit and have variable
bills, and the companies stack up the direct debits and do not
volunteer to return the money immediately, so the consumer has to
prompt the provider to return it or to discount it from the next
bill?</div><a name="08020611000101"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Allan
Asher:</b></i> Yes, we receive thousands of complaints a year
about such issues. There are requirements in the rules that if someone
has built up a credit, they should be able to get it back within, I
think, seven days. Some companies have been rather tardy about
that.</div><a name="08020611000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The bigger
problem was&#151;it is now reducing&#151;that some people did not
get a bill for two, three or four and on one occasion
seven years, and but then got a demand for immediate payment. I am
pleased that Ofgem has now outlawed that, and if a bill has not been
sent out for more than a year, that is too bad and the company cannot
recover the money. That has led to huge improvements, but there is,
sadly, still the administrative problem of tardiness in paying money
back. However, it is a reducing a
problem.</div><a name="08020611000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
98</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000463"></a>Mr.
Swire:</b> But should it be incumbent on the provider to
reimburse the consumer after a certain number of days,
regardless?</div><a name="08020611000104"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Allan
Asher:</b></i> Absolutely. If you have overpaid for something
in any other marketplace, you would expect an immediate refund. There
is no reason why you should not expect that here. Some people are happy
to build up a credit, because it is a bit of a cushion into the winter
months, but that should be at the wish of the consumer. If someone
wants to do that, they should be allowed to do so; if they want their
money back, they should get it back promptly and without
fuss.</div><a name="08020611000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">

there is a serious complaint by a consumer, and it is not
handled properly by the company on the

20 per cent. by 2020 target will be hit if the Government intend to use
secondary legislation to control the renewables

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08020611000468"></a>The

like to
answer?</div><a name="08020611000112"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Winser:</b></i> I am not sure that I can address the point
about secondary legislation, but the 2020 target is certainly
challenging from an engineering perspective. There is an awful lot to
do. We will need the Planning Bill and strong incentives. We will need
simple, clean structures and organisational models to get it done. It
is an incredibly challenging target for 12
years.</div>
<a name="08020611000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
102</b><a name="08020611000469"></a><b class="B">Albert
Owen</b> (Ynys M&#244;n) (Lab): I have two brief points.
First, Mr. Buchanan, I hold the citizens advice bureau in
high esteem, but is it really its duty to inform people about
switching, or is it the regulator&#146;s duty to simplify the process
on switching? The buck seems to be being passed to a voluntary
organisation when the regulator should take a more robust
role.</div><a name="08020611000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, on
distribution and the location of some of the wind farms that you said
were in isolated and often sensitive areas, will there be additional
costs in getting the transmission of some of the northerly ones on to
the grid system? Will Mr. Buchanan, and possibly
Mr. Smith, address those
points?</div><a name="08020611000115"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Al</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">i</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B">stair
Buchanan:</b></i> In terms of our working
relationship with the CAB, I believe, from all the comments I have had
from my team, that the relationship is working very well on both sides.
For us and energywatch, the key is to ensure that we can help to get
information to consumers. The CAB has to deal with those issues. As for
the extent to which its staff are trained to a level at which they feel
confident and comfortable with handling these issues, ultimately
anything that we can do to help must be a good idea. Clearly,
energywatch does a lot on that, as will the new National Consumer
Council.</div><a name="08020611000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
transmission costs, yes, there is a range of transmission costs. As you
know, throughout the past 20 years, the system has been based on the
concept of locational charging. The further from demand you are, the
higher the cost will be. There are issues regarding how the methodology
works and how it is explained to potential builders of and investors in
wind farms. For example, I spent an interesting week in the Hebrides in
September, when there was a lot of discussion about the connection to
the Orkneys. The charge for connection to Skye&#151;I am going to use
figures to give an example&#151;was around &#163;24 a kW. The
charge for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 51</div>connection to Orkney changed while I was there from &#163;114, which
no one could really understand in relation to the price on Skye, to
&#163;76. It changed again, because of the question about what kind
of standard is needed&#151;N1 or N2. Those are technical standards
from the grid company. The price might be a lot lower depending on what
standard is used.</div>
<a name="08020611000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part of the issue&#151;we
have discussed this with National Grid&#151;is the degree of
confusion about how the system works and whether the methodology is
clear enough. On the back of that, we announced a major corporate
governance review at the end of last year, which is to open up the
rules and regulations within this sector. We are currently receiving
feedback from that, and when we have a chance to digest it, we will
have to work out how to take the project forward. The national grid
will be very important in that regard. You have put your finger on an
area of great concern, not only about the charge, but about how we get
there. What does it mean? When will it change? Those are the things
that we need to address going
forward.</div><a name="08020611000118"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Winser:</b></i> I was just going to add that, yes, additional
transmission infrastructure will be needed. It sort of depends on where
the renewables are, especially if a lot of them are up around the north
of England, or Scotland and above. It is worth bearing in mind
that the part of the bill that constitutes transmission is only about 3
per cent. of consumers&#146; bills. Even though we will do quite a
lot of work to reinforce the system, it is spread quite thinly across
the charging base, at about 3 per cent., so I do not think that it will
make a material difference to
customers.</div><a name="08020611000119"></a>

I should tell the Committee that the description in the papers in front
of us for Dr. Mike Weightman is not accurate. So, gentlemen, could you
please introduce
yourselves?</div><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr. Ian

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
103</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000471"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:</b> As you might know, I have been persuaded that
nuclear should be part of the future energy mix. Do you accept that
there is widespread public suspicion and distrust of the nuclear
industry and its secrecy? If so, how do you think that we can create
greater transparency in order to win public confidence at a time of
concern about safety and
security?</div><a name="08020611000125"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Mike Weightman:</b></i> I would use slightly different
terminology. From a regulatory point of view, the industry must earn
the public&#146;s trust, as too must the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 52</div>regulator in its regulatory arrangements and its
fulfilment of them. We have been pushing the industry to do more on
that, particularly in relation to new build. Indeed, over the last few
months, we have arranged with them to put their safety cases into the
public domain, to invite comments from the public and to answer them.
We are overseeing that process. When we come to our views about the
various steps that we are looking at under the generic design
assessment, we will take account of its approach when putting forward
our independent view. For me it is not only about informing the public;
we also have to earn their trust. I think that that is a crucial
component of our thinking, as
regulators.</div><a name="08020611000126"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Parker:</b></i> On behalf of the NIA, which represents
companies throughout the industry, I think that what the Minister says
is broadly correct. In the past, there has been a degree of public
suspicion of the industry. It has not been entirely trusted and has had
a reputation for secrecy for reasons that I think are broadly
historical. It came from its sort of military background. There were
instances of apparent cover-ups in the past. I think that the
perception of the industry has changed quite significantly in the past
few years, and certainly the industry itself is going out of its way to
engage much more readily with the public and moving away from a
situation in which it just spoke to itself because it felt very
comfortable doing that. We are going out and debating the issues,
putting our case in public forums. That willingness to engage has
improved people&#146;s perception of the industry and their
understanding of the case for
nuclear.</div><a name="08020611000127"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Ian Roxburgh:</b></i> May I add one small comment? As the
Minister will know, it is part of the NDA&#146;s remit that we are
bound to be open and transparent. We were meant to represent a break
with the past, and I think that in large part that has been achieved.
It is also fair to say that the communities that we work in are
actually quite comfortable with matters nuclear as a general rule. We
have two Members on the Committee here today, Jamie
Reed and Albert Owen, who represent constituencies that are lobbying
the NDA quite hard that they should not be left out of the possibility
of site review for new nuclear plants, so there is another side
to
it.</div><a name="08020611000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
104</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000472"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> Could you tell us what your current thinking is
about the potential life extensions of the current fleet of nuclear
power stations, so that we can have an accurate understanding of when
they may come out of commission? Also, do you agree with me that, if
there is going to be a new fleet of nuclear reactors, it will be viable
only if a number are built to the same design, rather than one of one
design, one of another and two of another, and that we therefore need
to break from the tradition that we have had in this country? Do you
also agree that in the design approval process, we should not add on a
huge amount of extra work and cost, as happened with Sizewell B and
elsewhere and in Finland, which would make them essentially
unaffordable?</div><a name="08020611000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08020611000473"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Who would like to answer
that?</div><a name="08020611000130"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Spence:</b></i> The question of life extension is clearly one
that I should respond to, as we operate the gas-cooled reactors and
pressurised water reactor. We have made our corporate strategy clear:
to seek to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 53</div>life-extend those stations as long as we can, provided
that we can convince ourselves that it is safe,
technically feasible and economic to do so. Since our restructuring we
have reviewed the options for life extension for Dungeness and, mostly
recently, for Hinkley and Hunterston. In the case of Dungeness, we
extended it from 2008 to 2018. For Hinkley and Hunterston, which were
scheduled to close in 2011, we have announced a further five-year
extension to 2016. We expect to review the position for the next two
stations that are due to close, Hartlepool and Heysham 1, which are due
to close in 2014. We expect to review that three years before closure
date and form a view at that point about whether there is further
possible life extension of those
stations.</div><a name="08020611000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
pick up your second question, about standardisation, one feature of our
current fleet is that, although they are all called advanced gas-cooled
reactors, they are all subtly different, or in some cases markedly
different. We are on record in a number of places as saying that we
think it will be extremely desirable for the UK to adopt designs that
are like international designs and drive, as far as we possibly can,
for those stations to be built to a standard, accepted international
design. We believe that that offers the greatest margin of safety and
the greatest prospect of attractive
economics.</div><a name="08020611000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08020611000474"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Would anyone else like to
respond?</div><a name="08020611000133"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Mike Weightman:</b></i> If I may answer from a nuclear
regulatory perspective, clearly the operators will have to demonstrate
that the life extension that they propose is safe.
There will be some technical limitations on issues such as graphite
cores, which we will have to consider very carefully to ensure that we
have the confidence on those life extensions. I need to be sure that
Members are aware that there are various steps to go through to secure
approval, so that we protect the people of the UK. Similarly, on taking
forward standardised designs&#151;I shall not comment on the
commercial aspects of that, but merely on nuclear
safety&#151;clearly, if you have a replicated fleet then you can
learn more from events that occur across that fleet, because they will
be equally applicable to all the stations. So there are some safety
benefits from that.</div>
<a name="08020611000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of the design approval
process, it is clear under international conventions&#151;and,
indeed, under the International Atomic Energy Agency
safety standards&#151; that nuclear safety is a national
responsibility. We are set up to protect the people and society in the
UK, and we have to fulfil that duty.</div>
<a name="08020611000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">That does not
mean to say that we do not take account of other nuclear regulators
worldwide. Indeed, we have good relationships on a bilateral basis and
a multilateral basis, and more is being done at international level to
secure greater co-operation. However, some of the changes in design
that occur from country to country reflect some of those national
concerns. We know that the Finns have different concerns to the French,
but also some of those changes reflect different operators. Some of the
changes in Finland in the finished design of the European pressurised
reactor compared with the French design are to do with the operator
wanting to gain access to some of the areas, which meant that they had
to be reassessed. Indeed, there will be a third variant of that design
which has gone into the US system as well.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 54</div><a name="08020611000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a more complex picture
than just a regulator being imposed on some things. Clearly in the UK
we have looked at our safety standards recently, reviewing them against
the IAEA safety standards themselves, so that we have an international
underpinning of ours. Perhaps we can go forward on a more firm basis
than just looking at our own standards.</div>
<a name="08020611000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
105</b><a name="08020611000475"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Stephen Ladyman</b> (South Thanet) (Lab):
Clause 41 requires a costed programme of
decommissioning to be submitted when you apply to build a new nuclear
plant. First, are you all content that the framing of that clause and
associated clauses is sufficiently comprehensive to ensure that the
programme is robust? Secondly, what are the industry and the regulatory
side doing to ensure that you understand what will be involved in that
decommissioning, and the costs involved? Thirdly, what efforts are you
taking to ensure that you are learning from international experience,
in order to ensure that that costed programme is robust?</div>
<a name="08020611000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Last, but not least, in so far
as the regulator will have to oversee the process, and as you are
probably pretty stretched at the moment looking at safety cases and
given the relatively small number of people that you employ, what level
of your resources are you going to put into making sure that the
decommissioning plans are robust and well
costed?</div><a name="08020611000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08020611000476"></a>The
Chairman:</b> You have four questions, gentlemen. Who would
like to kick
off?</div><a name="08020611000140"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Ian Roxburgh:</b></i> I am prepared to be
brave&#151;probably braver than I should. The first point is that the
Government have made it clear that they are establishing what I
understand to be an advisory group, which is to work through the very
important issues that you have enumerated. We already have significant
experience. We have just heard from Mr. Hendry about
life extensions. The Nuclear Decommissioning
Authority has a duty to the Government to police those extensions, in
the sense that when approving an extension you must still be able to
meet the extra liabilities that accrue through the lifetime of that
extension. It must make good business sense, and the regulator has made
the point that it also has to make good safety sense.</div>
<a name="08020611000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">I personally am content. We
have a system that has already proven itself to be robust. We have the
nuclear liabilities fund. I have read these documents a couple of times
before, and I have skimmed them again; they ask the right questions. I
personally believe that it is a good approach that can
work.</div>
<a name="08020611000142"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Mike Weightman:</b></i> May I make a general comment, and
then try to answer the individual questions? We welcome the proposals
in the Bill. We feel that they make much more transparent and robust
the assurances on corporate finance, for instance, and matters that the
Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform considers at
present before granting a licence. So we think that they are a good
step forward.</div><a name="08020611000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
whether clause 41 provides enough areas or is sufficient, I think that
generally it is, without having looked at it in great detail. We have a
simple licence condition around decommissioning&#151;licence
condition 35&#151;that predominantly says that the licensee shall
have adequate arrangements for decommissioning, which embraces much of
this. We then look to them to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 55</div>develop around that. The Bill puts more structure
into that, so it is a good step forward. Generally, it makes the
assurances that we seek more transparent and
robust.</div><a name="08020611000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is
a costed programme robust? Well, things can change. The areas of the
Bill that provide for modification are very important. There are
sometimes unexpected events at plants, and that has to be taken into
account when you are thinking about decommissioning and the funding of
it. Clearly, there might be times when we would want to enforce
something on the site from a safety point of view, which might change
the approved decommissioning programme and the funding arrangements for
it. I am sure that BERR Ministers will ensure that safety and security
remain paramount in such circumstances and that the present robust,
independent regulatory system is not undermined or fettered in any
way.</div><a name="08020611000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we were asked to enforce some of these aspects&#151;we already
enforce some of them under the nuclear licensing conditions&#151;what
would the impact be on the limited resources that we have at present?
It all depends on how we go about it. There would be areas where there
would be some synergies with what we do now. When we inspect a site to
ensure that it is in line with the technical safety case, that is
similar to a technical case for decommissioning. We already cover
issues such as whether records are needed on the site. In some areas,
we could have synergies of approach. Resourcing would need to be
addressed, but we need to address it anyway. Perhaps the problem would
not be as large as one might otherwise
think.</div><a name="08020611000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we were
asked to look at financial aspects, clearly that is
not something that we have dealt with recently, although we did engage
in 1995-96 when British Energy was privatised with decommissioning and
segregated funds and assurances about financial
standing.</div><a name="08020611000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not know whether I have answered all four questions, but I have
tried to answer various aspects of
them.</div><a name="08020611000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
106</b><a name="08020611000477"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Brian Binley</b> (Northampton, South) (Con): May we pursue
this matter a little further? The Minister already spoke about
public perception. Frankly, this impacts on public perception big time,
and Members in particular know how volatile public perception can be,
so it matters to
us.</div><a name="08020611000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
management terms, a programme is only as good as the quality of the
people at its lowest level&#151;that goes without saying. Therefore,
monitoring is vital. You spoke about the robustness of the programmes,
but what levels of monitoring and review of the decommissioning
programme should the Minister put in place? What would you expect of
him and his team over time? Can I connect that issue with the skills
problem, which we have heard much about today? Do we have the people to
operate at the coal face who are of the quality that we would need to
ensure that the public can be reassured on every
occasion?</div><a name="08020611000150"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Mike Weightman:</b></i> Do you want me to discuss the
monitoring question
first?</div><a name="08020611000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08020611000478"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I think Mr. Parker looked as if he
wanted to take this
question.</div><a name="08020611000152"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Parker:</b></i> No, I was going to address the skills point.
We agree with the White Paper&#146;s analysis that there is a
challenge in recruiting people and developing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 56</div>the necessary skills for new
build, decommissioning, waste management&#151;the whole gamut of
nuclear activities. In relation to new build in particular, we are
making good progress. A couple of years ago, my organisation undertook
a study of the
UK&#146;s&#151;</div><a name="08020611000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"></b><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
107</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000479"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> I am talking particularly about the
decommissioning
programme.</div><a name="08020611000154"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Parker:</b></i> Yes, and Ian might want to talk about this as
well. A number of initiatives are going on to improve the skills
availability in decommissioning. Last week we saw the launch of the
national skills academy for nuclear. There are a number of initiatives,
in which the NDA is involved, to develop the skills that we need for
decommissioning our existing stations. I am sure that those skills will
also be available for the new build at the time when that is
happening.</div><a name="08020611000155"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Ian Roxburgh:</b></i> As you say, the NDA, along with others,
has facilitated the nuclear skills academy, which deals with NVQs and
HNDs up to basic degree level. Below that, we have
also put in place a reinforced apprentice training programme, and below
that we have engaged, to the tune of &#163;750,000, with the energy
foresight programme, which is a programme across 420 schools designed
to encourage children to take the necessary O and A-levels to make them
capable of taking advantage of training in the industry for
decommissioning and other aspects of engineering across the United
Kingdom. Talking about schoolchildren might seem strange, but given
that the programme has quite a long lead-in time and quite a long time
to go, it is very
relevant.</div><a name="08020611000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the other
extreme, we have arranged a partnership with the university of
Manchester&#151;with &#163;10 million from it and &#163;10
million from us&#151;to establish a new nuclear institute this year
to deal with postgraduate qualifications. We have also endowed two
chairs. We thought it proper to endow them, because then there can be
no question of the NDA exercising undue influence beyond the
establishment of the two chairs, one in nuclear materials science and
the other in decommissioning
engineering.</div><a name="08020611000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
two other initiatives running. One is to start our own graduate scheme.
We have just put out the first adverts and we have had more than 1,000
applications for 10 places, which suggests that young people see the
industry as having a future now. Perhaps a few years ago we would have
been hard pressed to muster a decent cohort of
applicants.</div><a name="08020611000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
also looking to facilitate across the industry all the existing schemes
to make sure that all graduates coming out from wherever have a basic
standard of proficiency, so that we can have mobility between schemes.
The Committee can be assured that a lot is going on and that there is a
lot of demand. The point about demand is important, because we are
determined that all the courses that we are helping to facilitate
should be demand led; they should be market
led.</div><a name="08020611000159"></a>

in place. What should our Minister do now to make sure he is monitoring
and reporting to the people that all is well and the decommissioning
programme is going as it should, because reassurance about the whole
process will be vital? What should the Minister be doing to ensure that
you are doing what you say you will do?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 57</div><a name="08020611000160"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr. Mike

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08020611000481"></a>Mr.

delighted.</div><a name="08020611000164"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Mike Weightman:</b></i> I would ask, first, whether you were
going for a prescriptive or a goal-setting regime,
because it matters greatly how you go about
monitoring and it also matters greatly what sort of people do that
monitoring. You can do it in various ways. If you go for detailed
prescriptive regulation, with a lot of guidance saying what they must
do at each stage, clearly you need a lot of people to monitor adherence
to that. Perhaps you do not need the same calibre of people if you take
a higher-level approach to looking at the management arrangements and
various programme aspects they put in place. That is the way that we
operate the nuclear regulatory system now. It is a goal-setting regime.
We use highly experienced and high-calibre people&#151;mid-career
normally; very well qualified engineers or scientists&#151;who
understand how projects run and can ask the really penetrating
questions about
that.</div><a name="08020611000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">It depends on
how the Minister wants to approach it, but there might be synergies
with the way in which we consider decommissioning programmes, because
there are legal requirements to follow decommissioning programmes,
too.</div>
<a name="08020611000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08020611000483"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Dr. Stephen Ladyman wants to come in briefly on
that precise point.</div>
<a name="08020611000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
109</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000484"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> The opponents of the nuclear power industry will
say that the Government are the funder of last resort
when safety matters are concerned, which is true of all
industries&#151;the Government are always the funder of last resort.
The question that the industry must answer, and we must answer for the
Bill, is, when a costed programme is put together, what assurance can
we give the public that it will meet the absolute costs of
decommissioning, so that it is unlikely that the Government would ever
have to step in and become a funder of last
resort?</div><a name="08020611000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08020611000485"></a>The

Roxburgh?</div>
<a name="08020611000169"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr. Ian
Roxburgh:</b></i> I am not going to answer it; I shall
refer to something that I said earlier. That issue is
readily addressed in the White Paper, where the Government recognise
that they must provide that assurance, hence the advisory group, which
would consider the minutiae of that warranty&#151;for want of a
better expression&#151;that you rightly require. I am comfortable
that there is enough skill in the marketplace for that committee to be
well advised and to come up with practical, deliverable
solutions.</div>
<a name="08020611000170"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr. Mike
Weightman:</b></i> One principle that you might need to
secure is openness and transparency in the monitoring function, so that
there is a wider view on it, too. That would provide some of the
assurance that you
seek.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 58</div><a name="08020611000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
110</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000486"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> The purpose of the White Paper, among other
things, was to set out the facilitative action that the Government
propose to take to reduce regulatory uncertainty, particularly
on nuclear decommissioning and potential nuclear new build. To
Mr. Parker and Mr. Spence in particular, do you
not think that although regulatory uncertainty may have been thereby
reduced, the amount of regulation, justification, site searching and
generic design assessment, not to mention the planning and building
processes, means that it will take so long to build new nuclear power
stations that the energy gap will have been filled by other forms of
energy, and that therefore nuclear might have missed the bus? Would you
prefer less regulation and more speed in the process, or do you think
that the balance is about right?</div>
<a name="08020611000172"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Spence:</b></i> In summary, the balance is about right,
provided we work through the regulations efficiently
and effectively. If I look back to the experience of Sizewell and
project it forward to where we might be today if we tried to go through
a programme for it without the changes that are laid out in the White
Paper, I would be very worried about the timetable. The proposals give
me the clarity, which I look for as an investor, about what we need to
do, the order in which we need to do it and the hurdles that we need to
go over, and it allows me to see a way in which I am asked once about
national need, rather than being re-asked in several
places&#151;similarly, on the questions about siting. So, from our
perspective, it looks a sensible and appropriate approach that can fill
the gap appropriately, rather than miss the
boat.</div>
<a name="08020611000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
111</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000487"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> To Dr. Roxburgh and Dr. Weightman, do you
consider that the prospective regulations on clean-up and new build,
particularly those in the Bill, such as the generic design assessments
and the number of people employed to undertake them, will evidently
lead to substantial delays? Do you consider the full weight of the
regulator process to be imperative, or is there a balance to be struck
between time scale and the weight of regulation as the process moves
forward?</div>
<a name="08020611000174"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr. Mike
Weightman:</b></i> Our duty is to protect people in society
in the UK. We will not shortcut the process if it means that we will
not deliver that. We have reviewed our approach and we now have the
generic design assessment. We have decided to go ahead with that and
believe that it will deliver safe reactors on a fleet basis across the
UK. We are not about rubber-stamping things or shortcutting to meet a
programme; we must ensure that things are seen and demonstrated to be
safe. We would be failing in our duty were we not to do
so.</div><a name="08020611000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is not to say
that we do not look to be more efficient and effective, and we look for
ways in which we can better serve the public. However, we will ensure
that the public have confidence in the safe future of any new reactor
programme. That means that we must work hard, as we are doing, and that
we intend to resource appropriately going forward.</div>
<a name="08020611000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not about shortcutting
things and doing things in a slapdash fashion, but it is also not about
not learning from nuclear regulators around the world and acting in
co-ordination with them. We are active with that at the moment. Indeed,
we have done some inspection with colleagues in France, Canada and the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 59</div>US, to look at their design organisations. Interestingly, they did not
do things that way in any of those countries, but ensuring that
designers of reactors have appropriate quality management systems and
systems for securing long-term resources, and that they have good
control over changes in design, is obvious for us. We work with others,
but there are things that we must do to ensure that the programme is
safe for UK people and society.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
112</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000488"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Given your confident reassurances and the
Minister&#146;s robust comments on Second Reading, I am clear that
things such as basic decommissioning, initial disposal, safety
monitoring and site clean-up are all covered within the funded
decommissioning programmes in the Bill. I wish to ask about three
specific costs, and I want you to tell me whether you are absolutely
sure that they are covered. First, is all long-term waste management
covered? Given that we are talking about nuclear waste, we are talking
about the very long term. Secondly, are the costs of any accidents or
insurance against accidents, if indeed they are insurable, covered?
Thirdly, is the cost&#151;I suppose that this question is for Dr.
Roxburgh and Dr. Weightman&#151;of your authorities and inspectorates
covered?</div><a name="08020611000178"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Ian Roxburgh:</b></i> Sorry, could you rephrase that last
question?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"></b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000489"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Are the costs of running your inspectorates and
authorities, which are, in a sense, a cost of the nuclear industry,
going to be covered by the funded decommissioning programmes, or by the
industry through any other mechanism in the
Bill?</div><a name="08020611000180"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Ian Roxburgh:</b></i> As I understand the White Paper, it
intends that the advisory body will include the cost of waste disposal
along with the cost of decommissioning, so the complete life cycle cost
would have to be
recovered.</div><a name="08020611000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
113</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000490"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Sorry, just to be clear, we are talking about the
Bill and not the White Paper. By long-term life cycle, do you mean
thousands of years in the future,
potentially?</div><a name="08020611000182"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Ian Roxburgh:</b></i> In the sense that once waste is placed
in a deep geological repository, I assume that it becomes a property of
the Government, or at least that it is on some sort of lease. That
issue is yet to be addressed, but the reality is that once the waste is
in a repository, it should be in a passive, safe form. I will not say
that age is immaterial, but that is the point about the repository: age
can be accommodated there.</div>
<a name="08020611000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
114</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000491"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> So you are expecting there to be no costs
attached to that that will not be
covered?</div><a name="08020611000184"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Ian Roxburgh:</b></i> You will have to ask the Government
about that.</div>

<a name="08020611000186"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr. Ian
Roxburgh:</b></i> In terms of the recovery of costs, that is
an interesting perspective. I do not know whether the advisory
committee will be asked to consider that. If it is, naturally we would
respond to any request for information that it made to
us.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 60</div><a name="08020611000187"></a>

accidents?</div><a name="08020611000188"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Mike Weightman:</b></i> There are provisions already
for insurance requirements under those conventions
and treaties. Under current nuclear installation legislation, BERR has
to ensure that sufficient insurance provision is available to meet
those treaties. There are some limitations to those insurance
requirements, which is an issue that perhaps the Minister might answer,
as you
say.</div><a name="08020611000189"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08020611000494"></a>Martin

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
116</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000495"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> According to the risk assessment by the
Government&#146;s own assessors, the key concern was that there was
still a risk that sufficient funds would not in practice be available
and that, in particular in a company undergoing a restructuring
programme, the assets could be diverted and be made unavailable to fund
a liability. It goes on to talk about issues such as liquidation and in
effect making the funds unavailable. Is that still a risk? The TUC and
the EEF this morning felt that, in the last resort, it still
was.</div><a name="08020611000193"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Spence:</b></i> As I understand the Bill, there are terms in
there to cover a situation in which there was insolvency and to ensure
that the funds that have been set aside for decommissioning and
management of waste are protected from the other creditors. I would,
therefore, see them as being
secure.</div><a name="08020611000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
117</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000496"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> But what if the funds are not actually
there?</div><a name="08020611000195"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Spence:</b></i> The requirement is to put them there during
or at the start of the operation of the station to ensure that they
are.</div><a name="08020611000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
118</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000497"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> So none of it would be dependent on cash flow, as
you understand
it?</div><a name="08020611000197"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Spence:</b></i> The component that would be put there during
subsequent operation would be to cover the increasing amount of waste
generated and potentially grow to cover the decommissioning liabilities
as required, so replacing insurance with cash over
time.</div><a name="08020611000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
119</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000498"></a>John
Robertson:</b> I wonder whether I could develop the waste
management point a bit further, because it is probably one of the most
contentious parts of nuclear energy. Do we think as a group that the
waste from new build should be separated from the old waste? Do you
think that reprocessing should form an important part of disposing of
or reusing waste? Furthermore, when disposing of waste, should we use
deep geological burial or put it in the ground so that it can be
retrieved and used for energy in the future, which some people believe
will become possible as technology becomes more efficient?</div>
<a name="08020611000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have one
other small question about the skills problem. What Dr. Roxburgh said
was really interesting. I think that it is great what you are doing
with universities 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column61" />Column number: 61</div>and schools. However, will it meet the needs that we
foresee in the near future? What happens to the apprenticeships for
local schools, because it is important that they are brought into the
equation? What happens with the manual labour also used? Will that be
looked at as well in order to bring in the local communities?</div>
<a name="08020611000200"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Spence:</b></i> May I take the last part of those questions
first? Dr. Roxburgh talked about what is being done
to ensure sufficient skills for decommissioning and waste management. I
could have echoed that by talking about what we are doing as a company
and as an operator of existing stations to ensure that we have the
graduate skills and craft skills available to operate the current fleet
of stations and be ready to operate new build. We have recruited
something of the order of 1,000 additional people into British Energy
in the past three years. Within that there are at least 150 apprentices
whom we are bringing in from around our stations, because we know that
we need those skills for existing operation and to allow us to be ready
when we need them for new
build.</div><a name="08020611000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a company,
we are looking forward and asking what skills we believe will be needed
and how many of those skills will be needed as construction programmes
start to happen, we hope, over the coming decade. We are looking to
build that pipeline to ensure that the local colleges are gearing up
and that GCSE courses in engineering at local schools are starting to
happen. Like the NDA, we are also building links to
universities. From where I am, we are laying the right foundations.
There is still more to be done, but there is time to do it as
well.</div><a name="08020611000202"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Ian Roxburgh:</b></i> Can I add a small point to that on
skills? I mentioned that we wanted everything that we were involved in
to be demand-led. If there were more demand, I would like to think that
those institutions that I just described would be flexible enough to
accommodate that new
demand.</div><a name="08020611000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the other questions, you first asked whether it should be separate from
the legacy wastes. By definition, given what is set out in the White
Paper, it would be for a period, because the planning presumption is
that it would be stored on site for a significant period. There would
be no question of mixing it back with the legacy waste, either
theoretically or in
fact.</div><a name="08020611000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">You talked about
retrieving waste. One decision that would need to be made about a
geological repository is what element of retrieval would be
appropriate. That might well be one issue that a community considering
volunteering would want to reflect
upon.</div><a name="08020611000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">You then asked
about reprocessing, and I think that that ties back into the point that
I have just made&#151;that you do not need to decide on reprocessing
in advance. If the fuel is stored and kept in good order, at any stage,
provided that it is retrievable, you can come back and see it as a
national resource at some time in the future. From the NDA&#146;s
point of view&#151;I suspect that the question is mine because we are
the only part of the UK that carries out
reprocessing&#151;our clear understanding has always been that any
new initiatives for reprocessing would be a matter for the Government,
and the Government in turn have made it clear that they would want to
consult widely on any such
proposal.</div><a name="08020611000206"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith

Government&#146;s view that if a deep geological

waste as well as legacy waste. I think that that makes sense. We agree
with the NDA&#146;s view that reprocessing would be subject to
another round of consultation, but we advocate keeping the option open,
which I think is what is stated in the White Paper. It should not be
foreclosed as an option for the
future.</div><a name="08020611000207"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
120</b><a name="08020611000499"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jamie Reed</b> (Copeland) (Lab): I have a few
questions&#151;first, for Mr. Parker and Mr.
Spence. Do you have any frustration at all with the Bill with regard to
other, non-nuclear electricity generating sources and the management
and funding of the intergenerational wastes that they produce,
particularly the radioactive wastes that the oil and gas sectors
produce during their extrapolation and use? Are you frustrated by the
way in which those sectors are not expected to fund their
intergenerational waste in the same way as the nuclear
industry?</div><a name="08020611000208"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Spence:</b></i> I am not sure that it makes sense for me to
voice frustration. As well as operating nuclear power stations, we
operate a coal station, and I hope that in future we
will be a generator of more than just electricity from nuclear
stations. It is appropriate in considering new build that we can show
that we can cover the costs of what we are producing, and those costs
should include any waste that we produce. That is an appropriate
principle to start from and I am pleased to be part of the industry
that steps up to that principle at the
moment.</div><a name="08020611000209"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Parker:</b></i> I agree that the principle about the polluter
paying should be evenly distributed across the sectors, but the nuclear
sector is confident that it pays for its waste, decommissioning and
other
pollution.</div><a name="08020611000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
121</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000500"></a>Mr.
Reed:</b> On a broader point, may I ask the whole panel, but
particularly Dr. Roxburgh, how long do you think it will be before the
UK could have a deep geological repository operating?</div>
<a name="08020611000211"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr. Ian
Roxburgh:</b></i> That is a good question, but is probably
two months too early. I understand that the Government intend to
publish a White Paper towards the end of April, following on from the
Corum debate, to set out how they will define a community, how they
would expect a community to volunteer, and how they might define
compensation. So, the question is just a little early.</div>
<a name="08020611000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, if you are thinking
about the technicalities rather than the politics&#151;the difficult
issues of arriving at a community that has volunteered and has the
right technology&#151;I do not believe that the technical aspects
need delay it over-long. Thinking back&#151;Mr. Tipping
might appreciate this&#151;it took just more than four years to sink
the Asfordby mine to what would be a similar depth, through some of the
most difficult hydro-geological material in the country, so there is
good experience. It should not take too
long.</div>
<a name="08020611000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
122</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000501"></a>Mr.
Reed:</b> To the panel more generally, if a decision were
taken to postpone investment in nuclear build in this country pending
the creation and operation of a deep geological facility, what effect
would that have on investment decisions by those who wish to invest in
new nuclear now? Given that there are vast international opportunities
out there for everyone who wishes to invest in the UK market, what
effect would it have on the UK nuclear skills base?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column63" />Column number: 63</div><a name="08020611000214"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Parker:</b></i> I do not believe there should be delay
to the new build programme for that reason, but if
there were, it could have a damaging effect. One difficulty for nuclear
vendors&#151;actually, it is not a difficulty; it is a
luxury&#151;is that there is worldwide demand for new nuclear power
stations. If there were difficulties with the UK moving forward with
new build, they would not have any difficulty in going elsewhere. That
may well push the UK further back in the queue for new reactors, which
could have an impact on our ability to meet the climate change and
energy security challenges that are set out so graphically in the White
Paper.</div><a name="08020611000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
123</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000502"></a>Paddy
Tipping:</b> May I follow up the investment point? The
Government have made it clear that there will be no public subsidy,
which means that you, Mr. Parker, and you, Mr.
Spence, will have to borrow substantial sums from the market. Are you
confident that the price of carbon&#151;carbon trading is still in
its infancy&#151;is robust and secure enough to bring comfort to
investors?</div><a name="08020611000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
we have spent a lot of time talking to you about the decommissioning
programmes and processes set out in the Bill, but at this stage, the
actual costs are not known, because we do not know the ultimate way
forward. Those are big issues for potential investors. Are you
confident that the investors are
there?</div><a name="08020611000217"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Spence:</b></i> On the first question, it is for us as a
private company to ask ourselves whether we are sufficiently confident
today to spend the money that we need to spend today on early-stage
work on our sites. The answer to that is yes. Today, I look at where
things are with the European emissions trading scheme and with the
market price for alternative fuels, and I say that it looks like a good
proposition for our shareholders to take forward and to spend the not
trivial but not huge amount of cash at this stage to develop the option
for new build. I expect that over the next three or four years, we will
need to examine how the carbon market has evolved and the costs that
the reactor vendors quote, once we have decided on the vendors that we
wish to go for, and ask whether there is a sensible investment
proposition. If it looks sensible for us as a company, having
considered the rest of the framework, including the back-end
liabilities, I suspect and am confident that funding sources will be
available either from company balance sheets or from the financial
markets to allow us to fund what we want to
do.</div>
<a name="08020611000218"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
124</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000503"></a>Paddy
Tipping:</b> Is that your view, Mr.
Parker?</div>
<a name="08020611000219"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Parker:</b></i> Yes, it is. If you consider the public
statements of other potential investors, they have all said
that given greater clarity about planning, licensing, the carbon price
and the cost of waste and decommissioning, they would be prepared to
invest. The Government, in their White Paper, have gone a long way to
delivering that clarity, and it will encourage investors to move
forward on new
build.</div>
<a name="08020611000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
125</b><a name="08020611000504"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Nick Palmer</b> (Broxtowe) (Lab): My question is mostly for
Mr. Spence. You mentioned a review of the lifespan of
existing reactors, and in at least one case, you have found that an
extension of 10 years is appropriate. The other extension was also 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 64</div>significant. You appreciate that regardless of new build, the lifespan
of current reactors is important for our planning. Was that substantial
extension a surprise, and can we expect similar pleasant surprises when
you review the next ones? If so, should we not get on with the reviews
so that we have more certainty?</div>
<a name="08020611000221"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Spence:</b></i> For Dungeness, which was the station that had
a 10-year extension, it was the first time that we had assessed its
life. The other stations have already had an extension to their
original accounting lives, so I am hopeful and expect that when
we examine the other stations, we will consider the prospect of further
10-year extensions. However, we will be dealing with a slightly
different situation at that point. Could we do it now? Part of what we
must consider is the real-world experience and results of our
inspection work on those stations, as components are irradiated and
age. We believe that the best time is as near as possible to the point
at which we must make a decision. That allows us to take those
decisions on the basis of best understanding, knowledge and data. That
is why we do it three years in advance of closure. To return to what
Dr. Weightman said, that fits with the programme of periodic safety
reviews required to confirm that it continues to be safe to operate
those stations.</div>
<a name="08020611000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
126</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000505"></a>Dr.
Palmer:</b> On a slightly different point, the panel
unanimously decided that it would be good to have a single design for
reasons of economy, safety and so on. To play devil&#146;s advocate,
one could apply that to many walks of life, such as making all office
buildings essentially the same design, but we tend not to do so,
because it is felt unwise to put all one&#146;s eggs in one basket.
There might be yet further generations who would benefit from having
two different designs to compare. In view of that, is the panel sure
that it is a good idea to go for just one design?</div>
<a name="08020611000223"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Spence:</b></i> If I can respond on that one, from our
perspective competition is very attractive. It helps both to create
innovation and to ensure that the vendors do not extract rent that you
do not want. So, in our view, you have a trade-off: whether the UK is a
sufficiently large market to support competition among reactor designs
as against the benefits that come from economies of scale and the
safety benefits associated with having one standard design. That is a
truth in respect of pretty much every market, from office buildings
through to motorcars: it is a question of how many the market can
sustain.</div><a name="08020611000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
127</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000506"></a>Dr.
Palmer:</b> On balance, is a single design probably
better?</div><a name="08020611000225"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Spence:</b></i> On balance, one or two, rather than
multiple.</div><a name="08020611000226"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Mike Weightman:</b></i> May I add that, for us,
we are not getting into the commercial, availability or
diversity of electricity supply routes argument? It is just about
concentrating on how we secure safety in the most effective way. That
was the
issue.</div><a name="08020611000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, if you
went for two different designs, you might have a fleet of both, for
instance, which would give some of that commonality and would provide
learning opportunities. Also, from our point of view, it would be
looked at on a worldwide basis, because we do not just look at the UK
aspects, but at what can be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column65" />Column number: 65</div>learned from similar designs internationally.
Unfortunately, with the advanced gas-cooled reactors and the old Magnox
reactors we do not have that luxury. For whatever reason, every power
reactor seemed to be designed differently in some way or
another.</div><a name="08020611000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
128</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000507"></a>Dr.
Iddon:</b> There are two different parts to this. Does the
panel have a view on the siting of the new fleet of stations? Are the
present sites adequate or, as in the case of Dungeness, perhaps, not
adequate? I think that Dungeness was taken up there partly for safety
reasons but mainly to provide some jobs up there. Would you be looking
for alternative sites, do you
think?</div><a name="08020611000229"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Paul
Spence:</b></i> I will answer for our company. We have eight
sites around the country adjacent, in most cases, to our existing
stations and, in one case, next to a decommissioned Magnox station. We
believe that, from a technical standpoint, all those sites are suitable
for new build. The factors we look at in considering which become the
most desirable sites include grid connections, access to cooling, the
engineering specifics of the particular sites and, in some cases, the
politics around the acceptability of nuclear north of the border. They
will all be factors that we will need to take into account. We will
also need to see what the Government identify as the criteria as part
of their strategic siting process. That will allow us to identify which
of those sites look
good.</div><a name="08020611000230"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Parker:</b></i> From the industry&#146;s point of view, we
have made the assumption that the new build is likely to take place
adjacent to existing sites, for all sorts of reasons that Paul has
already
described.</div><a name="08020611000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
129</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000508"></a>Dr.
Iddon:</b> The second question is about the
moneys that will be set aside for future
decommissioning way down the line. Are you all satisfied that the build
adequately protects those moneys and do you have a view on how those
moneys should be invested, or will you be giving the Government a
view?</div><a name="08020611000232"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Parker:</b></i> I understand that there will be more detailed
guidance coming out about the way in which both the funded
decommissioning programme and the funding arrangements for it
will need to be taken forward. But in general the proposals in the Bill
for an independent segregated fund controlled by an independent
body provide for a sensible way forward and should ensure that the
moneys are dedicated to the purpose of decommissioning and waste
management. We certainly advocated that in our responses to the various
consultations and believe that it is the correct way
forward.</div><a name="08020611000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08020611000509"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
130</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000511"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:</b> Given what I think is your stance on nuclear
energy, is it a stance that can be tempered or even changed by
evidence, experience and perhaps even the state of public opinion? Or,
is it a fundamentalist article of faith that you are opposed to it for
ever?</div><a name="08020611000241"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Burke:</b></i> It is certainly not my stance. I do not know
how you can take a fundamental stance on technology.
What matters is how relevant the technology is to the problems that it
seeks to address. Therefore, my stance is evidence-based. I would like
to say&#151;and my colleagues can speak for themselves&#151;that
the proposition that any addition to nuclear power in Britain can
contribute significantly either to our energy or climate security is
not supported by the
evidence.</div><a name="08020611000242"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Benet
Northcote:</b></i> I would agree with that. There are clear
and evident dangers to nuclear power. There are great risks and massive
issues of cost associated with waste and potential risks to future
generations. I would agree with Tom that essentially the argument is
pragmatic. Here is a technology that will do nothing, or very little,
to reduce our CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>emissions at vast cost, and which will not
help us to meet our renewable energy
targets.</div><a name="08020611000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
131</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000512"></a>Malcolm
Wicks:</b> Can I just ask&#151;are our two very
distinguished visitors saying that civil nuclear power would not reduce
CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>emissions? What is the scientific evidence for that
extraordinary
proposition?</div><a name="08020611000244"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Burke:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>Yes, as a matter of
practice&#151;either globally or in this country&#151;it
contributes very little. Let me take you through the rationale for
that. The Chinese have the world&#146;s most ambitious nuclear power
programme. They propose to build 40 reactors by 2030 and, being the
Chinese, there is some good prospect that they will do that. If they
succeed, nuclear power will contribute 4 per cent. to China&#146;s
electricity production by 2030. The rest will come from coal. The point
that we both made is that it cannot contribute significantly at that
scale. If you take the broader global picture, and you look at the
number of reactors that have to be built between now and 2030 in order
to keep the current level of nuclear contribution, you have to build 42
GW between now and 2015 and 168 GW in the 10 years after that. That is
what you have to do to maintain the current contribution of nuclear
power. If you look at our current rate of build, which is about 1 GW a
year, even if you scale that up dramatically&#151;and there are good
reasons to believe that that might be quite difficult&#151;the best
that you can hope for is a slow decline in the contribution of nuclear
power to meeting our emissions reductions targets. Meanwhile, a large 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column67" />Column number: 67</div>number of coal-fired power stations will be
constructed. If they operate over their 50-year lifetime, they will
make it extremely difficult for us to meet global and national goals
for reducing our emissions to the point at which the climate is secure
and stable. There is a strong evidence base that nuclear power cannot
contribute very
much.</div><a name="08020611000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">Were
you magically to overcome all the extraordinary difficulties of rate
and magnitude of building new nuclear power stations, of course they
could contribute. In the specific context of the United Kingdom, there
is a need to replace existing nuclear and some coal-fired power
stations that are coming offline, as I think you, Minister, and others
have pointed out. The emerging problem arises some time in the period
between 2012 and 2015&#151;estimates vary&#151;but the most
optimistic assessment of when new nuclear can contribute to meeting the
generation gap is 2017, and that is EDF&#146;s estimate. I think that
the Government&#146;s own consultation paper suggested that it might
actually be a bit later than that, at around
2020.</div><a name="08020611000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the meantime,
we will fill the gap with fossil fuels, so the issue becomes one of
priorities. What do you think it is most important to concentrate
public policy on doing? I suspect that my view is shared by my
colleagues, although they will speak for themselves. It is that it is
most important to concentrate on the fact that if we do not do
something very quickly to make fossil-fuel-fired electricity generation
carbon neutral, we will have made commitments that will be extremely
expensive and possibly impossible to
unravel.</div><a name="08020611000247"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08020611000513"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Would any of our other witnesses like to
comment?</div><a name="08020611000248"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Robin
Webster:</b></i> Yes, certainly. The question is an extremely
good one, because nuclear power is not an article of faith. Climate
change represents such an overwhelming challenge to us that we should
consider all options. It is something that should frighten us all, but
the evidence is that nuclear power will not provide the
answer.</div><a name="08020611000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">I certainly
back up everything that my colleague said. We can look at how Minister
Hutton presented the Bill, so much of which is about nuclear power, in
the House of Commons. He spoke for some 12 minutes about nuclear and
for about two or three minutes about renewables. Our fear is that
nuclear power provides a political distraction. Political energy,
political debate, and the minds of our civil servants and engineers go
down one route, and that does not give us a chance to think about the
root-and-branch change to our energy system that might be needed, and
how that will be achieved. That is our real
fear.</div><a name="08020611000250"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Benet
Northcote:</b></i> I think that that is exactly right. The
only thing that I would add in terms of the actual impacts that a
domestic new-build programme would have, is the figures from the
Sustainable Development Commission, the Government&#146;s own
advisory body on climate change. It says that if Britain built 10 new
reactors, nuclear power could deliver only a 4 per cent. cut in
CO<span class="Sub">2</span> emissions some time after 2025. That is the most
optimistic build programme, which, as we all know, is very optimistic
indeed.</div><a name="08020611000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, it is
essentially pragmatic to say that, in the short term, we have a real
problem. Nuclear power at present contributes just 3.6 per cent. of our
total 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column68" />Column number: 68</div>energy usage. We need a policy right now that looks at a heat strategy,
and how we will deliver on the EU renewable energy target, which takes
us to something like 40 per cent. of our electricity generation coming
from renewable sources. Frankly, nuclear just does not factor into the
equation at
all.</div><a name="08020611000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08020611000514"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Mr. Marsh, did you have a
view?</div><a name="08020611000253"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Russell
Marsh:</b></i> I want only to say two quick things.
One is that I fully support everything that my
colleagues have said. The other is to highlight the focus on nuclear.
There is a focus on nuclear to the detriment of other technologies, but
if we are to get to where we need to be by 2015 or 2020, we need other
technologies. At the moment, our sense is that the focus is very much
on nuclear, which is not part of the solution. We need to focus on
other
solutions.</div><a name="08020611000254"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08020611000515"></a>The

ask a question? If we are going to be fair, we must try to make the
questions and answers
brief.</div><a name="08020611000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
132</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000516"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> Thank you, Mr. Amess. I shall be guided
by our guests and move the discussion off nuclear, although I suspect
that it will come back. In your submissions, you talked about the
measures on heat wastage and inefficiency. What specific measures would
you like to see in the Bill, and what sort of amendments should be
pressed?</div><a name="08020611000256"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Russell
Marsh:</b></i> If I pick that up first, in terms of heat we
have a market with no support for renewable or low-carbon heat. There
is a renewable electricity obligation and a renewable transport fuel
obligation, but there is not the same support for renewable heat, let
alone low-carbon heat. We want the Energy Bill to have a power that
enables the introduction of a feed-in-type mechanism, particularly for
heat, although we also need a feed-in-type mechanism for smaller-scale
electricity.</div><a name="08020611000257"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Benet
Northcote:</b></i> I think that is right. The importance of
heat to climate change and to our energy security cannot be
underestimated. Something like 47 per cent. of our total emissions come
from heat. We talk about gas security. I do not know about you, but my
most immediate relationship with gas is in my boiler at home, which is
where the gas is being burned. The idea that you can somehow have a
coherent energy policy and not have a heat policy beggars belief. The
current energy White Paper has a mere four pages on heat; I cannot
remember how many pages there were, but I attempted to read them all.
That is a key part of the matter, and the Bill does very little or
nothing to address
it.</div><a name="08020611000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
reiterate on feed-in tariffs, they are also tremendously important. You
must look at the success of countries that have adopted feed-in
tariffs, notably Germany, where they are massively outstripping our
delivery of renewables in terms of solar power and wind. It is
acknowledged that the changes that the Bill makes to the ROCs and the
current framework will not get us to the necessary targets. The
Government admit that a new renewables Bill will be needed in about
2009 to meet the EU target. There is a lot that the Bill does not do
that it needs to
do.</div>
<a name="08020611000259"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
133</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000517"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> What about energy efficiency?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column69" />Column number: 69</div><a name="08020611000260"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Benet
Northcote:</b></i> It is easy to overstate energy efficiency,
and to make it out to be a simple, single bullet. We see it as a
culture of energy efficiency that runs all the way through the supply
chain. Traditional power stations throw away two thirds of the energy
before it gets to your house to be wasted at home in the form of wasted
heat. The culture should run through to appliances and ensure that we
have the most energy-efficient appliances. Waste avoidance needs to go
all the way through the system from generation to domestic light
bulbs.</div><a name="08020611000261"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
134</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000518"></a>Paddy
Tipping:</b> There is a lot in the Bill about carbon capture
and storage. The first issue is that in
Greenpeace&#146;s evidence you point out that the
technology is not yet proven. The second is, as a matter of principle,
do you as a group feel that there is a place for coal that is burned
cleanly? Are the measures in the Bill, and the Government&#146;s
other measures, sufficient to bring forward new, clean-coal power
stations?</div><a name="08020611000262"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Benet
Northcote:</b></i> We drew attention to the comments of the
former Secretary of State, now Chancellor Darling, and his views on the
role of coal. He said when giving evidence to, I think, the Business,
Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Committee, that</div>
<a name="08020611000415"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it is commercially untried and
untested. It is not being developed anywhere else in the
world.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 6 June 2007; Vol. 461,
c. 338.]</div> <a name="08020611000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">Whether that is
BERR&#146;s view of the potential for CCSs is a valid
question.</div><a name="08020611000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">The way in
which we will tackle climate changes is about trajectories, so it is
not about saying that we can bet the house on a technology that
may deliver commercially in 20 or 30 years. We need to explore the
potentials, and if CCS has the potential to deliver, we should push it
as hard as we can at every opportunity, notably the application that is
sitting on the Secretary of State&#146;s desk for a new coal-fired
power station at Kingsnorth in Kent, which may be built without any
carbon capture technology whatever specified. We believe firmly that if
it is to be built, it should be built with carbon capture installed and
working from the
outset.</div><a name="08020611000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue is
about trajectories, and what we can do between now and 2020. I do not
think anyone credibly thinks that CCS will be there between now and
2020. We must get ourselves into an energy system that can deliver what
we need by 2020, and see us on to
2050.</div><a name="08020611000266"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Burke:</b></i> I do not agree. Whether we have CCS by 2020 is
entirely a function of how much effort we want to put into it. If we
put enough effort in, we can have it much sooner than that. We are not
currently putting enough effort in, and the Bill does not do very much
to increase it.</div> <a name="08020611000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
set that in context, CCS is an imperative, not an option, if you want
to avoid even more dangerous climate change. The reason for that is
that, although you can come up with all kinds of
theoretical trajectories that are both economically and technologically
available to arrive at a carbon-neutral energy system by the middle of
the century that does not involve coal, I have not seen anybody come up
with a politically deliverable system. You have to face up to that
reality. The coal is there, and for perfectly legitimate energy
security reasons it will be burned, so we have to deal with CCS as an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column70" />Column number: 70</div>existential problem, not as an optional problem. If we do not solve that
problem, we will be in considerable trouble on the
climate.</div><a name="08020611000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not know
what the Bill really does to make a difference to nuclear power,
because anybody who wanted to could have applied for a facility anyway.
A really tough decision&#151;this is the one Benet
did mention&#151;would have been to spend the money needed to make
Kingsnorth carbon neutral whatever that cost us, as a way of
demonstrating to the world two things. First, that it can be done,
which we know technically but not operationally, and secondly that we
are serious when we say that is the way the western world has to go,
because if they do not believe we are serious, why should they do it,
and if they do not do it, we cannot deliver for 60 million Britons a
stable
climate.</div><a name="08020611000269"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Robin
Webster:</b></i> I have just one thing to add. The Bill
provides certainty through the Government&#146;s
competition on CCS, which is a good thing, but the competition on CCS
will be testing only the least efficient way of doing
CCS&#151;post-combustion. It is not testing pre-combustion. We are
seeing permission being given to build coal stations&#151;we are
seeing Kingsnorth. We are seeing them go ahead under the moniker of
capture ready; they are going to be clean coal. We do not yet know what
clean coal is and we are testing the least efficient form of clean
coal. We do not know when that testing will finish or when CCS will be
in place. That needs to happen pretty
fast.</div><a name="08020611000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
135</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000519"></a>Paddy
Tipping:</b> Would you give us a view on a high price for
carbon as a driver of technological
change?</div><a name="08020611000271"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Burke:</b></i> I do not think that there will be a high
enough price for carbon to deliver the technology changes that we need.
It is extremely important to have a price for carbon&#151;it has a
role to play&#151;but are you talking about the kind of technology
shift that we must make to arrive at what is essentially a
carbon-neutral energy system globally by 2050? That is what a 60 or 80
per cent. cut means. Because of the nature of the climate system, a cut
in total emissions of 60 to 80 per cent. is in effect
a carbon-neutral energy system because of emissions from deforestation,
agriculture and so on. If you want to arrive at that, you will
certainly have to use the carbon price, but in terms of both magnitude
and time, we are going to have to think much more about both the
regulatory and the fiscal
measures.</div><a name="08020611000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
particular, the idea that the infrastructure for CCS&#151;the
pipelines, the storage facilities and so on&#151;any more than the
infrastructure for offshore wind that we need to bring onshore, will be
built by the market responding to some signal that is pretty imprecise
with the volatile price of carbon is, frankly, a fantasy. Building that
infrastructure is the equivalent, for a competitive low-carbon economy
in the 21st century, of building the motorways in the 20th century.
Nobody would have suggested that we leave the building of the motorways
to the wisdom of the
market.</div><a name="08020611000273"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
136</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000520"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> I have two questions: one for Miss Webster and one
for Professor Burke. This picks up on your crowding-out point, and I
shall give you both the questions just to flag it up. Can you expand
more substantively on crowding out? Your argument was 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column71" />Column number: 71</div>that if we have new nuclear, the greatest brains of Government will have
to think about it and that crowds out renewables. All right, we have
this Bill and then they will get on with it; it is mainly the private
sector doing it. How real is the crowding out of renewables by new
nuclear? With nuclear, people will get on with it because it is a
private business and they will just do it, so is it really crowding out
renewables?</div><a name="08020611000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
question for Professor Burke is on waste. The argument is that we are
not starting from a position of no nuclear waste; we have dirty great
piles of the stuff and all we are doing is dealing with a bit more.
Given that we will need a big hole in the ground somewhere, why is it
so bad to put a bit more into that big hole in the ground? There is no
issue of principle here and it is quite cheap to put a bit more in a
big hole; it is just a bigger hole. So why is it so substantively
problematic? Perhaps we can deal with the issues in that
sequence.</div><a name="08020611000275"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Robin
Webster:</b></i> I think that the question of political
tension is not as ephemeral as it may seem, having seen with my own
eyes the leaked Government document that said we are not sure whether
we want to hit the renewables target at EU level because it might not
give us enough space to develop nuclear. You could see there was some
political thinking behind that. On the question about the political
thinking that is going on inside our Ministries, I think that quite a
lot of us recognise that within DBERR there is an attitude of
&#147;grown-ups build power stations&#148;. We see the Government
coming out with quite a lot of iconic announcements, saying, &#147;We
going to have nuclear power. We're going to do the Severn barrage. It's
all going to be fine. Please stop presenting us with this
problem.&#148; Actually, what they are not doing is looking at the
energy system.</div><a name="08020611000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
looking at whether we can make a more decentralised energy system, what
kind of mechanisms can exist to develop renewable power and what
barriers there are to renewable power within the UK. These are the
kinds of questions that need to be answered. The question of political
attention is a key
one.</div><a name="08020611000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
Benet is probably better qualified than me to speak on the finances and
the financial fears that there might be around nuclear, but that could
be another very large part of that
equation.</div><a name="08020611000278"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Burke:</b></i> We have to solve the problem exactly because
it is there. It does not make very much difference adding an extra cost
and I do not think that that is a core issue. There is obviously an
issue about the balance of risk that falls to the private and public
sectors that needs to be properly debated and worked out. However, I'm
much more worried about the fact that, this year, we will spend
&#163;2.8 billion on cleaning up the problem with radioactive waste
from the past, but nothing, effectively, on carbon capture and storage,
which is really important to the future prosperity and security of 60
million Britons.</div><a name="08020611000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
cannot see how it makes any sense to argue that we
should create more of a problem&#151;we are already
having to spend too much money on solving the problems of the
past&#151;when we are not spending enough on the problem we have
really got to address, which is guaranteeing the well-being of our
citizens. That is a hard argument to make.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column72" />Column number: 72</div><a name="08020611000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">Personally, I do not think that
waste is the core issue. I think that the core issue is what is going
to contribute to energy security and climate
security.</div><a name="08020611000281"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Benet
Northcote:</b></i> I am not sure that I agree with anything
that Tom says on the waste issue. There is a substantive difference
between legacy and new-build waste. We do not need to create new-build
waste. We have to deal with the legacy waste. There is an essential
ethical difference between the two bits of waste, which has
been clearly identified by CoRWM&#151;the Committee on Radioactive
Waste Management. The new chairman of CoRWM has been very clear that
all of its recommendations and proposals are for legacy waste and
absolutely cannot be applied to new-build waste, and that a new process
would need to be undertaken for new-build
waste.</div><a name="08020611000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are many
issues associated with a repository for new build and the associated
costs for that. For example, there are issues as simple as how the cost
for the repository for new build is apportioned or whether all the
transport links and the infrastructure links will be properly
apportioned into new build? How do you do that when you do not know how
many power stations there are going to be, if the market is coming into
things? Will it be four or 10? How do you apportion costs to one? Will
the first one take all the costs, as opposed to all 10 of them? There
are an awful lot of issues
here.</div><a name="08020611000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our primary
concern, just to talk about the detail for a second, is that we see the
Bill in terms of back-end costs. I agree with everything that Tom says
about up-front costs and all the up-front subsidies. British Energy was
not prepared to say that it was prepared to invest immediately; it
wants to wait for yet more years, because the subsidies right now are
not there. In terms of back-end costs, the Bill essentially cedes power
for protecting the taxpayer from Parliament and gives it to the
Secretary of State. So the Secretary of State has complete power to set
up all the funding mechanisms and all the requirements on the new-build
companies, leaving absolutely no way for Parliament to come in and
check that. That is our reading of the Bill. There is massively undue
haste in respect of new power stations when there is massive
uncertainty about what these costs might be. So why not wait until the
base-case consultation is finished and, at least, wait until there is
clarity on where the repository will be, what are the geological
criteria and what are the costs associated with making it work, and
then look at how you might put together the financing
programme?</div><a name="08020611000284"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Russell
Marsh:</b></i> I just want to pick up on the crowding-out
point and to highlight the fact that the evidence is already there to
show that, at the moment, we are seeing a lot of attention and almost
all the focus on nuclear and much less attention is being paid to some
of the other single reactors, particularly CCS, to which Tom referred.
We will have one demonstration project in the UK that may or may not
have CCS fitted at some point in future and at the moment we
may get nothing else. There is a lot of focus on
nuclear to deliver 20 per cent. of our electricity. However,
although we have to get 40 per cent. from renewables, there is a lot
less attention paid to that. We can already see that the nuclear debate
is crowding out the time for a debate and a policy discussion about how
we bring on all the other technologies at the same
time.</div>

137</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000521"></a>Mr.
Reed:</b> I have a question for you each individually. Do you
advocate the burning of more fossil fuels before any new nuclear energy
is
used?</div><a name="08020611000286"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Burke:</b></i> Is it better for us to burn fossil fuels?
Provided that we can do that in a carbon-neutral way, absolutely. I
think that I said that extremely clearly; to protect the security and
prosperity of 60 million Britons, we have got to solve the coal
problem, irrespective of what we do, because of what others will almost
certainly do. Also, we are going to use coal, as has been demonstrated
by the Kingsnorth application. Therefore, we need to show that we will
walk our talk on climate change. We will need to move very rapidly to
the mobility for ourselves and for everybody else to use coal in a
carbon-neutral way. I think that that is technologically possible; I
also think that it will be very expensive. There are some technological
problems and other problems to solve, but they are all inside the
bounds of our technical and economic competence to solve. I think that
we should just get on with
that.</div><a name="08020611000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
advocating using more energy of any kind. As others have said&#151;I
think most people would agree&#151;improving energy efficiency is by
far and away the fastest and cheapest way to guarantee both energy and
climate security. So I was slightly trapped by the word that you were
using there, &#147;advocating&#148;. I do not want to
&#147;advocate&#148; more use of energy per se, but I want to
advocate that we solve the coal problem first.</div>
<a name="08020611000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am also somewhat sceptical of
a rather interesting reversal, where we have an environmentalist
arguing for the prioritisation and the business world arguing for
&#147;let&#146;s do a bit of everything&#148;. We usually get
accused of wanting to do everything and not being willing to
prioritise. I suspect that the idea that we can do a bit of everything
will lead us into a situation where we do not get very much of anything
done.</div>
<a name="08020611000289"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Benet
Northcote:</b></i> You asked your question in a provocative
way. The answer, of course, is that we will be burning fossil fuels, as
Tom quite rightly says, and the question is this: what is the right way
to take us to the 80 per cent. emission cuts that we need by 2050? Our
point is that nuclear is not the right way and that there are better
ways to do that. So, you put your question in a particular way and I
think that that is not particularly constructive or realistic
within the framework of how you discuss energy policy going
forward.</div>

completely in favour of ensuring as long an availability of fossil

<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> If you will forgive me, my

141</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000526"></a>Mr.

nuclear dichotomy, which of course should not be a dichotomy&#151;it
is counterintuitive&#151;the figures for France, Spain, Italy and
Finland, all of them nuclear countries, would suggest that this theory
is nonsense. France has 12 per cent. renewables; Spain 14 per cent.;
Italy approximately 15 per cent., and Finland 25 per cent. How do you
respond?</div><a name="08020611000300"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Benet

<a name="08020611000302"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Burke:</b></i> In the past, that is right; they have
sustained that. However, we are not talking about the past. We are
talking about what will happen in the future. The point that I did not
make before about crowding out is this; what is the view that investors
take? If the view that investors take is that the Government will
support a nuclear programme to the point where they might even change
their mind about whether to subsidise it&#151;and Mr. de
Rivas and others made it quite clear that they think it extremely
unlikely that there will be nuclear build unless there is some sort of
revenue support&#151; and if investors think that that is where it is
going to go, of course they will think that there is less room for
them, so they will be less willing to take the risk. That is perfectly
normal.</div> <a name="08020611000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is my
sense of what the crowding-out argument is about&#151;what view will
investors take of the political probabilities? As we have seen over the
last few months, in a somewhat disturbing way, investors do not always
get it right; they, too, make mistakes. What all the energy industry is
looking for&#151;it is true of the electricity utilities and of the
renewables investors; it is true of pretty well everybody&#151;is a
sense of the clear political direction and what the Government are
really going to drive for. This debate is about whether nuclear is the

Main:</b> I have different questions, and I shall put them to
different people. From Greenpeace, I would like further expansion of
your concerns about the lack of provision for marine technology in the
Bill. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column75" />Column number: 75</div>I want to ask Friends of the Earth about their social justice policy
engagement with people, and whether you are concerned about the lack of
reference to smart metering in the Bill, which may help to reduce
energy consumption and help with fuel poverty, which affects many
vulnerable communities.</div>
<a name="08020611000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">I throw the
next question open to anyone. I would like a brief answer, as my
colleagues want to speak. You may have heard Dr. Roxburgh say earlier
that spent nuclear fuel may be a valuable national resource in future.
Please discuss. Do you agree or
not?</div><a name="08020611000306"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Benet
Northcote:</b></i> On marine renewables, the answer is that
we have the best wind and tidal resources in the whole of Europe, yet
we have the lowest renewable energy of pretty much anyone in Europe. We
have been hugely supportive of the need to exploit marine and tidal
resources, and very little has been done to date on that. That is why
we need to have mechanisms that incentivise the R and D, and growth in
these areas. The figures quoted earlier were essentially due to hydro
power, which was giving a lot of countries a boost in their
renewables.</div>
<a name="08020611000307"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
144</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000529"></a>Anne
Main:</b> Do you feel that that is a missed trick in the
Bill?</div><a name="08020611000308"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Benet
Northcote:</b></i> Absolutely, in this country. I think it is
something that we need to exploit far more in all ways. I do not think
it is as simple as reaching for the big ticket items and saying,
&#147;Here&#146;s the Severn barrage&#148; as an answer, and that
does it. It is about looking at how to exploit the whole of tidal and
marine
resources.</div><a name="08020611000309"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Robin
Webster:</b></i> I had hoped just to say yes. Generally, when
something gets thrown at us as environmentalists, given the kind of
work that we do, it is that we advocate technologies that might raise
fuel prices, and that would have an impact on those that find it more
difficult to afford them. That is something that has to be considered
in the development of the Bill. For example, we advocate the use of a
feed-in tariff for renewable energy development, something that has
been incredibly successful in other European countries, as it is a way
in which renewable energy can be developed on a community level and on
an individual level very successfully.</div>
<a name="08020611000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, in developing such a
mechanism, you have think what kind of impact it will have on
electricity prices and what impact it will have on the fuel poor. I
think that that is such a key point that mechanisms could be introduced
to find ways in which the fuel poor have get-out clauses on rises in
electricity prices. Feed-in tariffs, for example, can be brought in for
technologies on a more social housing level, so there are ways in which
the Bill should consider the impact on the fuel poor, and that is
something that needs to be considered very carefully.</div>
<a name="08020611000311"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Russell
Marsh:</b></i> Perhaps I can pick on the point about smart
metering. As Robin said, the short answer is yes. It is clear that the
debate about smart metering has been around for years. It is not
necessarily a technology problem; it is more how to get the technology
out there. It is clear that the current framework is not going to
deliver a roll-out of smart meters to every house in the country. We
need to see the Government taking a lead and mandating it to happen,
and the Energy Bill is an opportunity to start laying down a timetable
to get smart meters out as widely as we can and as quickly as we
can.</div>

assets, there are several hundred tonnes of separated plutonium and
uranium sitting around at Sellafield at the moment. They are a bit of a
problem for the people running the site. They are said to have some
sort of notional asset value, but they are actually a liability. I do
not see anything&#151;not even the construction of more nuclear
reactors&#151;altering the situation. It is a theoretical
possibility, but it remains pretty speculative as an asset and I would
be hard pressed to put a value on
it.</div><a name="08020611000313"></a>

real feel for your long-term thinking. Let me quote Professor
Christopher Llewellyn-Smith, who is reckoned to be one of the
leading&#151;perhaps the leading&#151;atomic energy and atomic
power experts in this country. He told the Department of Business,
Enterprise and Regulatory Reform that if we had the investment, he
could get &#147;a viable nuclear fusion station working in 35 to 45
years.&#148;</div><a name="08020611000315"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom

exactly that promise about 30 or 40 years ago. Funnily enough, the
person who punctured that prospect was Mrs. Thatcher. She
asked a very important question about whether the research was based on
science or technology. The answer came back pretty
emphatically&#151;</div><a name="08020611000316"></a>

me now go on. I happen to agree with you on clean coal. However, you

<a name="08020611000327"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom

am saying about carbon capture and storage is that it is an imperative.
In other words, if we do not find a way to make that work, it is not
possible to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column77" />Column number: 77</div>maintain a safe climate for the people of Britain and the rest of the
world. I am saying that we have no choice. That is what the science is
telling us. What I am saying about fusion is that it is an option that
might be worth considering at a lower rate. We are spending a lot more
on fusion than we are on CCS. I do not mind us looking at that option
and keeping going on it, but I do not think that it has anything
relevant to do with maintaining the future prosperity and security of
the people of this country.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
149</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000538"></a>Albert
Owen:</b> I want to push you a little on your pragmatic
approach to nuclear, which you say is not based on dogma. You say that
it is a distraction, which is a very interesting analogy. Other
countries are looking to extend their current nuclear fleet. One such
country is Canada, which already has renewables, and hydro power in
particular. It does not feel that they are a distraction.</div>
<a name="08020611000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">You also mentioned China. I
would not think that they are talking about
distraction. What they are talking about is getting a balanced energy
policy and achieving economic growth. We have not heard anything about
economic growth in your presentation. We have heard about sustained
growth and low carbon. Do not every Government in the world have that
responsibility? I know that we can talk about the academic reasons why
we need different things but, at the end of the day, Governments have
to make decisions and these Governments are making decisions. Canada,
which is extending its nuclear fleet, has a renewable
history.</div><a name="08020611000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">Friends of
the Earth talked about iconic measures such as the barrage in the
Severn. In Wales, the distraction is wind farms. Many people ask me why
barrages are talked about so much so, Friends of the Earth, do you
support the barrage in principle? Also, the two gentlemen who raised
the issue about the distraction initially were able to say,
&#147;Isn&#146;t economic growth important and isn&#146;t a
balanced base load important in
that?&#148;</div><a name="08020611000331"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Burke:</b></i> The issue of ensuring Britain&#146;s energy
security is as important as securing its climate security. I do not
think that you can trade off between the two; you have to do both
together. My underlying point, which will take rather longer than we
have to explain it in detail&#151;though I have done so to a Select
Committee not long ago&#151;is that the contribution that nuclear can
make even to our energy security is very small. That is because our
primary energy security problems are oil, which nuclear cannot help
with, gas, of which there is only a tiny
proportion&#151;</div><a name="08020611000332"></a>

not a lot of real commitments. I noticed as I was listening to the
previous panel that not many people are actually putting in orders to
Japan Steel Works, which is the only place at the moment that can
produce the forgings for new reactor vessels. Not many people are
actually paying up the 30 per cent. that Japan Steel Works is asking
for to get into the queue. That is what I am looking at&#151;what
Governments are doing. Mr. Bush offered the nuclear industry

&#147;Let&#146;s stick to electricity, please, if we can, as
opposed to energy, because that is important for industry&#148;. I
agree that it is. Clearly it is essential, but you cannot decouple
electricity from energy, which all the debate is framed on. That is the
misreading that is going on. You cannot say, &#147;Oh, I just want to
focus on the electricity gap&#148; and then talk about energy
security, gas prices and oil prices. Those things are integrally
linked. How do we have a sustainable economy that moves forward and
continues to employ people and provide what we need for our quality of
life without trashing the planet? We need to do that by solving all
those things together. That is why we talk about a solution in a
positive way&#151;an achievable solution built on decentralised

them, Benet has just said it: the Government have rather presented
nuclear as winning an argument, saying &#147;We are presenting a
package that is just one of many solutions.&#148; The idea of a
package is important, and Benet has just said it; they teach us to say
it on our line manager&#146;s knee or whatever, and to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column79" />Column number: 79</div>think about what solutions are out there: decentralisation, energy
efficiency, renewables. Those are the three solutions that we have to
be thinking about in the energy system. Decentralisation is thinking
about fossil fuel and more efficient use of the fossil fuel resource
that we are currently using in a completely profligate
way.</div><a name="08020611000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the Severn

as a distraction. They want to go with other options, because whatever
option people come up with, they seem oppose it. Many people in the

evidence to show that the electricity generation gap that we have is
not actually as big as we may think it will be. We were looking at some
numbers recently and if you include our renewable electricity target,
which could be about 40 per cent. of our electricity by 2020, and
everything currently coming through, we will not have an electricity
gap, so nuclear does not come into that equation. We need to look at
the numbers and get a good sense of what is out there and what we mean

156</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000550"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> I shall start by commenting on the idea
that&#151;I am paraphrasing Mr. Northcote&#151;the fight
against climate change is one of trajectory and that the effort put in
to develop technologies, such as CCS, up to 2020 will allow us to make
that trajectory up to 2050. However, that is exactly the argument that
you used to reject nuclear power, which cannot make a contribution up
to 2020 and, therefore, can be ignored between 2020 and 2050. My first
question is: can you explain that
contradiction?</div><a name="08020611000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
if you are going to convince me of your arguments, you will have to use
figures. The assertions that I have heard from the four of you today,
and in material that your organisations&#151;Friends of the Earth and
Greenpeace&#151;have put out, contain no hard estimates of what the
alternatives to nuclear power and the energy mixes of today can
produce. You have not given me figures such as, &#147;20 per cent. of
this by 2020, or 20 per cent. of that by 2020.&#148; Will you do that
now? Will you tell me what those are? Greenpeace just sent 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column80" />Column number: 80</div>us a DVD, which I have watched. It suggests a string of alternatives to
nuclear power as reasons that we do not need the latter. What
proportions of those alternatives do you envisage in our energy mix by
whatever date? When we were thinking about a 60 per cent. carbon
reduction by 2050, Friends of the Earth had a set of proposals for our
energy mix. However, I have not seen you revise those since you started
your campaign for an 80 per cent. reduction. How are you bridging that
20 per cent. gap without having produced a new energy
plan?</div><a name="08020611000357"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Benet
Northcote:</b></i> On trajectory, we are calling for a
fundamental change in our energy system. Be in no doubt about the
ambition that we are calling for. The analogy that I use is with
electricity privatisation&#151;the second time we have talked about
Margaret Thatcher in the Committee. If you had walked into the CEGB in
1983 and said, &#147;I have this great idea. We should privatise the
electricity system and hand it over to a small bunch of oligarchic
companies in a market operating a little like an oligopoly of largely
foreign-owned companies,&#148; people would have told you that you
were completely barmy. But that is what happened, and I think that we
are looking at a similar transition in our energy system. When I talk
about
trajectory&#151;</div><a name="08020611000358"></a>

Northcote:</b></i> No, I am saying that people would have
said in 1983 that the prospect of a privatised electricity system was
barmy, but it did not turn out that way and is now being defended
vehemently by DBERR. My point is that we need to go through another
transformation, starting now, to take us up to 2020 and beyond, as
opposed to sticking with the system that we have got and looking for
technical fixes.</div><a name="08020611000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">You
asked about figures and hardcore numbers. I shall point you towards two
documents: the work coming out of DBERR right now on heat, which I have
referred to already, and the Office of Climate Change report on the
potential of heat and a heat strategy. We could go through the numbers,
but I am not sure that that is the best use of the Committee&#146;s
time. However, I am happy to cheerfully circulate the latest figures to
you.</div> <a name="08020611000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">For ease of
reference, I point you to the White Paper on the
future of nuclear power, which is a useful document to look at every
now and then. I could talk to you about some of the alternative
scenarios proposed by DBERR if we did not have nuclear. Paragraph A20,
on the market allocation model&#151;I have been waiting to use this
quote&#151;states that</div>
<a name="08020611000416"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;when new nuclear power stations
are excluded, electricity generated from renewable sources would have
to play a significant role in electricity generation, constituting over
40 per cent. of the generation mix by
2050.&#148;</div><a name="08020611000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">Stop me if I am
wrong, but we are committed to about that generation mix from

158</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000552"></a>Dr.
Ladyman:</b> Those models were rejected because the Government
do not believe that they are achievable. I am asking you to give me a
picture of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column81" />Column number: 81</div>what our energy mix will look like by 2020 and by 2050, which I can test
with people who might invest in it to see whether it is
achievable.</div><a name="08020611000364"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Benet
Northcote:</b></i> Well, I think that I have answered that.
As I see it, we will meet our EU 2020 target of roughly 40 per cent. of
electricity generation coming from renewable sources. It is such a
shame that we cannot ask the Minister his opinion on whether the EU
targets are achievable. There is no doubt that the Prime Minister
thinks that they are because he is on the record as saying so. He said
very clearly that he thinks the targets are achievable. In saying that
you do not think that they are achievable, you have to challenge the
word of the Prime
Minister.</div><a name="08020611000365"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
159</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000553"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> I had a go recently at doing precisely what we
are talking about in a pamphlet that I produced, but I will not
advertise it to anybody.</div>
<a name="08020611000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">What becomes evident
immediately is that we have two planning cycles up to 2020, roughly
speaking. On the electricity generation gap, we have to replace 20 or
25-odd GW of our installed generator capacity by that
time. We know that none of that generation will be
nuclear, whatever one thinks of nuclear energy ultimately. Therefore,
we are talking very big numbers. Presumably we will go down a
predominantly renewable path with a number of transitional
technologies, such as combined heat and power, which might include coal
and gas. There will be various mitigating factors, such as
CCS.</div><a name="08020611000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
terms of your general view of how energy progresses, what compromises
do you think will be necessary to get us to those big numbers by 2020,
on the basis of the sort of scenario that I have set out? I think that
that vision is probably fairly widely shared. We may have to
use renewable fuels, the Severn barrage or gas with combined heat and
power. Do you regard those as compromises or as part of the big energy
picture? I know that we have not talked about the Bill too much.
However, is it your view that some of the devices in the Bill might at
least give a positive lead towards those numbers being
achieved?</div><a name="08020611000368"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Burke:</b></i> Let me add more to your problem before
answering it. If we want to arrive at a carbon-neutral global energy
system by 2050, which is what the scientists are telling us we will
need to do if we are to avoid not just the 2, but the 3
and more that are predicted, we will have to move to electricity for
all of our heat, cooling, power, communication and mobility needs.
Essentially, that is what a carbon-neutral energy system will
mean.</div><a name="08020611000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">Whatever
forecasts there currently are for electricity demand, they will go up
if we are to move in a direction that will really solve the climate
change problem. We might not go in that direction. Just to be clear
about this point: there will need to be a lot more electricity in the
system. A scenario that does not take you in that direction is not
taking you towards a stable-climate
world.</div><a name="08020611000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
illustrate that point. If you want to have a carbon-neutral energy
system, you cannot use gas for all domestic boilers. You cannot have
hundreds of millions of domestic gas boilers. One thing that the Bill
could do that would be very helpful would be to make regulations so
that you do not put gas supplies into the 10 new eco-towns and the 3
million new houses. You 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column82" />Column number: 82</div>will then not have to pay all over again to take them out. That would be
a way of getting ahead of the curve on that
issue.</div><a name="08020611000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will move on
to how best to meet the electricity demand that will be created if you
increasingly move to electrify your system. I have been trying to offer
you an answer about renewable sources. As Benet said, the renewables
target of about 40 per cent. will be difficult and expensive to
achieve. There will have to be a fair amount of public money in the
infrastructure&#151;not necessarily in the deployable
technology&#151;to get access to that potential. The rest of it will
come from centralised and essentially largish gas and coal-fired power
stations with carbon sequestration and storage. That is it&#151;about
40-odd per cent. from renewables and a bit more over time as we go
towards the 2050 thing, but the bulk coming from carbon-neutral gas and
coal. We need to get on with that very fast because it is 42 years away
and, as we all know, the life cycle of energy investments is very long.
The danger with things like Kingsnorth, as we lock ourselves into a way
of using coal for electricity, is that we will have to go back later
and pay a lot to make it carbon neutral. It is better that we realise
now the kind of world we will be living in in the next 40 years, and
start now with what we have to
do.</div><a name="08020611000372"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
160</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000554"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> With respect, the criticism that nuclear may
not be there by 2020 applies equally to CCS, as has been pointed out.
Most of the big figures have to be achieved before
then.</div><a name="08020611000373"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Burke:</b></i> I agree that there are real issues about
CCS.</div><a name="08020611000374"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
161</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000555"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> Even if you are really enthusiastic about
it?</div><a name="08020611000375"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Burke:</b></i> I agree with that too. All I am saying is that
because of what will go on in the rest of the world, if we do not have
a solution for CCS&#151;if we do not have it available and deployable
very rapidly&#151;we cannot guarantee the security and prosperity of
our 60 million Britons or of everyone else. If we want the rest of the
world, particularly China and India, to move in that direction, we had
better show that we are serious. Right now we are not showing that. We
are showing that we think this is an option among other options to be
considered. My underlying argument is that it is imperative. I do not
want to make this choice, but I consider what the science says we have
to do, and we have to solve that problem. In that sense, nuclear
is a distraction. That is what I meant about it being a
distraction. It diverts our attention away from a problem that we have
no choice about.</div>
<a name="08020611000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">People have argued that we
could do other things&#151;we could do more renewables and lots of
other things&#151;but that is not the argument I was
making. In an ideal world, you would end up with a big
improvement in energy efficiency, a lot of renewables and a lot of gas
and coal for your electricity supply, which would be much bigger than
it is now, not least because you would have to go for something that
would take you through hybrids towards a hydrogen mobility with some
biofuels in there, but I think that there are real constraints with
them. You have probably heard some of the discussions about that; they
can make a contribution, but they cannot be a substitute for
oil.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
162</b><b class="B"><a name="08020611000556"></a>Dr.
Palmer:</b> I have always been involved in four
main issues in politics: world development, child
poverty, environmental issues and animal welfare, so I like working
with NGOs on all those issues. However, it has always struck me when
working with environmental NGOs that there is never anything that we do
that they are in favour of. That is not true in the other areas. What
worries me about some of the presentations is that they are
silver-bullet solutions. Mr. Burke says that it is essential
that we solve the CCS problem at all costs because nothing else will
work, and Greenpeace emphasised the role of decentralised energy and
said that if we do not have that we are not really addressing the
problem; it is a distraction. The effect is that every time something
like the Severn barrage and the network of offshore wind farms comes
up, there is always a major lobby attacking it, as they do with any
change, and when we look to see whether the green lobby supports it,
somehow it is not there. As politicians, we have to go for more than
one option, because we have to consider what happens if we say that CCS
is the answer, but find out further down the line that relying on CCS
and the coal extraction that we can do in Britain is so expensive that
we are imposing enormous fuel cost increases on our constituents. That
would be a huge problem for us in every other
way.</div><a name="08020611000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am asking the panel in rather general terms whether they do not feel
that they are being too absolutist in rejecting things like the Severn
barrage and not getting behind a range of alternatives, which could
include the ones that they are
espousing.</div><a name="08020611000379"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Robin
Webster:</b></i> I would like to respond to this one.
Actually, I think the fact that you reeled off a series of solutions
that we were all proposing shows that there are not silver-bullet
solutions. That is quite difficult for us, because when campaigning it
is difficult to say, &#147;This is the one solution. You are going to
win this.&#148; Actually, this is about a package solution: it is
about energy efficiency, decentralisation and
renewables.</div><a name="08020611000380"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
worked in other areas with environmental NGOs, but I have worked in no
other area where there is such an agreement within the major NGOs about
what we want to see. If you are still seeing us as the no
people, that means that we are not getting that across enough. Really,
we are in almost unanimous agreement as to what we do not regard as the
solution: we do not see nuclear as the solution and we do not see the
Severn barrage as a solution. What we do see as the solution is energy
efficiency, decentralisation, heat capture and renewables expansion. We
are all saying that. We all believe it. We all know what we say yes to
and we all know what we are saying no
to.</div><a name="08020611000381"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Benet
Northcote:</b></i> I was going to say the same as
you.</div><a name="08020611000382"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Burke:</b></i> My point about carbon sequestration and
storage is about what you have to do if you want to achieve the goal of
a stable climate while delivering energy security for growth, which
another Committee member referred to. I think you have got to do that
to meet the development needs. Then, because of the political
dynamics&#151;not because we could not work out theoretical
solutions&#151;you are going to have to solve the coal problem. I
think it is going to be expensive. I think we have to face up to that
being expensive. I suspect we will find that, as things go
on&#151;partly in respect of what Benet mentioned about
trajectories&#151;the renewables piece is going to become 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column84" />Column number: 84</div>somewhat easier. I have only said about 40-odd per
cent.</div><a name="08020611000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">Last year, the
addition to the world&#146;s nuclear capacity was about 2 GW.
However, the addition to the world&#146;s photovoltaic capacity,
which is regarded as one of the less attractive options, was 2.6 GW.
The addition of wind to the global mix was about 15 GW. What I do not
like about nuclear is that I do not think that, in practice, for lots
of practical judgements, it will actually deliver. The nuclear industry
has, for 50 years of my lifetime, always been promising jam tomorrow
and, by and large, it has not delivered on that. It would be foolish to
make the same mistake when what is at stake now is not just our comfort
but the prosperity and security of everybody, including not just the 60
million Britons, but the other 6 billion people that we share the
planet
with.</div><a name="08020611000384"></a>
