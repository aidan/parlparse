<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000389"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Thank you for your guidance, Sir John.</div>
<a name="06062056000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 122 to 124 seek
to change the Bill&#146;s definitions back to the definitions that
applied prior to the Finance Act 2004. Committee members might remember
from our proceedings on Thursday that, in the Finance Act 2004, a
number of rules 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column721" />Column number: 722</div>relating to the investments that a self-invested personal pension could
make were removed or liberalised with a view to encouraging investment
in a wider range of assets. Subsequently, in the 2005 pre-Budget
report, the Government reversed that, and we see in this Bill quite a
complex series of rules concerning residential property.</div>
<a name="06062056000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments probe why the
Government have not simply sought to reinstate the pre-2004 position.
Rather than going into depth to distinguish between different types of
potentially residential property&#151;nursing homes, beach huts,
prisons, hospices and a range of different assets&#151;the old rules,
although brief, were clear, as was the associated guidance. For
example, paragraph 11.18
says:</div><a name="06062056000326"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Commercial
property with a residential aspect, such as hotels, guest houses and
nursing homes, is not a prohibited investment. It would not however be
permissible for the member or any connected person to use the
facilities other than at a commercial
rate.&#148;</div><a name="06062056000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those were the
rules in place. We seem now to have a much more complex set of
rules.</div><a name="06062056000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">I draw the
Committee&#146;s attention to paragraph 7(1)(b) of proposed new
schedule 29A to the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, which
expands on the meaning of the phrase &#147;residential
property&#148;. It will include</div>
<a name="06062056000327"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any land consisting of, or
forming part of, the garden or grounds of such a building (including a
building on any such land) which is used or intended for use for a
purpose connected with the enjoyment of the
building&#148;.</div><a name="06062056000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
paragraph makes explicit reference to beach huts. It seems also to
refer implicitly to sheds, greenhouses, Wendy houses and any other form
of garden building. I am concerned that the definition seems to be
getting more complicated, and I am not sure why.</div>
<a name="06062056000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The definition includes
gardens. In my constituency, many back gardens are now being used for
development. If I had a SIPP, I could legally buy a field with the
intention of using it for residential development, but apparently I
could not put my back garden into the SIPP if I wanted to build some
more houses there. That seems a curious distinction for the Government
to draw when they are keen to build more residential property on
brownfield sites.</div> <a name="06062056000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
responding to amendments Nos. 122 to 124, will the Economic Secretary
explain in more detail why the Government have sought to define
&#147;residential property&#148; when the previous rules worked
very well? It is almost as though, having decided to abandon the
previous rules, the Government have let the genie out of the bottle and
are having a great deal of difficulty putting it
back.</div><a name="06062056000044"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062056000390"></a><b class="B">Rob
Marris</b> (Wolverhampton, South-West) (Lab): Will the hon.
Gentleman tell the Committee whether he is in favour of
&#147;backfill&#148; as it is sometimes called&#151;that is,
building homes in gardens as brownfield sites? He seems to be, given
that he wishes people to be able to put them in their SIPPs as an
investment, so that they can build homes in big back
gardens.</div><a name="06062056000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000391"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The issue of brownfield development and whether
back gardens should be developed is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column722" />Column number: 723</div>controversial and will probably be the subject of a debate tomorrow in
the House, in which I hope to express some thoughts on the
issue.</div> <a name="06062056000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rather than
wishing to encourage more brownfield development on back gardens, I was
just pointing out the distinction that the Bill seems to draw. It
separates one type of land purchase for residential development from
another. That was the point that I wanted to tease out from the
Economic Secretary. In a way, I also wanted to tease him in that the
Minister for Housing and Planning is keen to see more residential
development in back gardens and similar brownfield
sites.</div><a name="06062056000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to
amendments Nos. 125 and 126. In schedule 21, distinctions are drawn
between different types of residential property. There are particular,
complex rules that relate to hotels and similar forms of accommodation.
I understand the rules&#146; purpose; some people&#146;s residence
may well be part of a hotel. Given that the Government seek to clamp
down on personal benefit in respect of residents&#146; property, I
understand the route that they are going down.</div>
<a name="06062056000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems odd, however, that
when we come to the different category of residential properties set
out in part 2(8)(1), a distinction is drawn. The Government do not seem
as concerned about the people who live in one of the properties listed
there having some personal benefit. For example, paragraph 8(1) lists
children&#146;s homes, student halls of residence, residential or
nursing accommodation for the elderly, hospitals, hospices, prisons or
similar establishments. My amendments Nos. 125 and 126 seek to impose
on residents of those properties, when they are connected to a pension
scheme member, constraints similar to those imposed on people whose
residence is part of a
hotel.</div><a name="06062056000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Economic Secretary explain why he has separately identified a hall
of residence&#151;a place where people pay to live and may get meals?
Why is the tax treatment of people connected to pension fund members
who live in such a place different from that of people who are
similarly connected but live in a hotel? We need consistency on the
issue. Amendments Nos. 125 and 126 seek to extend the rules.</div>
<a name="06062056000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to an allied point. I am
not entirely sure that I know what the definition of a &#147;hall of
residence&#148; is. The explanatory notes suggest that it is not a
collection of houses. Student houses, of which your constituency has a
number, Sir John, do not constitute a hall of residence. However, at
what point does a house become a hall of residence for the purposes of
the Bill? There are issues around the accommodation of students in many
of our towns, and it would be helpful if people could understand the
distinction. I seek the Economic Secretary&#146;s guidance and
explanation.</div><a name="06062056000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000392"></a>The
Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ed Balls):</b> Welcome
again to the Chair, Sir John. We hope to have a productive day and move
through a number of clauses. I will try to make sure that while
responding in detail to the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban), I do
so as expeditiously as
possible.</div><a name="06062056000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">We discussed
the broad thrust of these issues when debating the previous clause last
Thursday. We got into some of the more general issues surrounding beach
huts and other ways in which people might try to use 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column723" />Column number: 724</div>the opportunity to invest in lifestyle areas using pension tax reliefs.
There is a consensus on all sides that is something we do not want, but
the question is how?</div>
<a name="06062056000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule 21 and part 2 of
schedule 21, to which these amendments apply, provide the basic
definitions of taxable assets so that we can prevent people from
abusing the generous tax reliefs they are given on pension savings to
purchase assets that may benefit them personally. The tax reliefs are
given in order to help save the fund that will ensure secure income in
retirement. They are not there to provide a means of buying assets for
the personal use of pension scheme members. The taxable assets targeted
by the schedule are those where personal use is most likely. These are
different versions of residential property and tangible, moveable
property.</div> <a name="06062056000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 122 and 124 propose that the definition of residential property in
the Bill be replaced with the reverse definition that is derived from
the regulations that were in effect before A-day. The hon. Member for
Fareham asked me about this point in particular and why, if the
previous definitions are understandable and are not dissimilar to the
definitions that are here today, we did not stick with the previous
rules. As I explained last Thursday, the answer is that we looked at
the previous rules in a number of areas and found that there was
imprecision, a lack of clarity and the language was outdated. For
example, the term previously used for tangible, moveable property was
&#147;personal chattels&#148;. It is an outdated term, outside the
parameters of the Bill and rarely used in common parlance. Those
definitions have worked for a number of years but, over time, there was
a considerable need for substantial guidance in order to interpret some
of the looseness in the definitions that had arisen. What we are
seeking to do in this detailed schedule today is to bring in some
precision and to clear up some minor loopholes to make sure that we are
as clear as we can be in legislation, rather than having to rely on
guidance in how we will apply the regime.</div>
<a name="06062056000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first amendment removes the
reference to garden, grounds and outbuildings. It is important for
pension schemes to be clear that the legislation covers such items.
Further, if the references are removed, it would open up the prospect
of pension schemes attempting artificially to reduce the tax charges by
claiming that substantial parts of the value of a residential property
is instead within the grounds or the outbuilding. The legislation is
designed to prevent such private use of pension scheme assets. Allowing
the person to sell their gardens into a SIPP would allow a loophole in
the legislation whereby people could sell private land. The legislation
strikes a balance between preventing people from using private assets
from which they can get personal benefit and the sensible use of
pension fund
moneys.</div><a name="06062056000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the
amendment removes the provisions that treat parts of buildings as
separate buildings. It is an important provision that allows pension
schemes to own commercial parts of a building that also contain
residential property owned by other parties. The amendment also removes
the reference to beach huts, which we debated on Thursday, and prevents
schemes investing in these relatively expensive structures that would
be available for private use by members. When 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column724" />Column number: 725</div>the committee reflected on the scale and cost of beach huts and their
extensive private use in today&#146;s world, as well as on the
desirability of whether one wants to be inside or outside a beach hut,
I think we would agree on both sides that that we do not want directly
to subsidise that through the tax system, using pension tax
relief.</div> <a name="06062056000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, the
amendments would remove the reference to hotels. This is an essential
part of the drafting of the schedule, as it links in with provisions in
paragraph 14 which prevent schemes investing in timeshare-type
properties. This is estimated to cost up to &#163;20 million in the
first four years as pension savings are directed towards hotels and
other holiday lettings. Allowing people to buy, in such a detailed way
through their pension fund, a particular room in a timeshare-style way
to invest in a hotel, is not the intention on either side of the House.
The provisions do not disallow more general investment in hotels; the
issue is whether one is allowed to use one&#146;s pension fund to
invest in a particular room in a particular hotel for one&#146;s
personal
use.</div><a name="06062056000339"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div><a name="06062056000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
123 seeks to replace the definition of tangible moveable property in
the schedule with a definition based on the concept of personal
chattels. The alternative definition proposed in the amendment is, as I
said, derived from the previous regime. In our view, that old
terminology is a bit out of date. The Bill contains simpler definitions
that are easier to understand, and that is a better way forward. We
published a draft order and asked the pension industry to comment on
the range of definitions and types of tangible moveable property, and
we have a satisfactory
outcome.</div><a name="06062056000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 125 and 126 relate to the part of the schedule that removes
completely from the scope of the measure categories of commercial or
public accommodation used to house large groups of unconnected
individuals, including children&#146;s homes, nursing homes and
prisons. The amendment would bring the excluded categories of
accommodation back into the taxable property provisions if a pension
scheme holds the accommodation and a member of the scheme, or a person
related to that member is resident in it. The likelihood of a pension
scheme buying a children&#146;s home, hospice or hall of residence
for the personal use of a member&#151;and therefore avoiding the
taxable property provisions&#151;is very low. It is different from
the example of beach huts. A beach hut for one&#146;s personal use
and that of one&#146;s family is much more meaningful. It would be
impossible and impractical for pension schemes with many thousands of
members to monitor all members and related persons to determine whether
they were benefiting personally from an investment that the scheme has
made.</div><a name="06062056000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">The exceptions
from the charge will apply to institutional accommodation only where a
number of unconnected individuals reside. A private family home does
not apply, but a home for the residential accommodation of children is
quite different. To answer the question that the hon. Member for
Fareham asked earlier, in the case of investment in a hall of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column725" />Column number: 726</div>residence, although such buildings act as dwellings for people to live
in, they are essentially commercial operations. It is unlikely that one
would invest in a pension scheme to buy a large hall of residence to
benefit one&#146;s son or daughter. There is little risk of that
problem
arising.</div><a name="06062056000061"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000393"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for his
comments so far. He said that halls of residence, children&#146;s
homes and residential homes were places where a large number of
unconnected persons could be together. Will he define what he means by
a large
number?</div><a name="06062056000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000394"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> If one were to buy a house on the Cowley road, put
a sign outside it that said &#147;Hall of Residence&#148; and then
install one&#146;s son or daughter, such a property would fail the
test. On the other hand, if a college or a private company invested in
a block with a number of rooms or a set of houses that were to be
commercially let, that property would clearly count as a hall of
residence if a number of individuals who were probably unconnected to
the investors in normal business were to rent from that
company.</div><a name="06062056000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not
rule out the idea that, if one invests in a commercial property with a
number of student residents, one&#146;s son or daughter might end up
renting there, but that would be unusual. It would need to be clear
that that was not the intention of the investment; there would need to
be a number of other individuals in the property. It is clear that that
would be different from investing in a beach hut, a second home or a
larger building at the end of one&#146;s garden. It is not for me in
debating the measure to put a precise number on that, but it is pretty
clear what the intention is and why there is a distinction between a
student hall of residence and an individual buying a second or third
home for the benefit of a son or
daughter.</div><a name="06062056000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously,
we will need to make it clear in guidance exactly how the rules will be
applied in implementing the legislation. However, we are getting to a
better place than we were under the previous
regime.</div><a name="06062056000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have covered the detailed amendments tabled by the hon. Member for
Fareham. We have the opportunity to debate the broader issues about
housing policy, design and supply later in our
proceedings.</div><a name="06062056000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000395"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am grateful to the Economic Secretary
for his explanation. He demonstrated the Government&#146;s problem in
that, having decided to scrap the rules two years ago, it is now
difficult to put the system back in place to stop further abuse. It
would have been better to have thought such issues through first rather
than scrap a regime and impose a new
one.</div><a name="06062056000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">When I asked how
large the number of unconnected people had to be, the hon. Gentleman
gave the polar extremes. I visit several rest homes in my constituency
in which there are six, seven, eight or nine residents, so someone
related to a member of the pension fund might be in a small rest home.
There will be some definitional issues at which people will look
closely. I think that the 28 pages of guidance that have been published
about the matter will grow over time, rather than diminish, as the
issues are teased out by people who work in such
areas.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column726" />Column number: 727</div><a name="06062056000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000396"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the definitions
and rules are inferior to the regime that applied pre A-day? Does he
wish to return to a pre A-day regime? Does he not understand the use of
common sense when applying such
definitions?</div><a name="06062056000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000397"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> When we reach the clause stand part debate, I shall
explain the other problems that I have with the provisions and say why
they are not as clear in some respects as the pre A-day rules. The
Paymaster General commented about advisers probing and trying to push
the boundaries and I am sure that the same will happen in respect of
the issue under discussion. It may be a matter of common sense, but
people will look for loopholes to see how the rules can be used to
benefit pension funds. Given the fact that the Economic
Secretary&#146;s explanation and my remarks have opened up more
latitude, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="06062056000070"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment, by leave,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000399"></a>The

following amendments: No. 129, in schedule 21, page 152, line 8 [Vol

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000400"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> The group of previously six, but now four,
Opposition amendments and one Government amendment all refer to part 3
of schedule 21, which sets out when a pension scheme acquires and holds
taxable property and the extent of the scheme&#146;s interest in that
property. Part 3 of the schedule goes into considerable detail about
when a pension scheme is treated as holding an interest in taxable
property and the extent of that interest. That is essential because it
serves several purposes. It ensures that there will be no getting
around the rules by investing through companies and other vehicles
controlled by the pension scheme or its members. It also ensures that
any tax charge reflects the true extent of the pension scheme&#146;s
interest in the taxable property. It also prescribes when an investment
is to be treated as made through a genuine diverse commercial vehicle.
That will allow genuine investment without the risk of abusive tax
advantages arising through scheme members attempting to enjoy personal
or uncommercial use of their pension scheme
assets.</div><a name="06062056000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The real
estate investment trusts clauses that we debated earlier offer one way
in which to invest in residential property. Investments in residential
property made through other collective investment schemes, insurance
funds and even smaller commercial vehicles 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column727" />Column number: 728</div>will also be acceptable so long as they meet certain requirements in
respect of value and diversity: they must not hold an interest in any
property of 10 per cent. or more, and they must not hold the property,
so that any investor or relative can use it or occupy it.</div>
<a name="06062056000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where a pension scheme chooses
to invest through one of the acceptable types of commercial vehicles as
described in part 3 of the schedule, but still invests in taxable
property, the members of the scheme who benefit and the scheme
administrators will be subject to tax charges that recover the release
already
given.</div><a name="06062056000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 127, which was not moved, and amendment No. 128 referred to issues
around the use of hotels, which we discussed in the debate on a
previous amendment. Government amendment No. 393 is a highly technical
amendment, which does no more than add a cross-reference, erroneously
missed out of the published Bill, to ensure that the provisions
limiting investment in taxable property to genuinely diverse commercial
vehicles will work as
intended.</div><a name="06062056000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">As three of
the Opposition amendments&#151;Nos. 129, 130 and 133&#151;are
similar, I will deal with them as if they were one amendment, which is
the logical thing to do. The purpose of the measure is to remove the
tax advantages for pension schemes investing in residential property
and other taxable assets, where the members have influence over the
scheme&#146;s investment strategy.</div>
<a name="06062056000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">That includes where the pension
scheme holds an interest in residential property indirectly via a
vehicle and the scheme and its members have a sufficiently large
interest in the vehicle that they are able to exert influence over it.
That is to prevent the diversion of generous tax reliefs that are given
to help savers to build a fund into assets that are available to
provide personal benefits for scheme members.</div>
<a name="06062056000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The pension scheme, together
with any associated person, is therefore precluded from holding 10 per
cent. or more of the share capital and voting rights and from being
entitled to receive 10 per cent. or more of income distribution or cash
on a winding-up in respect of a vehicle that holds taxable property. If
it holds a greater interest, tax charges to recoup the relief given on
the amount invested will arise.</div>
<a name="06062056000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments seek to change
the conditions on the interest that the pension scheme is permitted to
have in the vehicle from less than 10 per cent. to not more than 10 per
cent. It affects three of the five tests set out of the
schedule.</div><a name="06062056000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has been
suggested to the Government that there was no abuse of the restrictions
on investment in residential property under the old pensions tax
regime, so there is no need for a rule covering indirect investments by
pension schemes in such assets. We reject that analysis. Preventing
direct investment in residential property, while allowing investment
via a company or trust, would give the green light to schemes seeking
to avoid the provisions. We cannot allow that to happen.</div>
<a name="06062056000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has also been suggested
that, rather than having complex descriptive rules, the Government
should have drawn up a list of acceptable, pooled investment vehicles.
Although superficially attractive, that would have been wholly
impractical. The rules need to have European and international
coverage. It would have been virtually impossible to eliminate
discrimination 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column728" />Column number: 729</div>and to avoid international loopholes. Instead, the legislation sets out
several straightforward characteristics that the vehicles must have to
demonstrate that they are genuinely diverse commercial
vehicles.</div> <a name="06062056000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">In most
cases, it will be clear to investment-regulated pension schemes which
large pool of investment schemes are acceptable. For any large
organisation, the tests are reasonably lightweight and easy to apply.
Most large occupational schemes will not be investment-regulated
schemes and will not be within the legislation.</div>
<a name="06062056000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">If an investment-regulated
pension scheme wants to tread closely to the boundaries and to invest
in smaller vehicles, it must expect its compliance burden to be higher.
In conclusion, the scheme removes all tax advantages where the pension
scheme invests in a vehicle, 10 per cent. or more of which is owned by
the scheme and its
associates.</div><a name="06062056000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No.131 will disregard any interest in the vehicle held by members of
the scheme, when applying the 10 per cent. test. That would open a
loophole that was easy to exploit. It would enable a pension scheme and
its members fully to control a vehicle that owned residential property.
The arrangement would not trigger any tax charges, so long as the
pension scheme did not own at least 10 per cent. However, with control
of the vehicle, the property would potentially be available for private
use of one or more of the members. We estimate that the amendment would
cost &#163;10 million per year. We do not want to allow those
loopholes to arise. They would allow the abuse of generous tax reliefs.
We therefore ask Opposition Members not to press the
amendments.</div><a name="06062056000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000401"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> May I first deal with amendmentsNos. 129,
130 and 133? The point that I was trying to get at was that those three
amendments and amendment No. 131 are very technical. Under the current
rules, no one can own a stake of 10 per cent. or more. Therefore, we
could have a situation where each member will own a maximum of 9.99 per
cent. recurring in the vehicle. Rather than having 10 people own an
equal stake in the vehicle, 10 people will own 9.9 per cent. and
somebody will own the balance. All I was trying to do was tidy up the
measure, so that people could own equal shares in the vehicle. It is
not about avoidance, abuse, or exploiting or creating any problems. The
aim is to tidy up the drafting so that we could have neat and tidy
arrangements for people seeking to use the vehicles to invest
indirectly in residential
property.</div>
<a name="06062056000340"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="06062056000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
131 picks up an issue that has been raised with me by one SIPP adviser.
I understand that a number of SIPP providers will effectively have an
umbrella trust or a master trust set up over a seriesof SIPP
arrangements. A member could have his own SIPP, which forms a subset of
a much larger SIPP. A SIPP for a small business might be part of a SIPP
provided by another company. That company might be based in Fareham and
there might be a SIPP based in Newcastle, both of which would be part
of the same 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column729" />Column number: 730</div>SIPP umbrella. Each might choose to invest indirectly in residential
property through a real estate investment trust, but because they are
part of the same SIPP umbrella the risk is that their interest will be
added together and come to more than 10 per
cent.</div><a name="06062056000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
issue that I want to probe the Economic Secretary about. Where there is
a master SIPP and the participants are different companies or
individuals who do not know each other and have no other involvement
apart from the fact that they are all clients of a particular firm,
their holdings in indirect vehicles will be aggregated under paragraph
30 of the
schedule.</div><a name="06062056000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000402"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> I slightly regret the fact that the hon. Gentleman
did not speak before me, as I could then have listened to his comments
first. I had interpreted amendments Nos. 129, 130 and 131 as being a
rather more complex attempt to probe the thinking behind the potential
use of trading companies. I ended up going into rather more detail
about how we are treating these issues than he was probably expecting,
so I apologise to him for allowing myself to be overly
probed.</div><a name="06062056000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">We think that
the application of the 10 per cent. rule is sensible and
understandable; it is what we consulted on and what the industry is
expecting. While I appreciate the rather more detailed drafting point
that the hon. Gentleman proposes, we are where we are, and this is what
people are expecting. The best thing to do is to get on with
implementing it. I apologise to him for thinking that he was making a
bigger point. I could have just said, &#147;Thanks, but no
thanks.&#148;</div> <a name="06062056000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment No. 131 and the issue of indirect holdings of property
through a vehicle, the 10 per cent. rule is simply to administer that
and is reflected in a number of other areas&#151;for example, a
number of double taxation treaties. The figure is common and
understood, including in areas where there will be an investment
strategy of a company or a vehicle rather than of an individual. Our
view is that this is an understood way of dealing with exactly the kind
of problem that the hon. Gentleman raises. I do not think, on the basis
of our consultation so far with the industry and advisers, that the
particular point he refers to, which was made by one SIPP adviser, is
reflected more generally across the
industry.</div><a name="06062056000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will be
conscious of the point that the hon. Gentleman makes to ensure that the
guidance is clear, but our consultation so far does not suggest that
this will be a general problem. On that basis, while being grateful to
him for that further probe, we must reject his
proposal.</div><a name="06062056000096"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

brief amendment aims to establish the point at which a property that is
being converted or adapted becomes
residential.</div><a name="06062056000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000404"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> That is an example of particularly efficient and
to-the-point probing. In fact, I was probed so fast that I had not
realised that I had been probed by the time the hon. Gentleman sat
down. I am not sure whether you did, Sir John.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column730" />Column number: 731</div><a name="06062056000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am happy to deal with the
question. Amendment No. 132 would change when the tax charges arose
when a pension scheme converted its commercial property to residential
use. We propose a tax charge as soon as the property becomes suitable
for residential use, even if the conversion is still going
on.</div><a name="06062056000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">To explain the
background, when a pension scheme invests in taxable property but does
not do so through one of the acceptable types of commercial vehicle,
this measure will remove tax advantages in respect of that investment.
The schedule achieves that by making scheme members and administrators
liable for tax charges that recoup the tax relief already given in
respect of the cost of investment. One way of investing in residential
property is for the scheme to convert commercial property, such as a
barn, into residential. The amendment is about when tax charges arise
on a conversion of the property to residential
use.</div><a name="06062056000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are making a
minor change to timing in a small proportion of cases. Normally, a
property becomes residential property at about the same time that the
conversion works are substantially completed. In such a case, the
amendment would have no effect, but it might have a limited effect if
the property became suitable for use as a dwelling before the
conversion works were
completed.</div><a name="06062056000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may not
always be clear exactly when a property that is being converted or
adapted from non-residential use becomes suitable for use as a
dwelling. We can imagine that in converting a barn, depending on
whether it was sunny or rainy, someone might choose to sleep overnight
with a hole in the roof, for example, just to give a colloquial flavour
to the deeper point that the hon. Gentleman probes
on.</div><a name="06062056000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not want the
tax charge to arise only when a property begins to be used as a
residence. That is too late. Nor do we want a charge to arise when it
becomes a residential property if the conversion works are still in
full swing. That is too
early.</div><a name="06062056000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is possible
for a property to be suitable for use as a dwelling before the
conversion works are completely finished. As I said, there might still
be a hole at one end of the barn, or the house itself might be finished
but a new garage might be under construction, or the works might be
finished apart from post-conversion snagging, which Opposition Members
might know can sometimes take not just weeks or months, but years, to
complete. Snagging is perhaps a technical term more commonly known to
the public than straddling, but it is no less
frustrating.</div><a name="06062056000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might
even be possible to manipulate the work so that ancillary building
works carry on long after the property has begun to be used as private
residence. The legislation therefore imposes the tax charges after the
property has become suitable for use as a dwelling, but only when the
conversion works have been substantially
completed.</div><a name="06062056000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The test
for the works&#151;with apologies to the hon. Gentleman&#151;is a
matter of common sense. The measure applies a fine balance, which
pension schemes can operate fairly simply&#151;not seeking to recover
the tax reliefs too early or too late, but preventing the opportunity
for abuse, which might be, as I highlighted earlier, when someone
allows the snagging to occur deliberately, rather than inadvertently or
frustratingly, for years rather than months.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column731" />Column number: 732</div><a name="06062056000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that that provides some
detail for the hon. Gentleman, which of course will be reflected in the
guidance and the operation of the scheme. On that basis, I encourage
him to withdraw the amendment and the building industry not to see the
opportunity for tax-driven snagging in
future.</div><a name="06062056000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000405"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for his
remarks. We will not go down the road of snagging. I know someone who
has been in a house for four years and is still completing the snagging
list, so to say that completion of snagging is an indicator of when the
property is suitable for residential use is to go too
far.</div><a name="06062056000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wonder whether
a certificate of habitations might be a better way of identifying the
transition point between development and residence, but the Economic
Secretary has put his views on the record very clearly. Therefore, I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<a name="06062056000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000406"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am sorry to detain the Committee for slightly
longer, but I want to raise one or two issues that did not fall within
the amendments that I tabled. The first is the inclusion within SIPPs
of unquoted shares. The 1991 rules stated that SIPPs could not hold
shares in an unquoted company when the pension scheme held more than 30
per cent. of those shares. This is one area where there is a deficiency
in the clarity of the schedule and an example of where the old rules
might be slightly clearer than the current
ones.</div><a name="06062056000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is difficult
to wade through the schedule trying to find the rules that tackle the
issue. The Government have sought to tackle it through indirect
investment, which is referred to in paragraph 23. The only tangible
moveable property that pension SIPPs can invest in is gold that meets
particular rules or individual items taken with the administration
scheme that cost less than &#163;6,000. That appears to rule out
shares in unquoted companies where a pension scheme has a particular
interest.</div><a name="06062056000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 21
enables direct investment in a vehicle such as a limited company
holding tangible moveable property where the company is carrying out a
trade or profession. However, subsections (2) and (3) prohibit that
where the pension scheme, in conjunction with associated powers, has
control of the vehicle or if a member of the scheme either directly or
indirectly controls the
vehicle.</div><a name="06062056000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
convoluted route effectively prevents SIPPs from holding shares in
unquoted companies by preventing them from investing indirectly in
tangible moveable property. While we think about computers falling
within the &#163;6,000 limit, if we are thinking about a trading
company with the same machine source, it is likely that the value will
be much greater than &#163;6,000, which would preclude the SIPP from
investing in the shares of unquoted companies where the members had a
particular
interest.</div><a name="06062056000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">John Lawson
of Standard Life

computers, desks and chairs will be subject to a tax charge if it is

<a name="06062056000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Economic Secretary
clarify the Government&#146;s position on unquoted shares being held
by SIPPs? He referred to guidance, which is already out with the
industry in draft, on tangible moveable property. That is limited
entirely to gold bullion. What further consultations does he expect to
have with industry about what falls within the definition of tangible,
moveable
properties?</div><a name="06062056000341"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="06062056000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning to page
165 of schedule 21 and to one of the issues that arose prior to A-day,
Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs gave SIPP providers guidance
saying that SIPPs could invest in residential properties so long as
they did not become residential prior to 6 April 2006. A number of
people bought property off-plan, as it were, with a view to completing
after 6 April. There is sufficient transitional relief in place to
allow people who bought properties in the UK before 6 April to sell
them on, but in some territories, such as Florida, one can buy off-plan
only once.</div> <a name="06062056000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schemes
that have bought off-plan with a view to completing the transaction
post-6 April will find that they own residential property after that
date and are therefore subject to the penalties and charges set out in
schedule 21. Will the Minister carefully consider the situation of
schemes caught out by the change in Government policy, and will he
ensure that, where schemes are unable to sell their property before it
becomes residential, because of the rules in the States or whatever
country the property is located in, they are not caught by the penalty
charges?</div><a name="06062056000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
raise the subject of the penalty charges themselves. A number of
Committee members have received a brief in which Philip Baker QC gives
an opinion sought from him by a solicitor. He considered the four
charges put in place in the Finance Act 2004&#151;the unauthorised
payments charge, the unauthorised payments surcharge, the scheme
sanction charge and the potential deregistration charge&#151;in the
context of the European convention on human rights, particularly
articles 1 and 6. I do not want to go into the opinion in detail,
because it is fairly lengthy, but the nub of Philip Baker&#146;s
argument was that the charges were disproportionate given the potential
mischief; that is, given the tax relief that would be paid as a
consequence of investing savings in property, or as a result of
indirect investment in businesses. The penalties were much greater than
the tax loss, and there was no opportunity to mitigate that loss,
because the charges were automatic; there was no opportunity for
someone to appeal against them.</div>
<a name="06062056000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would be grateful for the
Economic Secretary&#146;s comments on Mr. Baker&#146;s opinion,
which suggests that the penalty regime in the 2004 Act could come under
scrutiny from the perspective of the European convention on human
rights and could lead to pension scheme operators embarking on a
significant amount of litigation at taxpayers&#146; expense. Does the
Economic Secretary think that that is likely to happen?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column733" />Column number: 734</div><a name="06062056000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">There have been changes to the
investment regime for SIPPs, which has become more restrictive than it
was under the 2004 Act; at that time, the rules were liberalised, so
the amount that a SIPP could borrow was reduced from 75 per cent. of
its assets to 50 per cent. of its assets. That seems one way to choke
off investment in residential property. Now that we have gone back to a
more restrictive regime, do the Government have any plans to relax the
restrictions on
borrowing?</div><a name="06062056000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000407"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> The hon. Gentleman asks four questions and I shall
try to cover all four. On the first point, which was about unquoted
shares and investments in business assets, as the hon. Gentleman knows,
the legislation is aimed at preventing abuse of the tax reliefs given
to pension schemes for investment in assets, which may provide the
opportunity for private use. The legislation ensures that such assets,
held by companies and other vehicles owned by pension schemes, are also
caught. If the legislation had not covered the ownership of such
property by investment vehicles, that would have provided a large
loophole; indeed, the legislation would have been largely ineffective.
Pension schemes, for example, could have invested money in private
companies that bought residential properties. A simple example would be
that of a SIPP owning 100 per cent. of shares in a company that owned a
flat in Marbella; that would be very little different from direct
ownership.</div><a name="06062056000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of
points have been made on investments in trading companies, to which the
hon. Gentleman referred. First, it is said that the scope of the
legislation is too broad, because it will catch genuine commercial
investments in trading stock and plant and machinery used in trades for
which there is no possibility of private use.</div>
<a name="06062056000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although that may be true in
some circumstances, there are also a number of occasions on which
trading stock or plant and machinery used in a trade may be available
for personal use; for example, fine wines, cars or residential property
development. In such cases, trading stock may well be available for
private use. Furthermore, assets held to provide benefit to employees
may well be plant and machinery held for the purpose of the trade, but
still available for private use. Those are exactly the loopholes that
we want to prevent.</div>
<a name="06062056000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has also been asserted that
it would be difficult for pension scheme administrators to monitor the
underlying activities of companies. We do not agree. Most trading
companies in which small pension schemes want to invest are controlled
by the pension scheme members themselves. The same people are often the
pension scheme trustees. Also, an investment in a trading company will
not be a genuine diverse commercial vehicle if only the pension scheme
and those associated with it control that company or if a member of the
scheme or connected person is a controlling director of the company.
There will therefore always be a controlling relationship for which tax
charges arise, and that will clearly allow the scheme administrator to
monitor the company.</div>
<a name="06062056000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also asserted that a
pension scheme might be caught when a scheme administrator or pension
scheme member would not be able to calculate the tax 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column734" />Column number: 735</div>charges that arise. We reject that assertion. As the hon. Gentleman
said, we have issued regulations to try to ensure that we can prevent
the opening up of those loopholes while allowing proper business
practices to continue.</div>
<a name="06062056000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have issued regulations that
allow investment in small items of property used in the administration
of vehicles owned by pension schemes. That allows investment companies
to hold the general items of administration&#151;chairs, desks,
computers and so on&#151;and therefore allows commercial investments
in such vehicles with a minimal risk of using pension scheme funds to
purchase assets for the private use of pension scheme members. As the
hon. Gentleman knows, we have provided for an order power to define
items of tangible moveable property that are not subject to the tax
charge. The draft order is available on the HMRC website for
comment.</div> <a name="06062056000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will
consider the representations made on trading companies by certain
sections of the industry and will consult informally on the draft
order. I hope that we will take up some of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
concerns, and some of the detail, in those more detailed
consultations.</div> <a name="06062056000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say
to the hon. Gentleman that until now we have not had representations on
the issue of transitional relief and the difficulties of international
property investment. If there are concerns about those points in the
industry, HMRC will be happy to talk to pension schemes or the
individuals concerned, but cannot guarantee that they will not come
within the provisions. Obviously, that will depend on the facts and
circumstances. However, we are happy to have discussions to ensure that
the concerns raised with the hon. Gentleman are picked up. However, so
far the issue has not been raised with
us.</div><a name="06062056000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s fourth point was about reducing the borrowing limit
for SIPPs from 75 per cent. to 50 per cent. The previous borrowing
limit allowed borrowing only of a specific asset type&#151;for
example, commercial property plus some short-term borrowing. The
short-term borrowing limit was trailed in the consultation documents on
simplifying the taxation of pensions. Of 200 respondents to the second
consultation, only 20 specifically mentioned that they believed the
level of 50 per cent. for scheme borrowing to be too low.</div>
<a name="06062056000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of people in the
industry have taken a different view. Stewart Ritchie of Scottish
Equitable has commented that 75 per cent. is too high, being a
potentially huge proportion of the funds; he actually favours such
restrictions. If there are representations about the new regime in
practice, we will look at them, but so far the majority of respondents
to the consultation have not raised that as a problem&#151;and some
have supported the reduction in the limit.</div>
<a name="06062056000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The final point is about the
European convention on human rights and the opinion of Philip Baker QC,
which has been circulated to the Committee. Tempted as I am to dwell
upon the irony of the hon. Member for Fareham using that convention to
probe whether the Government are being overly intrusive in impinging on
the human rights of individuals in Britain, Sir John, I fear moving
into a broader debate about whether the convention and its
incorporation here has been an advance, or whether we would prefer to
return to a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column735" />Column number: 736</div>previous era. I presume that I would be ruled out of order were I to
stray too far down that road. So, I will not dwell on the irony of that
point but will stick to the substance if that is OK with you, Sir
John.</div> <a name="06062056000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Philip Baker
makes a number of points. Generally, it would be fair to say that he,
as an individual practitioner in this area, has not been overly
enamoured of the Government&#146;s attempt to ensure prevention of
tax avoidance in these areas. Therefore, on the content of the
legislation and the importance of acting in this area he probably takes
a different view, as a matter of principle, to that of hon. Members on
both sides of the Committee. There are some more detailed points in his
opinion. We have looked at those issues and, contrary to what Mr. Baker
says, in our view in both measures that he addresses&#151;the issues
of provisions in this order in schedule 21, and the recycling
provisions which we will come to shortly&#151;we have struck a fair
balance between protecting the rights of the individual taxpayer and
safeguarding the public interest, by ensuring that the general body of
taxpayers bear no undue burden.</div>
<a name="06062056000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">These are generous reliefs and
it is important that they are not abused by some who seek to make them
even more so. We have a clear duty to protect the general body of
taxpayers. It would be wholly unfair to them if an individual were able
to receive these generous reliefs on pension saving&#151;on the clear
understanding that they were to be accumulated and invested prudently
to produce a retirement income&#151;when they were in fact being used
to buy a yacht, fine wine or an expensive coastal beach hut. In our
view, that would not be right; nor would it be right if some should
seek to double up a relief without putting in any more general
additional pension savings. We will come to those issues in a moment,
but in both cases we have put in place provisions which encourage
people to stick to the rules. They provide for a range of tax charges
to apply in particular cases and are proportionate to the mischief that
they seek to address. In my view, while he is well intentioned, Philip
Baker QC is not right to accuse us of not striking the right
balance.</div> <a name="06062056000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having spent
a considerable time some years ago on the issue of windfall tax on
private utilities, I note that my sense is that when it comes to making
tax policy, a sovereign Parliament has substantial powers and
responsibilities, but also latitude to ensure that so long as
legislators move correctly through parliamentary processes that this
matter remains sovereign to Parliament. Personally, I think that right
and proper. It should be for Parliament to make those decisions, so
long as they are done in an open, transparent and fair manner and that
we strike the right kind of balance. That was undoubtedly so in the
case of the windfall tax. Lawyers said that a legal challenge could
arise but when people looked at the detail they concluded that it would
not. That was why, despite a years&#146; scaremongering, when it came
to it no such legal challenge
arose.</div>
<a name="06062056000342"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="06062056000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill is
also clearly well intentioned in aiming to protect the British
taxpayer. That is being done in an open and consultative way, and I
hope and believe that it will have support from both sides of the
House. We have struck a careful, fair and proportionate balance. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column736" />Column number: 737</div>On that basis, the right thing for us to do, as Members of a sovereign
Parliament, is to agree to the provisions.

Hoban:</b> I thank the Economic Secretary for his remarks. I
would have been much more nervous had my hon. Friend the Member for
South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) been here, because he would have
questioned my use of the ECHR rather than the Economic
Secretary&#146;s breathtaking irony. I am delighted that he is sure
of the penalty regime&#146;s correctness and confident that it will
withstand all challenges. We look forward to that proving to be the

transitional reliefs, I note the Economic Secretary&#146;s remarks on

have been noted. On borrowing, I welcome the fact that he talked about
the consultation process that had gone on prior to this legislation and
the support for the existing borrowing limits.</div>
<a name="06062056000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the unquoted shares,
according to the Economic Secretary&#146;s explanation, it seems that
the problem started when the rules were relaxed in the Finance Act 2004
and we had investment in the pension Picasso, the pension Porsche, the
pension penthouse and so on. He said that he will consider
representations from the industry on that. In trying to stamp out one
particular set of abuses, we must be careful that we do not deprive
SIPPs of the opportunity to invest in other assets where they might
feel it to be in their interest. I hope that the industry takes up his

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000411"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Economic Secretary alluded to the clause in his
remarks in the schedule 21 stand part debate. The clause is interesting
and perhaps I should explain a little of the background. It appears to
be quite a sweeping clause as it lays a charge of 55 per cent. on the
pension commencement lump sum of people who make a significant increase
in their pension contribution having already received the lump sum or
in the knowledge that they will receive a high lump sum in the
future.</div><a name="06062056000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provision
could capture a great deal of pre-retirement pension planning, as
anyone who makes a significant contribution to their pension prior to
retirement will do so envisaging that it will lead to a higher pension
commencement lump sum. A pension 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column737" />Column number: 738</div>commencement lump sum is what was hitherto referred to as a tax-free
lump sum that people received when they retired. The provision could
lead to a situation in which someone who makes a significant increase
in his pension contributions prior to retirement gets taxed on the lump
sum because he knew that making a significant increase in his
contribution would lead to a higher pension commencement lump sum. We
are talking about a perfectly reasonable form of pension
planning.</div><a name="06062056000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is, in
a nutshell, how the clause works. Having said that its effects are
quite sweeping, its broad effects are mitigated by 28 pages of
non-statutory guidance notes that act to restrict it. Take away those
guidance notes and many people could be swept within its scope.
</div><a name="06062056000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has been possible
for people to recycle lump sums as contributions to pension schemes
since at least 1988 and possibly as far back as 1956. All that they
must do is take the benefit and reinvest the tax-free lump sum as a
pension contribution if they have unused allowable pension
contributions. Historically, it was not much of an issue, as the limits
on pension contributions as a percentage of earnings were relatively
low and based on age, although there was a nuance whereby people could
carry forward six years of unused contribution relief for retirement
annuities.</div><a name="06062056000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">By lifting
the cap on contributions and making it much easier to withdraw lump
sums from pension funds, the A-day regime has created an opportunity
for people to reinvest those lump sums in pensions. They can
effectively invest 100 per cent. of their salary in a pension fund in
any particular year, and the unsecured income option allows them to
take the cash and still draw no income at all. They do not need to take
their pension benefit when they withdraw the cash and reinvest it in a
lump sum. It does not take a genius to realise that there is a big
potential for tax
loss.</div><a name="06062056000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example, if
someone has a &#163;400,000 scheme, they could withdraw
&#163;100,000 and invest it in a new scheme, gaining tax relief for
&#163;40,000. From thatnew &#163;100,000 pension fund,
they could extract a further 25 per cent., or &#163;25,000, invest
that in a new pension fund and receive tax relief at 40 per
cent.&#151;a further allowance increase of &#163;10,000. The
process can go on iteratively until the money is
exhausted.</div><a name="06062056000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 160
and the 28 pages of guidance seek to tighten up the rules to prevent
the alleged potential for widespread abuse of recycling by preventing
people from withdrawing lump sums from their pension funds and
reinvesting them. The change was heralded in the 2005 pre-Budget
report, which
stated:</div><a name="06062056000329"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;action will also
be taken to prevent abuse of the rules for tax-free lump sums from 6
April 2006. The legislation will remove tax advantages where lump sums
are recycled back into funds in order to generate artificial levels of
tax relief.&#148;</div><a name="06062056000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The draft
legislation has put that into effect. The pre-Budget report
announcement suggested that we should tackle those
abuses.</div><a name="06062056000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">According
to the details of the rules, a scheme can make an unauthorised payment
if several conditions are satisfied. The pension commencement lump sum
received must exceed 1 per cent. of the standard lifetime allowance,
which is currently &#163;1.5 million&#151;in other words, the lump
sum must be &#163;15,000 or more. The additional pension contribution
must exceed 30 per cent. of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column738" />Column number: 739</div>lump sum and must be a significant increase in the contributions paid.
Also, the taxpayer must have envisaged that the lump sum would have led
to a significant increase in contributions at the relevant
time.</div><a name="06062056000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">From looking at
the pre-Budget report announcement, I would assume that the sequence
envisaged was the receipt of a lump sum followed by the payment of a
significantly increased pension contribution. However, the
Bill&#146;s definition of &#147;relevant time&#148; means that an
individual can make the significantly increased pension contribution
and then receive the pension commencement lump sum.</div>
<a name="06062056000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">The sequence works both ways. A
person can either receive a lump sum and reinvest it to get the tax
relief or make significant contributions now in the knowledge that they
could receive a significantly enhanced pre-commencement lump sum later.
It is the latter sequence that causes a problem, because it captures
what people might think is legitimate pre-retirement tax
planning.</div><a name="06062056000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Revenue and
Customs has recognised that that could have an impact on ordinary
retirement planning. Its guidance notes include four paragraphs on
pre-planning&#151;less than one page out of 28 to tackle an issue
that is difficult to identify. It says in paragraph
4.4:</div><a name="06062056000330"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
must be pre-planning for the recycling rule to be triggered, an
individual will know that a conscious decision has been taken to use a
pension commencement lump sum as a direct or indirect means to pay
significantly greater contributions to a registered pension
scheme.&#148;</div><a name="06062056000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">That seems quite
clear, but let us consider three examples to help illustrate the
divergence of the broader
circumstances.</div><a name="06062056000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us
consider Mr. B of Westminster, who is planning to retire shortly. He
might decide to increase his pension contributions, knowing that that
will lead to an increased lump sum. The language of the 2004 Act
suggests that he envisaged that that would be caught, but the meaning
of the guidance notes is clear: it would restrict the application of
the provision, because although he knew about it, he did it and nothing
seemed to happen
deliberately.</div><a name="06062056000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the same Mr. B took out a pension commencement lump sum and reinvested
it in another pension fund, assuming all the other conditions were met,
in terms of the amount withdrawn and the change to the contribution
package, HMRC would say that it was recycling and would levy the
additional charge. But what if Mr. B decided to sell a flat and put the
proceeds in his pension fund, rather than topping up his savings,
knowing that he would, as a consequence of investing that money in his
pension fund, receive a higher pension commencement lump sum to
replenish his savings? He knew that the investment would lead to a
higher pension commencement lump sum and that he did not need to put
the proceeds of the sale in his savings, because he would be able to
withdraw that lump sum later and replenish his savings that way. There
is a relationship: he knew that he would draw a lump sum out in future,
so why should he tap into the savings now? Why should he not use the
proceeds from the sale of the flat to top up his pension scheme? He
would have entered into an arrangement apparently in the knowledge that
it would lead to an increase in his contributions. I am not sure how
that would be treated. It seems to be a legitimate approach, but it
does not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column739" />Column number: 740</div>satisfy either of the polar cases that I mentioned at the outset: it was
neither a straightforward transaction made on his income, nor did he
take any money out of his pension commencement lump
sum.</div><a name="06062056000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000412"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> The hon. Gentleman mentioned the relevant time,
which is defined in the clause. It refers to
</div><a name="06062056000331"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;paragraph (a) of
sub-paragraph (2)&#148;.</div><a name="06062056000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
does not refer to paragraph (2)(b), which deals with the
&#147;envisaged&#148; point that the hon. Gentleman is
making.</div><a name="06062056000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000413"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point and
it illustrates the complexity of the rules: a relatively
straightforward, short clause needs to be explained by 28 pages of
guidance notes. It is a sweeping clause that causes a problem with the
sequencing of
events.</div><a name="06062056000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would restrict the clause so that it only tackled circumstances where
the lump sum is received and recycled. It does not take into account
situations where contributions are increased with the intention that a
higher lump sum will be received in future; it considers recycling as
set out in the PBR measure, which proposed that there would be a clear
sequence&#151;receive lump sum and invest&#151;rather than any
other
relationship.</div><a name="06062056000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 143 would restrict the scope of the clause by lifting the threshold
for investigation from1 per cent. of standard lifetime
allowance to 10Â per cent. This is a probing amendment. The
&#163;15,000 threshold is potentially quite low and could lead to a
significant burden on administrators and others who are trying to
identify contributions that have been made. I wonder whether that is
too low and does not focus on wide scale abuses, and whether it will
pick up a wide range of pre-retirement planning in a grey area. We need
to recognise that the taxation consequence of breaching the clause is a
55 per cent. charge on the pension commencement lump sum and is not
based on the additional contribution that a member might make to the
scheme.</div>
<a name="06062056000343"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="06062056000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not know
whether 10 per cent. is the right level or whether it should be varied
between 1 and 10 per cent., but I would like the Government to explain
why1 per cent. has been chosen as the right level. Is there a
better a level that would not pick up a relatively low level of
transactions that were not directed towards abusing the recycling
regime?</div><a name="06062056000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a
broader concern. This is a short clause with extensive guidance notes
attached to it that do not have statutory status. They could be changed
and amended. My concern is that the breadth of this clause is so great
that there need to be stricter and more tightly defined regulations
underpinning it that the House can discuss. Otherwise the Government
could at some stage in the future withdraw the guidance notes and allow
the clause to have its full effect.</div>
<a name="06062056000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, could the Economic
Secretary guarantee that the provision does not affect the tax-free
status of the lump sum? This is one of the first times in which that
status has not been used in legislation and there is reference to a
pension commencement lump sum. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column740" />Column number: 741</div>sweeping nature of this clause may lead to tax charges being levied in
the future and I would welcome the Economic Secretary&#146;s
clarification that the intention behind this clause is not to remove
the tax-free status of that
sum.</div><a name="06062056000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000414"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> The answer on that last point is no; of course,
that is not the intention and that has been made clear in the pensions
White Paper and by me today. The new pensions tax regime, which we have
put in place since 6 April, will make it easier for people to invest
for their retirement using tax relief by lifting the limit on
contributions. Individuals can save as much as they like, where they
like in registered pension schemes, with annual tax relief on
contributions limited to the lower of 100 per cent. of earnings or
&#163;215, 000.</div><a name="06062056000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
became aware of the potential within these new, generous and less
restrictive rules for a systematic exploitation that could lead to
potentially generous and substantial amounts of tax relief being
diverted through a device known as recycling or turbo-charging. Under
this device, an individual&#146;s tax-free lump sum is put back into
a pension scheme as a further tax relief contribution.</div>
<a name="06062056000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">To explain how turbo-charging
occurs, let us consider an individual with a pension pot of
&#163;100,000 who takes a tax-free lump sum of &#163;25,000,
leaving &#163;75,000 in his pension pot. He then puts the lump sum
back into the pension scheme as a contribution, and this picks up a
basic rate relief of &#163;7,051 on the way back in. He also gets a
further &#163;5,769 in higher relief in his pocket. If he stops
there, he has inflated his pension pot from &#163;100,000 to more
than &#163;107,000 and has got a further &#163;5,769 in his pension
pot, all from the same money going round in a circle and picking up
Exchequer relief funds on the way. He can go further if he wishes by
putting his higher-rate relief back into the pension pot as well, and
he could also repeat that cycle to get further relief and inflate his
pot even more. I am not sure whether there is a technical term for
that. It may be called repeated reverse turbo-charging.
[<i class="I">Interruption.</i>] Or reheated turbo-charging, perhaps.</div>
<a name="06062056000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">What I need to clarify is that
we believe that very few lump sum payments will be affected by the
rules that we are putting in place to deal with this issue. I am
grateful to the hon. Gentleman for allowing me to correct a fundamental
misconception. Some people have wrongly assumed that our aim is to
prevent individuals from putting additional contributions into their
pension schemes late in their working lives to fulfil a shortfall in
their fund and ensure that their pension benefits pay out as much as
they have been hoping for. That is something that we want to encourage.
We are happy for individuals to put genuine additional money into their
pension funds, including lump sums.</div>
<a name="06062056000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">The recycling measure does not
aim to catch or prevent that behaviour. It aims to catch individuals
who deliberately take their tax-free lump sum in order to put it back
into a registered pension scheme and generate additional tax reliefs
through an artificial circulation of the same money, and it will catch
them only if that happens in a structured and pre-planned way. We were
keen to deal with the misconception, and that is why we produced a
substantial amount&#151;
<div class="Column"><a name="Column741" />Column number: 742</div>28 pages, as the hon. Gentleman said&#151;of guidance for what is, as
he said, a short piece of legislation.</div>
<a name="06062056000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The guidance, however, does not
seek to add to, amend or change the intent of the clause. It aims to
make it clear that the cases that some people have feared might get
caught inadvertently will not be caught. The intent of the legislation
is absolutely clear. That is why the Chartered Institute of Taxation
concluded:</div> <a name="06062056000332"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;HMRC have
consulted effectively on these changes; the resulting
rules&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06062056000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">that, I
think, means both the clauses and the
guidance&#151;</div><a name="06062056000333"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;seek to
separate structured tax avoidance from accidental or insignificant
increases to pension fund payments, while the guidance includes a lot
of excellent worked
examples.&#148;</div><a name="06062056000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
fact that there are 28 pages of guidance is evidence of the fullness as
well as the excellence of those worked examples. They are there to make
clear what we are attempting to do, which is to stop recycled
turbo-charging or reverse and multiple turbo-charging, without trying
to disadvantage people genuinely trying to top up their pension
funds.</div> <a name="06062056000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had to
act in that way with the legislation and guidance because the
simplification and shift in more generous limits, as a result of the
A-day reforms, means that, although in the previous regime past
restrictions made it difficult for deliberate tax avoidance through
turbo-charging and reverse multiple turbo-charging to occur, the matter
could conceivably arise in our new more light-touch and deregulated
pension tax regime. Through the use of guidance in the clause, we
wanted to make clear that that tax avoidance would not be
allowed.</div><a name="06062056000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman spoke to three different amendments. Amendment No. 141 would
effectively allow individuals to step around the anti-recycling
provisions quite easily. As drafted, the provision ensures that it is
not possible to get round the anti-recycling rule by making additional
contributions before taking the lump sum&#151;for example, by funding
them with short-term borrowing to be repaid when a lump sum is
received. That potential means of sidestepping the rule was touted
around in the specialist press even before the draft legislation was
published. Such pre-emptive multiple turbo-charging is something that
we are not minded to allow to occur, but the amendment would allow it
to happen. That is why I urge the hon. Gentleman not to press
it.</div> <a name="06062056000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 142
seeks to replace the word &#147;envisaged&#148; with
&#147;intended.&#148; The hon. Gentleman explained why. Twenty
years ago, in studies on the philosophy of mind, which were part of my
degree, I read an interesting book by Professor Davidson from the
University of California, called &#147;Actions, Reasons and
Causes<i class="I">&#148;. </i>It is<i class="I"> </i>an excellent and forward-thinking
book in which almost the entire text of 300 to 400 pages focuses on the
use of terms such as action, reason and intention. As those who have
studied those terms will know, they have quite different
meanings.</div> <a name="06062056000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">A desire to
do something is different from an intention to do something. An
intention is a narrower and more purposeful word. I might like, desire
or hope to do something, but to intend to do somethingimplies
a degree of pre-planning and foresight, and of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column742" />Column number: 743</div>structuring one&#146;s behaviour in order to go down a particular
road. It is different from the word &#147;envisage&#148;, which has
a broader meaning. This philosophical discourse on the meaning of
&#147;intention&#148; is, I hope, relevant to our broader debate on
tax policy. I must say that I never realised back then that Professor
Davidson&#146;s book would become useful in a Finance Bill Committee
for multiple reasons that I shall not dwell
on.</div><a name="06062056000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">When drafting the
Bill, we considered the issue and consulted with lawyers&#151;but not
philosophers. However, we have seen in this Committee that it is
possible to be a Member of Parliament and a lawyer; presumably it is
possible to be a Member of Parliament and a philosopher, or even a
lawyer and a philosopher, and therefore to have a philosophical, as
well as a merely legal, discussion about the use of
&#147;intention&#148;. In the case of recycling, in which a lump
sum is taken, the term &#147;intended&#148; is used and&#151;I go
back to my earlier remarks about the philosophy of mind&#151;that
suggests that the individual must actively plan the recycling on the
date that they receive the lump sum. If I intend to go to the zoo, one
would assume that I know the date on which I am going; I may have even
made a plan. A desire to go to the zoo would mean that I will perhaps
go at some point over the summer.</div>
<a name="06062056000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">An intention would normally
imply a degree of active planning around the receipt of the lump sum,
and that means that a case where the recycling had been planned and set
up before that date so that no further action was necessary on the part
of the individual on the date itself, might not be caught. Similarly, a
case where an individual had made arrangements for someone else, such
as an employer, to make additional contributions might not be caught.
However, in such a case, the individual may not be
&#147;intending&#148;. &#147;Envisaging&#148; is a broader
term; it might be an intention on behalf of someone else, rather than a
personal intention. &#147;Envisaging&#148; may mean opening up the
possibility that someone else may use the provision&#151;in this
case, to recycle the lump sum on that date. If
&#147;envisaging&#148; were used, that case would be caught. The
difference between &#147;envisaged&#148; and
&#147;intended&#148; is subtle but essential.
&#147;Envisage&#148; will cover the concept of intention, as sought
by the amendment, and will go a little wider, so as to ensure that we
catch all necessary
cases.</div><a name="06062056000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure that
the hon. Gentleman will have reflected on those issues when drafting
the amendment, but I urge him to reflect further and agree that we
cannot risk a change that might render the legislation ineffective
against some of the most offensive pre-planned cases of recycling. In
some of those cases, the word &#147;intention&#148; may not be the
most appropriate way of catching the action, reason and cause in
question.</div><a name="06062056000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
turning to amendment No. 143, the recycling legislation has been
carefully framed to strike a balance between deterring recycling
activity, catching the more blatant and artificial cases and leaving
unaffected those smaller pensions savers and those going about the
normal business of retirement planning. To achieve that balance, we
have included a threshold of 1 per cent. of standard lifetime
allowance, or &#163;15,000 in a tax year. Individuals taking total
lump sums of no more than that amount in a 12-month period will not be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column743" />Column number: 744</div>caught by the rule. The amendment would increase that threshold tenfold
from &#163;15,000 to &#163;150,000.</div>
<a name="06062056000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the generosity and
flexibility of the A-day regime, introducing that further substantial
increase in the threshold would be unnecessary and would make the
legislation ineffective in all but the most exceptionally large cases.
It would not provide an effective deterrent against recycling activity,
because the majority of people using deliberate and planned recycling
and tax avoidance schemes would know that they could safely do so
within the ambit of the legislation as a result of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s
amendment.</div><a name="06062056000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposed threshold of &#163;15,000 already carves out the majority of
pension savers. To go further,from &#163;15,000 to
&#163;150,000, would be grossly disproportionate. We think that we
have struck the right balance, allowing small pensions savers not to
trigger recycling rules, but catching the medium and larger potential
multiple and turbo-charging recyclers. On that basis, we urge the hon.
Gentleman to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06062056000344"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000415"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I did not appreciate when I started on the Finance
Bill that, as well as seeking advice from accountants and pension
experts, I would need to seek the guidance of philosophers. If only I
had, I would have come up with a more elegant rebuttal of the Economic
Secretary&#146;s way of distinguishing between
&#147;envisaged&#148; and &#147;intended&#148;. Without wishing
to do a disservice to him, it is perhaps just as well that it was his
officials who drafted the guidance notes. We would have had a much more
weighty philosophical treatise landing on the desks of pension advisers
if he, rather than his officials, had done
so.</div><a name="06062056000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a way, the
Economic Secretary undermined his arguments. He said that the Bill was
trying to capture structured and preplanned tax avoidance. I was struck
by that. When he read from Professor Davidson&#146;s book&#151;or
recalled chunks from memory&#151;the explanation of
&#147;intended&#148; mostly aligned with the definitions that he
had given himself. &#147;Intended&#148; would appear
philosophically to be the right word, since structured and preplanned
tax avoidance was going on, rather than vague
&#147;envisaging&#148;.</div><a name="06062056000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;Envisaged&#148;
is too vague a word. The Economic Secretary gave the reasons, because
the measure is about capturing preplanned and structured tax avoidance,
not some vague whim or thought about what should
happen.</div><a name="06062056000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000416"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> Planning and preplanning seem to be the same
thing. Did the hon. Member for Fareham envisage the response of the
Economic Secretary, or did he intend the
response?</div><a name="06062056000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000417"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> That is a good one. I thought that the Economic
Secretary&#146;s response would be intended, in the sense that it
would be planned and structured. The line between
&#147;envisaged&#148; and &#147;intended&#148; is difficult to
draw, but given that he is seeking to capture structured transactions
that aim, through recycling, reheated turbocharging or whatever, to
lead to tax avoidance, &#147;intended&#148; is better than
&#147;envisaged&#148;.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column744" />Column number: 745</div><a name="06062056000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not dispute the Economic
Secretary&#146;s view that the guidance notes are good&#151;he used
the word &#147;excellent&#148;. There are 21 examples in those
guidance notes that give a flavour of what the Government are seeking
to capture. He is right that the guidance notes are not seeking to
expand the scope of the legislation&#151;far from it. They are
restricting the legislation. They are making the clause much tighter
and clearer for its application and narrowing the scope significantly,
trying to highlight the circumstances that would be captured.
Separating the clause and the guidance notes is difficult, because
without the guidance notes the clause would have far wider
ramifications than is intended at the
moment.</div><a name="06062056000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">My concern is
that looking at the clause and notes together today is all very well,
but in six months&#146; or one or two years&#146; time those
guidance notes could change, relaxing the narrow scope now given and
leading to wider transactions being caught within the clause, causing
unintended mischief. The problem is that the guidance notes will not
come back for scrutiny to this Committee, or to another Committee of
the House. They can be changed by Revenue and Customs, or at its
behest, with or without consultation with the industry. That is what I
am most concerned
about.</div><a name="06062056000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is our
only chance to debate the clause and the guidance notes. Much more of
the Minister&#146;s thinking should be in either the primary or the
secondary legislation, rather than tucked away in guidance notes, which
can be changed at whim without a decision of the House. That is my
principal concern. Although I shall withdraw the amendment, I hope to
come back with some further thoughts on the matter on Report because
the House needs more control over what is happening to pension funds,
while less control needs to be delegated to the civil service, no
matter how good its members are at drawing up regulations and guidance
notes. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="06062056000196"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment, by leave,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000418"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> The difficulty with turbocharging or recycling
arose when we introduced the &#163;1.5 million lifetime pension pot
and the contributions regime of &#163;215,000 or 100 per cent.
earnings in a given year, whichever was the lower figure. The financial
press started talking about recycling and so on. A long time ago I
wrote to the Paymaster General about the problem and I wish to thank
her publicly for clause 160, although I am sure that it was not a
direct consequence of my letter. Other people made representations
about the matter because the loophole seemed huge and one to be
exploited almost invariably by the very rich, those with the huge
pension pots. I thank her for dealing with the matter under clause
160.</div><a name="06062056000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000419"></a>Ed

to be precise and, thus, to be sparse. Casting a philosophical eye on
such matters sometimes leads to greater efficiency of language, rather
than a proliferation of terminology. It is also important to get
matters right. In our view, &#147;intention&#148; was too narrow. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column745" />Column number: 746</div>I assure the hon. Gentleman that, if significant material changes are

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000420"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> We have just touched on two issues. I expect that
the Economic Secretary probably had prior notice of both of them as
they were set out in briefing supplied by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales. I refer first to the interaction of
inheritance tax and income tax charges. Under the Finance Act 2004,
rules were introduced to set up alternatively secured pensions to meet
the objection to annuities of members of Plymouth Brethren. They
enabled people to draw down income from their pension fund after the
age of 75 rather than by an annuity.</div>
<a name="06062056000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the mechanism that the
Government put in place, on the death of a pension fund member,
leftover funds that can be left to a surviving spouse. If they hold the
same view on annuities or choose not to buy an annuity, there will be
leftover funds for other dependants. A series of tax consequences arise
from the timing of a death of a pensioner and their spouse and from the
use to which the fund was put at the time of
death.</div><a name="06062056000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me give
five examples of such circumstances. First, if Mr. Jones dies before he
takes any benefit from his pension fund&#151;Mr. Jones being a member
of the scheme&#151;the fund is under discretionary disposal and free
from inheritance tax. That is clear. If Mr. Jones died when he had
started to take unsecured income, but before the age of 75, and if the
fund had not paid out a lump sum, income tax would
apply.</div><a name="06062056000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sir John, I
appreciate that I should have spoken about these matters under the
schedule stand part

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000421"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I was coming to that conclusion myself.
Does the hon. Gentleman wish to have such a debate on schedule 22 stand
part, or does he want to have it now? The clause is purely an enabling
clause. I shall leave that to his discretion, but he cannot have the
discussion
twice.</div><a name="06062056000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000422"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Sir John, at this stage of what I thought was the
final sitting, I do not wish to debate such matters twice. I apologise
for having been too keen and eager to participate in the debate. I hope
that I have your leave, Sir John, to continue on this matter. I promise
not to recycle my remarks.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column746" />Column number: 747</div><a name="06062056000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000423"></a>The

with the enabling clause immediately and then move to schedule 22, to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000424"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I apologise to Committee members for the confusion
that I inadvertently created. I am not sure how those transcribing the
proceedings will cut and paste what has happened into the report. To
recap without recycling the points that I have made, I was elaborating
on the five circumstances that relate to the interaction between income
tax and IHT in respect of alternatively secured
pensions.</div><a name="06062056000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
example is that if Mr. Jones should die once he had started to take his
unsecured income, but before age 75, the fund would be paid as a lump
sum and a 35 per cent. income tax charge would apply. The third
circumstance is that if he should die once he had gone into the
alternatively secured pension, no tax charge would arise as long as he
had nominated his spouse to receive the fund into her SIPP.</div>
<a name="06062056000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fourth example is that if
Mrs. Jones died before age 75, the leftover fund would be paid out and
subject to a 35 per cent. income tax charge. However, because the fund
would have derived from Mr. Jones&#146;s alternatively secured
pension, inheritance tax would apply as well. The inheritance tax
charge would take precedence and apply before the income tax charge,
and the effect would be a combined tax burden of61 per cent.
If, however, Mrs. Jones died after age 75, having used the ASP, the
leftover fund&#151;the one transferred to any dependants&#151;would
be subject to inheritance tax. There are varying tax rates. Is the
intention behind the schedule to give rise to an effective 61 per cent.
tax rate in the circumstances that I identified in my fourth
example?</div><a name="06062056000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">My next brief
point is about requirements. Paragraph 2 of the schedule legislates for
an existing Revenue and Customs concession, which exempts a pension
fund from IHT when the member who died before age 75 had yet to buy an
annuity. However, that exemption does not apply if members are in poor
health; the suggestion might be that they had deferred the annuity to
maximise the death benefit. That provision would apply when the
decision to defer taking the annuity was made within two years before
death.</div> <a name="06062056000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question
asked by the ICAW is what steps beneficiaries and executors need to
take to establish what the deceased knew about the state of their
health when they decided not to take an annuity. It might be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column747" />Column number: 748</div>rather difficult for them both emotionally and otherwise to establish
what the deceased knew at any point in time. Will the Minister set out
what would be acceptable information in those

Goldsworthy</b> (Falmouth and Camborne) (LD): I have a brief
point about new section 2C of the Inheritance Tax Act 1984, which
follows from the remarks of the hon. Member for Fareham. Will there be
no inheritance tax charge if the individual dies before 75 and passes
the inheritance on to his partner, spouse, dependant or a charity, or
if the individual chose not to take his pension when in good health?
Where does the burden of proof lie for the motives of the deceased. and
what records does the Minister expect individuals to keep with regard
to understanding their medical position, which clearly could be an
additional burden? Will people be exempt only if they can provide that
proof, or will the assumption be that they did not have that knowledge
beforehand?</div>
<a name="06062056000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000426"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> Clauses 161 and schedule 22 set out the inheritance
tax rules for choices made by members of registered pension schemes on
or after 6 April 2006. In broad terms, the measures provide that
longstanding inheritance tax rules for scheme members under the age of
75 will continue to apply as before, so in most cases there is no
inheritance tax to pay. For those over 75, the measures bring the
alternatively secured pension option within the IHT framework and will
come into effect from 6 April for consistency with other pension
simplification measures.</div>
<a name="06062056000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee will recall that
the ASP has a new option available for A-day for scheme members aged 75
or over. Some people have principled religious objections to the
mortality risk inherent in annuities. ASPs were designed specifically
to enable those with such objections to benefit from tax-privileged
pension savings.</div> <a name="06062056000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
may help the Committee if I give a little background information. We
were asked last year to clarify how the IHT rules would apply to
pension choices post-A-day. That followed widespread media speculation
that wider choices open to members under the new post A-day pension
rules would provide opportunities for IHT planning. We launched the
discussion exercise with key industry stakeholders about how the
existing IHT law could be applied to the choices under the new pension
rules. We are grateful to all who responded to HMRC&#146;s discussion
paper. Their comments have materially affected us in finalising the new
rules.</div> <a name="06062056000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">The responses
confirm that, without change, IHT will arise in situations that were
IHT-free in the past. The broad consensus with the longstanding IHT
rules should continue for scheme members under 75, and new rules should
be introduced specifically targeted at leftover funds and ASPs. We
agree that that is a broad approach and is what the provisions achieve.
Generally death benefits under pension schemes are IHT-free for scheme
members under 75, but an IHT charge can arise in certain circumstances
under a pension scheme where a general IHT anti-avoidance rule is
triggered. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column748" />Column number: 749</div>rules are complex: they interact with the state of the scheme and
members&#146; health. There are two particular instances that relate
to the deferral of the scheme member&#146;s pension, where in
practice an IHT charge is not taken under the resulting enhanced death
benefits.</div><a name="06062056000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">One is where
death benefits are paid to the scheme member&#146;s bereaved spouse
or civil partner or their financial dependant. The other is where the
scheme member was in good health when they first admitted to draw their
pension, so no IHT charge was triggered, but despite a subsequent
deterioration of their life expectancy they simply continued to defer
their pension. We are legislating so that concessionary practice for
the anti-avoidance charge continues not to be triggered in those
circumstances, and where death benefits are paid to a charity we are
ensuring that they, too, are IHT-free.</div>
<a name="06062056000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other aspect of this
measure sets out the IHT rules where scheme members die with funds in
an ASP. They restrict control over the amount of income that they
withdraw under ASP rules. That means that there must almost always be
funds left over on the scheme member&#146;s death, and it is
necessary to bring those ASP funds within the IHT framework in a way
that is consistent with the existing rules. This measure means that
there will be no IHT charge on any ASP funds paid in one of three ways:
to provide pension benefits for the scheme member&#146;s spouse or
civil partner; to provide such benefits for any person who is
financially dependent on a scheme member at the time of his or her
death or whether funds are paid to charity, or else IHT will be charged
with the leftover ASP funds where a scheme member dies; or on any funds
left over where a dependent&#146;s pension benefits cease, except
where on the death of a dependant they are paid to charity. Scheme
administrators will be responsible for paying and accounting for the
tax to HMRC. We are working closely with the industry to strike an
appropriate
balance.</div><a name="06062056000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Member for Fareham mentioned, we have had consultation with some
religious groups about whether it would be possible for there to be
particular and special treatment for them. The Plymouth Brethren are
one such example. They have contributed to the HMRC consultations on
the IHT changes, and we have carefully considered their comments. We
are clearly sympathetic to the principled religious objections that
they have set out. Indeed, they were part of the thinking behind this
whole area of
legislation.</div><a name="06062056000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
we cannot simply carve out specific groups from tax. Leftover funds can
be given tax-free to charity, but we cannot have particular and
specific carve outs relating to members of a specific religious group.
We are sympathetic to the position. We have tried our best to ensure
that this is a general provision that allows us to be sympathetic to
particular concerns and beliefs, but we cannot have a particular carve
out for those groups. As I said, ASP leftover funds can be given
tax-free to charity.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000428"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> I mean the hon. Member for Fareham; I feel as if we
have been here before. He reminds me that it is important to be careful
in the use of language, which takes us back to our preceding
philosophical discussions. I clearly made an unintended and unenvisaged
slip for which there was no reason or cause. All I can do is ask the
Committee&#146;s leave to withdraw it.</div>
<a name="06062056000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Fareham asked about two particular points. One was whether
we are imposing a double tax charge and whether that is our intention.
The answer is no. There is nothing new in what we are doing. The
particular instances that he set out could have arisen in the pre-A-day
situation as well. For example, overlapping charges could have arisen
where an unsecured pension was paid out as a cash sum to the
member&#146;s estate, attracting both a pension scheme tax charge and
an IHT charge. Depending on the options chosen, the tax charges cannot
overlap in two circumstances where leftover ASP funds are involved. One
is where funds are refunded to an employer and the other is where
remaining funds are paid out as a cash sum on the death of a dependant
under the age of 75.</div>
<a name="06062056000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are choices in the
pension rules on how pension funds can be used, so no one is forced
down a particular road. Generous tax reliefs are given to provide a
secure income on retirement, and where ASP funds are paid other than
for that purpose there is no reason why tax charges should not
apply.</div> <a name="06062056000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
issue that the hon. Member for Fareham raises is whether we are
imposing unfair or unreasonable burdens of proof on executors. No
changes are proposed to the previous HMRC approach. The evidence of
health requirement will continue to be operated on the same lines as
have applied under tax bulletin 2 since 1992. HMRC is fully aware that
this is a sensitive area. We also need to act in a sensitive manner,
but this process has operated in a relatively smooth way under the
previous practice. We have no reason to think that these legislative
provisions will operate any differently.</div>
<a name="06062056000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">Depending on the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s view, he will be either pleased or concerned to note
that we will be publishing updated guidance on these matters on the
post-IHT A-day rules. The hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia
Goldsworthy) also raised this issue. The answer is that, in terms of
the burden of proof, things will operate as they have done in the past.
We will ensure, through guidance, that there are no undue bumps along
that road.</div>

attention to the wording on page 172? The word &#147;actually&#148;
in proposed new subsection (2B) is inelegant and redundant and should
not be included.</div> <a name="06062056000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">More
importantly, I ask him to re-examine the wording further down the page
in proposed new subsection (2C)(b), because I fear that the liberal use
of negatives means that it has the reverse effect of what he intended.
It may be simply that I am not able to read it well because it so
inelegantly worded, but I ask him to look at again&#151;not today,

Celia Barlow</b> (Hove) (Lab): I wholeheartedly support Clause
163, raising the threshold for stamp duty land tax on residential
transactions from &#163;120,000 to &#163;125,000. This, of course,
follows the welcome doubling of the threshold in March last year and
Government initiatives to help young people and key workers to get on
the housing ladder.</div>
<a name="06062056000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the average price for
a residential property in Brighton and Hove has risen to
&#163;222,241 in the first quarter. A flat or maisonette costs, on
average, &#163;168,236. That implies that the increase will probably
not have the desired effect in my part of the world. Although we have
made great progress in tackling homelessness, with a 75 per cent. cut
in people sleeping rough since 1997, and although tens of thousands of
people have been given new life chances, homelessness and overcrowding
are still key indicators of child poverty. There are also many young
families and public servants in my area who face difficulties in buying
their own homes, albeit even the tiniest flat.</div>
<a name="06062056000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">I therefore tactfully ask the
Minister whether further such increases in the threshold might be
considered if that proves to be affordable for the public purse. As
house prices nationally rose by 6 per cent. in the year to the first
quarter, I presume that could be done in a way that is revenue
neutral.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000435"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> I have a very brief question for the Economic
Secretary about the changes to stamp duty land tax. I would be
interested to hear the rationale behind the increase and to hear what
impact he thinks that it will have on home buyers, particularly
first-time buyers as mentioned by the hon. Member for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column752" />Column number: 753</div>Hove (Ms Barlow). Surely it is the slab-like structure of stamp duty
land tax that poses so many problems for first-time buyers, because
they have to pay a percentage of the whole value of the property rather
than paying on a sliding scale.</div>
<a name="06062056000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my constituency, where
average house prices are above the threshold, the difficulty for
first-time buyers is not just stamp duty but the gap between incomes
and house prices. Houses are worth many multiples of people&#146;s
incomes. Stamp duty is only a tiny proportion of the problem. Only a
tiny proportion of houses will fall below the threshold, so I will be
interested to hear what impact the Economic Secretary feels that the
minor change being made will have on behaviour and on opening up the
housing market to more first-time
buyers.</div><a name="06062056000255"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062056000436"></a><b class="B">Stewart
Hosie</b> (Dundee, East) (SNP): I have a similar question. In
Scotland, the average price of a first-time buyer&#146;s property is
less than the stamp duty threshold, so stamp duty is of little
consequence to first-time buyers other than those who are very rich or
who can afford to pay many multiples of their income. The real
difficulty for us is that the larger family houses now being built are
routinely priced by developers at &#163;300,000 at least, and so
attract the higher level of stamp duty. What is the Economic
Secretary&#146;s thinking on that for the longer term? Families with
good incomes are effectively priced out of the larger family homes that
they may wish to live
in.</div><a name="06062056000256"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000437"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> I thank hon. Members for their contributions. To
give a bit of background, the clause increases the starting threshold
for stamp duty land tax to &#163;125,000. That follows the doubling
of the threshold last year. The increase means that an additional
40,000 home buyers a year are taken out of stamp duty. The doubling of
the threshold in 2005 and this year&#146;s increase together mean
that a total of 400,000 home buyers a year are out of stamp duty
entirely; that is about 50 per cent. of all home buyers.</div>
<a name="06062056000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the Member for
Hove makes the good point that there is regional variation in house
prices. In London, 26 per cent. of home buyers are exempt. Some 25 per
cent. of those in the south-east will be exempt after the changes that
we propose, but the figure is 78 per cent. in Wales, 75 per cent. in
the north-west, 72 per cent. in Scotland, and 83 per cent. in the
north-east. Given that the stamp duty regime is national, and given the
regional variation in house prices, at least a quarter of all home
buyers across the country will benefit, but that proportion rises to
well over three quarters of home buyers in those parts of the country
where house prices are lower. That seems a fair and equitable way in
which to
proceed.</div><a name="06062056000258"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000438"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:</b> I represent a constituency in Cornwall, which
is the poorest county in England. In some parts of Cornwall, house
prices are up to 10 times average income, which is often 20 per cent.
below the national average. In such places, there is real inequality,
and great difficulty in getting a foot on the housing ladder. The
problem of access to the housing market is not just in the south-east,
and does not just affect 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column753" />Column number: 754</div>people with poorer incomes who live where house prices are lower. The
increase does not resolve that
issue.</div><a name="06062056000259"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000439"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> I completely agree with the hon. Lady. She is
pointing to the wider issue of housing policy and to the need to tackle
the still substantial deficiency in the supply of new housing,
particularly in the south. Despite the substantial extra investment
that has gone into social housing and despite the Barker review, we are
still not building enough houses, which means that it is much more
difficult for a first-time buyer on average or below-average income to
get on the housing ladder than it was 20 years ago.</div>
<a name="06062056000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">I completely accept the hon.
Lady&#146;s point but, frankly, although stamp duty can play a role
in dealing with the issue, it will not solve the problem in any way.
There are things that we can do to help first-time buyers, and stamp
duty is part of that. Stamp duty also plays an important role in
raising revenue in our economy and in making the housing market work
efficiently. The problem with saying easy things such as, &#147;Why
don&#146;t you move from a slab system to a slice system?&#148; or
&#147;Why don&#146;t you abolish stamp duty entirely, or raise its
limits substantially?&#148; is that that costs billions of pounds

earlier about housing issues by the hon. Member for Fareham, who looked

people to live in&#151;we will never tackle the inefficiencies in our

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000444"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 184, in clause 168,
page 138, line 20 [Vol I], leave out from second &#145;company' to
end of line 25 and insert</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;in

company'.</div>
<a name="06062056000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a brief amendment to
consider demutualisation of insurance companies in a slightly different
light. The amendment would extend the reliefs to situations in which
one mutual must take over another mutual that has fallen into financial
difficulty, for example, and probes whether there would be an exemption
or release from stamp duty in those circumstances, given that
demutualisations have cropped up in the
debate.</div><a name="06062056000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">I add a
further comment to save the need for a stand part debate on the clause.
The Economic Secretary will probably have received representations from
the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales on this
matter. The reliefs in the Bill apply in the very final stage of a
demutualisation, and similar issues arise in clause 170. The suggestion
is that the reliefs should also be available in the steps leading up to
demutualisation. At the moment, the companies going through the process
have to apply for anti-avoidance reliefs instead. It would be much more
elegant and straightforward if the same reliefs that apply at the point
of demutualisation applied in all the stages preparatory to that taking
place.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column755" />Column number: 756</div><a name="06062056000278"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000445"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> As the hon. Member for Fareham told the Committee,
the clause concerns the stamp duty land tax and the consequences for
SDLT when a mutual insurance company transfers its business to a group
headed by a company listed on the stock exchange, a process normally
referred to as
demutualisation.</div><a name="06062056000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment to the clause extends the reliefs available under the stamp
duty land tax when a mutual insurance company transfers its business to
such a company. At present, the clause gives relief only where as part
of the demutualisation process shares in the listed company are offered
to members and employees of the mutual company, and to those persons
only. In other words, the only demutualisations affected by the clause
are those where, immediately after transfer of business, those who were
members or employees of the mutual company&#151;and only those
persons&#151;own the new listed
company.</div><a name="06062056000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">Relief is not
available when a mutual company transfers its business to an existing
listed company with outside shareholders. The proposed relief and the
existing relief on the stamp duty land tax and the stamp duty reserve
tax reflect the fact that the ownership of the business, apart from the
issue of shares to employees, is effectively unchanged. As discussed on
an earlier clause with my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton,
South-West (Rob Marris), the Government&#146;s policy is that the
SDLT treatment of this type of demutualisation should be neutral in tax
terms, neither favouring nor hindering the
process.</div><a name="06062056000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would extend the relief in the clause to any situation where mutual
insurance companies cease to be mutual, including the purchase of a
mutual company by an existing listed company with outside
shareholders&#151;effectively a takeover of the mutual company. The
Government do not think it is appropriate to extend tax relief in that
way. I should point out that clause 168 is an extension to the existing
SDLT relief for demutualisations, when shares are offered to members.
The amendment would not extend existing SDLT relief to takeovers and so
would not achieve the aim intended. However, as I said, we do not think
extending demutualisation reliefs to takeover scenarios
appropriate.</div><a name="06062056000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
asked a couple of other questions. The hon. Gentleman asked whether the
relief applies when a mutual takes over a mutual. The answer is no. The
existing relief applies only when shares are offered to existing
members. He asked whether reliefs should be available in the steps
leading up to demutualisation. That is the intention of the clause. The
ICAEW representations did not relate to demutualisation, but to
corporate reconstruction. I hope that that answers his two related
points. On that basis, I urge the Committee to reject the
amendment.</div><a name="06062056000347"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000446"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that response. He
makes a valid point about how my amendment would affect other forms of
takeovers. I suspect that he is right about
that.</div><a name="06062056000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will conclude
by sharing with the Committee a quote that Mr. Cranmer provided, which
might be appropriate to characterise some of the discussions 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column756" />Column number: 757</div>that we have had to date between the various professions on the
Committee. A solicitor at the Ecclesiastical Law Society annual general
meeting said that all lawyers would be accountants if they could add
up, just as all accountants would be lawyers if they could
read.</div><a name="06062056000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw amendment No.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000447"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> I shall be brief, because we had a debate earlier
on this matter, as my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary said. I shall
abstain on clause 168. I do not think that we should be neutral on tax
terms for demutualisation. I previously declared my interest as a
member of Standard Life. Interestingly, since the other 95 per cent.,
or whatever, of Standard Life members voted for demutualisation, the
prospective share price in that organisation has tanked because of the
way the market has gone. My hon. Friend the Economic Secretary says
that a takeover by a private company, as opposed to another mutual with
an amalgamation, would not get the benefit of clause 168, but I
reiterate to him that a Labour Government should not be neutral on tax
terms for mutuals and doing so in this way is a step towards
encouraging demutualisation, which I regard as most
regrettable.</div><a name="06062056000289"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000448"></a>Ed
Balls:</b> The clause is about delivering a level playing
field but, at the same time, taking steps to liberalise the stamp duty
land tax treatment of alternative finance mortgages. It is therefore in
the spirit of some of our earlier debates on different aspects of the
tax system.</div><a name="06062056000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
will benefit anyone who wants to access financial products that do not
involve interest, especially those who do not want to pay interest for
religious reasons. Current tax treatment makes such products more
expensive than other financial products. Alternative finance mortgages
generally involve the purchase of a property by a bank and resale to
the customer at a premium. The resale to the customer is currently
exempted from stamp duty land tax if the customer is an individual. The
clause extends its relief to all, including companies; it has been
developed in concert with business in response to a demand on the
market for alternative finance products. As with the previous clauses
in this area, I commend it to the
Committee.</div><a name="06062056000294"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000449"></a>The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury (John Healey):</b> I
welcome you to the Chair, Sir
John.</div><a name="06062056000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause takes
us into part 9 of the Bill, which is entitled &#147;Miscellaneous
provisions&#148;. Perhaps hon. Members will take heart from the fact
that, although we are not quite there yet, the end of our proceedings
is in sight. In line with the 2005 pre-Budget report announcement, the
clause increases the standard rate of landfill tax, which applies to
active waste disposed to landfill, by &#163;3 per tonne to &#163;21
per tonne with effect from 1 April. The Government have been urged to
provide clarity and certainty in their policy framework to give the
greatest possible certainty for those looking to raise investment in
the long term. We announced as long ago as the pre-Budget report in
2002 that the standard rate would increase by at least &#163;3 per
tonne each year on the way to a medium to long-term price for the
landfill standard rate of &#163;35 per tonne. A steadily increasing
rate sends a clear market signal, and announcing the increases in
advance maximises that
effect.</div><a name="06062056000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">The increase
will encourage waste producers to seek more environmentally friendly
alternatives to landfill by encouraging them and the waste management
industry to switch more to waste minimisation, alternative forms of
disposal, reuse and recycling and, therefore, away from landfill. The
increase covered by the clause, and the future increases already
announced, are part of a principled, broad national policy to reduce
the volumes of waste in this country going to landfill and are
complemented by significant additional public spending on sustainable
waste management and other policy mechanisms that are in place. There
are clear signs that the combination of landfill tax rates and those
other measures is beginning to have the impact that we want and
reducing our reliance on landfill. The amount of active waste going to
landfill between 1997 and last year fell by almost 16 per
cent.</div> <a name="06062056000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">Increases such
as that proposed by clause 171 are an important part of that policy mix
and of the long-term signals to the industry, and a long-term
contribution to the important shift away from landfill to other more
environmentally friendly and sustainable forms of waste management. I
commend the clause to the
Committee.</div><a name="06062056000302"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062056000450"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Secretary has intimated, this is one of the shortest, perhaps the most
predictable, clauses in the Bill. In the 2003 Budget, the Government
confirmed that the tax would increase, in that year, to &#163;18 and
by &#163;3 a year thereafter, on the way to &#163;35. The
Government have carried through that policy in this year&#146;s
Budget, and we have no intention of opposing the clause.</div>

George Young</b> (North-West Hampshire) (Con): It is a
pleasure to see you in the Chair, Sir John. Thismay be my last
contribution to this Finance Bill. It is 10 years since I last
participated in a Finance Bill Committee, and I think it will be 10
years before I do
another.</div><a name="06062056000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
changes the rate of the climate change levy, and I have no difficulty
with the principle behind it. I should like clarification on two
issues. As the explanatory note says, the rates are being increased to
maintain their real value and environmental effect. In page 14 of the
Red Book for the 2006 Budget, one sees:
</div><a name="06062056000336"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Climate
change levy: revalorise from 1 April 2007...&#151;20 &#151;20
&#151;20&#148;.</div><a name="06062056000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister explain why increasing the levy produces that negative effect?
Perhaps it is because it is reinvested somewhere else and given back to
industry, but it would be helpful to have an
explanation.</div><a name="06062056000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">My other
point is about the relationship between the climate change levy and the
cost of electricity. I want to find out whether there is a parallel
between the treatment of the climate change levy and that of the duty
on petrol. When the Government have reviewed the duty on petrol, they
have looked at the market price of petrol. When that has escalated,
they have taken the opportunity to defer the increase on the grounds
that they want to use the price mechanism to promote efficiency. If the
market price has gone up, that has an impact on the imperative to
increase the petrol duty.</div>
<a name="06062056000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">The same argument could apply
to the climate change levy. If the market price of electricity is going
up&#151;and it is&#151;does that impact on the Government&#146;s
policy on the climate change levy? In other words, is there a direct
read-across between their policy on the petrol duty and that on the
climate change levy, or is the climate change levy in a little box on
its own, to be driven up irrespective of what happens to the market
price of electricity? It would be helpful if the Minister shed a bit of
light on that
issue.</div><a name="06062056000312"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000452"></a>Mr.
Goodman:</b> I have only one further question on the climate
change levy. It is in the same territory as the question just asked by
my right hon. Friend. Commenting on the change proposed in the Budget,
the National Farmers Union said that</div>
<a name="06062056000337"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it is not clear from the Budget
documentation how the additional revenues from the increase in levy
rates will be
returned.&#148;</div><a name="06062056000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
presume that they will be returned in the same manner as always, but I
should like the Financial Secretary to cast a bit of light on that
question.</div><a name="06062056000314"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062056000453"></a>John
Healey:</b> As a current Treasury Minister, I say to the right
hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young) that
we measure our contributions on a year-to-year basis in Finance Bills;
I am interested that he does so on a decade-to-decade basis. I look
forward to the Finance Bill in 10 years&#146; time, when he makes a
return appearance.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column759" />Column number: 760</div><a name="06062056000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right hon. Gentleman asked
me two specific questions. The scoring in the Red Book is essentially
the impact on the scorecard of revenues looked at from this current
financial year onwards. Clearly, because we are delaying the
revalorisation and not increasing by the rate of inflation this year,
there is a hit to the public finances of about minus &#163;20
million, which is what is
scored.</div><a name="06062056000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
question of the comparability&#151;or the alignment of the decisions
that we have taken on fuel duty&#151;the right hon. Gentleman will
remember from his period of serving in the Treasury that with any tax
the specific decisions that the Chancellor takes on rates are taken as
a result of a combination of factors. However, they are also taken in
relation to the purpose of the particular tax itself.</div>
<a name="06062056000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right hon. Gentlemen may
remember that historically the principal purpose of fuel duty for
Governments of all parties has been to make a significant contribution
to the overall public finances. It has also played a part in dealing
with the challenge of climate change. Historically, for several
decades, the levels of fuel duty in the UK have been comparably and
relatively high. If he examines the decisions that we have taken on
fuel duty over the past six years, he will see that they have been made
bearing in mind the imperative to raise revenue for public services,
the concern about climate change and the costs and pressures on
consumers and on road fuel-using
industry.</div><a name="06062056000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fact
that we have consistently frozen fuel duty, although we raised it in
line with inflation in 2003, means that cumulatively, in the face of
rising world oil prices and pump prices, the relative take in tax of
fuel duty has decreased. Since 2000, there has been a real reduction in
the value of fuel duty of 8p per litre, which is of benefit to the
motorist and the haulier. In addition, to a significant degree it
offsets the price pressure, which is driven by world oil prices and
reflected at the pumps. That is the balance of factors that the
Chancellor took into account in making his decisions on fuel duty this
year and in previous
years.</div><a name="06062056000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think the
right hon. Gentleman will remember that when we announced the climate
change levy back in 1999 we made it clear that our expectation was that
when it was properly established it would be revalorised; it would be
raised annually in line with inflation. That would be done to maintain
its real value and, specifically, to maintain its incentive
effect&#151;that is its principal purpose, unlike fuel duty&#151;to
encourage business to invest in and do more on energy efficiency and
make the gains that are
possible.</div><a name="06062056000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having seen
a period of bedding in of the new levy since its introduction, the
Chancellor&#146;s decision and judgment is that now is the time to
seek to revalorise the climate change levy. Given the pressure on fuel
costs and energy prices, it is important both to signal that intention
so that businesses can recognise that that is coming and take any steps
that they might wish to improve their own business efficiency, and to
delay changes until 1 April 2007. That is what the clause
does.</div> <a name="06062056000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other words,
the rates under clause 172 are being increased to ensure that the levy
