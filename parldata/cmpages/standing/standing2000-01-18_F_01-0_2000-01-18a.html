<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the Minister, I shall make a couple of announcements. First, any hon. Members wishing to remove their jackets may do so. Secondly, hon. Members may wish to note that, in the explanatory notes to the Bill, the number 19 is consistently substituted by the word "CAPut". That is because there was a virus in the software, and it would be too expensive to issue a correction sheet. I therefore ask hon. Members to substitute the number 19 wherever the word "CAPut" appears in the explanatory notes.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Jeff Rooker):</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Ten o'clock and half-past Two o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not propose to make an opening statement, Mr. O'Brien, but I would like to say what a pleasure it is to see you in the Chair this morning.
<P>
The Government have tabled several amendments to the Bill, but we intend to keep Government amendments to a minimum. It was our intention to get a Second Reading of the Bill before Christmas, and the printers were working to a tight deadline. Therefore, many of the amendments, especially those relating to the child support provisions, are of a technical or redrafting nature, although I am not suggesting that they should not be debated. There will be other amendments, and we shall give plenty of notice to the Committee when we table them. Having said that, the Government stand ready for the scrutiny of the Bill by the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Pickles </B>(Brentwood and Ongar): I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. O'Brien. I served on a Select Committee for many years and I know you to be a fair and thorough person. I have little doubt that you will be able to guide us through any problems that the Bill may present, including the problems of being CAPut.
<P>
I am sorry that the Minister did not make a longer opening statement, because there are matters to be raised that can be raised only during the debate on the sittings motion, which will determine how long the Committee is to deliberate. Our view on how long the Committee might sit was fundamentally changed by a statement made by the Secretary of State on Second Reading. He said, in a manner that I regarded as both helpful and ominous, that this was the last chance for the Child Support Agency. If we take the the Secretary of State at his word, as I am prepared to do, we may have to go back to a court-based system unless we get this reform of the Child Support Agency right. I am aware of the remarks made by the Secretary of State about the Liberal Democrats and the lawyers.
<P>
We need to ascertain whether there is a plan B. After we have examined the clauses relating to the Child Support Agency, will we be presented with a new measure and told, "We've looked at the CSA, and we now recognise that it is not going to work"? Would it not be better to have plan B on the table now? I readily accept that the Government want to keep amendments to a minimum. However, if we are to plan our diaries on the basis of how long we will be in Committee, we have a right to know what the Government propose as a replacement, if--to use an expression from another context--this is the last drink at the last chance saloon for the Child Support Agency.
<P>
The fact that the official Opposition and the Government are as one on most issues relating to the Child Support Agency might make the passage of the Bill a little more expeditious. Because of that, and because we are acutely aware that there was a high degree of consensus across the political spectrum when reforms were last debated, we shall want to table more probing amendments than usual. The Government have said that they will actively look for alternative ways forward, and that will have a direct bearing on how long the Committee sits. It means that the Government will be prepared to have a dialogue with the Opposition. It is therefore important that the Government should indicate how soon they expect to table major amendments to the Bill. This is the third social security Bill that I have debated, and the two previous ones were both subject to significant Government amendments in Committee and on Report. If we are to take the Government at their word, the Minister should tell us exactly how long it will be before we have a clear idea of what the Government are planning.
<P>
I shall not embarrass hon. Members by reading out quotations to show that there is all-party support for the Bill. Running through all the quotations is the sentiment that hon. Members were on the side of the angels; they wanted to do the right thing. On Second Reading, we had the advantage of hearing from the hon. Member for South Dorset (Mr. Ian Bruce), who was intimately involved with the Child Support Agency. His point also has a strong bearing on the issue of time. He said that everything that hon. Members feared would go wrong with the Child Support Agency had not done so: the problems that had ensued were entirely unpredictable. At what time we meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and for how long, is likely to be determined by our concern--which, I am sure is shared by Members from all parties--that we may be replacing one set of inequities with another. If this is the last chance, all Committee members will have to exercise a much higher degree of scrutiny than usual. Traps lie ahead, and we must be clear about the amount of time required to consider the Bill. We are changing from a system that at least attempts to get some support from a non-resident parent to meet the child's needs to a more rough and ready approach.
<P>
When we come to amendment No. 1 to clause 1, I shall explain what we mean by rough and ready justice. We are prepared to try to achieve consensus and to embrace the Government's aims so that we can establish some equality in the process. I do not want to delay the Committee by rehearsing my arguments on amendment 5 6 No. 1, but we shall be removing freedoms and rights that our citizens currently enjoy, so additional sittings may be required to find a way around the inequity of the system.
<P>
On Second Reading, a number of hon. Members talked about running two systems together. Some Ministers treated those comments as treason. They pointed out that one of our greatest problems will be to persuade our fellow citizens that the reforms are acceptable. We shall soon have people coming to our surgeries telling us that, after we had spent the best part of three or four months in Committee examining the Bill, they are paying sums of money that Parliament said they should not pay.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is moving on to the first amendment. It would be better to discuss the mechanics when we come to that amendment. It would be helpful if the hon. Gentleman would speak to the narrow sittings motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> You are quite right, Mr. O'Brien. I allowed my oratory to take me off the subject, and I apologise to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): If we are discussing the timetable for our sittings, we should know early on what the timetable will be for phasing out the CSA's old system and introducing the new one. As my hon. Friend says, it would be absurd if two systems ran side by side not just for months, but for many years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend is right, which is why the Government have been keen to tell us that they will phase out the old system as soon as possible. They have our support in that. I do not want to rub you up the wrong way, Mr. O'Brien, especially on the first day of our deliberations, because I know on which side my bread is buttered.
<P>
If we are to reach a reasonable conclusion, we must consider whether we should sit through Easter to get the Bill right. That would be a great sacrifice to hon. Members, but we are charged with a great duty. Not only do we have the problem of the Child Support Agency to deal with, but we are introducing a state second pension. It will be towards the end of the century before it can be ascertained whether we are right in our deliberations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Desmond Swayne </B>(New Forest, West): I caution my hon. Friend that there is no great enthusiasm, certainly not on my part, for sitting through Easter. Would it not be better for the Committee to avoid that scenario by sitting more often, rather than for a longer period?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend is a hard man. We must recognise that the Government need to govern, and that the good people on the Government Front Bench--pleased as we are to see them here--have other responsibilities. We must ensure that the Government's machine runs smoothly.
<P>
<H5>Mr. Leigh: It is not doing so.</H5>
</P>
<P>
10.45 am
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend is unkind. The last thing that I want is for Ministers to be compelled to be here virtually 24 hours a day--there are letters to sign and important decisions to be made. We should stick to the Tuesday and Thursday sittings. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne) is keen to be united with his family and his Easter eggs, and with a degree of friendship we may be able to conclude our deliberations within a month or two. I certainly do not intend to waste the Committee's time.
<P>
However, that cuts both ways. We expect a good dialogue between the parties, so as to enable us to come to decisions quickly. Although the Government enjoy an enormous majority, they have said that they will listen to, and engage in, the arguments surrounding the Bill. We have a duty to put party differences to one side and make the Bill work.
<P>
The Child Support Agency and the state second pension are matters of enormous importance. In respect of the latter, we shall need time to pursue two main areas of debate. I shall not go into details now--those matters will be discussed when we come to the amendments--but it is important to be clear where we stand on these issues so that hon. Members can organise their diaries.
<P>
We shall want to establish how state second pensions, stakeholder pensions, personal pensions and occupational pensions can interface with one another--I regret having to jump into the jargon--so that people are not trapped into taking an unsuitable pension. I shall not go any further on that issue, Mr O'Brien, because I do not want to try your patience. We shall also want to consider moving towards a funded scheme for the state second pension and improving the way in which private pension companies augment and complement it.
<P>
We shall also want to devote considerable time to other important matters, not least the plight of war widows. We should like to table several amendments on that subject, and to spend a fair amount of time debating it. We shall carefully scrutinise the residual schedules on national insurance.
<P>
We intend to approach the subject of the Child Support Agency on a cross-party basis. However, we shall be vigilant in respect of stealth taxes, especially in the latter part of the Bill. We do not want the amount of taxation, which has increased so dramatically--

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman that we are discussing the dates and times of the Committee's sittings. The length of time involved is a matter for the Whips. We should not rehearse everything that is going to be said during debates. Will the hon. Gentleman confine his remarks to the motion?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am sorry, Mr. O'Brien. My enthusiasm ran away with me.
<P>
It is now traditional for Parliament to take a week's break in February to coincide with school holidays. Such a break would increase the time that our deliberations will take. I hope that the Minister will comment on that, and explain what arrangements will be made for members of the Committee to table amendments. Perhaps we should sit through that break to conclude our business more quickly, but I seek guidance on that matter from you, Mr. O'Brien, or from the Minister.
The Minister said that the Government wanted the Second Reading debate to take place before Christmas, and it is clear that they want the Bill to complete its passage as soon as possible. We do not intend to delay that process, so, in a spirit of good will, I shall conclude my remarks, even though I have more to say on this important issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Burstow </B>(Sutton and Cheam): I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. O'Brien. My honourable Friend the Member for St. Ives (Mr. George) and I look forward to many future sittings of this Committee under your chairmanship.
<P>
 We are broadly happy with the sittings motion, which will provide a basic framework for our deliberations, but some aspects give cause for concern. We hope that the Government will consider some fine tuning, so that certain matters can be better scrutinised. That is particularly true in respect of part I of the Bill, which deals with the Child Support Agency. On Second Reading, it was noted that, in reality, the Bill is three Bills squashed together. It would have been better if the Bill had been presented as three separate measures, because the total time that the three Committees would have taken to consider them would probably not have exceeded the time that we will take. Moreover, each Committee would have been able to expend greater energy on each measure.
<P>
As has been said, the sittings motion may require amendment to enable us to deal with the Bill's treatment of the Child Support Agency. Even those members of the Committee who were not Members of Parliament when the Child Support Agency legislation completed its passage through the House carry a great burden. They must ensure that the Bill, which will amend and reform the CSA, is sustainable and can deliver the service that the CSA is currently failing to deliver. In that spirit, my hon. Friend and I shall table amendments that will explore some aspects of the CSA's operation, but we shall not discuss our preferred position, which is that the courts should take back those responsibilities. In our view, the Committee's job is to scrutinise the provisions in the Bill, and the sittings motion should provide sufficient time for us to consider whether the formula will work fairly without leading to too many cases of rough justice.
<P>
We are also concerned about the introduction of the state second pension, and we feel strongly that sufficient time must be made available to consider the relevant provisions. If necessary, there should be additional sitting days to enable us to debate amendments and consider the Government's arguments on the qualifying criteria for credits. We have yet to be convinced that the Government have thought the matter through fully. In particular, we are worried that the much vaunted improvements that the state second pension will bring for carers will not materialise, not least because the Bill states that carers' contributions will be based on crediting invalid care allowance throughout a given year. We want to explore in detail with Ministers how those provisions will work in practice, and what they will deliver into the pockets of carers when they retire in years to come.
<P>
That is not the only issue that we wish to explore with the Government concerning the possibility of implementing changes. We hope that time will be provided to enable us to examine the situation of people who currently discharge caring responsibilities and who face the prospect of retiring with very little pension provision. We need to examine how we might use the state second pension to get money into their pockets at an earlier stage.
<P>
The final part of the Bill deals with a mixture of measures, including war pensions, changes to national insurance contributions and the draconian provisions relating to breach of community orders. We shall need more than adequate time to scrutinise those aspects of the Bill that we consider to be the most illiberal. We hope that the Committee will consider the Bill in a manner conducive to improving it, and to securing improvements for those whom we represent. We look forward to working with other members of the Committee to make our deliberations as smooth as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I sat through 14 years of Standing Committees when the Conservative Government were in power, and I heard many long speeches during sittings motions from Labour Members trying to lengthen our proceedings. I do not blame them for that: it is the Opposition's duty. The only way to stop anything in opposition is to keep talking. However, I do not want to do that today. I do not want to discuss the substance of the Bill. I want to make a serious point about the way in which we deal with the Bill, and about how we might use the sittings motion to achieve proper scrutiny.
<P>
I do not think that Standing Committees work very well. We are discussing a matter of huge importance that has caused massive distress to many people over many years. In my experience, what usually happens in Standing Committees is that the usual channels get together and decide that the Bill will take two, four or six weeks to consider. An arrangement is made and we abide by it: the Committee takes that length of time to consider the Bill. Government Back Benchers say almost nothing throughout the entire period--except, perhaps, one or two short interventions--while Opposition Members just go on talking. Fair enough, but is that proper scrutiny?
<P>
I want to hear a proper debate in Committee over the next four or six weeks. I want to get a dialogue going between the Opposition and the Government. It is rather like filling a jug: there is no point in agreeing the size of the jug at the outset and then saying that it is up to the Opposition and the Minister alone to fill that jug. There is no point in us going on talking without there being a proper debate. I am not trying to make a party political point or to tease Labour Members, but I hope that, if we agree to sit for four, six or eight weeks, they will feel able to get a debate going. If not, we shall be in danger of repeating the mistakes of the past.
<P>
I did not sit on the Standing Committee that considered the original CSA Bill, but I was in Parliament 9 10 as it was going through. It was, as everyone knows, uncontroversial. Everyone agreed that it was a good thing to do. Although I did not sit on the Committee, I imagine that very little was said by Government Members. I blame myself for that, because I was around at the time. I hope that, in five, seven or 10 years' time, when people realise that the CSA has failed in the last chance saloon and we have to change to a new, possibly court-based system, they will not look back on our proceedings and say "Where were they? What were they saying? What points were they raising on behalf of their constituents?"
<P>
This is an important matter. We are all experts on the CSA. Many of the subjects that we consider in Parliament are, frankly, technical, but we all understand the CSA. People who come to my surgery have more complaints about the CSA than about any other subject. I have had to put up with 10 years of complaints, and I want the Bill to get it right.
<P>
I am worried that we may be moving towards a system of rough and ready justice. CSA officials will have less of a hard time because they will be able to impose a strict formula and to spend more time on enforcement, which we all agree is a good thing, but there may be many more complaints under the new system. I do not want to discuss the substance of the Bill, but I said on Second Reading that the system should contain sufficient flexibility to take account of people's personal difficulties. I hope that we shall debate that matter properly.
<P>
Another concern of mine involves the fact that the Standing Committee system is the weakest part of parliamentary scrutiny. The controversial part of a Bill--the part that interests Members of Parliament--is usually reached early on in a Committee's proceedings. The CSA is a controversial and interesting subject that is not technical and which we all understand, and we may spend two, three or four weeks discussing it. At that point, when Easter may suddenly be on us, a deal may be struck and we shall have to rattle through the rest of the Bill. I have seen that happen many times, but it would be a disaster in this case. Although we may believe that politically, and in relation to our surgery experience, the CSA is the important part of the Bill, the state second pension may be more important. It will have a dramatic impact on people's lives for the next 40 or 50 years and if we do not get it right, we shall be in deep water.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> How long does my hon. Friend think we should spend discussing the CSA?
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> We should give it proper scrutiny. All Committee members should take part in a serious debate and bring their personal experience to bear, and the Minister should be quizzed and put on the spot. That may take one, two, three or four weeks, but the length of time does not matter. What matters is that we debate all of the Bill and our amendments and that we feel that we have done our duty by our constituents. Committee members should not simply sit in Committee doing their correspondence. We do not have the excuse of having to write Christmas cards as Christmas is over, and although we may be tempted to spend our time preparing Easter eggs, that is not what Standing Committees are for.
<P>
The state second pension is a technical subject, and I wonder whether we have the expertise to discuss it. We are lucky to have the assistance of an excellent report that was prepared by the Select Committee on Social Security, on which some Committee members sit. It will help us in our debate on the CSA. How many of us understand the state second pension or have actuarial training and how many of us really understand the stakeholder pension scheme and its impact on our constituents? I have tried to understand the state second pension, but I suspect that I have not done so very well. I am a simple layman and a politician, not an actuary. It would be helpful if expert witnesses could share their ideas with the Committee. Although I know that it will not happen, the Committee could beneficially act in the manner of a Select Committee.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> It was the Government's originally stated intention to refer the Bill to some such forum for pre-legislative scrutiny.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> One positive step that the Government have taken is to encourage Select Committees to sit more often. In cases such as this, a pre-Standing Committee inquiry can be helpful. Last year, I sat on a Standing Committee that discussed the splitting of pensions on divorce, and we found that it was useful to have a Select Committee report. So far as I am aware--I may be wrong and the Minister may be able to correct me--little material is available to Members of Parliament to help them to understand the state second pension.
<P>
I hope that our proceedings will not continue for a set period simply because we may feel that we will have done our bit if we sit around in Committee for four, six or eight weeks. I hope that we will have a good debate. Therefore, when things start to go wrong--I fear that they will, because we are dealing with some of the most difficult aspects of human nature and with huge amounts of emotional energy being expended, and officials, although I do not blame them, find that difficult to deal with--we will feel that we have done our duty.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> I am in two minds on the sittings motion. I should briefly like to give the Committee a taste, or vignette, of both those minds. Clearly, my principal concern is whether the Committee will sit often enough. The number of times that we might sit does not constrain the length of each sitting. Nevertheless, on the basis of experience of Standing Committees, I would suggest a reasonable estimate of eight to 10 hours a week. The key question is therefore how many weeks we will sit, which is anybody's guess. I asked my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) for such an estimate, but, to be charitable, her response was guarded, if not unhelpful. My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) has made it clear that that is something of an art. As I said on Second Reading, the Bill is effectively three Bills, and a significant amount of time will be needed for sufficient scrutiny. My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) referred to the Committee's additional responsibility when he described it as the last chance saloon.
<P>
We should consider an alternative--treating the sittings as the Select Committee did in producing its excellent 10th report. The Select Committee sat all day for three days, and, as a result, as my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough said, we produced a useful report. I therefore hope that the hon. Members for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) and Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble), who are also veterans of the Select Committee, might enlighten this Committee on the advantages of that kind of intensive, focused approach. What mitigates against that approach is the requirement to have sufficient time between sittings to think about the issues and prepare to speak about them effectively. A temptation always exists that, given a certain amount of time, the job of work to be done will expand to fill it. Providing discipline in terms of the length of sittings can be effective in terms of concentrating the mind and obtaining a better result.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I want to make myself clear. I do not object to an agreement to stick to four, six, or eight weeks, or whatever has been agreed. Having made such an agreement, however, we should use the time well and have a proper debate between both sides of the Committee, instead of feeling that one side has to fill out the entire period.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> I agree entirely. We must be thorough because this is the last chance, but we must also be equipped to be thorough. As my hon. Friend said, all hon. Members are experts on this matter. We have all sat through surgeries, and child support is the most common problem that I have had to deal with. I have acquired a certain amount of expertise, and I want to use it, perhaps exhaustively, to solve and resolve the problems that have been brought to my attention. I often wonder why so many commentators tell me that employing a researcher would make me more effective in my parliamentary duties and that acting as a surrogate social worker is not my proper constitutional role. My answer is that a time will come when I shall be in a position to remedy some of the defects that are brought to my attention, so it is vital to educate myself properly by being acquainted with the problems faced by ordinary people. After two and a half years, I have been provided with that opportunity in this Committee and I do not want to waste it.
<P>
That brings me back to the question of whether the sittings motion will provide that opportunity. I wonder whether we should sit more frequently each week to safeguard our ability to circumnavigate any agreement on the number of weeks that the Committee will sit. It would be a sufficient guarantee to have another sitting each week.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) said that he wants to use the time available to ensure that there are not too many cases of rough justice. I do not want to digress from the sitting motions, but I am not sure that he and I have read the same Bill. The Bill seems to have been designed to provide rougher justice. That seems to be the principal intention of the simplified formula. I am not sure that we shall be able to consider the hon. Gentleman's worries, but I am anxious that the Committee sits often enough.
<P>
I should prefer to sit more often than to follow the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar and to sit through the half-term break, if we are afforded that luxury, or through Easter, which strikes me as mildly blasphemous.
<P>
<B>Mr. Laurence Robertson </B>(Tewkesbury): I have not been in the House long, Mr. O'Brien, so I look to you to guide me through our proceedings. This is only the second Standing Committee of which I have been a member--
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend is a lucky man.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> The first considered the Access to Justice Bill, so I do not feel so lucky. That Bill had the potential to touch the lives of everyone. I am lucky to be considering the Bill before us because it will also touch the lives of everyone. I feel a great weight of responsibility, as, I am sure, do all hon. Members.
<P>
I share the concern about timetabling, because it is important to have good debate and quality, as well as timing, is important. The aspect about which I am specifically concerned is not the Child Support Agency, although people have come to my surgery in a terrible state. Last Friday, someone came to see me with documentary evidence that he had paid his former wife. He had sent that documentary evidence to the Child Support Agency, but he was told that he had not paid and that he must pay the arrears immediately. We have read about people committing suicide when the Child Support Agency has fouled up on their behalf. I do not take the view that this is our last chance to put that system right because it can evolve a little. I am not underestimating the Committee's work, but the system can be slightly amended later, even when the Bill has been enacted.
<P>
I am more concerned about the pension proposals. They will affect everyone, even the better off, and I share my hon. Friends' worries that we may be insufficiently briefed about the matter. The Bill will change the whole way in which the pension system is administered by replacing the state earnings-related pension scheme. It is not being portrayed in that way, but that is what is involved. That is an enormous undertaking, for two reasons. First, it affects everybody in the country. Secondly, it involves a huge potential cost to the Government.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The state pension has provided security for many millions of people, and I hope that it will continue to do so. However, it costs a great deal of money. Governments throughout the world are considering ways of correcting such systems, and it is right that Parliament should do so. I fear that we could miss a golden opportunity to create the system that we need, and worsen the problems with the "pay as you go" scheme.
<P>
Although I do not consider myself to be completely ignorant about pensions, I feel that I am inadequately briefed, and hope that there will be plenty of debate about the subject. I am sorry that pensions will probably be the second issue that we discuss. Important as the Child Support Agency is to many people, especially children, I hope that we do not spend too long on it. I urge members of the Committee to spend sufficient time on debating pensions--not only the state second pension, but the way in which occupational pensions are administered. My remarks have been brief, but members of the Committee 13 14 should not underestimate how strongly I feel about the importance of the pensions aspect of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew George </B>(St. Ives): I begin my remarks about the sittings motion by saying that I welcome the opportunity to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. O'Brien. I am pleased to serve on another Standing Committee with the Minister of State, the hon. Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker), with whom I spent many hours in the Committee that considered the Food Standards Bill. I was impressed by his forthright and direct style, which I am sure we will enjoy during the Committee's deliberations.
<P>
I wish primarily to respond to the points that were eloquently made by the hon. Member for Gainsborough, who is not presently in his place, and the hon. Member for New Forest, West, who elaborated on those points. Committee members have a shared interest in ensuring that we get it right this time. Despite the fact that Liberal Democrat Members voted to oppose the Second Reading motion, we approach the Standing Committee with the intention of engaging constructively in debates. All parties have a shared interest in ensuring that we do not make the same mistakes again. Some hon. Members have already expressed trepidation that we may get it wrong.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> It is sometimes believed that what Oppositions really want from Standing Committees is for Bills to remain unchanged, and to be as bad as possible, in the hope that Government Members will get the blame. However, in this case it is recognised that the Bill puts our system of government in question, and that the Committee represents the last chance to get the matter right.
<P>
<B>Mr. George:</B> The hon. Gentleman has helped me to elaborate on my point. We may be unable, unlike members of Select Committees, to invite expert witnesses for questioning. However, the fact remains that the Social Security Select Committee's report on the child support White Paper recommended that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the legislation on child support should be committed to a Special Standing Committee in order to enable its Members to take evidence directly on the details of the legislation which they will then proceed to debate and (if they wish) to amend."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I assume that Standing Committee procedure does not permit the taking of evidence. However, if we agree on the Bill's aim but do not know how to achieve it, we should not simply plough on in the hope that a fudged compromise based on the collective wisdom of Committee members will prove adequate. I seek your advice, Mr. O'Brien, on whether we could adjourn the Committee and question expert witnesses if necessary.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait </B>(Beckenham): I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. O'Brien, and look forward to many hours under your chairmanship. Given the worries expressed by Opposition Committee members, I suspect that we shall spend many hours discussing not only child support but pensions and the remaining changes across the social security spectrum.
<P>
I do not wish to go into detail, but before attending this Committee I was speaking with the Child Support Agency in Hastings about a case that I suspect I shall often cite, because I cannot see how it fits with the rough and ready justice element in the Bill. I agree that we shall have to spend an enormous amount of time examining the detail, so that we get it right. If we get it wrong, such cases might have to return to the courts, and I would defend to the death the principle that child support cases should not be sent back to the courts. In the past, that process has done nothing but favour the men. It is men who have complained about the system, and it is men who have messed it up, I want to ensure that the parent with care continues to receive reasonable maintenance from the parent without care. I shall stick to that principle with great determination, and the Opposition will examine the Bill with that in mind.
<P>
I also want to ensure that the less exciting subject of the state second pension is thoroughly scrutinised. As my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar said, the proposals will give rise to considerable confusion and difficulties. There will be many disincentives to take up the state second pension and the stakeholder pension, and there will be problems associated with the interaction with private pensions. We must ensure that as many people as possible are encouraged to take out second pensions, whether state funded or, as we would prefer, privately funded.
<P>
We shall spend a considerable time examining the Bill in detail and putting forward our proposals, but I can reassure the Government that, in the main, we shall probe rather than oppose outright. Nevertheless, on occasion, we will want to ensure that our views are put on record. As my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar said, we will examine the war pension system. We will also consider why annuities are no longer the best way for people to provide for themselves, and we will examine the 75-year rule. There is great concern about those matters among the many pensioners who have to rely on annuities that are no longer worth what they should be, and on the 75-year age rule.
<P>
We are not planning to try to amend the motion that we sit on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but we could sit for longer on those days. We should have no difficulty with sitting late on Tuesdays or even on Thursdays, and if necessary we should be prepared to sit through the night. There will be ample opportunity to examine all the amendments in as much detail as is necessary. I notice, as a veteran of the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill, that there are many familiar faces among Labour Members. I am sure that from time to time they will make good contributions, although we hope that they do so more often than that.
<P>
I support the desire of my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough to have a proper debate on all the relevant issues. We shall not be deterred from sitting late if we feel that that is necessary to ensure that the sittings motion is complied with and that the Bill gets the scrutiny that it deserves.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I shall respond briefly to two or three of the points that have been raised.
<P>
Like many others, I have cited the CSA in other contexts as an example of the way in which the House can produce legislation that is of abysmal quality. The legislation, which went through on the nod because we believed that the idea was good, did not receive proper scrutiny because there was no dog fight. That is the stupidity of and the defect in our system--no dog fight means no proper scrutiny. We all thought that we had set up an agency to do a job, but we discovered pretty quickly that it was not doing what Parliament thought that it would do. The failure is to be found in Parliament and in our legislative process, not among the CSA staff who have grappled with the system. We are therefore willing to have our proposals scrutinised.
<P>
The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar asked about half-term holidays. I have no information about that--it is a matter for the Leader of the House and for our managers. Perhaps we could swap days and sit on a Saturday and Sunday to make up for the holiday. That is a joke, by the way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Nobody laughed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I am sure that we shall accommodate the half-term break in due course.
<P>
I have served long years in opposition and as an Opposition Front Bencher during the 1970s, and I know what it is like to serve on Standing Committees. My hon. Friends have received not an instruction to keep quiet but an invitation to participate and to have a proper debate, but to keep their remarks tight and to the point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> They have started well.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> They do not think that debating the sittings motion is a fruitful way to get money to children. We are here to get money to kids, but we shall not be able to do so until we begin our debate on clause 1.That is why I shall be brief.
<P>
The hon. Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne) must have misread the sittings motion. By my rough calculation, it will allow us to sit for about 45 hours a week if the Committee desires to do so. Please do not fall through the floor, Mr. O'Brien. The position is fairly flexible.
<P>
The start of the Bill contains important provisions, but crucial policy issues that are separate from child support can also be found half way and two thirds of the way through it and at the end. It would be a travesty if we so messed up our consideration of the Bill that those matters--which include national insurance and its association with benefits in kind, the powers of inspectors and pensions--were not properly scrutinised.
<P>
Before Christmas we invited hon. Members to Westminster Hall to consider some of the issues that lie behind the proposed changes in child support and the state second pension. I shall ensure, as far as I am able, that the briefing and slides on the state second pension are put into a manageable form for the Committee, now that we know who the Committee members are. We will put together more briefing on that matter for all Committee members before we reach those debates.
<P>
The hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson) made some valid points. It is important that we should be as well informed as possible about the implications of the state second pension, and about how it will work and interact with the rest of pension provision. It is covered by only a few clauses in the Bill--and one very long schedule, I agree--but it has implications for millions of people.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I thank the Minister for his kindness in providing that information. We look forward to receiving that briefing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I meant what I said. We want to work co-operatively, and to establish a genuine dialogue on this subject. The reason that we are in this situation now is that, over the years, there has not been sufficient dialogue. I want to encourage a change in that area.
<P>
We shall deal with the details as we go through the Bill. We have tried to consult on many aspects of the legislation, and the Select Committee's deliberations on child support have been extremely useful. We have had other consultations regarding the state second pension. We concluded the rebate opt-outs on 14 January, and will report our conclusions as quickly as possible--certainly before we reach that part of the Bill in Committee.
<P>
I hope that I have answered all the queries. The order of consideration of the Bill will be covered by a separate motion, which I shall move at the appropriate time.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Ten o'clock and at half-past Two o'clock.<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill, copies of which are available in the Room. I should also like to remind hon. Members that adequate notice should be given of amendments.

As a general rule, my co-Chairman and I do not intend to call starred amendments, including any starred amendments that may be reached during an afternoon sitting of the Committee. In answer to Mr. George, the terms of reference for Standing Committees are set down and we shall work within those terms, so we cannot call witnesses.

<P>

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 8, at beginning insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(A1) Subsection (1) shall not come into force until such time as the Secretary of State shall have published in the London Gazette, an estimate prepared by him of:
<P>
(a) The number of maintenance calculations he expects to perform (whether as a result of the operation of section 4 of the 1991 Act or as a result of the operation of section 6 of the 1991 Act) in the period of 12 months following the coming into force of subsection (1);
<P>
(b) The number of maintenance calculations referred to in (a) above in which the amount of child support maintenance would be more if that maintenance calculation were to be undertaken in accordance with Part I of Schedule 1 as amended by this Act rather than in accordance with Part I of Schedule 1 to the 1991 Act prior to any amendment by this Act;
<P>
(c) The number of maintenance calculations referred to in (a) above in which the amount of child support maintenance would be less if that maintenance calculation were to be undertaken in accordance with Part I of Schedule 1 as amended by this Act rather than in accordance with Part I of Schedule 1 to the 1991 Act prior to any amendment by this Act; and
<P>
(d) The number of maintenance calculations referred to in (a) above in which the amount of child support maintenance would be the same if that maintenance calculation were to be undertaken in accordance with Part I of Schedule 1 as amended by this Act rather than in accordance with Part I of Schedule 1 to the 1991 Act prior to any amendment by this Act.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister gave a reasonable response, but I felt mildly tetchy when he said that we were not dealing with the issue of getting money to children. The amendment seeks to do that. It is broadly drafted, which should give plenty of Opportunity to determine who will gain and who will lose. That piece of the jigsaw is missing, and a great responsibility is placed on us as we discuss the amendment.
<P>
The Minister said that a previous Committee, which may have considered a similar amendment, had exercised abysmal scrutiny. That is not the view of his right hon. Friend, the First Minister of the Scottish Parliament, who said that it had been a constructive Committee stage. I do not accept that it is necessary to have a dogfight to examine important considerations. I should like the Minister to respond in detail to the demands of this comprehensive amendment, which proposes a system whereby the Minister would publish who will be the winners and who will be the losers. We are in exactly the same position as we were when the hon. Member for Oldham, West and Royton (Mr. Meacher) said
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the central principle enunciated in the Bill is undoubtedly excellent"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He also said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It enshrines a principle that we strongly support".--[Official Report, 4 June 1991; Vol. 192, c.196-201.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 Despite the passage of time, I have an almost identical view.
<P>
On Second Reading, I quoted from the Social Security Committee's 10th report on the 1999 child support White Paper. Many members of that Committee are in this Committee today, and our deliberations would be much harder were it not for the work of the Select Committee. The Committee's minutes include a submission by Mr. Justice Kay from Australia--which I quoted on Second Reading, but not in full. After offering considerable guidance and an examination of winners and losers, he suggested a helpful principle, which will assist consideration of this amendment. The penultimate paragraph of his submission, in the minutes of 15 September 1999, on page 74, states,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The success of the scheme may well depend on the extent to which the public perceive it to be fair. Assessments which throw up  500 per week"--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 Australian dollars, that is--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"for a baby or ignore the fact that the carer is earning  100,000 per annum whilst the payer is struggling to make ends meet will do little to bolster public enthusiasm for the scheme.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We share those sentiments.
<P>
Our system, however, is based on rough justice, as my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West said so eloquently earlier and on Second Reading. We should not shirk from the issue of rough justice, which it undoubtedly is. As official Opposition Members we expect rough justice: we do not accept it absolutely, or on all occasions. We recognise that moving towards a percentage system will mean that some people will be worse off and some will be better off. Clearly, a percentage system will be unjust and will not always meet the needs of individual children. The cost of a child varies enormously according to age. Mr. Justice Kay said that it is more expensive to bring up a teenager than an infant--there will be broad consensus in the Committee on that point. However, a sacrifice must be made in order to simplify the system.
<P>
As the Government are moving to a straight percentages system, regardless of the age of the child, there will be inequities and rough justice. We recognise why the Government have chosen that method, and we support them in it. However, flexibility is a problem. That is why, before we consider the matter further, the Government should publish figures that clearly show who will be the winners and who will be the losers. I recommend that Labour Members read the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough on Second Reading. He made a number of points, the most important of which was to warn about variations. The Bill represents a return to the position before the Child Support Agency was established. Many of the problems occurred because of the agency's inflexibility, and the basic formula has now been varied.
<P>
The amendment is necessary because we need to know the extent to which those variations are likely to increase. We may, down the line, find ourselves in a Committee considering a future statutory instrument to increase the number of variations following almost exactly the pattern proposed by the previous Government. The amendment is necessary because we need to know who will be the winners and losers. There will be many losers. The Under-Secretary calculated that the number of parents with care who will lose will be 350,000.
<P>
On 29 November, my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and the hon. Member for Teignbridge (Mr. Nicholls) asked the Secretary of State about that issue. I asked the Secretary of State how child poverty would be tackled if 350,000 parents with care were worse off by an average of 70, but he missed the point and said that 1 million children will be better off. Today, I received a pack of information from the Department of Social Security stating that 1 million children will be better off as a result of the Bill. The amendment would require that information to be published. The Under-Secretary said that she wanted to ensure that money goes to children, and I told her that parents with care will be worse off. The Secretary of State said that parents have an obligation to look after children, and that they will be better off. I remind the children--I am sorry, I mean the Conservatives. I think that that passes for humour in the Chamber.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security </B>(Angela Eagle): It could have been a slip of the tongue.
<P>
<B>Mr Pickles:</B> It may have been. I think that P.G. Wodehouse was probably right when he said that a Scots man--or a Scots lady--
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Careful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> A Scots person with a grievance could not possibly be mistaken for a ray of sunshine.
<P>
We are worried about parents with care. The distinction is important. Our point is not about making parents pay, but about making parents who are looking after children materially worse off. I put a calculation before the House, which the Minister of State tried to contradict. I shall repeat that calculation and perhaps the Under-Secretary will tell me whether the figures are correct. If 350,000 parents with care each have an average of 2.4 children, 840,000 children would be worse off. That is not far from the 1 million figure, as the Government may have slightly overstated the number of gainers and we may have slightly underestimated the number of losers. Therefore, there is virtually a one-to-one balance between the two. That does not seem to me to be a good basis on which to embark on a fundamental reform of the system. If the Minister knows the number of children and can put our minds at rest, so much the better.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
My second point is one that I briefly raised on the sittings motion, stretching your patience almost to breaking point, Mr. O'Brien. It relates to two systems operating together. Again, if that information were published, it would either incense people because of the inequity of the system or relieve their fears.
<P>
Two systems will operate side by side for possibly five years. One system will require people to pay a certain percentage while others will pay under the old formula. Those who would gain from the new formula will protest. They will argue, "Parliament considers that I should pay a certain percentage, but I am paying considerably over the odds. Why should I pay more? After all, this is what Parliament says I should pay." Perhaps the Minister could tell us in her reply what advice will be given to the CSA about the pursuit of those in arrears on the basis of the old calculations who would not be in arrears on the basis of the new calculations.
<P>
I have a letter, which I suspect may have gone to all members of the Committee, from a Mr. Colin Stamp, who has been involved with the CSA. He sums up in two sentences what I am trying to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Whilst the proposals seem, on the whole, to be a very much simplified system which will speed up the assessment process, there does appear to be great inequity in the decision to leave any beneficial adjustments to absent fathers payments until some lengthy period after the new scheme comes into effect. As you will read, the new scheme could well favour absent fathers who have, to date, sought to avoid, evade or even ignore Agencies attempts to bring them into line."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That last sentence raises an important point. If the Minister says, "We won't prosecute. We won't go for arrears", we will exchange one set of aggrieved parties for another. This new set of aggrieved parties will include those who have, over the years, conscientiously paid, as they should, the correct amount of maintenance. They have never defaulted; they have never been late; they have always paid up. They will say to themselves, "I've been a mug. If I had evaded my responsibilities and played the system, right now I would be a lot better off," That is why the amendment is so important: the public have a right to know the Government's assessment of the amount of money that should be paid over, and who will gain and who will lose.
<P>
As I said a few moments ago, a number of people will clearly lose out because of this new assessment. I noticed that, in his evidence, Mr Nicholas Mostyn QC provided a table, which appears on page 86 of the Select Committee's Minutes of Evidence for 15 September. He shows that those on average male earnings for manual and non-manual work are likely to pay considerably less, whereas a nursing auxiliary on a little under 9,000 a year will pay more. Therefore, we need to understand who will gain and who will lose.
<P>
The Minister was extremely candid in her replies at Question Time last week, and also on Second Reading in response to heckling. The said that this is merely a question of the number of gainers and losers on paper. It is not the actual position, because many of these people have shrugged off their responsibility. She wants people to pay. That is why the amendment is so important. Whatever happened to enforcement? What happened about pursuing these people? The Bill makes great play of toughening up the process of ensuring that those who are derelict in their obligations to their children have to pay additional sums of money. Why do we not start to practise what we preach?
<P>
A further reason why the amendment is so necessary is that, by giving the number of winners and losers, it enables us to illustrate a problem raised by Mr. Erikson from ManKind, a charity dedicated to raising awareness of issues affecting men. He says
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The final inherent problem with the CSA is that there is no correlation between the payments demanded from the absent father and the actual cost of raising the child."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We accept that, by the process of rough justice, the Government's decision to move towards a percentage payment is correct, but the amendment would enable us to address Mr. Erikson's point.
<P>
A further reason why this amendment is necessary is that we are not simply embarking on changing the Child Support Agency, but are starting to put together a fundamental change in English law on children's rights. The Bill will give children a right to share in their parents' wealth. That is why the amendment is so important, because it deals specifically with this point by 21 22 clearly showing who will win and who will lose. This right exists nowhere else. One would expect children to enjoy their parents' increased wealth. It is a natural consequence of being fortunate enough to have children, and all responsible parents would want that, but hitherto it was not an automatic right.
<P>
Mr. Nicholas Mostyn QC said that hitherto children had a right only to be maintained and not to share in their parents' wealth; to alter that would represent a change of massive legal and social profundity. I am sure that he is right about that. Strangely, and slightly disturbingly, however, that right to share in the wealth of parents exists only if the parents are separated and if their separation is scrutinised by the CSA.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> Although it has been argued that such a right is merely implicit in the specified percentages, does not the absence in the Bill of a cap make the proposal explicit and deliberate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right--he anticipates the point that I was about to come on to.
<P>
The fact that there will be no limit will make enormous concessions to people whom the Secretary of State did not intend to help: namely, the lawyers. The absence of an upper limit will drive a coach and horses through every divorce settlement that comes before the courts. The proposal is of considerable interest to the parent with care, who will have to re-examine and cut through the arrangements. The shame is that not many cases will be involved, although they will dominate the headlines and undermine the public's confidence in the system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Dismore </B>(Hendon): I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will be acquainted, from the press and his surgeries, with similar stories to those that I have come across. They usually involve a woman--the parent with care, looking after children in dire straits--and a husband or former husband who has considerable financial wealth. The parent with care argues that considerable injustice attaches to the fact that the husband leads the lifestyle of a millionaire while she lives in poverty. That is the ill that the proposal is designed to correct.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also said that a child who lives in a settled family relationship will not have such rights--he or she will enjoy the benefits of the lifestyle that the two parents had when they were together. Would not the amendment result in the child facing a substantial--an enormous--drop in his or her lifestyle?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting comment. He is a member of the Social Security Select Committee and I have studied his voting record. In this instance, he completely misses the point. No one likes the idea of a father who shirks his responsibility, but the Government's proposal will not help to ensure that such fathers meet their responsibilities. The relevant provisions appear, I believe, in schedule 4, which will give the Secretary of State powers relating to a person who has a lifestyle that is considerably different from that which is declared. I have no sympathy with such people, who should be pursued.
<P>
On the hon. Gentleman's second point, I do not deny that in the event of the break up of a marriage, the child should have the right to enjoy the wealth of the parent who does not have care. However, there is nothing in the Bill to ensure that money will be transferred to the child. The Government's proposal merely provides a way to overcome a divorce settlement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Laurence Robertson:</B> My hon. Friend makes an important point. Transferring money from the absent parent to the parent with care will not ensure that the money goes to the child. Is not that fact used by the absent parent to avoid an assessment, which further complicates the situation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I hope that he will later contribute to our debate. Although the Government's proposal will affect only a small number of people, it will undermine our judicial system and people's confidence; it is not in anyone's interest.
<P>
As I said, we studied the Select Committee's report. You are a distinguished member of a Select Committee, Mr. O'Brien, so you know how these things work. It is only right that hon. Members should be able to table amendments, but when a vote divides strictly along party lines, the report is somewhat devalued. You will also know that such reports are put together by highly qualified Clerks on the basis of the flow of the evidence. I have read the report in question from cover to cover, and I could see no case for not having an upper maintenance limit. On pages xlii and xliii, the Social Security Select Committee's 10th report quotes the original text, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"While there will evidently be a relatively small number of cases where the non-resident parent is so wealthy that the abolition of maximum contribution would be an issue, such cases...have a high profile...We recommend that the Government should re-examine the possibility of inserting in the legislation an upper limit on the automatic application of the revised CSA formula."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Committee reversed that recommendation by five votes to two, which were cast along party lines. We should like to hear the Minister's justification for that.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> In fact, in his evidence, Nicholas Mostyn argued against the Government's proposal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am most grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point, but he may have misunderstood mine. I said that there was little evidence to suggest that there is no need for an upper limit. Indeed, I find Nicholas Mostyn's evidence extremely persuasive. If the Bill is not amended, children from families who have broken up and are using the CSA will be in a stronger legal position than those from happy, harmonious, united families. That cannot be sensible.
<P>
We are creating a formula under which a child may benefit from the increased wealth of the parent without care, but we are neglecting to create the mechanism through which the child will benefit from that fundamental shift. Without such a mechanism, we will be left with a rather underhand way in which to shift money between two parties.
<P>
A number of other points clearly show that there will be winners and losers. In particular, we need greater certainty about the concept of shared care. At the moment, approximately 25 per cent. of CSA cases involve shared care, which represents a significant slice of its case load. That problem cannot be properly addressed because of the way in which the formula is calculated for time spent with the parent without care. Families Need Fathers is particularly concerned about that. On the basis of rough justice, the Minister should clarify the situation. I hope that she will accept the amendment and that matters will be carefully laid out in the London Gazette.
<P>
The question of the parent with care's income should be addressed. Members of the Committee may recall my quotation from Mr. Justice Kay, which clearly demonstrated the injustice that is involved if the parent with care has a considerably higher income than the parent without care. The hon. Member for Hendon described a situation in which a non-resident parent was enjoying a high lifestyle while not making the necessary contribution.
<P>
There is another side to the coin. I have already experienced four cases at my surgery in which people expressed concern at the legislative changes. A non-resident parent may be a person of limited means, while the person who has charge of the family is considerably wealthier. As members of the Committee may be aware, Families Need Fathers has produced a newsletter explaining the system. The example that it gives refers implicitly to the Prime Minister and his wife. I see no reason to publicise that aspect, and shall therefore omit the personal references. Citing a typical modern couple with three children, it states
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"High earners both, she gets almost twice his salary. Sadly, their marriage breaks down, but as responsible parents they decide, in the interests of the children, that they will continue to play a significant childcare role, so they agree to share the children's care equally.
<P>
The newsletter goes on to explain that under the proposed system, the man would be expected to pay his higher-earning wife 12.5 per cent. of his income, as well as looking after the children half the time. The woman, however, would have no such financial obligation. Even if their earnings were equal, and their care of the children equal, the man would still have to pay more. Having suggested that that is not fair, equitable or sustainable--which is a fair point--the newsletter goes on to state that if the two people were living on benefits
<P>
"The 5.00 minimum payment would not apply to a shared care case,"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
so the man would pay nothing. It continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Quite right--he is equally sharing the care of the children. But that means equally sharing the cost as well, doesn't it? Apparently not."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The lady would be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"deemed to be the 'parent with care'. Though spending an equal amount of time caring for the children, she will also get Child Benefit, additional Income Support, plus Housing Benefit and other 'passported' allowances."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That illustration relates almost exclusively to the amendment. Will the Minister give a clear and unequivocal statement on who is going to gain, who is going to lose and how a degree of equality between parents and children can be achieved?
<P>
The Green Paper, the White Paper and the Bill are rightly on the side of the child. The Bill should be about helping children. We want to see equality among those children--we cannot see the point of impoverishing the children of a second marriage to benefit the children of a first marriage. We do not accept the idea that children of a first marriage are superior to those of a second marriage. The Minister should examine and exemplify the reasoning behind the Government's decision to introduce the new system, and consider ways of ameliorating the position of those who are the losers. I look forward to her comments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> This is a key area, because the success of the reform will depend on whether people perceive themselves as winners or losers. It is a clich that the winners will say nothing, and will not congratulate the Government on what they have achieved, whereas the losers will make a great fuss.
<P>
The Government have been shrewd in that regard. Previous Conservative Governments worked out what they thought was right, and imposed it on claimants. That was the right way to govern, although it caused enormous angst. This Government are politically shrewder--they are not changing the system for existing claimants such as widows. However, perhaps 350,000 women will become widows next year, and be worse off. The same will happen with regard to the CSA. The Government imagine that it will be easy to finesse in the new system because they are not introducing a big solution and nobody will be able to work it out. It will be quite difficult for new claimants to work out what they would have achieved under the old system. However, those who are already in the system, and who understand it quite well, will know how much they are paying now, and how much they will be paying under the new system. Those who are already in the system will wake up in 2001 and say, "This isn't fair. I am paying a lot more than I should."
<P>
New claimants will find it difficult to work out what they would have been paying. As we know, the existing formula is complicated. It sets a minimum target figure for the support of the number of children in question, and it works out the income of both parents, the minimum cost of support for the parents in question, housing costs, the effect of any earlier capital settlement, disability, responsibility for other children, shared care arrangements and travel-to-work costs.
<P>
I presume that a parent who enters the system after 2001 will find it difficult to work out whether he or she would have been better or worse off under the old system. Currently, a departure system takes into account many complex factors--travel-to-work costs, contact costs, illness or disability costs, pre-separation debt, pre-April 1993 commitments, the costs of supporting other children, capital settlements, non-income- producing assets, diverted income, life style inconsistent with income, unreasonably high housing costs, unreasonably high travel costs and failure of a partner to contribute to housing costs. Because of all those variables, it will be virtually impossible for a new claimant to say whether, if the old system had carried on, he or she would have been better or worse off. As we have heard, however, the new system will be very simple. Even a child would be able to work out whether he or she would be better or worse off.
<P>
Let us take the example of an absent father. He will be subject to a complex formula--I have read out the criteria--but he knows that, if he has one child, he will pay 15 per cent. of his income; if he has two children, 20 per cent.; and if he has three children, 25 per cent. He knows whether he will be better or worse off. Surely he will kick up a tremendous row. Are we not deluding ourselves that there are many quiet people out there who will say, "Fair enough, the Government have changed this; the present system--under which I pay part of my salary--is grossly unfair and complicated"? Will those hundreds of thousands of people who are worse off sit around and do nothing, or come into our surgeries to complain and cause difficulties for the Government? I think that they will do the latter.
<P>
<H5>12.15pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We should have more information on who will be the winners and losers under the new system. My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar referred to the table supplied by Nicholas Mostyn, which is on page 86 of the Select Committee report. It makes alarming reading. The present liability of a nursing auxiliary is 5.15 a week, but it will go up to 14 a week under the new system. However, it also works the other way. A grade 3 teacher's present liability of 64.69 a week will go down to 35 a week. The liability on average male manual earnings will go down from 74.94 to 40 a week, and that on average male non-manual earnings will go down from 86.48 to 52 a week.
<P>
One can see from that one table--as I have said, there is a shortage of information--a tremendous difference in the liability to be imposed on people. That leads me to suggest that there will be an enormous row about the issue. An idea to which we shall return is that the success of the scheme will depend on the extent to which the public perceives it to be fair. Many people who will be worse off under the new system than they are at present will start to complain strongly.
<P>
Labour Members often deny that the issue of an upper limit is important, as only a few people, who tend to be well off anyway, are involved. They say that children have a right to share in their parents' income, and ask what all the fuss is about. However, my anecdotal experience is that what really riles people is not the formula or the fact that they have to pay something--they accept that the formula is complicated, but think that it is trying to work things out--but the fact that they have to pay a heavy proportion of their income and much of it does not appear to go to the child.
<P>
I am sure that that is a common experience. People accept that their relationship has broken down, and that they have to pay for their child. However, they are irritated by the fact that the money that they are paying, which they cannot afford, is not going to the child because their ex-spouse is shacked up with someone earning a lot more than they are, and the money is being spent on luxuries. People tell me this again and again. They will say it even more when we have a system with no upper limit on what can be taken out of one's income. One could find oneself without any rights over where that money went.

<P>

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Is there not the equally important point that the child has no right over where that money goes? The child has no way of ensuring that that wealth is passed on to him or her. It could stay with the mother; it could go to the partner of the second relationship.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Yes, and I do not accept the argument that it will affect only a small number of wealthy people, so we need not concern ourselves with the problem and anyway these problems will be dealt with by the court. I suspect that the courts will follow this provision carefully and that a number of settlements will be overturned, because there is no upper limit. A professional person may earn 50,000 to 80,000 a year and the ex-spouse may say, "I am entitled to 15, 20 or 25 per cent. of that income. At the moment, because what I receive is based on these complicated formulae"--which I have gone through--"I am not receiving anything like that." Therefore, an enormous number of settlements will be reopened, not just at the top end of the scale but in the middle of the scale.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> The disincentive for such people to engage the Child Support Agency under the current system is the level of administrative incompetence which attends it, of which we are all aware from our surgeries. This reform, if it is successful, will remove that disincentive, and the lack of an upper limit will entice into the agency a private case load which will exacerbate the problem to which my hon. Friend drew attention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Either a private case load will be enticed into the agency or the courts will feel that the CSA formula sets a benchmark, and they will generally follow that benchmark. That was the flow of the evidence given to the Select Committee--that the courts will now follow this simple formula. As my hon. Friend says, people will be able to work it out very easily, and they will be able to work out whether they are worse off or better off.
<P>
What about the point that children have a right to share in their parents' income? I believe that they have no such right. They may have an expectation; indeed, in real life children do share in their parents' income, because parents who are living together pass on the benefits of their higher income to their children in many ways--in their living conditions, their education, or 101 different ways. Therefore, children have an expectation. The reality is that they share their parents' income, but they have no right to do so, and no legal system in the world says that children can sue their parents for a percentage share of their income. We would create an extraordinarily silly and unique system if we created such a right.
<P>
We were told that certain continental systems establish a right whereby a child is guaranteed a proportion of his parents' estate on death, and there is a complicated German word--which I will not read out because I cannot pronounce it--which describes that situation. That may be true, and one can understand why certain systems have decreed that a child should be guaranteed a minimum proportion of the parents' estate on death, but that is very different from saying that we want to create a system in which a child is guaranteed a set proportion of his or her parents' income. However, we are not doing that anyway, because there is no guarantee, as my hon. Friends have made clear, that this income will be passed on.
<P>
For all those reasons, we are now venturing into uncharted territory. One thing worries me; despite sitting through the Select Committee, I may have missed this point. I hope that the Minister will go into more detail about the figure of 350,000. My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar said that there may be up to 350,000 losers who are worse off by an average of 17 a week. He went on to argue from that that 840,000 children could be worse off, assuming that the money was all passed on and that there was a direct correlation between a CSA settlement and what the child received. That is my hon. Friend's estimate, but--I hope that he will forgive me--I am not prepared to accept that from him. Has he just worked it out on the back of an envelope or does a table in the London Gazette or something that a Minister has said set it out in detail?
<P>
Is my hon. Friend feeling pregnant?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> That is unkind, considering that a year ago I looked as though I was pregnant. After all that effort and the lack of chips, I would have thought that my hon. Friend could have given me some support in this matter.
<P>
The figures were supplied by the Minister, who is always courteous in her responses to written questions. I did the extrapolation on my Psion 5 organiser, but I suppose the back of an envelope would have done. To be honest with my hon. Friend--as he would expect me to be--I did it precisely because I was sure the Minister would then be galvanised into producing figures that gave us a clearer picture.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> That is an honest reply, and I apologise to my hon. Friend. We congratulate him on his new svelte appearance.
<P>
Am I right in saying that, if 840,000 children are worse off, there will be a neutral result? The Government are trying to work out who will be the winners and losers, and one would expect the result to be broadly neutral. I suspect that a vast churning exercise is now going on between winners and losers, and we shall have broad equality on that basis. Therefore, the new system, as one would expect, because the Government presumably want it to be achievable, will not result in a certain class of person being better or worse off or in more children being worse off than at present.
<P>
That is all very well, but why are we doing this? The only answer is that we want to make the system simpler. The only justification for what we are doing and for spending four to six weeks sitting in this Committee is that we have so little confidence in the CSA that we do not believe it is capable of producing a system that bears any relation to what is fair between the parties, and has to impose on them a rough and ready solution. We admit to ourselves that the winners and losers will broadly balance out, but we do not care about that--perhaps we do not know the details. We must ask ourselves whether that is an entirely satisfactory outcome. It would help if we had detailed tables.
<P>
When the Select Committee went to Falkirk, one of the gentlemen who briefed us had on his desk a series of tables. When we gave him particular circumstances of income, number of children and the rest of it, he could easily work it out. With such a simple formula, one would expect that. I suppose the Minister  will argue "I don't know why you are asking for all this extra information. After all, it is such an easy system that it will be easy to work it out" but I am not sure that life will be as simple as that. I have read out the long list of departures, and we know that there will be this new system of variations. What we do not know is how complex the variations will be and how similar they will be to the present departures system. We do not know what will be in the variations. We do not know whether the new variations system will take account of travel-to-work costs, contact costs, illness, disability, separation debts and all the other things that I alluded to earlier.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> My hon. Friend refers to variations, but is he also aware that we do not yet know what the net income will be? The net income will be a real key to whether there are winners or losers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> One of my hon. Friends made that point very well on Second Reading. He said that the real problem is not in the formula. Although a great deal of stress is placed on the complexity of the formula, if one goes to a CSA centre, one realises that the officers dealing with the formulas have reasonably good systems that ensure that they can work out quite simply what the father owes. The problem is determining the net income. The myth is growing up that this is is rough justice, but it will allow the CSA to be far more efficient, because it is simply 15 per cent. of the parent's income. The real problem, as my hon. Friend made clear, is not in the various criteria, but working out the net income of the absent parent. Some people, especially self-employed people, go to enormous lengths to disguise their net income.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> It may be helpful if the hon. Gentleman reads page 12 of the explanatory notes, which I commend to the Committee. They put the clauses into plain English and make them easier to understand, which was our aim in producing them.
<P>
Paragraph 10 on page 12 of the explanatory notes refers to net weekly income and states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The intention is to take account of income tax, National Insurance contributions, contributions to an Inland Revenue approved pension scheme and other types of specified income.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary and I know that she is trying to be helpful, but that was not the point I was making. People in difficult, emotional circumstances who feel that money is being taken from them to support an ex-spouse rather than a child want to resist the system. If that were not so, it would be fine and it could be said that the intention is simply
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to take account of income tax, National Insurance contributions, contributions to an Inland Revenue approved pension scheme",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 and everyone would co-operate with the system and provide the CSA with the figures. Is there a problem at the moment? Does my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham think that people come forward willingly to the CSA to tell it what they are earning and whether their wages go up and down? That does not happen now, and will not happen under the new system. People will do whatever they can to disguise what they earn.
<P>
It is relatively simple for wage earners with a steady wage and those who work for large companies to do as the Minister suggests and to work things out simply. I accept that. But the pattern of modern employment is that an increasing proportion of people do not work for large companies or do not have a steady employment record. Their wages go up and down, or they are self-employed or in casual employment, so the problems will continue to recur. What worries me is that, although the formula looks simple, the amount of work that the CSA will have to carry out will be almost as great as at present.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> With reference to page 13 of the explanatory notes, someone who decides to pay himself by way of dividend would escape scrutiny by the CSA.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> That is correct. People are adept at avoiding the clutches of the CSA.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I hesitate at this early stage to enter into the nitty, gritty details, but Opposition Members know that we can now go to the Inland Revenue and examine the tax returns of self-employed people. People may hide their income or receive dividend income, and there may be apparent disparities in that their lifestyle appears to be over and above what they have declared. They will have a duty to be truthful in their declarations to the CSA, and that duty will be backed up by criminal penalties. The variation scheme can be used by the parent with care.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> That is very helpful. I know that the Government are doing their best to tighten the screws on people who try to play the system. I have always been enthusiastic for Government Departments to speak to each other, and it has always been a mystery to me that Chinese walls are erected between, for example, the Inland Revenue and the Benefits Agency.
<P>
The Select Committee talked with people who had relevant experience in other countries, especially in the Scandinavian countries. They told us that they found our system incomprehensible. They do not understand why it was so difficult to pursue absent parents who do not fulfil their dues or why it is not possible for Government agencies, such as the CSA, to co-operate closely with the Inland Revenue. That would help to solve the problem. However, tax returns often constitute a historic document that relates to what happened last year or to what may happen next year, and there is much room for variation in the relevant figures. People may work overtime or they may collude with their employers. That appears to be happening increasingly in smaller businesses, and increasing numbers of people work for smaller businesses. Whatever avenue the Government decide to close off, there will always be 101 ways in which people can disguise what they are earning at any particular time.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> That is true. We must close loopholes when they appear. However, the hon. Gentleman appeared to argue that we should not have a tax system because such problems occur in it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> No, I am not arguing that. My point was that people legitimately try to use any means that they can to avoid paying tax, although it is illegal to try to evade paying tax. You will be aware, Mr. O'Brien, that death and taxes are inevitable. You hate paying taxes, but you have to pay them. People on all levels of income hate and resent paying money to their former partner, and they will find any possible means to avoid doing so. That is why the CSA has such problems; it deals with people in difficult emotional situations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> That is the nub of the matter. The Minister said that the Govemment's intention was to get money to children, but money is paid to the partner with care. Our attention was drawn earlier to the anomaly that involves a partner with an income that is significantly higher than that of the partner who makes payment--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are now repeating what has already been said. I want to hear new evidence. It is unacceptable for Committee members who make interventions to repeat what has been said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I shall not go down the route that was suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Your comments, Mr. O'Brien, prompt me to intervene. My hon. Friends have presented important new evidence about net income. The Minister said in her helpful intervention that the Secretary of State had relevant powers. They appear on page 72 of the Bill in paragraph 10B of schedule 1. I shall not read out that passage because it would be tedious to do so, but two points should be made. There has to be dividend income, and the person has intentionally to deprive himself of a source of income. Currently, however, dividend income falls outside the relevant definition. Net income should be included in the definition. If it is not, the situation that was described by the hon. Member for Hendon, who discussed people escaping their responsibilities, would occur. That is directly relevant, Sir, to the number of gainers and losers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> That is right. Page 72 of the Bill suggests that dividend income will not be covered by the clause and that the CSA will have to prove that a person has intentionally deprived himself of a source of income. It is often difficult to prove that a person has done something intentionally. We shall no doubt return to this matter later when we get down to the nitty-gritty of the Bill.
<P>
Although the proposed system appears to be simple, it will be more difficult to work out who will be the winners and the losers. The people who are currently enmeshed in a system that they loathe from the bottom of their heart will be able to work out in broad and simple terms what they would have been paying. A considerable but as yet unidentified number of those will realise that they are paying much more now than they should be, and they will make a huge row. The Government should tell us how they will deal with that row.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew George:</B> It is important to be clear about how to calculate who will be the gainers and who the losers. Insufficient evidence is currently available, which is why I shall make only a brief comment, and I hope that the Economic Secretary will at least have time to commence her response.
<P>
The points about gainers and losers were emphasised by my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) on Second Reading. I do not intend to repeat evidence that we have already heard. It is not appropriate, however, to base future discussions on trust. That is why we are anxious to hear the evidence that is available. It is worth exploring such issues to provide greater clarity about the anticipated impact of the Bill; that is vital. Although the debate is worth while, I cannot support the incorporation of the amendment into the Bill, as it would impose an onerous responsibility on the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> Given your earlier strictures, Mr. O'Brien, I shall avoid examination of the detail and confine my remarks to the general impact of the amendment on the clause.
<P>
The spin that trailed the Bill was one of warfare and a crusade against child poverty. The amendment would be a means of measuring effectiveness in this particular battle in that war. I cannot enumerate all the principles of war that I learned at Sandhurst. However, I can remember the first two, and the most important--the selection of the aim and the maintenance of that aim. When the noble Baroness Hollis appeared before the Select Committee, I asked her what aim the clause was intended to achieve. Was it a normative principle that parents should look after and provide for their children? Was it a measurable reduction in child poverty? Was it an increase in compliance with the Child Support Agency's assessments? Was it greater administrative efficiency? Was it equity? Alternatively, was it a Benthamite principle of the greater good for the greatest number of people? I wanted her to focus on the aim of the Bill and the clause in those respects, and to attach priority. She gave a thoughtful reply; indeed, it was clear that she was still thinking.
<P>
The amendment provides a means by which we can focus the Government's thinking on the outcome of the measure that they propose. It is not an onerous requirement; it requires that the Government make estimates and publish them in the London Gazette, where, touchingly, my commission was published, and where I could have legitimately expected my award of the territorial declaration to be published. The Government withdrew the award after I had qualified, but before it had been awarded. However, the publication of those estimates in the London Gazette would be adequate compensation. The Government must use the specified formula that is given in the schedules to provide an assessment of the consequences of the new formula for ordinary people and a measurement against what they would legitimately have expected to pay under the old formula.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I estimate, as do several commentators, that the mother or the taxpayer--given that 90 per cent. of the Child Support Agency's caseload is benefit-related, in most cases it will be the taxpayer--can expect an average reduction in the assessments from about 38 per week to about 30 a week. It would not be an onerous task to carry out some modelling based on that. Indeed, at the back of the White Paper there are copious pages assessing the effects of the new formula. I do not believe that it would greatly stretch the requirements if one were to ask for an assessment of the existing caseload of the Child Support Agency.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Before the hon. Gentleman embarks upon further calculations, perhaps I may give him a more accurate basis on which to do so. Forty-five per cent. of our current caseload of parents with care are on income support, while 20 per cent. are on working families tax credit. The rest are not on those benefits, and his figure of 90 per cent. is therefore wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> I stand corrected. Of course, the introduction of the working families tax credit means that the caseload will disappear so far as the agency is concerned. That is a welcome development. However, despite the complications to which my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar referred, it should not be beyond our ingenuity to do a little computer modelling, based on existing caseloads, so as to arrive at a fairly accurate reflection of precisely who gains and who loses--irrespective of the number of departures that are currently taking place.
<P>
Chapter 2 of the White Paper suggests that an intact family raising a child will normally spend about 30 per cent. of its income in doing so. Under the new formula in the schedule, when such a family breaks up, the partner without care will be required to provide only 15 per cent. of their income. That implies that the material quality of the child's life will fall dramatically, by half, while the partner without care may stand to make a substantial windfall. Such an outcome would not be consistent with the crusade against child poverty. That is precisely the issue that we wish to have explored in the estimates and published. If such a requirement were to be included in the Bill, it would focus the Government's mind on their aim in proposing the legislation and greatly benefit the remainder of the Committee's proceedings.

<P>

<B>Mr. Laurence Robertson:</B> I should like to make one or two general, and some more detailed remarks. Given your earlier strictures, Mr. O'Brien, I shall try to introduce some new thinking.
<P>
As well as being fair and efficient, the Child Support Agency should be seen to be able to provide. It is therefore important to consider, from a fundamental, philosophical point of view, what we are trying to provide. Are we trying to provide the parent with care with the cost of bringing up the child? If so, how do we assess that? Alternatively, are we, as the hon. Member for Hendon suggested, trying to provide a standard of living to which the child is accustomed? Those are often two different concepts. I am not saying that I have the answer, but we ought to consider exactly what we are trying to provide.
<P>
There is an emotional point relating to that issue. The parent without care has often lost the opportunity to see the child every day. I know that that would suit some 33 34 parents without care, who might want to see the child only once a month in the pub. However, many parents without care want to see their children regularly. One such parent came to see me recently at my surgery. It was a Friday, and I said that I hoped that he would have a good weekend. He said, "I'm seeing my children this weekend, so I'm happy." That was all that mattered to him. If he saw his children, he was happy; if he did not see them, he was not happy.
<P>
I am not suggesting that the House of Commons can legislate for that kind of emotional problem. However, perhaps some allowance should be made for parents without care, to compensate them for their loss. They have not necessarily lost money. Indeed, the fact that they have no family to go home to every night might mean that they can earn more money. Instead of working from nine to five, they might work from nine in the morning until 10 in the evening. They might be better off financially when they do not have the family with them, but they have lost a great deal in other ways. We ought to recognise that point.
<P>
It is essential that we ensure that the money provides for the children rather than for the parent with care. There is a great deal of difference there. One could draw an analogy with the way in which the Government are treating asylum seekers in terms of vouchers. I am not suggesting that we go down that road in this case, but we should, perhaps, concentrate on that issue. If we are to relieve child poverty, as the Government say that they are interested in doing, we must ensure that any money provided by the parent without care goes to the child.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that we should pay child maintenance in vouchers because we do not trust the mothers to spend the money on their children?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> I said that I was not suggesting that we go fully down that road. However, we have to consider all ways of ensuring that the money provided by the parent without care goes to help the children. Is the Minister suggesting that we should ignore the fact that a lot of money paid to parents with care does not go to those children? Of course it does not go to the children, as we have already heard.
<P>
As I said earlier, one reason why parents without care avoid the assessment in the first place is that they do not believe that the money will go to the children. They may have fallen out with their partner--otherwise they would be with them--but they have not fallen out with their children. They want to give money not to their partner, but to their children. We shall not be doing the children a great service if we do not examine ways of ensuring that the money goes to them.
<P>
It is also important to assess the net income properly. As my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough suggested, one of the problems with the system is that it is easy to work out what 15, 20 or 25 per cent. of one's salary would be, but it is not quite so easy to assess the net salary. I am concerned about what is to be taken into account when making that assessment.
<P>
People are also troubled by the inefficiencies of the system, and by the way in which the Child Support Agency has been run. We have heard many complaints about computers causing those problems. I want to introduce a new idea that has not been mentioned this morning. I hope that you will not rule me out of order for doing so, Mr. O'Brien, because it is important in the context of my argument. Parliament is to be asked to spend money on a new computer system before the Bill receives Royal Assent. I raise that point because there is a great deal of concern as to whether that money will be properly spent.
<P>
I want to ensure that we do not make worse the inefficiencies that already exist in the system, because being wrongly assessed is as bad as not receiving any money. As I understand it, the suicides that have taken place as a result of the introduction of the Child Support Agency have been among those who were wrongly assessed, not those who received no money. These are important issues and we must get them right.
<P>
I am also concerned about whether the Bill will enable absent parents to be contacted to ensure that they pay, but I expect that it will probably go some way towards achieving that aim. The parent who is contactable but who makes a bit of a fuss about the amount that he is supposed to pay is not the real problem. Of course, there are many families who cannot trace a previous partner, and I hope that that will be taken into account. We must take this opportunity to get matters absolutely right, because a great deal is at stake.
<P>
<B>Miss Julie Kirkbride </B>(Bromsgrove): I applaud, but do not envy, the Government in taking on the Child Support Agency, which has not worked well during the past few years. Nevertheless, the underlying principle of the agency remains right, so I congratulate the Government on dealing with this matter. As my hon. Friends have said, we are well aware of the problems associated with the CSA. People bring them to our surgeries every week, and they write to us, so we must consider carefully how to proceed. Many such problems will emerge as we discuss the various amendments.
<P>
In many ways, the principle that underpins amendment No. 1 goes to the heart of the matter. Money and its distribution has been the chief cause of distress to all concerned. Many absent parents--most of whom are fathers--who object to the CSA have done so primarily because of the amount of money that they are being asked to pay. Equally, the interest that many mothers, who are usually the parents with care, have taken in the CSA relates to the amount of money that they receive from absent fathers. This issue is central to the difficulties that the CSA has in carrying out its work. As parliamentarians, we will be aggravated to hear people complain about the new system. None of us should expect everyone to be happy with change; we should be aware that the changes that the Government are bringing about will make some people unhappy.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury was right to say that money is not the sole issue. In my constituency, there are cases in which the absent father, who is usually villified, has been damaged by the break-up of his family. Demands are placed on his income, which, in the context of the CSA, is reasonable. However, he feels that the amount that he is expected to pay is unreasonable because his wife is in fact well off. He feels aggrieved because he cannot afford to buy his children presents. The money that he gives his wife enables her, so he claims, to live the life of Riley. The creation of a system that can deal with such cases which seem entirely legitimate when they are discussed in surgeries, is a major issue.
<P>
As I have said, primarily, it is the question of money that upsets people. We should know who will be affected by the changes that the Government are putting in place. We have been given the rough and ready figure that two thirds of absent parents will pay less. The Government do not have much to fear from those figures. Although many parents may receive less from their absent counterparts, the money will be made up by the state through the 10 disregard that will be put in place. Nevertheless, those who receive less will want to know what the difference will be, how many people will be affected, and by how much. Those are serious issues. Raising children is a very expensive business.
