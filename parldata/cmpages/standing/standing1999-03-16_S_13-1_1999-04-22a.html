<P>
<H5>4.30 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department (Mr. Geoffrey Hoon):</B>  On a point of order, Mr. Maxton. I should explain to the Committee that I will respond to an Adjournment debate in the House later this evening. I should like to deal with certain amendments that have been tabled but I may not be in a position to respond to some Members' arguments and it may seem as if I am being discourteous to them. I thought that I should make that clear, and I hope that no one objects if I begin by dealing with certain amendments. 
<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): Further to that point of order, Mr. Maxton, may I say how much we will miss the Minister when he leaves? We have very much enjoyed his contributions. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am not sure whether that is a point of order, but I am sure that the Committee is grateful to the hon. Gentleman. 
<P>
<B>Mr. David Maclean </B>(Penrith and The Border): On a point of order, Mr. Maxton, the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department, the hon. Member for Ashfield (Mr. Hoon) is most courteous. I will not make political capital out of his point of order. However, the fact that he may doze off is a different matter. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is a different point of order. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> Yes, it is a different point of order. 
<P>
I am a bit rusty on procedural matters, Mr. Maxton, and need your direction. Going through the matters that we discussed yesterday and today, it is clear that there is potential for new clauses to be tabled. Those clauses would deal with some of the measures that we have already discussed. 
<P>
Is it in order to table clauses on subjects that we have already touched on and can they be debated? I cannot remember the procedures, Mr. Maxton. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It makes no difference. The right hon. Gentleman is entitled to table a new clause. Provided that such a clause is in order and relates to the Bill, it may be selected, although I obviously cannot make any promises about that. However, the right hon. Gentleman may wish to bear in mind the tabling of new clauses in Committee and on Report. 
<H4><center>Clause 21 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Procedure </center></H4>
<P>
 Question proposed [this day]: That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
Question again proposed. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley </B>(Worthing, West): Refreshed by lunch, I shall keep my remarks brief. I wish to raise a new point relating to the interaction of civil and criminal proceedings. 
<P>
One of my early constituency cases involved a young man who was arrested and was told that if he pleaded guilty, he would be released on bail. He therefore agreed that he was guilty. However, he came to see me and, when I asked whether he was guilty, he replied: "Not at all." I therefore said that he should change his plea. 
<P>
That young man pleaded guilty to avoid custody. So there is a risk that if a vehicle is impounded on a criminal charge, the carrier may plead guilty to get his vehicle released. In relation to penalties, a carrier can go to the courts to challenge an order for impounding or detaining a vehicle. 
<P>
I am worried by the interaction with criminal proceedings. Someone may find it easier to plead guilty to a small criminal charge as the penalty is likely to be lower than the £2,000 penalty for bringing in a clandestine entrant by avoiding the immigration service. 
<P>
I do not expect the Minister to give a detailed response to that matter, as I did not give him notice of it. However, civil and criminal procedures--and their possible ramifications--need to be considered. I will not give other illustrations of my point, but I should be grateful if the Minister would pay attention to it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> This morning, the Minister gave one of his best replies ever to our debates. In the clause stand part debate, he resorted to his innate nice-guyness behind his nice--guy image and the debate was the best that we have had. I do not wish to be out of order, but I sincerely wish to thank the Minister for responding genuinely to the points that I raised. 
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</B> Tributes are starting to flow, so the end of my career is obviously nigh. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Worthing, West (Mr. Bottomley) asked whether penalty notices would be cancelled or not proceeded with. If there is no liability, they can be cancelled when a person puts in a proper defence. If, for some reason, discretion is exercised not to enforce them, they may not be proceeded with. A letter to that effect will be sent. If the clandestine is not in a vehicle, that point will be dealt with in a court case or as a result of the representations being made. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman suggested that someone might plead guilty to a criminal charge rather accept a civil penalty. Given that the criminal penalties for facilitation are extremely serious and involve imprisonment, I suspect that most people would not be disposed to take that course of action. They might fear that a £2,000 fine would seriously affect their business, but they would probably be more afraid of the prospect of spending  961 962 seven years in prison. I shall consider the hon. Gentleman's point, and I shall write to let him know whether I think that there are any serious grounds for his fears. I suspect that there are not. 
<P>
Question put and agreed to. 
<P>
Clause 21, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill. Clause 22 Power to detain vehicles etc. in connection with penalties under section 18 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 199 in page 16, line 6, leave out "a significant" and insert "an obvious and substantial". 
<P>
We have moved on to the next clause, which deals with an important new feature of the same subject. Before lunch, I described the clause as the sting in the tail. It contains the power to detain vehicles after the issuing of a penalty notice. 
<P>
In its written evidence, the road haulage industry told us that it was concerned by the proposals and, interestingly, those concerns coincide with those of human rights organisations. Justice says that it is not impressed by the fact that detention can subsequently be challenged in court 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"given the serious prejudice that will have already occurred... and the fact that the court cannot provide any remedy for any losses sustained as a result of the transporter's seizure."--[Official Report, Special Standing Committee, 16 March 1999; c. 64.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We therefore need to consider carefully the circumstances under which detention--or as Justice describes it "seizure"--can take place. The amendment deals with those circumstances, so, in that context, it would be helpful to know whether the Minister thinks that penalty notices will normally be given soon after an alleged illegal entry comes to light. 
<P>
Once the penalty notice has been given, under clause 22(1) 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a senior officer may detain any relevant-- 
<P>
(a) vehicle 
<P>
(b) small ship, or 
<P>
(c) or aircraft, 
<P>
until all penalties . . . have been paid."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 That would be a serious step to take. 
<P>
Subsection (2) relates to the conditions that must be fulfilled before the power can be exercised. According to paragraph (a), it can be exercised 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>if, in the opinion of the senior officer concerned, there is a significant risk that the penalty . . . will not be paid before the end of the prescribed period if the transporter is not detained".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection 2(b) states that the power 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"may not be exercised if alternative security which the Secretary of State considers is satisfactory, has been given."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The subsection concerns me. Smaller operators are more likely to come within its provisions because a larger operator is more likely to be able to provide alternative security if he wants to get his vehicle back after it has been served with a penalty notice and detained. In that case, he has a let-out under subsection (2)(b): if he can provide alternative security he can get his vehicle back. It is mainly the small operators who will be concerned about the proposal because they may not be able to give alternative security. 
<P>
The power in paragraph (a) can be exercised 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"if, in the opinion of the senior officer . . . there is a significant risk".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would replace the word "significant" with the phrase "obvious and substantial". We tabled the amendment to discover how high, or significant, a risk of the penalty not being paid the Minister thinks there should be before a senior officer detains the vehicle. The issue should be debated because, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean), said, it is a serious step. For many operators, large and small, the fact that their vehicle has been detained will concentrate their minds; they will be worried only about getting the vehicle back so that they can continue to earn their living. 
<P>
I described the power to detain as a sting in the tail if it was not operated fairly. We debated at length the procedures and the steps to be taken to dispute them, but if someone's lorry is detained, or seized, as Justice put it, in practice it will short-circuit much of what we described. 
<P>
This is an important subject and we look forward to the Minister of State's reply. He will want to emulate the eloquence and helpfulness of his hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> If I say that the amendment is significant I do not want the Committee to think that we attach as low a threshold to its importance as the Government may attach to "significant" in line 6, page 16. 
<P>
The use of the word "significant" imposes too low a potential threshold on the judgment of the senior immigration officer in determining whether to exercise the power, which can be exercised if in the opinion of the senior officer there is a significant risk. How will that senior officer determine what constitutes a significant risk that the penalty will not be paid? What evidence must he have before he comes to that conclusion? Will it be that he does not like the look of the operator, or thinks that he is a fly-by-night or not within the British jurisdiction--I think that that is the term we must use, rather than saying that he might be a foreigner who may abscond or not pay? Will the officer take into account criteria that may be dependent on the size of the firm or of the vehicle? If the vehicle is part of a big fleet he may conclude that there is no problem because it belongs to a company of substance or a man of means and thus there is little risk. 
<P>
What does the Minister think should be at the back of the senior immigration officer's mind when he exercises his opinion and concludes that there is a significant risk? Given the serious harm that could be inflicted on 963 964 businesses by detaining a vehicle, a senior officer must be able to substantiate his belief and show that his decision is not prejudiced or arbitrary. 
<P>
The Minister will say that immigration officers would not take an arbitrary or prejudiced decision, but should not the same rules apply to those officers as apply to police officers operating stop and search under the various codes of practice whereby officers are not allowed to stop a person simply because he dresses in a certain way or looks like others whom they have stopped. They should not stop people because they are young, wear an earring or are of a certain colour, creed or nationality on the prejudiced assumption that they may be criminals just because that was the case with others of similar appearance whom they stopped. How are we to ensure that immigration officers, who have the best of intentions and are not bigoted, biased, racist or prejudiced but have stopped young guys in trucks or in a certain type of vehicle that they think is the sort usually, habitually or traditionally used for the trade in clandestines, will not automatically assume that a person of a certain disposition, type or character driving such a vehicle who in his view looks a bit dodgy is the sort who is not going to pay his fine? 
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
If immigration officers think that there is a significant risk of a fine not being paid, it is inevitable that those about whom they form that opinion will be from a small company which may not have the means to pay or which they regard as a fly-by-night firm. I fear that many genuine innocent companies which happen to be small beer will get caught under this catch-all on the premise that a small company is likely to abscond and not pay. I have not checked with my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere yet but I do not think that Opposition Members are asking to see a code of practice at this stage. However, I hope that the Minister will be able to assure me that there will be some internal guidance--a sort of mini-equivalent of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act codes of practice for immigration officers--to point out that immigration officers should not let the Eddie Stobarts of this world through automatically because they are big guys who are bound not to pay and who have a lot of lawyers to "sort you out if you try and impound Ellie May" or any other of Eddie Stobart's trucks, while seeing the small guys, who perhaps do not have legal means behind them, as fair game for stopping. I assume that the immigration service would want to operate in that way in any event--indeed, I would be appalled and surprised if immigration officers came to any other conclusion--but I would like reassurance that some internal guidelines or code will be available. 
<P>
The exercise of discretion by a senior officer may amount to confiscation of the property of a third party; a driver may not, of course, be the owner of the vehicle. Some of my hon. Friends may wish to refer to the point made by the Freight Transport Association and the Road Haulage Association in their briefings so, for the sake of brevity, I will not rehearse the argument. However, a serious problem remains. It is all very well for an immigration officer to conclude that he does not like the look of a driver--by that I mean all aspects such as his financial means, his arguments and so on, but if he judges that the driver may not be a man of means, or may not pay, and he decides to detain the vehicle, he may be detaining a vehicle belonging to someone else, and that could be very unfair and arbitrary, and perhaps seriously damaging to a business. 
<P>
Where a driver is the owner of a detained vehicle, his livelihood could be lost immediately. The Minister will say that, in theory, he could apply to the courts but, in practice, a driver might not be able to afford to contest the penalty. This point was made in an early evidence sittings by, I believe, the lady from Justice. Also, a driver may suffer because of the cost of a court case. I should like an assurance that there could be either a speedy application to the courts or, preferably, that in reaching the opinion that there is a serious risk, the immigration service will also take account of the damage that might be done to the business and of the fact that companies could be put out of business if an officer comes to a wrong conclusion. 
<P>
The RHA and the FTA support a fast and effective appeal procedure. I back that view entirely. It is essential that disruption to business should be minimal. What we heard this morning about the £2,000 penalty did not reassure me that the procedure will be as fast as we should like. In later debates on the clauses relating to detention and the threat of detention, we should like assurances that the appeal procedure can be very rapid indeed, because jobs depend on it. 
<P>
Although I need not make any political points at this stage, I do say that if, in taking these powers to detain vehicles, the Government end up destroying small businesses and jobs it will be a black day for the economy. I look forward to the Minister's response.

<P>

<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): I should like to echo some of the views of my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere on amendment No. 199. The word "significant" has a wide interpretation and "obvious and substantial" is far better. 
<P>
My first point is that my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border has put his finger on a good point. Immigration officials are more likely to think that a self-employed owner-driver does not have the resources to pay a fine, particularly if it is a multiple fine. He is at greater risk of having his vehicle detained. It will be less of a problem for a member of a large group, certainly one which is obviously of substance, such as a P and O-type organisation. 
<P>
Apart from considering penalty notices, the immigration official will have to take a view at that time without having regard to who owns the vehicle, whether it is leased or whether money is owed on it, and so will decide to detain a vehicle simply by the look of the individual. We continually talk about codes of practice, but it has to be quite clear what steps an immigration officer would go through before that happened. No doubt, following the issue of a penalty notice, he would have to follow procedures to decide what was a sensible course of action. People have bonds, but there might be a telephone call to company headquarters. These things would have to be done. 
<P>

<P>
A one-man band or someone who does not look like a person of substance may well find his vehicle impounded. It is much more serious for him to have his vehicle impounded than for someone whose vehicle is a part of a fleet of 50, as the former cannot earn his living. That might be a strong incentive to pay the penalty, but there is a problem of how this matter will be handled in relation to small businesses. When we debated another clause, we discussed the difficulty for foreign drivers who are not-- 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This is quite a narrow amendment and the hon. Gentleman should address it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I take your point, Mr. Maxton, but it is a narrow amendment that has been used widely against drivers coming into our ports. The word "significant" covers a wide area. The significance of this may differ with different categories of driver. If a foreign driver has no office in the United Kingdom and no bank accounts or resources, the most obvious thing to do is to detain the vehicle. There is a more obvious and substantial risk of not getting the money from a Dutch owner-driver coming into Britain than from a British company domiciled in the UK. 
<P>
We may end up with a lot of impounded foreign lorries. There may be implications for our European Union colleagues. If Dutch, Belgian or French lorries are impounded because of the interpretation of the clause, it may lead to problems on the other side of the channel. The clause would be improved if amendment No. 199 were accepted. There has to be a step-by-step procedure so that the power is not abused by immigration officials but is honestly used because they believe that it is the sure way of getting their fine. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis </B>(New Forest, East): I should like to raise five points. The first, which has already been raised, concerns discrimination against small firms. Given that the Minister told us that about 8,000 illegal immigrants entered the country that way last year, will he tell us the average number of stowaways in any one case? Are there usually only one or two people, so that it is an exception to find more, or are there frequently larger numbers? 
<P>
I ask that in relation to the clause, because if the majority of cases relate to one illegal immigrant, or perhaps two or three illegal immigrants at any one time, surely the likelihood is that larger firms will keep available a fighting fund or penalty fund of a few thousand pounds to post, like a bond, so that, if one of their vehicles is detained, they can be assured of instant release. Small firms, on the other hand, would not be able to manage anything on that scale and would have an immediate crisis every time that a vehicle was detained. 
<P>
My second point is this. Presumably, costs will be associated with the storage of vehicles while they are in detention, so if a vehicle is detained, will the firm to which it belongs be charged parking fees? If so, that will add a good deal to the costs. Added to my initial point about discrimination, that means that small firms will be  hit harder: they will not have money to set aside for instant release and, because they cannot obtain instant release, they will end up with swingeing storage or parking charges. 
<P>
My third point relates to guidelines and criteria. I am not sure whether another code of practice is proposed. We heard a great deal on earlier clauses about codes of practice and their deficiencies, and the danger of their being gold-plated. It is essential that there are clear criteria for the detention of vehicles in this way. 
<P>
In that connection I suggest, as my fourth point, that there is a danger that the Bill gives too much discretion to the immigration officer, to such a point that so much responsibility is not fair, even on the immigration officer himself. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The amendment is clearly about why the words "obvious and substantial" are better than the word "significant". 
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> I am sorry, Mr. Maxton. I thought that that was what I was talking about. The word "significant" allows enormous latitude. Any thought that registers on any scale of mental awareness could count as significant, whereas for something to be obvious and substantial a much tougher test is necessary. We must choose those words because of the need for equity, which can be achieved only if a clear yellow card is given for the criteria that must be met for the detention to go ahead. 
<P>
Finally, I suggest that if the threshold is set too low, there is a serious danger that, for example, a disgruntled driver with a grudge against his employer could, if stopped with a person who was found to be an illegal immigrant, seize the opportunity, by deliberately obstreperous behaviour, to have his employer's vehicle impounded. The employer would bear the cost and the disgruntled driver would probably be laughing at him. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I talked yesterday about plumbing new depths, but the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis), with his last observation at least, has at any rate provided the Committee with entertainment that we might not have had. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere accurately described the operation of the clause. It introduces a power to detain vehicles in connection with a civil penalty. Subsection (2) provides that that important power can be used only in specific circumstances. Under subsection (2)(a), it can be exercised only if, in the opinion of the relevant senior immigration officer, there is a significant risk that the penalty will not be paid before the end of the prescribed period if the vehicle, ship or aircraft is not detained. 
<P>
I shall deal with the points that the hon. Member for Hertsmere made. We anticipate that the penalty notice will usually be served soon after one or more clandestines are found, especially when the discovery is made at immigration control. The procedure for subsequent representations is designed to ensure that the case is examined even more thoroughly. It is in everyone's interest that all the processes occur with 967 968 dispatch. The sooner they happen after the discovery of clandestines, the better the information for the authorities. It is in the interests of drivers, owners or controllers of a lorry for the matter to be resolved as soon as possible. 
<P>
<H5>5 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
Several Conservative Members mentioned the change that amendment No. 199 would make. They suggest that the clause should provide for an "obvious and substantial" risk rather than a "significant" risk. No Conservative Member tried to justify the change other than to claim that the amendment would provide for a stronger test. 
<P>
The words, "significant" and "substantial" have more or less the same meaning in the context of the clause. Therefore, the inclusion of the word "obvious" is the only change that the amendment proposes. Conservative Members did not explain what they meant by "obvious". "Significant" is well understood. If Conservative Members want to give lawyers further opportunities to investigate the meaning of "obvious", they will support the amendment. However, it would add little to a straightforward test that can be applied by the relevant immigration officers. 
<P>
In reply to the points that the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border made, there will be guidance for the immigration officers who exercise the power. The powers will be reviewed at senior level to ensure that they are exercised properly. 
<P>
I hope that the points that the hon. Member for New Forest, East made do not require detailed examination. Different numbers of people are found in vehicles. I cannot provide an average, but doing so would not be especially helpful. There will be parking fees for vehicles that are detained. I have already mentioned the code of practice. The discretion will be supervised by a senior official. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> The Minister has made a significant admission about parking fees. Can he suggest the possible scale and rate of those fees? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I cannot give the hon. Gentleman a precise figure, but they will probably be related to the appropriate commercial charges for storing vehicles. The immigration service will not want to profit from that, but there are charges that are associated with supervising other people's property. The taxpayer does not want to subsidise the storage of such vehicles. I am sure that the hon. Member for New Forest, East understands that. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B>  Will the Minister explain to the Committee whether the scale of the charges will be large in comparison with the actual penalties?

<P>

<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I have already said that I cannot specify the scale of the charges. Therefore, the hon. Gentleman should be able to work out the answer to his question. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We have had a useful little debate. The Minister said that the penalty notice will be served soon after the circumstances that gave rise to it. We can infer from what the Minister said that in most cases it will be at the quayside. 
<P>
I am not going to press for a Division; the amendment was intended to explore the issues. We found out something about parking charges of which we were hitherto unaware. However, in the interests of making progress, I shall not press the Minister on that. However, I would be grateful if he would write to me about it in due course, as he seemed surprised about some of the information that he was imparting. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 200, in page 16, leave out lines 9 and 10 and insert-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(b) may not be exercised if-- 
<P>
(i) alternative security which the Secretary of State considers is satisfactory has been given, or 
<P>
(ii) the person to whom the penalty has been given indicates that he proposes to give notice of objection, 
<P>
but in the case of subsection (2)(b)(ii) above a senior immigration officer may disregard the indication given by the person and exercise his power to detain the transporter if he considers that the grounds for giving such a notice of objection are manifestly unfounded".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Under subsection (2), the power to detain 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"may be exercised only, if, in the opinion of the senior officer ... there is a significant risk that the penalty ... will not be paid before the end of the prescribed period",
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and it 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"may not be exercised if alternative security"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is provided. The amendment would expand that by establishing another ground on which the power to detain could not be exercised--when the person concerned contests the liability. It is important to explore what would happen in such cases. 
<P>
We were at pains yesterday to establish that the enforcement of the penalty would not take place until the person had had an opportunity to contest the allegation. A similar point underlies the amendment--that it would be undesirable if a person who contested liability and eventually succeeded in establishing non-liability suffered prejudice in the meantime. That risk often occurs in criminal proceedings when defendants are held in custody and then triumphantly walk free from the court. It happens from time to time, but it is best to avoid it whenever possible. 
<P>
The amendment also contains a filter that would enable a senior immigration officer to 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"disregard the indication given by the person ... if he considers that the grounds ... are manifestly unfounded".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would stop someone from contesting liability solely in order to get out of paying the penalty without being serious about it. 
<P>
The Minister is likely to respond that it has to be viewed in the context of subsection (2)(a), which establishes whether 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"there is a significant risk that the penalty ... will not be paid".
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
He may say that it neglects to take into account the circumstances that I mentioned, which would be a fair point. However, he should reflect further on the problem of someone who wishes to contest liability suffering serious prejudice. 
<P>
I draw the Minister's attention to the submissions of Justice, which looked at what would happen in those circumstances. It said: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In practice ... an individual subject to a penalty notice would be obliged to pay the penalty for fear of the consequences. This would be particularly the case for those for whom detention of a transporter represented the removal of all, or a significant proportion of, their livelihood."--[Official Reports:, Special Standing Committee, 16 March 1999; c. 64.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Once again, that affects the small operators, whom we want to have a fair crack of the whip in contesting liability. That would be difficult if they knew that their vehicle would be impounded and that they would be deprived of the profits of using it. In some cases, that could be an overwhelming consideration. Will the Minister explain how those operators will be given a fair crack of the whip in those circumstances? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I apologise to the Minister for being outside the Room during his reply, which I did not expect so quickly in our proceedings. 
<P>
The amendment is important. I want to deal with paragraph (b)(i), which repeats the power earlier in the Bill, because I want to know what alternative security the Secretary of State considers satisfactory. What does the Minister have in mind? 
<P>
Alternative security for a big, refrigerated HGV trailer with a Volvo tractor cab, which is a minimum £70,000-worth of tackle, would be a bond of £70,000. It may not be necessary; the Secretary of State may conclude that in the case of one clandestine, which carries a penalty of £2,000, he will be happy to accept a bond or security of £5,000 for the vehicle that has been detained. 
<P>
I suspect, however, that more small vehicles than large ones will be detained. Will security to the full value of the vehicle be necessary? A rented van, for example, is worth considerably less than a large truck. It may be worth £10,000, but that is only one seventh of the value of a £70,000 vehicle. I am anxious that for those with smaller vehicles the security demanded will be proportionately more. 
<P>
Does the Minister have in mind a sliding scale, so that the minimum security demanded in respect of each clandestine discovered will be twice or three times the value of the fine? If the vehicles are detained, the security demanded for smaller vehicles will be higher, proportionately, than for larger vehicles which may be part of a bigger fleet. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> People who deliberately smuggle clandestines will study the measure very closely. Does my right hon. Friend agree that there is a strong likelihood that such people will ensure that the vehicles they use will be worth very little? They will not mind if they are detained, or even abandoned, thus negating the effect of the clause on those who are most guilty of the activities that it seeks to prevent. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> That is a possibility that I confess I had not thought of before. Of course, people who go out to commit armed robbery, for example, do not use their own vehicles. People who commit crimes want to be sure that none of their own property will be impounded. Those who are involved in racketeering and whom we want to be severely punished will not buy their own new lorry on the off-chance, or the good chance, that they will be caught and thus lose their own vehicle. The perfect solution for them will be to have a cheap trailer, convert it to contain hidden compartments and have it towed on to a cross-channel boat or train by a reputable company. If the vehicle is impounded, the people involved in racketeering, who own the cheap and worthless trailer, lose very little. It is the poor sucker with the expensive tractor unit who suffers the loss. There is a good possibility that such things will happen. 
<P>
I need to know what the Minister has in mind as alternative security. Does he envisage a sliding scale in cash? Has he considered a deferment of VAT for those companies that are registered for it? If companies are registered for VAT, Customs and Excise already has its fingers into them and if they are owed VAT returns of £10,000, £20,000, £30,000 or £40,000 the immigration service should be able to contact Customs and Excise and have part of the VAT refund transferred to the immigration service as a bond or security. That may be one of the more valuable ways of doing it if that is an acceptable alternative. 
<P>
I am sure that it is because the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department boasted yesterday that they now have joined-up government and they all collaborate. The test will be whether any Department can get any co-operation out of Customs and Excise. I am dreading hearing the Minister say that they have already got that sewn up because I shall be obliged to praise him, even more than his hon. Friend if he can get whole-hearted cooperation from Customs and Excise, even to hand over someone else's money to another Government Department. 
<H4><center>5.15 pm </center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I support the amendment. A tremendous incentive for anyone who owns a valuable asset is the desire to get it back. If a reputable company has a vehicle impounded it will do everything it can to release it, either by posting money or a bank order. I have some reservations about paragraph (ii). There is a risk in putting that in; if someone is going to object he would do so automatically to get the vehicle released. I welcome the addition that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a senior immigration officer may disregard the indication given by the person and exercise his power to detain the transporter if he considers that the grounds for giving such a notice of objection are manifestly unfounded."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, the person would have the opportunity to say that he would give notice of objection, but if it was seen to be a frivolous objection, the immigration officer 971 972 could overrule it. If the driver feels that he has a case, such as witnesses who are not available at that time, it might be taken into account as a reason for not impounding the vehicle. 
<P>
One of the difficulties of the Bill in general is that it would be the word of the lorry driver that he checked the vehicle against the word of the immigration official. One way of getting over that where there is a line of vehicles on the continent waiting to get on to the ferry would be to cross check. One driver could check a lorry for another driver who would check his and they would both sign a docket to say that they had looked over a vehicle. When the driver turns up at Dover and the immigration officials find someone in the back of the vehicle he could say that Fred So-and-So of Jones transport checked the vehicle on the other side of the channel and thought that it was allright. There may then be phone calls or letters to someone else to verify that information. 
<P>
In such an instance it would make absolute sense not to impound that vehicle because further evidence may come to light and either a penalty notice could be cancelled or not issued at all. Things are not quite so clear cut and so the wording suggested in the amendment is a little better. 
<P>
One difficulty with the Bill is that the joint and several liability means that if a driver is guilty the firm will be responsible. That tends to mean that the firm will be anxious to get its vehicle back and will post some security. That is a bit of rough justice, but given the nature of the Bill and the administrative nature of the charge there is probably nothing that can be done about it.

<P>

<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for giving way particularly as I had the discourtesy to be out of the Room for part of his remarks. Surely a key point in this connection is the relationship between the parking charges and whether a firm tries to pay up. Clearly the parking charges will be non-refundable. If they are to be refundable perhaps we should hear about it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> Some of that may have to come up on clause stand part. There will inevitably be other associated charges with impounding a vehicle. The cost of having a vehicle impounded for any length of time is likely to be more substantial than the fine, particularly as it would have to be in a secure compound. I do not want to stray too far from amendment No. 200. The clause will work in the sense of getting security from a company, but the wording proposed in amendment No. 200 is an improvement. 
<P>
Other matters may emerge. A firm's track record may be material to immigration officials. Should a firm have an outstanding fine, another of its vehicles may have to be caught and impounded to get the money from it. 
<P>
I will raise the other matters that I wish to consider in the stand part debate, otherwise you will call me out of order, Mr. Maxton. I am most anxious to be helpful. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The Government recognise the considerable implications of detaining vehicles, ships and aircraft for the transport industry. However, it is important that we should have the power provided for in clause 22 to back up the civil penalty. Otherwise, disreputable operators could have a penalty notice served on them, but could drive away and ignore the penalty. Foreign-based operators, in particular, could rely on the difficulty of tracing and serving the penalty. 
<P>
Subsection 2(b) recognises the difficulties that may arise for owners and operators of vehicles, providing that vehicles may not be detained if satisfactory alternative security has been given. Amendment No. 200 seeks to insert into the clause another possible reason to prevent detention of a transporter: the person on whom the penalty is imposed would simply have to indicate that he or she intends to give notice of objection to the penalty. That would provide a get-out from the vehicle being detained, so would clearly be used by every operator whose transporter was proposed for detention. 
<P>
Those who tabled the amendment have attempted to reduce the consequences of that by inserting a modification so that a senior immigration officer could disregard the objection being given to the civil penalty if he considered the grounds for that object are "manifestly unfounded". 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I was noot attempting to intervene, but nodding in agreement with the Minister's agreement of my analysis. However, the amendment is not written on tablets of stone, and if the Minister can think of better wording, we would certainly like to debate that. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> It is interesting to hear that Government Members should think of better amendments than those tabled by Opposition Members. However, the Government--as I will demonstrate to the hon. Gentleman in due course--will dwell on the words that the Opposition have put before the Committee. 
<P>
I recognise that the amendment is designed to weed out cases in which an indication of likely objection is given, even by those who know that they are culpable. However, that would impose an unreasonable burden on the immigration officer, as he or she would have to obtain and consider the detailed reasons for objection to the civil penalty. 
<P>
The immigration officer would mostly do that by questioning the driver or operator. The case for objection would not have been considered by the owner, operator or other parties involved. However, under the amendment, the immigration officer would be required to make a snap judgment of the value of the grounds for objection. That judgment would pre-empt the considered process of submission of a notice of objection and its consideration by the Secretary of State, as provided for in clause 21. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Is it not the case that the immigration officer is being called on to make a snap judgment about whether there is a significant risk that the vehicle will not be available in due course? To do that, the immigration officer must do exactly those things that the Minister mentioned, such as asking questions and making inquiries. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The difference is that the immigration officer will make that judgment on the basis of the facts before him or her. He will make a decision in light of what has just happened, such as a clandestine emerging from the back of vehicle or being found as a result of a spot check. 
<P>

<P>
The amendment would require the immigration officer to go further and consider the objections that might arise. Conservative Members have emphasised due process. The operator of the vehicle and others who are potentially liable for the payment of the civil penalty should have the opportunity to carefully think through the grounds of their objections. Those people would not want a snap decision taken on the basis suggested by the amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Do not the circumstances in which the offence comes to light--such as people coming out on the quayside--affect the prospect of eventual success in contesting the liability? 
<P>
Are not the problems envisaged by the Minister in relation to the amendment far more likely to be problems in assessing a risk of whether a penalty will be paid? That involves making inquiries about the firm, the location of its offices, the scale of its operations and so on. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I do not accept that. We wish to ensure that other people who may be liable for the civil penalty have the opportunity to make considered objections as part of the due process of considering such cases. 
<P>
The alternative security, to which the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border referred, will relate to the amount of the civil penalty that is due, not to the value of the vehicle, although that will be relevant. What is sought for the alternative security is an amount that guarantees that the civil penalty will be paid. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> This has been another useful debate. The Minister accepted the force of my analysis. I am not persuaded by his argument as a reason for disregarding the amendment. Although I shall not press the amendment to a vote, I do not accept his analysis. 
<P>
The Minister says that too much weight is put on the immigration officer's shoulders if he has to make a decision, but he must make the same snap decision on the question of significant risk. The Minister also says that it would be unfair to ask the operator to spell out his objections there and then without giving him time to make a considered response. Someone in that position would rather have an opportunity to make a denial at that stage than suffer the disavantage of having his vehicle seized and detained for a long time, preventing him from earning a living by the use of it. In any case, an honest person with reasonable grounds for objection will want to say something there and then. The provision does not hit the person who has a long time to think up a defence, whereas it would be reasonable to expect it to do so. 
<P>
I heard what the Minister said and, as I conceded in my opening remarks, I can see an objection to the amendment myself, because in every case there is a significant risk, in the senior immigration officer's opinion, that the penalty will not be paid. We must see whether, with better wording, we can avoid the risks of injustice that were detected by Justice in its submission to us. 
<P>
I shall not take the matter further, because I want to return to some of these issues later. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's response to one part of my remarks. However, if he has a brief on the Customs and Excise point--he may not have received advice on it yet--I should be grateful if he would reply. I assume that, if the driver hands over his gold Amex card for £3,000, that would be acceptable as security for a sum up to a reasonable level above £2,000. However if a few clandestines have been detected and security of £10,000 is required, and if the company has no ready cash or cannot obtain a bond, could a Customs and Excise refund be paid to the Home Office instead, as security? The Minister's officials may not have an immediate answer, but I should be grateful for the Minister's view, if he has one. If not, perhaps he can let me know in due course. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The right hon. Gentleman has suggested some interesting ideas that will be carefully considered. However, I do not intend to go further than rely on the word "security", which is a clear and well-established word in the English language. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 201, in page 16, leave out lines 15 to 18. 
<P>
The amendment relates to subsection (4), which states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The detention of a transporter under this section is lawful even though it is subsequently established that the penalty notice on which the detention was based was ill-founded in respect of all or any of the penalties to which it related."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That creates considerable immunity for those detained. In some ways that is desirable, because it prevents immigration officers from being too intimidated by the risk of future action over measures that they must take in dealing with these issues. 
<P>
However, we should consider for a moment the evidence that was given to the Committee by the Immigration Law Practitioners Association. It said: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The mind of the Secretary of State, when imposing penalties such as this should be concentrated by making him liable for the financial consequences of all detentions which turn out to be ill-founded."
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
It describes subsection (4) as the most curious part of the procedure for the detention of transporters. It adds: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The potential loss to a carrier through the detention of a vehicle is considerable. To give the Secretary of State protection from the consequences of his arbitrary action so long as it is not unreasonable, is to give him far too much unfettered power."--[Official Report, Special Standing Committee, 17 March 1999; c. 208.]
<P>

<P>
<H5>5.30 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
A balance must be achieved between giving an immigration officer the opportunity to do his job without fear of the consequences and, in the words of ILPA, giving "too much unfettered power" to the Secretary of State. Its evidence makes a plea for the power to be used carefully and for ill-founded penalty notices to be avoided. I am sure that the Committee will share that view, but we need to examine the provision in light of ILPA's evidence. 
<P>
This is such a far-reaching clause that we cannot allow it to pass without some debate and without establishing that it gets the balance right.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I support the amendment because something needs to be done. I do not like the clause's wording because it gives full protection to the Secretary of State. That means that immigration officers will be in the comfortable position of knowing that if they have to weigh something in the balance, they can tip one way knowing that liability is not likely to occur. 
<P>
The detention of a transporter might cause not only inconvenience, but distress, loss of contracts or even bankruptcy. The clause might take away people's ability to earn their living and to conduct their business. 
<P>
The Secretary of State should have some protection, but this subsection offers all-embracing protection. The amendment is a means of drawing attention to that. ILPA said that the subsection would give the Secretary of State 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"far too much unfettered power"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
so its wording needs to be examined. I am not sure that we shall press the amendment to a Division, so it might be better for us to reconsider the issues on Report. 
<P>
The Secretary of State needs some protection. However, when immigration officers are on the dockside at 3 o'clock in the morning and have to weigh up whether to detain a vehicle, they should be aware that the person whose life they are about to affect will have some means of redress. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> This is a bad subsection. In all honesty, it is not fair. Although I accept that the amendment might not be perfect--it is reasonably simple--it draws attention to a part of the Bill that is unfair. Of course, it is not the Government's job to draft Opposition amendments, but it is not the Opposition's job to rewrite this into a perfect Bill. It is our job to table amendments dealing with problems in it, to highlight deficiencies, injustices and unfairnesses and to point out errors of principle. 
<P>
I listened ad nauseam--sometimes with the emphasis on the "nauseam"--to the now Secretary of State for Wales, the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) for five years when he was in opposition. He used to lecture me from the very chair in front of me, saying that it was not the opposition's job to draw up perfect legislation for a Tory Government and that he was in Committee merely to propose. I am happy to admit that all the amendments that I advocate might not be perfect, but they draw attention to a problem. 
<P>
There is clearly a problem in that this subsection goes too far, particularly when one reads it with subsection (5), which states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"But subsection (4) does not apply if the Secretary of State was acting unreasonably".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister will no doubt claim that that is the defence and that the Government do not need to delete subsection (4) because it does not apply if the Secretary of State was acting unreasonably. When do Secretaries of State act unreasonably? It is a preposterous defence. All Secretaries of State get pulled up on judicial review in rare circumstances. In rare circumstances, the judicial reviews succeed. The rate of judicial reviews against a Home Secretary is approximately 1,000 a year. 
<P>
<B>Ms Diane Abbott </B>(Hackney, North and Stoke Newington): The right hon. Gentleman claimed that Secretaries of State were subject to judicial review only on rare occasions. But when the right hon. Gentleman's former boss, the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard), was Home Secretary, he was pulled up a record number of times on judicial review. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> The hon. Lady misheard me. I believe that I said that it was quite rare for a Secretary of State to be found to be acting unreasonably. [Interruption.] It is quite rare for that to happen. The Minister can confirm that the current strike rate against Home Secretaries is 100 successful attempts out of 1,000. The success of judicial review against Home Secretaries is small in relation to the hundreds or thousands of times when Home Secretaries and other Ministers are pulled up on judicial review. 
<P>
If someone wishes to object to a decision under the clause, he will rightly have to sue the Home Secretary, not an immigration official. But the occasions when judicial review will be applied to the hundreds of thousands of decisions taken under the clause by the agents and staff of any Home Secretary will be few and far between. The Minister may claim that we should not worry about subsection (4) because it will not apply if the Home Secretary is acting unreasonably. But the Home Secretary, his agents and staff will rarely be seen to act unreasonably. I do not believe that they will ever be proved to have acted unreasonably because unreasonableness is a very high test. The Home Secretary, his officials and staff merely have to show that they hold an opinion, and they will probably have procedures in place to justify it. I cannot see how anyone can prove to the satisfaction of a court that the Home Secretary or his agents were acting unreasonably in legal terms. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> If I understand my right hon. Friend correctly, he claims that the Secretary of State will often be found to have acted wrongly but not unreasonably. The Government have made difficulties for themselves by rejecting amendment No. 199, which proposed that an "obvious and substantial" threshold, not simply a "significant" threshold, should be crossed before the penalty was imposed. The Government are creating a huge grey area. That is the nub of my right hon. Friend's point. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> That is exactly the point that I was about to make. Unreasonableness is almost impossible to prove. The threshold that has to be crossed to show that officials of the state acted unreasonably is very high. The behaviour of immigration staff and others would have to be pretty diabolical before unreasonableness could be proved. 
<P>
Being unreasonable is different from being wrong. If the chief officer of immigration or his colleagues made a mistake or got everything wrong about a decision, the Home Secretary would not be liable and the vehicle  977 978 could still be detained. They could get everything wrong but still be deemed to be acting reasonably. They could have reasonable grounds that were utterly wrong. Reasonableness means testing the opinion of the immigration officer and asking, "Why did you come to those conclusions?" He could then produce a reasonable defence and state why he thought x was y, black was white and one and two made five. If he could show reasonable grounds but nevertheless came to a wrong conclusion on the facts, he would not have acted unreasonably. 
<P>
We need an assurance from the Minister--I do not expect him to delete the appropriate lines--that he will go away and think about the possibility of having some restitution where the Home Secretary and his staff acted reasonably but nevertheless got it wrong. The subsection says: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The detention of a transporter ... is lawful even though it is subsequently established that the penalty price on which the detention was based was ill-founded".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not particularly want to declare it unlawful. I am happy to say, "Yes, it can still remain lawful" because it could open up an awful hornet's nest to claim that it was unlawful. However, the provision should go on to say that notwithstanding the fact that the detention is lawful, the fact that it was totally wrong should allow some restitution. There should be a right to compensation for the person who has had his vehicle detained by mistake. 
<P>
The Government have it all ways. They propose a power for which they will never have to pay compensation. It would be almost impossible to show that the staff were acting unreasonably. I would be appalled if many cases showed that they were acting unreasonably. I do not expect immigration officers to act unreasonably. I expect them--and in the vast majority of cases I am sure that they do--to act reasonably. 
<P>
However, I also expect that on occasions they will get it wrong. My years of experience as a Home Office Minister suggested that the police always acted reasonably, but sometimes they could be wrong. When the police act reasonably but get things wrong, penalties have to be paid and there is the matter of compensation. Should that not also apply to the immigration service and to the Secretary of State, who is the ultimate chief officer of the immigration service? 
<P>
If someone is acting unreasonably and it is unlawful, they should suffer the penalties; but if someone is acting reasonably but gets it wrong, please permit some form of compensation or restitution. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Subsections (4) and (5) of clause 22, between them, seek to strike a balance in the provisions for detention of vehicles, ships and aircraft. Subsection (4) provides that detention of a transporter is lawful even if it is subsequently established that the penalty notice was ill-founded. However, subsection 5 qualifies that subsection (4) does not apply if the Secretary of State acted unreasonably in issuing the penalty notice. Amendment No. 201 seeks to delete all of subsection (4). If subsection (4) were deleted, it would also be logical to delete subsection (5). 
<P>
We recognise the significance of the power to detain transporters. We understand that it may have very grave consequences for the owner or operator or for those whose goods are being carried in. We have therefore sought to include in the Bill a number of safeguards of which subsections (4) and (5) are part. We are seeking, in subsections (4) and (5), to strike a balance. On one hand, if all detention of transporters were to be unlawful even if the judgement later turned out to have been ill-founded, it would have an adverse effect on the operation of the civil penalty. Immigration officers would feel greatly inhibited in seeking to exercise their judgment. The temptation would be to err on the side of caution, not to detain a vehicle and run the risk that the impact of the civil penalty is undermined when operators can evade its consequences. Equally, we wish to provide a safeguard for the owners and operators of transports against arbitrary and unreasonable behaviour. Subsection (5) provides that. 
<P>
We therefore tried to obtain, in the two balancing provisions in subsections (4) and (5), a reasonable degree, of protection both for the effectiveness of the civil penalty and for those to whom it might apply. Removing subsection (4) would destroy it and I invite the Committee to reject the amendment. 
<P>
The right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border, as a former Minister with responsibility for the police, will be familiar with the context of police powers in which these sorts of issues are common in the sense that powers have to be exercised on reasonable grounds. The context and wording here differ, but the effect is similar. An immigration officer must act reasonably. If he does not, the Secretary of State is liable; if he does, the Secretary of State is not liable. 
<P>
However, the right hon. Gentleman will wish to bear in mind that the immigration officer will also be aware that the Secretary of State may become liable for paying the costs of detention. So there is a deterrent against arbitrary use of the power in that the detention of a vehicle is expensive--no one has gainsaid that during the debate--especially if it is detained for a long time. Therefore the Secretary of State will be very careful to ensure that the power is not used unnecessarily or arbitrarily, or that immigration officers do not go about detaining vehicles if they do not need to. 
<H4>5.45 pm</H4>
<P>
It is hoped that, in due course, if agreement is reached with the carriers' associations and transport associations, a means will be devised whereby their members, at least, would not be in a position where their vehicles would have to be detained. There might be some form of guarantee if an allegation were proved, and because of the guarantee, the Secretary of State might be in a position--I am still using the word "might"--not to have to detain certain vehicles. 
<P>
We intend to strike a clear balance so that the Secretary of State will not put in the position of incurring considerable cost to the taxpayer, assuming that immigration officers act reasonably and properly. We must balance the interests of the operators, the immigration service and the Secretary of State with the cost to the taxpayer. We must all have that in mind when considering how the provision will operate.

<P>

<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I have listened carefully to the Minister. I think that he would agree--I use the analogy with the police service--that there is a concept of wrongful arrest and that for police officers, it is not unreasonable arrest. By analogy, therefore, the defences built into to this part of the Bill for the agents of the Home Secretary and the immigration service are much tougher defences than for bobbies on the beat, who can be done for wrongful arrest, and do not have to act unreasonably before they are in trouble for getting it wrong. I merely suggest that the Minister's test of acting unreasonably will hardly ever be satisfied. I cannot imagine--perhaps the Minister could give me examples--what sort of behaviour would be necessary on the part of a chief officer of immigration before it could be shown to be unreasonable. He would need to behave in a highly arbitrary or bigoted manner, or just run a lottery board and pick one lorry in 20 to impound. It would need to be something pretty stupid, diabolical or extreme to be shown to be unreasonable. I cannot imagine any officer behaving in such a way as to cause someone to say, "That was totally unreasonable, therefore the defence, and subsection (5), will apply." There is a qualitative difference between acting unreasonably and getting it wrong--and I bet that if the Minister were to read the part of his brief which says "if pressed" it will say the same. I do not want immigration officers to be scared that if they get things wrong they will have to bear a huge penalty, but there has to be a possible sanction to prevent getting it wrong in some cases. 
<P>
As the Bill is drafted, if the immigration service gets it wrong, the innocent victim who is detained suffers a bigger penalty. I am working on the assumption that he was detained, that the immigration service got it wrong and that there was no penalty to pay. We must conclude that the person is innocent--not that the service could not get enough evidence and that he got away with it. That person has suffered his vehicle being detained, loss of business and possibly--we shall come on to this--the loss of freight, if it has been refrigerated. He then wins his case, the penalty is struck out and he asks, "What compensation do I get for my load of ice cream that melted at the docks and the loss of my lorry for three weeks?" The reply is "Ah, none, because, I'm sorry, sir, although we got it totally wrong, we weren't acting unreasonably. We didn't pick on you because we didn't like your colour, your nationality, the colour of your lorry or your dirty number plates or because it was just your turn. We did not act unreasonably, so there is no compensation." 
<P>
Between the extremes of having so much compensation for victims and so many swords of Damocles hanging over immigration officers' heads that they are scared to do anything, both of which are unacceptable, and the Minister's position, which is also unacceptable, there might be a halfway house: if immigration officers behave unreasonably, it is struck out, it is unlawful and other damages are paid, but if they behave reasonably and get it wrong, the innocent victim who has lost his lorry should have some redress. That is all that we are seeking, not that guilty people or racketeers get redress, but that the innocent victim who was not up to anything and who has had the case against him or her cleared is entitled to redress because the immigration service, with the best will in the world, got it wrong. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> Does my right hon. Friend agree that the innocent victim faces further jeopardy? If it was found that the Secretary of State got it wrong but argued, as he almost certainly would in every case, that what was done was not unreasonable, the only way in which an innocent victim could prove that the Secretary of State was further getting it wrong by claiming not to have been unreasonable would be to initiate risky and costly civil proceedings, which he might then lose and thus be penalised all the more. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend. The only hope would be judicial review proceedings. All members of the Committee will have had someone coming into their surgery once a week or almost once a fortnight with the complaint, "I have been to the ombudsman and done this, that and the other and I want to seek judicial review. What do you advise?" My first advice is, "Have you got £10,000 that you can afford to lose?" If they have, I say "In that case, get another £10,000, go and see some lawyers and take a chance on it." 
<P>
It is highly unlikely that people will seek judicial review against the Secretary of State on the ground that the officers acted unreasonably. I should like the Minister to give me some possible examples of unreasonable behaviour. Will he confirm that getting it wrong because someone reached a wrong conclusion on the facts or got the wrong vehicle is not unreasonable? The immigration officer thought that the guy was hiding in a vehicle of the same make, the same colour or roughly the same firm, but he made a genuine mistake: he got it wrong. That is not unreasonable either. I was trying to suggest to the Minister earlier that it would have to be extreme and outrageous behaviour for immigration staff, which I do not think occurs at present and would not in the future, certainly not by a chief officer of immigration, before he could be found guilty, so to speak, of unreasonable behaviour. 
<P>
I conclude my plea to the Minister by saying that I understand that he cannot accept the amendment, but will he at least admit that we have a point? There is a point. If he says, "There's no point. You have got it wrong in principle. There is no justice in the argument", I shall have to disagree with him, but I hope that he will say that, in the case of the innocent victim there is a point and that there should be some form of redress, without it costing the taxpayer a fortune and without racketeers getting in on the act. I am advocating only the case of the person who happens to be innocent: it is as simple as that. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> That is half a point, but not enough to undermine the reasonable balance within the clause, which provides adequate protection for people who are subject to penalties. The term "unreasonably" is adequate and it allows the the Secretary of State to make a decision that subsequently transpires, for honest, decent and straightforward reasons, to have been ill-founded. Let us consider a possible example. A lorry arrives at immigration control and immigration officers find two clandestines in the back. Questioning the driver results in little further information coming to light. A penalty notice is issued, but it later turns out that the driver and other responsible persons can make out a defence. In such a case, detention would be lawful. The officer acted reasonably. The fact that it later transpired that a penalty was not payable and that the vehicle was detained should not of itself mean that the detention was unlawful from the start and that damages were payable. 
<P>
However, an immigration officer could act unreasonably, so let me provide another example. An allegation could be made that some clandestines got off the back of a lorry, but it is not properly investigated. The evidence amounts to a fairy tale but the immigration officer decides to detain the vehicle. That would clearly be unreasonable. The officer had no justification for doing so and in those circumstances no one would believe that the Secretary of State had acted perfectly reasonably. An officer must act on some reasonable suspicion. 
<P>
Another example is where a driver can show, when questioned, compelling evidence to the immigration officer that he has an appropriate defence--perhaps a certificate that showed conclusively that he had been through a proper system. It would be unreasonable to press for a penalty if it were clear that a defence could properly be made. It would then be unreasonable to detain the vehicle. 
<P>
The right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border keeps referring to judicial review, but that is not the only way in which a person can take the Secretary of State to task for making an unreasonable decision. Other civil courts are available. Proceedings for damages could be taken against the Secretary of State who, if he had acted unreasonably, could not rely on subsection (4). A case for damages could then be mounted in the county or High court in the normal way and if the Secretary of State or his officials were shown to have acted unreasonably, all the costs and tribulations associated with judicial review would not come to pass. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> Is not the Minister being disingenuous? If the penalty was around £2,000, a small operator could not risk going to the civil courts and having to pay the costs of the Government side if the case were lost. The remedy of trying to establish the difference between what is wrong but reasonable and what is wrong but unreasonable is unlikely to be available to a small operator. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman is worrying unduly about the costs of litigation, much as lawyers charge enormously high fees in certain cases. Perhaps the hon. Member for Hertsmere could tell him about the fees that he charged for so ably representing people in court. It is not onerous to take a case to the small claims court, which deals with claims of a limited value. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> Up to what amount? 
<P>
<H5>6 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> About £5,000, I think. I have never taken a case to the small claims court myself or been employed as a lawyer to do so, given the small amounts involved and the fees that lawyers charge. If trade was damaged because a vehicle was detained for a short period, no doubt the haulier could decide that the small claims court was the proper venue to pursue a claim against the Secretary of State. At that point, if the Secretary of State had acted unreasonably, and it could be shown that he had done so, he would have to consider whether to settle the case before it came to court. The evidence would be considered in the proper way by his lawyers and if it was obvious that the Secretary of State would lose the case the matter could be settled quickly and amicably. The fears about cost may not be realised. However, if a lot of clandestines were in the back of a vehicle that was detained for a long time, other cases may arise and the small claims court may not be appropriate place to pursue them. My point to the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border is that judicial review is not the only remedy.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> When I intervened, I had in mind not judicial review but the double or quits--perhaps even treble or quits--nature of taking civil court action. Unlike the Minister, I have been involved in litigation, in which one is far more concerned about the costs, whether one wins or loses, than about the sum at stake in court. As the Minister was starting to recognise towards the end of his response to my intervention, he cannot rely on the small claims court because it is easy to imagine a small operator being hit to a far higher level than could be dealt with in a small claims court. He has to decide whether to risk tens of thousands of pounds more in contesting an action against the Government, when the Government have admitted to being wrong. The question at issue is whether they were unreasonable. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I thank the Minister for conceding half a point. He is becoming infinitely more generous as the days and nights wear on. Clearly, we will need to return to the matter on Report and I would like the Minister to reflect on it. I take his point; I talked about judicial review but he is right that these matters can be pursued in other courts. I do not criticise him if the £5,000 figure is wrong--I have not a clue what it is myself. I believe that it went up to £5,000 under the previous Government, but two or three clandestines would push the amount way above that limit, certainly in England. If we had the benefit of the sheriff court system the problem would be diminished. It is not so much the cost of the court that worries me as fighting the costs of the lawyers whom the Government would employ, on the assumption that they would employ the best, and if not the best, the more expensive, legal services. 
<P>
I shall not bore the Committee by quoting further examples. The Minister gave me three examples-- 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Although there are exceptions, normally there is no award of costs in the small claims court. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> Let us assume that in the small claims court, whatever the ceiling, the costs should be negligible. I merely suspect that in cases where more 983 984 than £5,000 is involved the costs can be horrendous. Governments rightly do not like losing legal cases. They will employ lawyers to try to make sure that they win, and rightly so as that is the name of the game. 
<P>
The Minister gave me some examples of when it could be reasonable to get it wrong, which I accept. I agree entirely that if a driver refused to co-operate and it then turned out that the immigration service had got it wrong, the driver should not be compensated. That is an example that I give against my own side. I do not suggest that, if the immigration service gets it wrong, there has to be compensation in every case. If the immigration service gets it wrong but the driver or operator was bloody minded and did nothing to assist the case, which might have led the immigration service to get it wrong, it serves him right and no compensation should be payable. 
<P>
I do not accept the Minister's point. There is half a case here. Will he go away to think about it and see whether, in the case of the genuine innocent victim who helps the immigration service and does his best, there is a possibility of redress? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> This has been a useful debate. I had anticipated the point that the Minister made about not wanting to inhibit the immigration officer in the exercise of his powers. I made that point in my opening remarks, but in the light of the expert evidence that we received from ILPA I thought it right to explore the power, given that it is such a substantial one. ILPA calls it a curious power. 
<P>
The Minister has fairly accepted the need for balance. We have established that there will be cases, which are not covered by subsection (5) because the Secretary of State was acting reasonably, where something has gone wrong and some compensation should be available as a result. In such cases, there would be no legal remedy because the detention would be lawful. As long as the Secretary of State was acting reasonably, detention would be lawful. I think that the Minister is with me so far on that. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien indicated assent. </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mt. Clappison:</B> I do not want to labour the point but without admitting liability or setting any precedents, could some compensation be paid by the Home Office? I am thinking particularly of the small operators as this will mean the most to them. It would be entirely at the discretion of the Secretary of State, but are there any such arrangements that would give some comfort to small lorry firms? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am not aware that such a power exists, but presumably where the Secretary of state takes a view of the circumstances presented to him--and given all the requirements to ensure that public money was properly spent and all the rules that surround the application of public money and the fact that the Permanent Secretary might have to adjudicate on it--there are some arrangements for gratis payments. I give no commitments on cases that might come under these penalty clauses, but the Secretary of State could take a view--it would be a matter entirely for him. I would not want any lorry firm to rely on the Secretary of State taking a view that he might decide not to take. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I understand the Minister's caution, but it was a worthwhile point to explore. 
<P>
I said at the outset that this was an exploratory amendment. In order to make progress, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
The Chairman, being of the opinion that the principle of the clause and any matters arising thereon had been adequately discussed in the course of debate on the amendments proposed thereto, forthwith put the Question, pursuant to Standing Order No. 68, and Standing Order No. 89, That the clause stand part of the Bill:-- 
<P>
Question accordingly agreed to. 
<P>
Clause 22 ordered to stand part of the Bill. 
<H4><center>Clause 23 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Effect of detention </center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 203, in page 16, line 28, leave out "or".
<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 204, in page 16, line 31, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "or-- 
<P>
(c) the applicant would suffer serious hardship if the transporter was not released".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We move from an immigration officer's exercise of power to what a person whose transporter has been seized can subsequently do. 
<P>
The clause allows a person whose transporter has been detained to apply to a court. Subsection (3) states 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The court may release the transporter if it considers that-- 
<P>
(a) satisfactory security has been tendered ... or 
<P>
(b) there is significant doubt as to whether the penalty is payable and the applicant has a compelling need to have the transporter released." <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 204 would add an additional condition to the grounds on which a court could release a transporter when an 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"applicant would suffer serious hardship if the transporter was not released." <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Some smaller lorry operators might be covered by such a provision, and they deserve our consideration. 
<P>
For example, a small lorry firm might be unable to raise the security required and there may be some, if not significant, doubt about that firm's liability. A firm in that position would be unable to avail itself of the provisions in subsection (3). It would be in something of a pickle and would have no redress in court. 
<P>
Will the Minister think about including the additional condition in the Bill to act as a get-out? The degree of hardship caused by the penalty will vary according to the size of the firm. There is no way in which a large firm could succeed in establishing that it had suffered serious hardship because one of its transporters had been 985 986 detained, but a smaller firm might suffer considerably. For example, the following day, it might have to deliver an important cargo to which a substantial penalty clause for non-delivery was attached. It might find it difficult to raise the security required by the court. 
<P>
I was going to raise another issue--overseas lorry firms--on the previous clause, but I accept that it was fully and properly debated. The problem relates as much to applications to courts as it does to immigration officers, because courts, as well as immigration officers, must exercise discretion. We have not debated the position of overseas lorry firms so far, because there has been an underlying and implicit assumption that we are debating the measures from the point of view of the British lorry driver. That is in our interests. We all have constituents who are employed in the road haulage industry. 
<P>
We should, however, think about how the proposals will appear to people from overseas and about how they will be affected. What is the Department's estimate of the number of overseas firms that have been involved in incidents in which clandestine entrants have come into the country? How will immigration officials and courts deal with overseas lorry firms? Security is an issue and courts and officials will have to form an opinion about whether there is a significant risk that a penalty will not be paid. 
<P>
We cannot assume that individual immigration officers and the courts will have too much knowledge of the continental lorry industry. Some firms do not often make deliveries to this country, and we cannot expect an immigration officer to know much about them. Such firms might feel that they will be disadvantaged by the measure. Will the Minister, therefore, say a little about that from the point of view of the overseas lorry driver? Will he say something about that in relation to the original penalty and the application to the court referred to in the amendment? 
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I support the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend, as serious damage could be done to some businesses unless it is accepted. 
<P>
We have spent so long talking about lorries that it is difficult to remember that we are now discussing a clause that deals with all vehicles, small ships up to 500 tonnes and aircraft up to 5,700 kg. In real weight, such a plane would weigh about 5 tonnes. I do not know how many passengers a 5-tonne plane would carry, although I know what a 5-tonne combine harvester looks like. 
<P>
There is a potential scenario of some of those transporters carrying valuable cargoes. In some ways, it is easier to relate to lorries. A large part of cross-channel traffic is refrigerated lorries carrying perishable goods. Clandestines stow away in refrigerated lorries, however uncomfortable that is. It may be said that immigration officers are less willing to check such lorries, as no one in his right mind would stow away in a refrigerated lorry. I am not talking about deep-freeze lorries, or containers carrying goods at minus 17 deg, but those carrying goods that are kept at 5, 10 or 15 deg centigrade. 
<P>
Nevertheless, a lot of lorries carrying perishable goods cross the channel. The Minister may say that if one such lorry is detained, even for a few hours, someone can be sent to pick up the freight. He may also say that that matter is connected with clause 22, but I wish to deal with this point now, as we did not touch on it in the stand part debate. 
<P>
Some goods may be transferred quite easily with no harm whatever. However, unless refrigerated lorries are opened in a secure, hygienic, refrigerated environment, the goods will be worthless and will be written off. Committee members may find those goods quite appetising, but such goods would be written off under food safety regulations. 
<P>
I do not want irate managers from Marks and Spencer, Tesco, Safeway or other food retailers to attack me for getting that wrong. Certainly, all of the big five supermarkets give a time slot in which goods are to be delivered. Should a vehicle leave the central distribution depot and fail to deliver its load within 15 minutes of a time slot given to its stores--the same is true of vehicles going to the supermarket's shops and plants across the channel--the supermarket is not interested in those goods, and a huge penalty is paid. If the vehicle is a couple of hours outside the deadline, the supermarket refuses to accept the cargo. The load is written off if the doors are opened by anyone other than, say, a Marks and Spencer refrigeration manager who has his own electronic monitor to check temperature and who also checks that the seals match those e-mailed before the lorry left. 
<P>
Some of that is over the top. Nevertheless, that is how food safety operations are conducted these days. People are not willing to risk the slightest interference with goods, especially cook-chill and perishable goods. In such circumstances, it is impossible for someone to say: "Let's get another lorry down to Dover, back it up to the back door and transfer the refrigerated cages". On the contrary, goods are written off and people do not want to know about them. 
<P>
I do not think that that is particularly sensible. However, I understand why it happens given the legal constraints under which the supermarkets operate. Environmental health officers impose draconian penalties if supermarkets get anything wrong on food safety, and bad publicity ensues if goods are not at the right temperature. 
<P>
Such procedures are followed not only by the big boys. Marks and Spencer would not suffer severe hardship if it lost the value of goods in a lorry crossing the channel. It would get pretty stroppy, but it could not claim that it had suffered severe financial hardship. 
<P>
Hundreds, if not thousands, of refrigerated vehicles are on hire to those organisations. If the Minister asks the Road Haulage Association or the Freight Transport Association, he will find that more and more companies that are involved in food have decided that, if they are experts in food, they are not interested in lorries, so it is all contracted out to others to deal with. In some cases there will be smaller operators with speciality goods. 
<P>
In my own county some of the local food fare people set up an organisation called Food from Cumbria to bring together all the smaller, individual producers--gateaux here, a leg of lamb there--in a little marketing co-operative to get goods down to Harrods and other shops and across the channel. They can only afford a 30-cwt transit van with all the refrigerating kit in the back. If they lose a valuable load, they are wiped out; if they have problems on the motorway, they can be wiped out. There are numerous problems. 
<P>
One of the fascinating things about the road transport industry is that, just when one thinks one has mastered one bit of it, 200 different aspects emerge. It is such a diverse industry and it is part of the driving force that is Britain. We all complain about pollution on the roads, but, as the Government are discovering, if they clobber the road transport industry, they clobber the British economy. The Minister will say that he does not intend to clobber the whole road transport industry, and I understand that. Our amendment simply says that if an operator will suffer serious hardship, the court should release him under the clause. 
<P>
If the Minister believes in joined-up government, he should take a holistic view. A Minister who is working with his officials on a Bill and pushing a line sees the one problem that he has to deal with. This Minister sees the problem of clandestines and, rightly, wants to do something about it. I support him in that. To tackle a mischief, he must introduce penalty clauses and penalise those who may be involved. I have suggested to him that he can sometimes catch the innocent in such clauses and that there should be some redress. 
<P>
If in dealing with the wrong or mischief--I do not use the word "mischief" in any slight, derogatory sense but in a technical, more legal sense--of people bringing in clandestines, the Minister imposes conditions that destroy jobs, that is not good Government policy. I do not want him to jump up and say that the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border is saying, "Drive a coach and horses through the Bill. Let in clandestines. Let's not clobber vehicles, because we want exemptions." I am merely suggesting to him that, in a Bill that deals with clandestines, there is no point in having a provision that puts legitimate companies out of business and destroys jobs. In the overall balance of things, that is not worth while. 
<P>
It does not have to be one or the other--the jobs and the business or dealing with clandestines: the Minister can do both in the Bill. He can deal with the problems of illegal immigration, clandestines and racketeers and those who deliberately bring in people in lorries, small ships and small planes, but he should have a mechanism to ensure that, by focusing on this awful Home Office problem, he does not accidentally--I am not accusing him of deliberately destroying jobs--fail to pay enough attention to the effects that it can have on other aspects of the economy. 
<P>
Finally, I seek advice from the Minister on the question of ships and planes. I know that this applies to small aircraft. I used to complain when small aircraft landed at Heathrow, clogging up other flights. Small aircraft should not land at Heathrow or other major  airports, for various reasons: they may not be part of operators' agreements. The problem is landing charges. The Bill gives the Minister power to detain a vehicle, small ship or aircraft of up to 5 tonnes. If a plane is detained at Heathrow or other airports, there are overnight parking charges. I do not know what they are, but I used to wonder why empty jumbos rapidly took off from Heathrow. They wanted to land in an airport where it was cheaper to park overnight. Airports around the country have horrendous landing charges. 
<P>
Perhaps the Minister will inform us later whether small aircraft are allowed into Gatwick and smaller airports. If a five-and-a-half tonne aircraft that was carrying clandestines was detained for a few weeks at Gatwick--or an airport with lighter traffic such as Stansted or City airport--what would the overnight parking charges total? The amount would be fairly horrendous. That may be another example of undue hardship. If the Minister wants to detain an aircraft, he should have powers to move it to a destination that is cheaper than City airport. A similar argument could apply to ships. 
<P>
I shall not consider cargo in detail. The points are the same as those that we made about lorries. I shall simply give a good example of a valuable cargo. There used to be a flight from Carlisle airport to Heathrow in the flying Belfast shoebox--I cannot remember its technical name, but it is the square plane made by Shorts. It used to fly from Dundee to Carlisle to London. It flew at 10,000 ft and bounced over every cloud. When it stopped at Carlisle, members of the public were allowed to board it, provided that there was room after the smoked salmon from Pinney's had been loaded onto the plane. We sat in the little passenger plane with a valuable cargo of smoked salmon. If that plane was impounded--

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The example is not relevant because the plane did not come from overseas. That will remain the case until Scotland is independent. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I understand that you will be independent very shortly, Mr. Maxton. The interesting question is, who will govern Scotland? 
<P>
The flight that I mentioned went on to Holland and brought back goods from there. It went on to Schipol or another airport overseas. That small plane carried a valuable cargo. Many flowers that are brought into the country are flown in on little planes. If those planes are delayed for a few hours, the cargo is valueless. In some circumstances, the big boys of Gatwick and the larger airports can bring in other planes, or lorries to transport the cargo by road. Smaller planes and ships may be unable to organise alternative transport to move a cargo. In those circumstances, the cargo can be lost. The provision should cover that. There should be a discretion that would be used not at the whim of the individual, but by the courts to determine whether the applicant would suffer serious hardship if the transporter was not released. Surely the Minister can trust the courts to use that additional power in those rare circumstances when the applicant produces sufficient evidence? 
<P>

<P>
The Minister is a reasonable man. I do not expect him to accept the whole proposal. Accepting half of it would be progress. Thus, between the other half that the Minister accepted and the half that we now request, we would have a whole loaf. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I support the amendment. It gives the courts more flexibility to deal with difficult circumstances. Under the Bill, there is no time limit between serving the penalty notice and detaining the vehicle. The assumption in the Bill is that they will be done at the same time. Immigration officials could detain the vehicle later if they became concerned about whether the penalty would be paid. Giving more latitude to the courts would he advantageous. Knocking out "or" would achieve that and provide a broader perspective on the courts. 
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Several points have been made and I shall deal with them in order, beginning with those raised by the hon. Member for Hertsmere. I understand why he proposed the amendment but my concern is that in practice every driver would put some sort of case for serious hardship--for his company as signee of the goods, or for himself in terms of his job. It could be alleged that he had not taken sufficient precautions. All sorts of serious hardships exist, but we also have to bear in mind the serious hardships to the taxpayer caused by the failure of our hauliers properly to check their cargoes. We want to create a deterrent to encourage drivers to check their loads and not carry clandestines. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere asked about overseas hauliers. Detailed information on the number of foreign-owned vehicles that have carried clandestines is unavailable. However, we know from anecdotal evidence that a significant proportion of clandestines enter the country in the back of foreign-owned vehicles, so it is important to have a method for dealing with that problem. 
<P>
I shall explain my worry about the amendment. A foreign haulier found to have clandestines in the back of the lorry whose claims for serious hardship prevent the vehicle from being detained, could get back in the vehicle and take it back home. In those circumstances, there is no way for the British taxpayer to recoup the penalty. As a result of the amendment, the foreign haulier could flout the law, of which I am sure that the hon. Gentleman--and certainly I--would not approve. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> I hope that the Minister will forgive me if I have misunderstood him, but I believe that he said that there was no way in which the British Government could recover the penalty from a foreign operator who had returned to his own country. The Minister is shaking his head. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I did not say that there was no way, only that it might be difficult if someone had returned to a far-off country. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> I thank the Minister for that clarification. However, that point was urged on the Minister earlier when we said that it was unfair for owners to have to face that same difficulty. They may have hired their vehicles from people who have returned to their own countries and hence face having to recover penalties from them. The Minister seemed earlier to regard that as acceptable. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We were talking earlier about people entering into a foreign business. They should enter into it only if they are able to sue upon the contract--otherwise they are knowingly taking a risk. That is different from when an overseas vehicle visits our country and access proves difficult for the legal system, perhaps in terms of the provisions that could apply in other countries. I presume that reciprocal arrangements would be necessary. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I want to stay on the point of how the amendment relates to overseas lorry drivers. The Minister has made an ingenious interpretation of the amendment. My point about lorry drivers was inspired by a previous point about putting too much on immigration officers. How will immigration officers assess whether there is a significant risk that the penalty will be paid in the case of overseas lorry drivers? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We will build up a database on foreign firms to help immigration officers assess the likelihood of payment where a civil penalty is imposed and detention is a possibility. That will obviously be done in accordance with data protection law, But overseas lorries are subject to the provisions of the Bill in the same way as UK firms are. An overseas lorry might, if detained, be driven out of the jurisdiction, but those engaged in the cross-channel trade are often large and reputable firms or, indeed, small reputable firms. 
<P>
In such cases the immigration officer will no doubt be easily satisfied that a payment will be made if he knows that the whole business is reliant on the cross-channel trade and he regularly deals with the company or one-man operation. In other cases, it is open to those concerned to provide a security of some sort. It will be possible for the companies concerned to arrange schemes to make security available to those who need to provide it. There are different ways in which this can be dealt with. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I raised a point that the Minister has not had an opportunity to deal with but it is germane to what he is saying. There is not a time scale between the penalty and the detention of the vehicle. The assumption is that a decision would be made on the dockside. Let us assume that the immigration official allowed the vehicle to go and the vehicle went out of British jurisdiction but came back after the prescribed period. There would be nothing to stop immigration officials impounding it if a fine of £6,000 was owed to the British taxpayer. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> That is indeed the case. If someone uses a route regularly, immigration might warn him that if he has not paid the penalty by his next visit his vehicle might have to be detained. 
<P>
The right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border raised a number of issues. He talked about perishable goods. He referred to the arrangements that we are putting in place whereby the consignee can recover perishable goods. No doubt people who receive 991 992 perishable goods would want the drivers to ensure that extra checks were taken. That is all part of the process of creating a culture of checking vehicles and making sure that clandestines are not in them. 
<P>
If there is a just-in-time delivery of perishable goods the consignee will no doubt want some reassurance from the haulier that the driver will make checks, will go through the proper procedures and there will be no delay. If all the checks are not carried out he will want to know that a system is in place requiring a security or guarantee to the immigration service that any fine will be met. 
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman talked in broad terms about joined-up government. Other Departments have been involved in discussions on these clauses. I am not focused only on clandestines: TNT and other operators are based in my constituency. They are part of our important road haulage industry, which I want to succeed. We therefore make every effort as a Government to ensure that overall costs are lower and that we make it easier to operate here by having less red tape. We have cut the red tape on switching rates, just as the industry asked. 
<P>
I do not want to rehearse familiar arguments that we heard in the Chamber yesterday. We have a common interest in ensuring that the road haulage industry succeeds, but I think that the road haulage industry and those who might be thinking of having perishable cargoes in the back of lorries have a vested interest in making sure that checks are carried out, that there are no clandestines in the back of the lorry who might destroy perishable goods or make them uneatable. 
<P>
The checks benefit the industry and make it more secure. They ensure that lorries will be secure and less accessible to clandestines, that flaps are soundly tamped down and that there are proper checks and oversight of the cargo. In the long run, that will work to the benefit of the British haulage industry and will give it a better reputation for being secure and security conscious. 
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman raised the cost of detaining planes overnight. I cannot tell him what the costs are, but the issue is covered by clause 22(1), under which expenses that have been reasonably incurred could be the subject of a claim. 
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman also wants me to consider the prospect of the Secretary of State detaining a plane, because the claim might be unfounded because a defence is established. The immigration officer would be aware of that and would have to be aware of the potential costs to the Secretary of State. 
<P>
I think that we have got the balance right and that the amendment will not add anything to the clause. It could, as I have said in terms of overseas operators, have adverse implications for the operation of a penalty regime, and I ask the hon. Gentleman to seek to withdraw it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his considered response. It has been a useful debate that has elicited additional information that we did not already know. I think that the Minister has taken the point that we shall need to know something about overseas lorry drivers. He told me about the possibility of building up a data protection bank because we do not want to give our immigration officers an impossible task or put them in a position where they may be accused of acting in an arbitrary or discriminatory way. 
<P>
As regards hardship, we are debating what happens after a penalty notice has been served and an immigration officer has decided to detain a vehicle. If that decision has been made. What can the haulier do about it? He can go to a court and apply for the release of the vehicle, but he must bring himself within the grounds in subsection (3). I shall not go over those grounds, but let us suppose that he cannot do that. 
<P>
I put the points about hardship to the Minister, who said, "We can't allow a get-out on the ground of serious hardship, because everybody would use it and it would undermine the clause." I can understand his point of view, but I do not think that he has focused sufficiently on the words in the amendment, "serious hardship", which were chosen with care. The amendment does not refer to hardship on its own. "Serious" imports something more than mere hardship, something out of the ordinary that will have a serious effect on the person and his business. 
<P>
The Minister will know that in other branches of the law somebody can be let out of a situation if they can establish that they would suffer out-of-the-ordinary hardship and hardship that is out of proportion to the liability that they face. I shall give the Minister a brief example so that he gets a flavour of what I mean. 
<P>
The Minister will be aware of the totting-up provisions. People who accumulate a certain number of penalty points on their driving licence become liable to disqualification. Somebody who is liable to disqualification can get out of it if they can establish to the court that they would suffer exceptional hardship. It has long been established in the courts that exceptional hardship means more than mere hardship or something approaching it. We would all suffer hardship and inconvenience as a result of losing our driving licence. However, for some people the loss of a driving licence might mean the difference between having a job and not having a job or having a business and not having a business. Parliament and the courts have taken the view that the provisions should not impose disproportionate hardship on people and that they could be tempered to that extent. That is the thinking behind the amendment. 
<H4>6.45 pm </H4>
<P>
We have established that a £2,000 fine will not be much of a liability to big or medium operators. However, a fine of that size could have a significant effect on a small firm that is on the edge or that needs to deliver a particularly valuable cargo. The fine might mean the difference between the business managing to stay afloat and it going under. 
<P>
If the amendment were accepted, a person would have to convince a court that he was suffering exceptional or serious hardship. I am not fixed on the words in the amendment, but I hope that the Minister will accept the concept behind it. Perhaps, he will consider the matter and decide to substitute the word "exceptional" for "serious" if he thinks that "serious" does not go far enough. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I can see the hon. Gentleman's point. However, subsection (3)(b) contains the phrase, 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"there is significant doubt as to whether the penalty is payable and the applicant has a compelling need to have the transporter released."
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
That might deal with some circumstances of exceptional or serious hardship. 
<P>
The difficulty with the hon. Gentleman's phrase is that it would enable a driver to argue that he would lose his job or be threatened with the loss of his job of he were fined. The loss of a job always constitutes serious hardship. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister is moving in my direction, but he needs to reconsider the wording of subsection (3) (b), to which I referred in my opening remarks. The paragraph puts two completely different things together and requires both to apply. 
<P>
There is a difference between having 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "a significant doubt as to whether the penalty is payable"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and the applicant having 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a compelling need to have the transporter released".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
They are completely different tests, but the person seeking to get his lorry back will have to satisfy both. 
<P>
We could face the situation that I outlined in my opening remarks. Someone could show that there is some, but not a significant, doubt as to whether the penalty is payable and that he has a compelling need to have his transporter released. That person cannot avail himself of paragraph (b), even though there may be some doubt. 
<P>
We have already debated the word "significant" and I do not want to go over that again. Clearly, on some occasions, there will be doubt that falls short of being significant. On the burden of proof that has been adopted, a person might be able to establish in the long run to the Secretary of State that he is not liable for the penalty by showing that there was some doubt. He would not have to go as far as showing that there was significant doubt. Some people will ultimately succeed in absolving themselves of liability by convincing the Secretary of State. However, they will not be able to convince a court that there was enough doubt to say that there was significant doubt. Some people might find themselves caught by that. 
<P>
The Minister is moving towards my view, so, I shall ask him to reconsider. His response suggests that a sufficiently well-crafted amendment could take on board my points and help someone facing exceptional hardship. I am not stuck on the word "serious". I want to prevent someone from being put in a dreadful position and suffering a penalty that is out of the ordinary in his circumstances when compared with the effect that it would have on other people. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The clause provides an adequate and reasonable safeguard. It is balanced and we do not need to import the amendment into it. Although I hear the hon. Gentleman's argument, he does not convince me that we need to take the steps that he has suggested. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am glad that the Minister has accepted that there is an argument. May I take him a little further with it? I do not seek to draw it out now, but I am not sure, given the Minister's earlier response, that his mind is yet focused completely on the fact that two different criteria are required to be fulfilled, both of them under paragraph (b). The Minister seemed to think that if one were fulfilled, that would be enough. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> No, the Minister does not think that. He made it clear, or at least intended to, that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"there is a significant doubt as to whether the penalty is payable and the applicant has a compelling need to have the transporter released."
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
There are clearly two limbs to it, and both need to be there. The word "and" makes that clear. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Some people will fall short because they will not be able to avail themselves. So the Minister's remark means that he is happy that some people will be able to escape liability while others will not. Perhaps I can leave it to the hon. Gentleman to reflect on that. 
<P>
I make one other point to the Minister that is very much connected to hardship. The person who has received the notice has to apply to the court and he will want his vehicle back as quickly as possible because it will be causing him concern--even hardship. Will the Minister say a little about how the person will go about applying to court, to which court he will apply, and how the application will be made? All that is extremely relevant to the question of hardship. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> It is very much the intention that the court should be able to consider any application. If it is very likely that the penalty is payable, it would not release the vehicle, but if there is some doubt, it would be able to release it, provided the other limb--a compelling need to have the transporter released--could also be shown. The court considering the application would be the High Court under clause 28. In due course the court would have to make rules to deal with it, which no doubt will be put in the White Book. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I do not want to stray into a debate that will come later, because an amendment on that point has been tabled. But I put down a marker now on the hardship point and will refer to it later. A person may have had a penalty notice put on his lorry on the quayside or thrust into his hand, his vehicle has been detained and he wants to do something about it--and in the case that I have postulated it is a person who will suffer serious hardship if he does not get his vehicle back. He will want to do something quickly and as inexpensively as possible, I imagine, but applying to the High Court might be a daunting task because, as we know, high courts are not on every street corner. All that will put another hurdle in the way of a person in that position. We must focus on how that will work in practice and affect people. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> We can take that point a little further. Is it not the case that for, say, a small operator in a desperate financial plight, the prospect of having to make an application to the High Court, with all the expenses involved, especially if it fails, would be a phenomenal deterrent, and is no protection whatever for such a person? 995 996 
<P>
<B></B><P>
<P>
We have had a good debate and have made some progress. The Minister has responded constructively. In the circumstances and with a view to making progress, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
<H5>6.54 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended.
