Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): We debated designated members briefly at our previous sitting. Whole clauses are dedicated to the appointment and number of designated members and the incorporation document, but there is no reference in the Bill to what designated members should do and for what they will be responsible. The Minister's response on Tuesday was that they will do similar things and have responsibilities similar to company secretaries but that, because the statute book on company law does not state what company secretaries do, there should be nothing on the statute book to state what designated members do. That is a poor argument. Custom and practice have led to the evolution of the company secretary, but we are discussing a new position that is being created for a new sort of corporate entity.

<P>
We have been assured by the Minister and in Government notices that a guidance booklet on limited liability partnerships will be published to provide the missing details when the Bill comes into force. That is a new form of tertiary legislation-law by rule book-with none of the bother of parliamentary scrutiny.

<P>
The summary of responses to the July 1999 consultation document, which I quoted at our previous sitting states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It will be a matter for the llp to allocate duties among members and designated members. In the event of default by the llp, the relevant designated member and any other member in default as well as the llp will be subject to any penalty.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
On Tuesday, I asked the Minister to explain what those penalties will be, but he failed to do so. Perhaps when he responds to this debate, he will be able to list them. I presume that the Minister should have said on Tuesday that the company law penalties that currently apply to company secretaries will be deemed to apply to designated members by virtue of the schedule to the draft regulations. It would be helpful if the Minister could provide a list-it need not be an exhaustive list-of the penalties that will be applicable to designated members under the incorporated company law legislation that will be introduced when the draft regulations become law.

<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): It is good to see you back with us, Mr. Stevenson.

<P>
I am anxious for the Minister to speak on the clause and to elaborate further not just the functions of designated members, but to tell us-the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) also asked for this information-what penalties will apply to designated members who transgress. I am also anxious to know what will happen if a designated member is not appointed and if the incorporation document does not specify who is to be a designated member.

<P>
<B>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Dr. Kim Howells)</B> I did tell the Committee at length on Tuesday that two designated members should be named but, if not, all partners would be deemed to be designated members.<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation and I am pleased that it is on the record. I hope that the Minister will now explain the functions and penalties.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen O'Brien </B>(Eddisbury): I shall begin by declaring an interest. I am a member and fellow of the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators and I was the group company secretary of a United Kingdom public limited company before I entered the House. I am conscious of the need not to transgress the no-advocacy rules.

<P>
On Second Reading, I urged the Minister to reconsider the clause's requirements about designated members. I want to raise five matters in that context. Limited liability partnerships are driven primarily by the competitive and international commercial needs of currently large professional partnerships. However, we should not lose sight of the fact that llps that have operated elsewhere in the world were rapidly and quite properly used for joint ventures in multinational manufacturing companies-partners came together for no premium, in addition, obviously, to smaller managed companies. Property companies that wanted to come together were particularly relevant in that regard. It is crucial to ensure that the provisions' impact on property companies has been thought through.

<P>
The first of the five points that concern me follows on from the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett)-we need to define the functions that are carried out by designated members. The role of a company secretary in a plc is not defined in statute, apart from the requirement to have one. However, useful custom and practice has grown, especially in the light of Cadbury, involving good corporate governance and the ensuing requirements. The lessons that we have learned during the past 10 years should also be involved. I say that in the context of the on-going consultation on company law reform that is being led by Department of Trade and Industry. That approach has to be viewed in the context of the overall consultation process on company law reform. One could argue that our debate should be seen as a precursor of the various matters that will be raised in that process.

<P>
Secondly, are two designated members needed? The Government's approach appears to involve the belief that it is necessary to have two designated members in a partnership business, in the absence of which the default goes to all members-that involves the culture of binding all the partners and a carry through from the past. I shall presently explain why the Government's approach may be slightly misconstrued.

<P>
Thirdly, an analogy has been drawn between what the designated members and the officer of a company will need to do. Those of us with corporate experience know that a rather vague concept is involved, in addition to the specific requirements involving directors-the fiduciary duties that are owed by a director are clear, but how does an officer bind the company? That has always been somewhat vague. The analogy between a designated member and an officer was discussed in the consultation document, which stated that it was too difficult to define a designated member because there was no equivalent definition of an officer. That is wrong-there is a large body of relevant custom and practice, which would be extremely helpful to a company secretary, and which clearly states the role and duties of an officer of a company. It might have been better to draw an analogy between designated members and a company secretary rather than to argue that the Government could not produce a definition in the absence of a proper definition of an officer in company law.

<P>
Fourthly, why cannot the functions that we presume are to be carried out by designated members-in the absence of a definition, this matter is linked to my third point-be carried out by an employee or other person concerned with the llp? An analogy could be drawn with company secretaries, who-at least in the case of larger companies-are rarely directors. There is often a real and proper reason for that.

<P>
Fifthly, on residency, the Minister said on Second Reading that it was not necessary for designated members to be resident in the United Kingdom, because the registered office was to be in England, Wales or Scotland. I presume that that will eventually, under separate provisions, apply to Northern Ireland as well.

<P>
On Second Reading, the Minister said that it was not necessary to provide a definition of a designated member because the position was similar to that of the officer of a company. However, a great body of knowledge now exists about the role of a company secretary that could be utilised in creating a definition. It has proved to be extremely helpful and important in the development of corporate governance and compliance over recent years. Without taking up the Committee's time by repeating myself, I listed, towards the end of my speech on Second Reading, what I thought should be the main headlines of the job description.

<P>
The Minister said that, for the avoidance of confusion, it is important to have a different name-that is, designated member rather than, say, designated secretary, which was the term that I used on Second Reading. On reflection, a better job title might be partnership secretary, which is often used in large partnerships. Limited liability partnerships will have a use and a context way beyond professional partnerships as we know them today.

<P>
The Minister said that the Government take comfort from the fact that designated members need not necessarily be UK residents. That fails to recognise the important advice role that a company secretary offers to the board of directors, especially in large enterprises that may be contemplating becoming llps. Some llps will have hundreds of partners-as I am sure that they will continue to be called in most cases-and will therefore need the strength, advice and guidance of somebody with deep knowledge of procedural and technical matters.

<P>
One matter that was not tackled in debate either here or in another place is the fact that the current proposals, which stipulate a minimum of two designated members, may lead not only to duplication-and therefore cost to the enterprise-but to confusion on the part of people who wish to communicate with the llp. Effective communication with a company generally requires a contact name.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his constructive proposals. However, is he saying that an llp-a properly organised corporate body-cannot get its act together so as to publicise the fact that there is a name that people should contact if they want to do business?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I agree with the Minister that a properly organised llp will do that, as one would expect of any enterprise. However, the Bill should take into account the fact that some will not be properly organised. Indeed, if they are in corporate trouble, they may seek to hide behind the potential for confusion. In holding the Government to account and scrutinising legislation, we must look round the corner to discover areas where the provision might not prove effective. In this ever-faster-moving corporate world, it is important to consider the potential for confusion, and the time lag between notification of changes in designated membership and any subsequent communications.

<P>
I know that the Minister and his Department have received representations from various bodies, including the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, in which, as I said, I play a role. It would not be proper to rehearse now what was said, but I hope that the Minister will take such representations into account. For those who hold equity interest in enterprises that are currently unlimited, the price of limited liability must be transparent and accountable. Transparency requires action, and action is effective only if it is punctual, complete and carried out by competent and responsible people. Such people must also have the technical knowledge necessary to understand what is required of them.

<P>
Most of the partnerships that we are considering consist of such people, and we would expect from them the appropriate level of compliance and diligence. However, to judge by my experience in corporate life, llps are an attractive corporate vehicle for not only professional services and businesses, but areas such as manufacturing and property. Even professional partnerships such as chartered surveyors might not possess the necessary technical knowledge about corporate compliance, so they should contemplate the qualified equivalent of a secretary. Such a person, who need not be a member, would be responsible for compliance and could ensure that members receive advice. That would be preferable to a dedicated member taking on that role, because one would not normally expect, say, a chartered surveyor, a property business person or a roof tile manufacturer to be conversant with the requirements of company law.

<P>
It is important to ensure that the right competency is available to members, and such competency may not necessarily reside in members themselves. Therefore, rather than giving such responsibility to designated members or, by default, all members, it would be better to appoint a partnership secretary.

<P>
I am nervous about relying on the guidance book, and the matter should be made clear in the Bill. I am not advocating the use of a chartered secretary, as in company law. A qualified professional could act as company secretary, and for smaller companies, anyone could fulfil that role. Such people would advise members, and their responsibility would be recognised. They would be named, and would carry out the tasks required of them.

<P>
As it is drafted, the clause could give rise to confusion, and might place an extra burden on such enterprises and those with whom they deal. Unnecessary extra costs might be incurred, and those enterprises could become less competitive.

<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Fabricant </B>(Lichfield): I share some of the concerns expressed by my hon. Friends and by the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon relating to the penalties involved. On Tuesday, I spoke at some length about how the Government have a tendency to produce primary legislation with huge gaps in it-blank cheques that are filled in only at the secondary stage, in a statutory instrument. That is a great danger, and such gaps could be closed by inserting precise details of the penalties.

<P>
I do not share all the concerns of my hon. Friend the Member for-

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Eddisbury. A famous by-election.

<P>
<B>Mr. Fabricant:</B> A famous and very successful by-election. I would say that it demonstrated the nation's huge disquiet about the Government, but you would call me to order, Mr. Stevenson, so I shall not.

<P>
I do not have to declare an interest, but I was a company secretary for a short while in the early 1980s. I joined a small company that we made into a large company, selling to 48 countries. The regulations, burdens or conditions laid upon a company secretary were straightforward, and there are plenty of organisations, such as Oyez, who produce pamphlets that enable people to go through the required procedures.

<P>
I am not sure that I like the name ``designated member''. Given that we are discussing limited liability partnerships, I would have thought that it should be ``designated partner''. ``Member'' is a throw-back to the Companies Act 1985, in which someone who is a shareholder in a public company or limited liability company is a member of that company. That is not the case with limited liability partnerships. It would be more consistent to use the term ``designated partner''. No organised partnership, large or small, would find it especially difficult to meet the conditions for being a designated partner. I presume that a partnership need not become a limited liability partnership, if it does not relish the burdens on a limited liability partnership, such as filling in forms and ensuring that Companies House is kept informed of changes of membership.

<P>
I shall not speak at length now. My sole concern relates to penalties. What will be the penalties for not registering on time?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The hon. Gentleman will know that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has tabled an amendment to clause 17 on penalties. I hope that we will have a fruitful discussion on the question then.

<P>
<B>Mr. Fabricant:</B> I hoped that the Minister might talk about penalties at this stage, but that is because he does not have the information to answer my question in his folder. However, I am happy to wait until we get to clause 17. I hope that the Government will listen and that the Bill will make clear to people what the burdens will be, if they opt for limited liability partnership and, subsequently, fail to meet the relevant conditions, in terms of registering on time or providing incorrect information.

<P>
There will, to some degree, be an additional burden on partnerships, should they become limited liability partnerships, but it will be more than offset by the advantages thereof. I am convinced that many publishing houses will benefit from the demand for pamphlets and books on the procedures necessary to become a designated member.

<P>
I do not believe that being a designated partner is especially onerous, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien) said, there should be clarity regarding the penalties and obligations.

<P>
This is a thin Bill, which in some respects is to be applauded, but perhaps it is a little too thin. It could have been fattened up by including all the aspects that will be encompassed by the statutory instruments that will flow from it. Interestingly, the limited liability partnerships consultation document produced by the Department of Trade and Industry-a blue paper-is considerably thicker than the Bill. However, observers of the Committee should not be deceived. Although this is a thin Bill, it is not a simple one, which means that there could be hidden dangers.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am following the hon. Gentleman's arguments with great care. I should be grateful if he would return to the subject of designated members.

<P>
<B>Mr. Fabricant:</B> I thank you for your advice, Mr. Stevenson.

<P>
Burdens are placed on designated members to fill in forms on time and to file them with Companies House, and they will be penalised if they do not do so. We do not know what that penalty will be, however, because that is to be the subject of secondary legislation. It is that lack of openness-of glasnost-that is so dangerous in the Bill.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> That was a pretty exhaustive run-through. I welcome the contribution of the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon. He missed the Committee's first sitting, probably through no fault of his own.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I think the Minister means the hon. Member for Eddisbury.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I do.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is the first bit of clarity.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Thank you, Mr. Stevenson. I stand corrected. When one reaches the age of 53, all Opposition Members look the same.

<P>
The hon. Member for Eddisbury made a great many constructive suggestions, and I shall try to deal with them. The hon. Member for Lichfield (Mr. Fabricant) accused me of not having my briefing material in place, but I can assure him that I have it here. I thought that we were going to have a serious debate about penalties in clause 17, in line with the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton.

<P>
I said a great deal at our first sitting about the role of designated members. I trust that the Committee will forgive me if I rehearse some of those points. Clearly, some hon. Members are either hard of hearing or were not paying attention. I understand that, because a lot of this material sounds like Serbo-Croat to the average man or woman in the street, if not to the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, who understands it, or to me.

<P>
I shall go through some of my previous points about designated members, because it is an important subject. I shall preface my remarks by reminding the Committee that there is no definition of an officer in the Companies Act 1985. The Act places obligations on directors, company secretaries and officers of companies. However, officers tend to be employees, whereas designated members can also take the role of a director. There is an important difference.

<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
It is intended that an llp should have at least two designated members who will carry out a number of administrative functions, some of which will relate to communications with Companies House. They will include the approval and signing of annual accounts, the filing of accounts at Companies House, the removal of auditors and, in the event of insolvency proceedings, providing any statements setting out the llp's affairs-for example, in relation to assets, debts and liabilities.

<P>
As I said at our first sitting, a designated member will be no more superior or responsible than other members. The way in which the llp is run and who makes the management decisions will be a matter for the llp, and we expect such issues to be covered by the llp agreement. I am surprised that someone with such vast experience of running a company as the hon. Member for Lichfield, who has traded with countries all round the world, should want the new vehicle to be so prescriptive in the way in which it sets out those agreements. He was right to disagree with the hon. Member for Eddisbury about the nature of being a designated member and the rather straitjacketed role that he was prescribing for that designated member as an officer of the partnership. Perhaps he will tell me later exactly what he meant by that.

<P>
I have been asked why there is no definition of a designated member. I have referred to comparisons between designated members and company secretaries, but designated members are not the direct equivalent of a company secretary. The Companies Act makes regular reference to functions that must be carried out by an officer or by an officer and director of the company. In applying the Companies Act to limited liability partnerships in regulations, it has been necessary for us to decide whether references to ``officer'' or ``officer and director'' should be to designated members and/or all members of the llp. There is no definition of an officer's role in that Act, and we cannot conceive of one that would make the designated member's role in an llp any clearer. Designated members are essentially defined by their functions, which will be contained in regulations.

<P>
I know that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has tabled an amendment to clause 17 and I hope that we shall deal with penalties then, but I want to outline the position, as I did at our first sitting. The application of the 1985 Act means that designated members in default will be subject to the penalties applied to officers of a company who are in default. The Act frequently imposes a duty on a company and then provides, where a breach occurs, that both the company and any officer in default are subject to a penalty. The various offences and penalties for each default are set out in schedule 24 and section 730 of that Act.

<P>
As I have said, in some cases the offence will also attach to all members of the llp, just as it may also attach to directors of a company. Clearly, therefore, the duty will be imposed on the llp, and any designated member, or any member in default, will be subject to a penalty along with the llp. For example, the designated members will be responsible for delivering annual accounts to Companies House. If they do not comply with that provision, they will be subject to a penalty in the form of a fine. They will also be liable to a fine if they fail to convene a meeting requested by the resigning auditor.

<P>
Other areas where designated members and the llp are subject to a penalty include the failure to deliver an annual return. Again, that would result in a fine. Similarly, when there is a failure to give notice to the registrar of the auditor's removal or to forward the notice of the auditor's resignation to the registrar, there will be a fine. However, as with companies, only the designated member, or the member who has knowingly and wilfully authorised the default, will be penalised. That is at the heart of the Bill. That is why we are interested in giving these partnerships limited liability.

<P>

<B>Mr. Alan Simpson </B>(Nottingham, South): I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his explanation, but he will be aware that I have raised with him one of my misgivings about whether liabilities are restricted to individuals as opposed to the collectivity. The matter arose specifically from work that I had been doing with police in another context. It arose in respect of the ability of criminals to conceal assets acquired as part of the proceeds of crime.

<P>
Nothing in the Bill would allow people to transfer assets acquired through crime from their personal ownership, which would be available for seizure, into the partnership framework, which would cease to make them available for seizure. One of the Minister's ministerial colleagues has had a considerable amount to say recently about the proceeds of crime, and I should be grateful if the Minister would make it clear that nothing in what he is saying would provide llps with a shelter from that process.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I should be grateful if interventions could be kept as brief as possible. Penalties have been referred to, as well as clause 17 and the amendments to it. I am willing to take such contributions at this stage, but I am sure that hon. Members will want me to take that fully into account when we come to clause 17, so they must be extremely careful. I ask the hon. Members to bear that in mind.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Thank you, Mr. Stevenson. I understand your guidance.

<P>
We have certainly been discussing these issues in the Home Office. If the hon. Gentleman will raise the matter at the appropriate point in clause 17, I shall deal with it then.

<P>
It is intended that the llp incorporation document should state who the designated members are. That does not prohibit changes to the designated members. However, any change that requires the agreement of the other members and, if the incorporation document does not stipulate that certain named members are designated, all the members are designated. We have made it a requirement that the registrar of companies must be informed if the designated members change. The notice must be in a form approved by the registrar and signed or authenticated by a designated member. A person who stops being a member of the llp will automatically stop being a designated member.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I have been listening carefully to the debate, and it occurs to me that notices that I have seen from Companies House to companies are normally addressed to the secretary, who is a known individual. To whom will the notices from Companies House be addressed, assuming that all members of an llp are designated members?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> As a preface to my answer, I would assume that the llps would take care to ensure that two designated members are named. If they did not, Companies House would have to communicate with all the partners in that llp, because they would all automatically, by default, as the hon. Member for Eddisbury said, be defined as designated members.

<P>
There is nothing to stop an llp appointing an employee or anyone else as a company secretary. There is no requirement for it to do so, but it will still require two designated members.

<P>
<B>Mr. Fabricant:</B> The Minister just said, as he did on Tuesday, that where two designated members are not specified, all members are deemed in law to be designated members. He also said that notices then issued by Companies House would be addressed to all members. Is the Minister saying that a single letter would be addressed to ``the partnership'' or that, in the unlikely event of a large partnership with perhaps 100 members, all of whom are deemed to be designated members, 100 letters would go out from Companies House to each member of the partnership? If that were the case, would it not result in considerable confusion-and cost?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> One would hope that, in line with the way in which companies operate at present, a partnership of 100 or more members would have the good sense to ensure that two designated members were the named members.

<P>
<B>Mr. Fabricant:</B> And if not?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> If not, I am afraid that all the partners listed would have to be contacted by name.

<P>
<B>Mr. Fabricant:</B> Individually?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Individually.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way, because we have reached a point that I want to explore.

<P>
Who is competent to receive legal proceedings for and on behalf of an llp? The Minister told us that members could appoint a secretary, who need not be a member. In those circumstances, who should be in receipt of legal proceedings and notices from Companies House?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The named designated members would be finally liable for any responsibility in respect of the llp.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen O'Brien rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Is the Minister giving way?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> No, I have finished.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I should like to speak briefly, having listened carefully to the Minister.

<P>
He was right to say that it would be open to any designated members-indeed, any members-of an llp to appoint someone as the partnership secretary: an employee with the ability to carry out the functions that we have discussed. We have had an interesting discussion about the potential cost and confusion involved in circumstances where an llp chose, for whatever reason, not to select two delegated members. That remains a worry.

<P>
The most important factor that has not been taken into account is that, within corporate structures, what really matters is the authority that is vested in individuals who perform functions within the enterprise and the sense of responsibility that they have. The company secretary is important to the way in which the outside world communicates with the enterprise-through his receipt of legal and corporate notice documents, for example. In corporate law, a company secretary personalises the company as a separate legal entity, so that one is certain that one can communicate straightforwardly with it and knows that one has done what is necessary in that respect.

<P>
The company secretary also has great significance within the company, especially in terms of compliance. If we are to ensure that we have learned all the hard lessons of recent years about corporate governance, enormous benefit can be gained from having access to someone with the appropriate knowledge and competence, who is able to give authoritative advice to the directors of a company or the members of an llp. Often, the company secretary is not a director or member because he can stand up to the board of directors and say, almost from a professional point of view, ``There is a requirement here, and this is my advice.'' That appears on the record, in the minutes, which can be very important in compliance terms. The proper balance must be kept to ensure that the needs of the company as an enterprise do not subsume the need for proper accountability.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the authority to which he refers resides in the llp members, and that it is for the members to decide among themselves whether someone is to be a managing member? It is a good thing to transfer the arrangements between existing partnerships to llps.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have appealed for interventions to be brief and I hope that the hon. Gentleman has made his point.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I think that I get the hon. Gentleman's drift.

<P>
The directors of a company and the equivalent members of llps are those who are vested with total authority for the executive management of the enterprise and who transact that both commercially and legally. My point is that to ensure internal and external compliance, a degree of competency and knowledge is required. That could be absent among designated members because the enterprise might not require that level of competency. A secretary with the necessary competency might be appointed to give advice and the authority would reside in the members. I fully accept that, but my concern is that partnership secretaries are not defined or recognised in the Bill-the same applies to company secretaries under the Companies Act. There should be a statutory framework to give the necessary authority for a partnership to take fully into account any advice offered by a partnership secretary.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I want to make one brief point. I am anxious to ensure that limited liability partnerships are as similar as possible to existing partnerships. I hope that when the Minister responds, he will not over-bureaucratise or fetter the smooth running of what could be a useful organisation if it was allowed to function as similarly as possible to an existing partnership.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The careful probing of my hon. Friends the Members for Eddisbury and for Lichfield and the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon has flushed out some lack of thinking in the development of the Bill. The Minister has admitted that if no designated members are appointed, notices from Companies House-there are many such notices on the most routine matters, such as when it is time to file accounts and so on-will be sent to 100 people if a partnership happens to have 100 partners. The cost of sending, by second class post, 100, 200 or even 30 or 40 notices on routine matters several times a year would be absurd. If the Minister was wrong and notices will not be sent to every designated member, he should tell the Committee.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The Minister was not wrong, but the hon. Gentleman is wrong to denigrate business men and partners in this country for being so incompetent that they cannot appoint two designated members from 100 partners. I do not envisage such a situation and the hon. Gentleman should not talk down British business.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Minister may not envisage that, but his Bill states that all members of a limited liability partnership will be designated members unless the appropriate procedure has been followed. I guarantee today that many of the llps that are set up under the Bill will not appoint two designated members and record their names with Companies House. On the basis of what the Minister said, many hundreds of unnecessary notices will emerge from Companies House at great expense in postage and administration. He may believe that this is a minor point, but it is not. We are creating legislation that is designed to increase bureaucracy and cost. It is difficult enough to stem that without creating absurdly drafted legislation. It is a pity that the Committee is being asked to pass legislation that will lead to that absurdity.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Fabricant:</B> I have several queries about the clause, which appears on first sight to be straightforward.

<P>
Subsection (1)(a) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>where a person becomes or ceases to be a member or designated member, notice is delivered to the registrar within fourteen days.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have no argument with the fact that someone must notify Companies House when the membership of an llp changes, but does the Minister accept that the death of a member of a small llp could cause considerable disruption to the partnership? Did he consider allowing 28 days, or a longer period of grace, before it became an offence not to have made a change in membership of the partnership? In a large partnership, meeting the requirement within 14 days would not be a problem, but in a small partnership, when one of three or four partners has died, it could cause so much disruption to the partnership that the need to deliver the notice to Companies House within 14 days might be overlooked. Fourteen days are not as long as they seem. The documents must be received by Companies House within that period. Allowing for postal delays and weekends, in practice we are probably talking about nine or 10 days' notice, which is a little onerous. Could a company or llp notify the registrar by e-mail? That, at least, is fairly instantaneous and would mean that the full 14-day period would operate.

<P>
Subsection (4) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If a limited liability partnership fails to comply with subsection (1), the partnership and every designated member commits an offence.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What does ``the partnership'' mean in that context? I understand that if a designated member has committed an offence, he would be punished accordingly, but how would the partnership be punished? Would a fine be applied to the body corporate, or would all members, not simply designated members, be punished?

<P>
Subsection (5) offers a defence for a designated member who is charged with an offence under subsection (4) to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>prove that he took all reasonable steps for securing that subsection (1) was complied with.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a good provision, apart from the fact that it ends with a preposition.

<P>
I am delighted that subsection (6) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A person guilty of an offence under subsection (4) is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That provision states what the precise penalty will be, but why was that not done throughout the Bill? Several Opposition Members have asked about such glasnost provisions. The Minister said that he wants flexibility, but the Government's approach is inconsistent. Subsection (6) does what we want, namely, it clearly states that the fine will not exceed level 5 on the standard scale.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> The hon. Member for Lichfield has hit on an interesting point. I am reminded of those marvellous words that appear near the end of ``Romeo and Juliet'': ``all are punish'd''. They could be used to describe what will happen to an old partnership. In this context, however, we are moving away from joint and several liability. Who will be liable for those fines? Will all members be liable jointly and severally, or will the Government define a culpable member? I look forward to the Minister's comments.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The hon. Member for Lichfield raised the serious matter of the 14-day limit. He painted a vivid picture of a family tragedy, and it is true that some partnerships involve such relationships. He also made an important point about electronic communications. Companies House is rapidly moving towards an entirely electronic service, and it will make extensive use of e-mail, but it is not quite there. In the first instance, registration at Companies House will be done on paper. As the hon. Gentleman said, not all businesses will have access to electronic methods of registration, and it is important to ensure that registration is easily accessible. In the longer term, we intend to make electronic access available and as the hon. Gentleman said, such access will be instantaneous, but some llps may not have computers, let alone an internet facility. More importantly, even if they have access, they may not know how to use it.

<P>
I shall try to explain why there are different time limits for filing returns. The 14-day limit for notification of changes in membership is the same as that prescribed for companies in section 288 of the Companies Act 1985. The 28-day limit for notification of any change in a member's name or address is longer than that allowed for companies, which have only 14 days to notify such changes in respect of a director.

<P>
<B>Mr. Fabricant:</B> Does the Minister not think it ironic that 28 days will be allowed for notification of a simple change of name or address, but only 14 days for notification of a member's death, even though the former circumstance is the less traumatic?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> It is a matter of judgment as to whether the returns allow sufficient time for people to register. We have allowed the longer, 28-day period because consultees said that firms with many members would find the 14-day limit administratively burdensome. Members of the Trade and Industry Committee said that, although they were prepared to accept the case for a monthly return, a properly managed llp should not find it difficult to provide an up-to-date list of the names and addresses of its members. The hon. Member for Lichfield asked why the limit should not be 28 days, but we think it important that changes in membership are notified as soon as possible, because such information will be valuable to third parties. Moreover, changes in membership are unlikely to occur with sufficient frequency to make the completion of returns administratively burdensome, but I take the hon. Gentleman's point about exceptional circumstances.

<P>
<B>Mr. Fabricant:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for the spirit of his answer. Although a burden should not be imposed on Companies House, does the Minister agree that in the unusual circumstance of a small llp that suffers a death and consequently fails to file a return within 14 days, Companies House should show a little flexibility and heart before prosecuting?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> As the Minister who has endlessly to write letters to companies that file late, I cannot give him that undertaking, nor would I. I do not intend to spend the rest of my life brokering deals between Companies House and late filers.

<P>
The clause also provides for a fine to be imposed on llps. The hon. Members for Torridge and West Devon and for Lichfield asked about that. The fine will be imposed on the llp and any or all of its designated members, should the returns notifying Companies House of any changes in the members' details not be made within the specified time limits. The power to enforce a fine will give an llp an extra incentive to notify Companies House of any changes to members' details in good time. That, in turn, will give more protection to those dealing with individuals who may no longer be members of the llp-an important point.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The imposition of a fine on an llp that fails to comply with these requirements is the same as that applied to companies who fail to comply with the similar requirements of section 288 of the Companies Act 1985. The fine would not exceed level 5 on the standard scale. For the hon. Member for Lichfield, I have discovered that level 5 is currently £5,000.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I want to clarify one or two points. First, subsection (4) is reasonably clear, and I think that I understand from the Minister that liability rests with the members or the person liable at the time that the offence was committed. Secondly, could the Minister confirm that, if there are no designated members, each member is liable up to the maximum sum, which is £5,000?

<P>
<B>Mr. Fabricant:</B> I want to press the Minister on two points that he has not answered, despite his official's excellent briefing.

<P>
First, I specifically asked whether the phrase ``the partnership'' in subsection (4), when the llp is committing an offence and being fined, means the funds of the partnership held as a body corporate or, as the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon said, that all the members of the partnership would be jointly and severally liable? If the latter is the case, surely that partly defeats the reason for becoming a limited liability partnership in the first place, at least when an offence is committed. It is particularly confusing, because there is a clear demarcation in the subsection, which says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the partnership and every designated member.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does it mean all the members?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Fabricant:</B> Do you want to speak?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am anxious that the hon. Member should make his point as quickly as he can, and we do not want to be confused. Is the hon. Member continuing or is he giving way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Fabricant:</B> If the Minister can clarify my point I should be grateful.

<P>
Finally, the Minister has not answered the drafting question. Given that subsection (6) clearly states what the fines will be, why is that not continued throughout the Bill?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I thank both hon. Gentlemen for their questions.

<P>
First, I was asked how the penalty would apply to an llp under subsections (4) and (6). There is one penalty for the llp as a separate legal entity and one for each of the designated members.

<P>
Secondly, the offence is referred to in subsection (6) and not in the others because it is a new offence. The offences referred to in the regulations refer to existing offences that will apply to llps. This is a new offence because this is a new corporate body.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I want to place on record several points. I fully understand what the Minister has said. If there is no designated member, all partners are liable, each of them up to the maximum amount of the fine, as is the llp itself.

<P>
I have one further point. Will the Minister confirm that to protect outgoing and incoming partners, the fine, and the liability for it, accrues on the partnership and on the partners at the time of the offence.

Clause 9 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 10</center></H4>
<H4><center>Income tax and chargeable gains</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I have just one issue, with which the Minister should be able to deal swiftly and cleanly. It relates to the conversion of a partnership into an llp. My understanding is that that will not give rise to a tax charge. Will he confirm that that is correct?

<P>
Will the Minister also confirm that the reason for that is that, as llps are effectively transparent for tax purposes, on conversion there will simply be a transfer from one identical partnership to another, for tax purposes, which will not trigger a tax charge under existing tax rules? That is not spelt out specifically in the Bill. If that is not the case, will he inform the Committee of the correct interpretation?

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I have one or two points on taxation. The first is a plea. Over the past 15 years, steps have been taken by business to persuade successive Governments of the merits of easing the capital gains tax problems associated with disincorporation. In the past, the Department of Trade and Industry-the Minister's Department-has been anxious to facilitate that.

<P>
A number of limited companies might wish to disincorporate and become limited liability partnerships. For some, especially those with large inbuilt gains, that will present a problem. Will the Minister have a word with his colleagues in the Treasury, to see whether they can devise a system that would enable disincorporation to happen more easily than it does now? That would be in the interests of a flexible economy and of the better running of business in Britain.

<P>
Secondly, I take it that all interest on loans taken out to acquire an interest in an llp will be allowable, for tax purposes, against the total income of an individual. Will the Minister confirm that? Presumably, the same will apply to such loans taken out to purchase an interest in an existing partnership that is converted into a limited liability partnership.

<P>
Thirdly, the Minister will recall that in 1998-when I think his Parliamentary Private Secretary, the hon. Member for Halton (Mr. Twigg), was on the Standing Committee on the Finance Bill-changes were made in partnership taxation, and a phasing out of the cash basis of accounting was introduced for partnerships, especially solicitors' partnerships. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton was also on that Committee, and he might remember my having to declare an interest because my then firm was operating on the cash basis of assessment, and the original rules that were promoted by the Inland Revenue were punitive, to say the least. They are rather better now. There has been a phasing in from the cash to the earnings basis over a period of eight years. Will that phasing in continue for professional firms that convert into a limited liability partnership?

<P>
Fourthly, will the Minister tell the Committee whether transparency for capital gains tax will be lost if an llp ceases to carry on any trade or business? I hope that that transparency will continue to the end of the winding up process, provided that it is not done for tax avoidance purposes.

<P>
Fifthly, capital gains tax rollover relief is causing some uncertainty to business. I understand that the Government have accepted that they were unreasonable to recapture gains that an llp member had rolled into an asset outside the llp, and which were unconnected with his membership. Will the Minister confirm that the Government do not intend that gains be recaptured when the llp ceases to be transparent on the cessation of its business?

<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen O'Brien:</B> It is important to look down the track in the context of taxation. Several llps may wish, in due course, to convert to limited companies or plcs. Some professional partnerships have already become plcs. Many are in the headhunter profession, not least because of the huge international extent of their business. It is highly likely that llps will be used as a staging point in the development of such firms. What thought has been given to the ease of conversion from an llp to private or public limited company status, and what taxation consequences may flow from that?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I must ask the hon. Gentleman to repeat that question, because it is more usual to be asked whether there will be tax implications in converting from a limited company to an llp.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I shall clarify my point. We have carefully examined conversion from a limited company or unincorporated business to an llp, and the clause addresses many of the taxation issues involved in that. However, I am concerned to look forward, as we create a new corporate beast, to see how it is likely to develop commercially given the speed of international commerce, especially within professional partnerships. I suspect that it will be used as a staging point by companies that want to become public limited companies for greater access to funding and capital over time. The headhunting profession has shown the way in that regard.

<P>
The clause does not make it clear how taxation is likely to be affected by conversion from an llp to limited company status. That is the other side of the coin to a matter that has been reasonably well covered.
