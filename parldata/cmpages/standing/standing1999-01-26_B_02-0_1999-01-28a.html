<P>
<B>Mr. David Curry (Skipton and Ripon):</B> On a point of 
order, Mr. Gale. Yesterday, I received a little white card 
summoning me to the Committee on the Greater London 
Authority Bill. That would not have mattered but for the 
fact that my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley 
and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) received a card summoning 
him to the Committee on the Local Government Bill. You 
can imagine that that caused me and my right hon. Friend 
equal consternation. He had always thought that the Forth 
was one bridge that we could not cross in that regard. I 
hope that we will ensure that such an unfortunate error, 
which, despite the esteem that my right hon. Friend and 
I have for each other, caused some embarrassment, will 
not recur.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am grateful to the right hon. 
Gentleman. I am certain that the Committee would 
welcome with open arms the presence of the right hon. 
Member for Bromley and Chislehurst were he to appear. 
I am advised that there was an administrative error, for 
which the authorities responsible duly apologise. I am 
sure that it will not happen again.
<P>
I was about to say, "Good morning, ladies and 
gentlemen,"	 but I did not get the chance.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bernard Jenkin (North Essex):</B> I was responding 
to the Government's two replies to the debate on the 
amendments. In particular, I was discussing the set of 
amendments that I had tabled on exemptions from best 
value for certain police functions. I tabled them as probing 
amendments, but I was rather startled by the Minister's 
reply. I had expected a reply along the lines of, "Don't be 
ridiculous. Of course the Secretary of State won't have 
powers to intervene in these processes."	 However, that is 
not what the hon. Lady said. Instead, she got into a rather 
interesting discourse about what were the overall 
responsibilities and operational responsibilities of police 
authorities. That echoed a controversy in the previous 
Parliament. No distinction is made in the Bill between 
police authority responsibilities that are overall functions 
and those that are operational functions.
<P>
The particular benefit of the amendment that we tabled 
on support services, which might be exempted 
[Interruption.] If the Minister wants to intervene, I will 
give way to her.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Local Government and Housing </B><P>
(Ms Hilary Armstrong): Police authorities do not have 
operational functions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The point is that the Bill is blind to that 
distinction. It was the hon. Lady who made the assertion 
that there were differences between operational and 
overall responsibilities they are not specified in the Bill. 
In theory, every aspect of police activity will be subject 
to direction by the Secretary of State as regards best value. 
The hon. Lady said that the police had one statutory duty, 
but we are placing a new duty on them, which, because we are dealing with a new piece of legislation, will potentially override the other duties that they have been 
given. There is still no clarity on the issue. Perhaps the 
Minister can explain it a little further.
<P>
On the question of waste disposal, the hon. Lady was 
keen to tell us that the companies concerned welcomed 
best value, and I am sure that they do. Let us, however, 
be realistic about the position that they face. The hon. 
Lady's party has a majority. The Bill will become law. 
It gives the Secretary of State huge discretion regarding 
companies' future involvement with local authority 
activities. Having a head-to-head argy-bargy with the 
Government about whether the Bill should become law 
may not be in their best interests. They will need to get 
in with the Secretary of State to ensure that when they 
complain in future that a local authority is not doing 
something properly, they will not be regarded as being 
outside the third way. They want to be in the great big 
tent constructed by new Labour.
<P>
This probing amendment on waste disposal authorities 
underlines the utterly all-embracing nature of the powers 
that are to be taken by the Secretary of State.
<P>
I am grateful to the hon. Lady for her clarification about 
unitary and metropolitan districts. The Committee will 
return to the issue of limits because the Liberal Democrats 
have tabled an amendment about it. The National 
Association of Local Councils has said that it wants a 
£750,000 exemption for local authorities so that below 
that level the best value provisions of the Bill will not 
apply. We agree that there comes a point at which it is 
not worth the public expense of using the Bill's huge 
apparatus of supervision and control on such small 
authorities.
<P>
On the question of regions, Conservative Members 
accept that regional development agencies are not 
precepting authorities and that the Bill is, as we shall learn 
from later clauses, intended to apply to precepting 
authorities. However, the hon. Lady is not correct to say 
that non-precepting authorities will be beyond the scope 
of the Bill. The long title of the Bill states that it will
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"make provision imposing on local and certain other authorities".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It does not refer to local and certain other precepting 
authorities. It is therefore perfectly legitimate to suggest 
that regional development authorities should be included 
in the Bill it would, in fact, be difficult to argue why 
they should not be included. The question of dual 
supervision applies to other authorities every precepting 
authority is subject to the supervision of the Audit 
Commission or its own auditors. It would be equally valid 
to ensure that RDAs are covered by the Bill. That gives 
the lie to the claim that the Bill is aimed at achieving 
best value, and we shall consider that point further as we 
progress through the Bill.
<P>
On the same theme, one wonders why the Greater 
London authority should not be properly subjected to the 
duty of best value. The hon. Lady is keen on saying that 
we must have flexibility. I think that by "we" she 
inadvertently refers to herself and her ministerial 
colleagues, because it is they who will have flexibility. 
The Greater London authority and its constituent parts-- 
Transport for London, the fire authority and so on will 
not know where they stand except as the Secretary of 
State shall direct them. That is the Bill's fundamental 
feature.
<P>
The whole purpose of legislation is to limit the 
discretion of the state. The whole purpose of having a 
Parliament to make laws is so that the state cannot make 
it up as it goes along. The Bill allows the Secretary of 
State to decide where best value shall apply as he goes 
along. The hon. Lady claimed that it is a matter for 
speculation as to whether different parts of the GLA 
should be included in the best value provisions. Indeed, 
we can only speculate as to how the Secretary of State 
will apply the powers that are set out in the Bill. The 
amendments would place a general duty on the GLA, the 
RDAs and any future regional assembly to achieve best 
value and thereby clarify the situation.
<P>
Finally, with regard to Wales, the response of the 
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales, the 
hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Jones), rather 
lowered the tone of the Committee. It is counterproductive 
to rerun arguments about whether the Conservative party 
has accepted that the legislation has gone through. His 
speech betrayed that he does not know how to respond to 
the hybrid body that has been created.



<P>
The National Assembly for Wales is not a local 
authority and not a Parliament. It is a Crown body which 
is part of the state. It is not a legislative body, although it 
will deal with the legislative responsibilities that might 
be exercised by the Secretary of State in England. It is 
extraordinary that a body that is 100 per cent. funded by 
this place this applies to RDAs as well and which has 
all the characteristics of a local authority, being a directly 
elected assembly, should be exempt from all the 
disciplines that we expect local authorities to undertake. 
It would be different if it were a proper legislative 
assembly, as is the case in Scotland.

<P>

<B><P>
The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for 
Wales (Mr. Jon Owen Jones):</b> It is true that the Welsh 
Assembly will not have primary legislative powers, but it 
will be responsible for secondary legislation, which is not 
the case with the other comparisons that the hon. 
Gentleman gave. It will be specifically responsible for the 
way in which local authorities ensure that they deliver 
best value.
<P>
The logic of what the hon. Gentleman proposes is that 
the Welsh Assembly should be seen to be no more than a 
local authority as regards its relationship with 
Westminster; that is the heart of the matter. It destroys 
the concept of devolution. I may be upsetting the hon. 
Gentleman by lowering the tone, in his view, but he 
confirms my view that the Conservative party has not 
accepted the concept of devolution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> If we had legislated for a Welsh 
Parliament, I would accept that we had moved a stage 
further, but we have not. Parliament has legislated to 
transfer some of the Secretary of State's powers to an 
elected body in Wales. The Secretary of State is usually 
answerable to and sackable by the House of 
Commons. However, we have created a framework in 
which there will be a Secretary of State in Wales that is what the Welsh Assembly embodies in law, because it will act in the name of the Crown, like a Minister and 
yet that particular "Minister" will be immune from 
scrutiny by Parliament.
<P>
I should have thought that the opportunity for best 
value would be just the thing. The Minister for Local 
Government and Housing keeps assuring us that it is a 
benign and involving process for drawing out the best, 
and not about imposing responsibilities. I merely use the 
rhetoric that the hon. Lady attempted to use to sell the 
proposal to her former councillor Back Benchers.
<P>
The Welsh Assembly is immune from parliamentary 
scrutiny and will now, under the Bill, be immune from 
the disciplines that apply to every other elected assembly 
that exists in England and Wales. We are adding to the 
hybridity, not improving accountability. If the Welsh 
Assembly raised its own money, there would be no 
question, but the money for which the Welsh Assembly 
will be responsible is voted by the House. Therefore, it is 
the obligation of the Secretary of State, the Government 
and house to ensure proper accountability. In discussions 
on the Government of Wales Bill, questions were raised 
on the methods by which the House would supervise the 
accountability of expenditure in the Welsh Assembly. 
I do not think that they were all satisfactorily answered.
<P>
I regard this Bill as an opportunity to strengthen 
accountability when it comes to money raised by 
the United Kingdom Government, which is supervised by 
the United Kingdom Parliament, in consultation with the 
people of Wales as represented through the Welsh 
Assembly.
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jon Owen Jones  rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am just about to sit down. If the Minister 
wishes to have another go, he may.
<P>
In view of the unsatisfactory answers that we have had, 
we will listen to what the Minister says, but reserve our 
right to divide the Committee on the matter.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford (Mole Valley):</B> One reason why I 
am tempted to respond, apart from the unsatisfactory 
answers that we have received on some points, is that the 
compliments given by the Minister for Local Government 
and Housing were somewhat backhanded, and aged me 
instantly. She had me down as being responsible for some 
of the environment legislation prior to my arrival here. 
I only arrived here in 1992 it just looks as though I have 
been here for a long time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Allen (Vice-Chamberlain of Her Majesty's Household):</b> It is great credit to the All Blacks.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> Yes, great credit to the All Blacks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> My hon. Friend is unnecessarily modest. 
When he was leader of a local authority, he demonstrated 
how effective competitive tendering could be in 
improving services. We wanted to extend those benefits 
to other local authorities, and my hon. Friend was an 
inspiration to the previous Government.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I think that we can let that flannel 
slide, Mr. Gale. [Laughter.]
<P>
The Minister missed what I was trying to get at. On 
amendment No. 103, I have no concerns for the private 
sector when it comes to waste disposal. The hon. Lady 
asks for, insists, and says that best value will integrate 
the various stages. I shall not quote from her remarks in 
Hansard, but she clearly says that that is one of the 
purposes. But the disposal side must be integrated, 
because it is driven by specifications, the requirements of 
the contracts, collection, and so on.
<P>
I am not surprised that the contractors are not 
complaining about best value. They are already driven, 
for commercial reasons, to meet the three Es, and any 
major changes will mean more revenue for disposal and 
collection contractors. So there will be no complaints, 
particularly as I understand that they see this as a softer 
regime than that which it will replace.
<P>
The problem lies in consultation with the client side. 
They have all the reviews and all the paraphernalia 
which we shall touch on later in the debate with a 
minute client side staffing. The alternative would be an 
enormous boost in jobs for the boys and girls. It really is 
the overkill to beat all others.
<P>
I am intrigued at the repeal of the EPA competition 
rules. It was anticipated: it was mentioned in journals, and 
the Minister confirmed it. It will be succour to a few of 
the diehard disposal authorities which fought all the way, 
either by incompetence or intransigience, and refused to 
go along with the previous legislative requirements. 
I think that the Government will be in for a shock: the 
Chief Secretary to the Treasury should be looking at this 
issue with deep concern. If the system that some 
authorities would like is adopted which effectively 
means finding the capital and revenue costs themselves 
they will be in for a blunt surprise when they look to the 
Treasury for assistance.
<P>
I do not intend to press amendment No. 103. I am rather 
amused to see that dogma has overridden common sense. 
However, I turn briefly to the excuses given by the 
Under-Secretary of State for Wales for protecting the 
Welsh Assembly. He is protecting it from the bureaucratic 
hand of best value, but it is better than the current system. 
The hon. Gentleman's excuses were pathetic. The hon. 
Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) mentioned the 
All Blacks. Every time the All Blacks come over here and 
trample across the Welsh team, we hear pathetic excuses. 
But the excuses given by the Under-Secretary of State for 
Wales were even more pathetic.
<P>
The clause deals with the upper tier of local authorities, 
which will have a huge budget and be partly filled with 
ex-councillors. It will also have lots of buzz words, some 
of which the Committee heard from the Minister 
yesterday or the day before. He spoke of clarity and 
openness, but the only objectives that he could come up 
with were in some Cabinet Office paper called "Better 
quality services"	.
<P>
While the Bill imposes best value on local authorities, 
the best that the Minister can come up with for the Welsh 
Assembly is the half-way and half-baked standard of 
"better"	. Local authorities will not be impressed. It is 
often complained that Governments lean on local 
authorities, and the clause is another classic example.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> If I have understood the Opposition 
Front Bench correctly, the hon. Member for North Essex 
wishes to ask leave to withdraw amendment No. 111 and 
to press to a vote amendment No. 105, which relates to 
the Welsh Assembly. Is that correct?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That is correct. I beg to ask leave to 
withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I shall speak to the Liberal Democrat 
amendments, Nos. 73 and 20. As you said nothing to the 
contrary, Mr. Gale, I assume that debate on the 
amendments is in order despite the fact that the Minister 
has already spoken briefly about her attitude towards the issues that they raise in the debate on clause 1. She accepted that under compulsory competitive tendering 
legislation there was a de minimis level to exclude 
authorities with small budgets. We are still working under 
compulsory competitive tendering legislation too often 
it is treated as if it were dead and buried. Unfortunately, 
it is not yet dead. The Minister also accepted the need to 
recognise the folly of placing unnecessary burdens and 
onerous duties on small authorities, which would not be 
in the interests of the public purse. She said earlier that 
she had no intention of setting best value duties which 
result in unnecessary expenditure for authorities. That is 
why our amendment would, in practice, relate only to 
parish councils and town councils. Even West Somerset 
district council, which is in my constituency and is one of 
the smallest district councils in the country, has a budget 
running into millions of pounds.

<P>

<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Teesdale is smaller.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> Committee members may know of 
other smaller councils, but I suspect that those councils 
all have a budget of at least £1 million.
<P>
Parish councils are elected by ballot and therefore they 
must consider the cost, quality and value of the contracts 
that they award and the services that they provide. They 
are subject to the scrutiny of auditors and the electorate. 
However, authorities with small budgets should not be 
subject to the best value regime of consultation, auditing, 
contract specification, monitoring, tendering, and the 
publication of plans, indicators and targets.
<P>
In the summer when, according to the press, Members 
of Parliament were on holiday I made a comprehensive 
tour of parish councils in my constituency. Many have 
tiny budgets and employ a clerk for only two hours a 
week to deal with the parish council meeting and 
constituents' correspondence. Imposing best value duties 
on those clerks would incur a lot of extra expenditure. 
Labour Secretaries of State seem to want a lot of power 
[Interruption.] I shall not be completely constructive; 
I am sorry if the oppositional nature of my comments 
upsets the Government Whip.
<P>
I do not believe that a Labour Secretary of State wants 
power to interfere with every parish and town council in 
the land, including those with a budget of less than £7,000 
a year.
<P>
The Government still appear to be consulting with the 
National Association of Local Councils and other 
organisations. Perhaps the lesson to be drawn from that is 
that they should have waited for the results of best value 
pilot schemes before introducing the Bill. We are debating 
an incomplete Bill.
<P>
The Bill does not include a de minimis level. The only 
indication of what that level should be appears in the 
White Paper. [Interruption.] The Government do not 
always do what White Papers recommend.
<P>
The explanatory notes to the Bill state that the Secretary 
of State has at his discretion the power
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to exempt the smaller town and parish councils...from the full duty 
of best value".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The notes do not specify that the Secretary of State will 
definitely use such power.
<P>
Town councils and parish councils want the Opposition 
to press the Government for a more definite commitment. 
They are not ready to trust the Secretary of State and give 
him total discretion. In my experience, most town and 
parish councils do not trust larger authorities or, indeed, 
Secretaries of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I endorse many of the comments made by 
the hon. Member for Taunton (Jackie Ballard). 
Conservative Members are also anxious about the Bill's 
lack of clarity, and that is why we have tabled amendment 
No. 114. We like clause 2(5) and do not wish to delete it. 
Amendment No. 114 is a probing amendment, which 
seeks to establish why the Secretary of State requires 
specificity in his discretion. Government amendment No. 
50 amplifies that discretion, and is an avoidance of-doubt 
amendment, but it underlines the Secretary of State's 
discretion. We look forward to hearing some justification 
for that.

<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Alan Meale):</b> It is nearly always a delight to be in Committee 
under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale. I am also grateful to 
Opposition Members for their contributions on the first 
group of amendments. My hon. Friend the Minister for 
Local Government and Housing made it clear in an earlier 
sitting that we are still willing to listen and that 
consultations are still going on with associations 
connected with the smaller British authorities.
<P>
The local government White Paper published last 
summer suggested £500,000 as a de minimis level for best 
value in England. We recognise that the statutory duty 
could be onerous if applied in full to smaller authorities, 
particularly to the smaller town and parish councils.
<P>
The hon. Member for Taunton said that the Bill was 
incomplete, so I would like to assure her that we are still 
having meetings and talking about problems. There will 
be opportunities later for further amendments and to 
ensure that our assurances are fulfilled. In that light,
I would ask her to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> Is the Minister saying that, before 
Third Reading, the Government will table amendments 
that will insert a de minimis level into the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> That is not what I said. I said that Ministers 
and officials are still willing to meet associations for 
consultations, that we will deliberate on them and that we 
will decide whether further amendments are necessary. 
We recognise the importance of the issue that the hon. 
Lady raised. We have been advised that £500,000 would 
cover all but 70 parish councils in England. The figure of 
up to £1 million bandied about earlier would exempt 
nearly all. As the hon. Member for North Essex 
(Mr. Jenkin) acknowledged, it becomes pointless to 
exempt everybody. We need to find an appropriate level. 
As I said, discussions are still continuing and if the 
Government can establish that a different figure would be 
appropriate, they will then take a decision to table 
further amendments.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> Despite the lack of clarity about what 
will happen, it would be helpful if the Government would 
accept the amendment, which would write the principle 
of the de minimis level into the Bill. At a later stage when 
consultations have ended, the Government could then 
table another amendment to increase the amount.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> That sounds fine, but the answer is no.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> Have local authorities estimated 
the cost of consultation exercises, particularly as a 
proportion of their net revenue costs? That would be 
interesting and could influence the figures. The 
Government could either lift the de minimis level upwards 
or consider alleviating the load of so much consultation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> As the hon. Gentleman knows, the Local 
Government Association supports the de minimis level of 
£500,000. The process is being fulfilled. We are 
committed to meeting representatives of the smaller local 
authorities to determine whether they can make the case. 
As matters now stand, the level has been set out in last 
summer's White Paper on local government.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I was suggesting that, rather than 
necessarily shifting the de minimis level, it might be 
worth considering the way in which the consultation has 
been set out and diminish that, while still having strong, 
worthwhile consultations. It may be that consultation is 
overloaded.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> I am advised that we have not said what 
that will be. The whole purpose of the clause and our 
debates especially last Tuesday is to show that the 
Government have a flexible approach to achieving best 
value. The White Paper "Local Voices"	, issued last July 
by the Welsh Office, proposed that the National Assembly 
for Wales, following discussions with local authority 
associations, would determine the threshold below which 
the duty of best value would not apply to best value 
authorities in Wales.
<P>
I must resist the amendments because putting a figure 
in the Bill would remove the capacity to change the de 
minimis level in future in the light of changing 
circumstances. Setting the figure by order in the Bill gives 
us necessary flexibility. Therefore, I ask the hon. Lady to 
withdraw her amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 114 proposes the deletion of clause 
2(5). I am grateful to the hon. Member, Mr. Jenkins 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the Minister and all 
hon. Members that, while it is sometimes confusing in 
Committee, only the Chairman refers to hon. Members by 
name. Following the custom on the Floor of the House, 
we refer to hon. Members by constituency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> Yet again, Mr. Gale, I apologise as I 
have had to do frequently to you in Committees, although 
not usually for the reason for which I apologise now.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex stated his 
willingness not to press amendment No. 114. We are 
grateful because, as he rightly said, it would remove clause 2(5), which would cause difficulties for him and for the Government, and we would be obliged to oppose 
it. The Government intend that the duty of best value will 
generally apply to all local authorities. That, as the hon. 
Gentleman rightly pointed out, is dealt with in 
subsection (5).
<P>
Government amendment No. 50 addresses the point 
raised in the Opposition amendment. It would make it 
possible to disapply particular functions from the duty of 
best value in respect of individual local authorities or 
categories of authority. The amendment will give added 
flexibility to the framework so that the duty can be 
tailored to fit the circumstances of not only individual 
authorities or categories of authority but of some local 
authority functions.
<P>
The full duty of best value may prove too onerous, or 
impractical, in certain circumstances, as the hon. Member 
for Taunton said, For example, it might be sensible to 
make different arrangements in respect of certain services 
provided by town and parish councils, or the emergency 
planning functions of other authorities. Clause 2(5) allows 
us to deal with such cases in a flexible and appropriate 
way. Amendment No. 50 gives us further flexibility to 
do that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The Government's amendment No. 50 
amends subsection (5) as follows:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Secretary of State may by order provide that a best value 
authority specified, or of a description specified, in order is not to

<P>
(b) to which the authority would otherwise be subject under

deviation, put down his notes and tell us, in simple 
English, what on earth that means?

<P>

<B>Mr. Meale:</B> It is complicated parliamentary language. 
It means, simply, that the Government are determined that 
the new law will be flexible, and that best value will be 
delivered flexibly to fulfil the needs of large and small 
authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The Under-Secretary cannot get away with 
that. He has given his interpretation, but I asked him what 
the clause meant. Can he tell us in English was the 
clause means?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> The right hon. Gentleman asks me to 
present the Government's proposal in plain English. As a 
former Minister, he knows that, to do that, Departments 
submit proposals to the plain English courts and wait 
many weeks for a simple reply. However, before we finish 
with the Bill, we shall submit it in that way, so that the 
public will be more aware of the meaning of the 
parliamentary language that passes into law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I shall not press the Under-Secretary on 
the matter. Government amendments are made to every 
Bill. Many are technical, but some are the most abstruse gobbledegook. I am sure that we would agree that a Government amendment was technical, if the 
Under-Secretary, when explaining it could describe its 
effect in understandable language. But when I am told 
that a Government amendment is technical, and I cannot 
understand it, every instinct tells me that something fishy 
is going on. I am usually wrong, but I like to be reassured.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> I agree with the right hon. Gentleman. 
I have endured 12 tortuous years of serving on 
Committees considering the previous Government's Bills, 
and I experienced the same difficulties. I look forward to 
an Adjournment debate, or even a Bill perhaps 
promoted by the right hon. Gentleman on the use of 
simple language in legislation. I am sure that all parties 
would support it.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> If I understand the mater correctly, the 
Government have accepted the principle of a de minimis 
level, but are not inclined to give any idea of whether it 
will be £5,000, £50,000 or £500,000. It will certainly not 
be £1 million. That will give a little comfort to smaller 
authorities. Therefore, were should like to press 
amendment No. 73 [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There are at least three 
conversations going on. If hon. Members wish to discuss 
matters in private, they may do that in the Corridor.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> Amendment No. 73 paves the way for 
amendment No. 20. Therefore, we shall press amendment 
No. 73 to a vote.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand 
part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I abstained in the vote on amendment
No. 73, because I do not subscribe to the view that 
because something is small it is necessarily virtuous. 
There is a Liberal tendency to think that because something is small it must be good. There are many parish councils in my constituency and two biggish ones town 
councils in Ripon and in Skipton. Those should be 
subject to the rigours of audit. There are hundreds of 
minuscule councils to which, to all intents and purposes, 
no elections ever take place, because it is a problem to 
find anyone willing to serve on them.
<P>
A de minimis rule is a blunt instrument. It would be 
more sensible to find a way of scrutinising councils to 
find out which are doing a proper job and running 
efficiently. Those could be relieved of the regularity of 
audits that might fall on other councils. It must be inherent 
in the notion of best value that councils that provide it 
can be trusted to continue to do so without such regular 
scrutiny as the laggards require. It would be sensible to 
devise a rapid audit of smaller councils which have a wide 
range of duties. Some have arrangements with their 
district council, under which responsibilities are devolved 
to them. Many and even town council is just a parish 
council in constitutional terms mainly bang on about 
planning permission. That is the main function of many 
parish councils which are often just against it.
<P>
Deciding not to examine any council with a budget 
under £500,000 or £750,000 is not relevant. We should 
aim to find out whether a council has a real purpose. If it 
uses real cash and has real responsibility it should be 
subject to audit. However, perhaps it exists just to provide 
an echo of village opinion. That is perfectly legitimate. 
Villages worry about whether they will get mains 
drainage and about the footpaths. Many people are 
preoccupied by those; indeed, my wife is chairman of the 
footpaths committee in Arkesden. Anyone who thinks that 
village life is peaceful should occasionally sit in on one 
of those committees, where things get quite close to 
nuclear war. I should hope that the Government could 
devise a rapid scrutiny method to determine whether 
councils need to be subject to a more rigorous regime. 
The sums of money involved are less relevant.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> On a similar theme, what I was 
trying to elicit from the Under-Secretary and I hope that 
my right hon. Friend would agree about this was that it 
would be possible to reduce the regime by reducing the 
consultation required with respect to many, if not all, of 
the local authorities and targeting it on key areas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> That is extremely sensible and I was about 
to make that point. I remember the system which is 
probably still in operation of dairy inspection charges. 
Farms that received a clean bill of health had their next 
inspection after a given number of years. Farms with a 
problem were inspected much more regularly. I hope that 
the Government will devise a way of dealing with parish 
councils that recognises that their resources are not of the 
kind to require the full rigours of the best value system, 
but that does not exclude them from the relevant auditing 
requirements. They spend public money and have public 
responsibilities and in many places, including Ripon and 
Skipton, play an important historical role in the character 
of the city.
<P>
<B>Mr. Adrian Sanders (Torbay):</B> I do not think that a 
parish or town council in the country is excluded from 
audit nor would they be under the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The hon. Gentleman misses my point. His 
party has suggested that below a certain level of resource 
the best value rules should not apply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> Not that there should be no audit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> No, I accept that. My point is that there 
should be a method of judging whether a council has 
responsibilities that should require the best value rules, as 
opposed to the simple audit rules, to apply. De minimis is 
not necessarily a sensitive enough instrument, given the 
differing relationships between parish and district councils 
and the different culture of parish councils. Indeed, a 
parish council can be as minuscule as the tiny hamlet at 
the top of Wharfedale, which is in my constituency, or as 
large as the Skipton and Ripon town councils, which are 
much more substantial bodies.
<P>
The clause will empower the Secretary of State to 
include authorities within the best value framework. Can 
the Minister illustrate perhaps by providing one or two 
names the sorts of bodies that will qualify under 
subsection (2)(a)(b) and (c), so that we have some notion 
of the Government's intention? Will she also tell us the 
Secretary of State's views on when those authorities will 
be included, which ones will take priority, and how best 
value will relate to them?
<P>
<B>Mr. John Hayes (South Holland and The Deepings):</B> 
I should be grateful if my right hon. Friend would also 
ask the Minister whether inclusion might also mean 
reduction. Given that the Secretary of State is assuming 
the power to include authorities, does he intend the 
number of best value authorities to grow year by year? At 
what point will an authority cease to be a best value 
authority? That certainly has not been made clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> My understanding is that the system is 
intended to be permanent. The problem will be faced not 
during the first rounds of best value, when ground may 
need to be made up, but at a later point, when we measure 
the reasonableness of demands for incremental extras at 
the top end of the performance range. By definition, if 
25 per cent. are in the top quartile, 75 per cent. are not. 
Not everyone can be in the top 25 per cent. How one 
squeezes extra value from those at the top of the scale, 
and whether a new regime should be introduced, are 
probably the next conceptual questions to ask.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> It is useful to have a general discussion 
on the clause, because it will give the Secretary of State 
the discretionary power to extend or disapply best value 
to other authorities.
<P>
Perhaps I can help the Under-Secretary. The clause will 
enable the Secretary of State to choose the functions that 
are subject to best value in a local authority. That 
discretion will extend to not only individual authorities 
but individual functions, and underlines the huge powers 
that will be given to the Secretary of State.
<P>
It may be preferable to establish a de minimis level to 
limit the Secretary of State's discretion to extend or 
disapply best value at this point. Alternatively, perhaps 
there should be a general de minimis level that he could 
extend or disapply, as we discussed earlier. That is the difference between including the provision in clause 1 or clause 2. I listened with interest to the Under-Secretary's 
comments on that point.
<P>
The Minister must make it clear why the discretionary 
power needs to be so wide. Local authorities will need to 
know where they stand. For example, as the right hon. 
Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) noted, there 
is a de minimis auditing level for parish councils. They 
are not required to complete a full resource accounting 
audit or amounts under £5,000. That is an important issue 
for local authorities.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> So that the Committee and the record 
are clear, the Bill provides for the de minimis level to be 
set by order, and that will happen. We are arguing that it 
should not be in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Parish councils are now subject to an 
extensive audit on amounts over £5,000. There is a great 
deal of resentment among smaller parish councils about 
the obligation that that entails. Those parish councils have 
relatively small budgets. They do not pay their clerks a 
huge amount of money; a clerk often does the work in his 
spare time for nothing. Then to be involved in the 
preparation of the financial information necessary is a 
great deterrent to councils finding the right people to take 
on those obligations. That is why the National Association 
of Local Councils has made representations on this matter, 
both to this Government and to the previous Government, 
and why we thought it right to consider whether a de 
minimis level should be included in the Bill to provide 
protection for those councils, so that the Secretary of State 
could not perhaps be over-zealous, as Secretaries of State 
tend to be when they try to achieve their objectives.
<P>
However, the real point about the clause is the extent 
to which the powers of the Bill can be extended or 
disapplied. I thought it important to draw the Committee's 
attention to that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> The clause gives flexibility to extend or 
vary the duty of best value in the following ways. It gives 
the Secretary of State a power to make an order extending 
the duty to preaccepting or levying bodies within the local 
government financial system which are not included in 
clause 1. That allows for future developments, when it 
would be desirable to bring another body or bodies within 
the scope of the duty.
<P>
The clause gives the Secretary of State a power to make 
an order applying the duty to the Greater London 
authority in respect of functions that it does not exercise 
directly through the mayor, such as police functions 
exercised through the Metropolitan police authority. There 
is also provision for the duty to be applied to the GLA 
in respect of functions currently performed by other best 
value authorities.
<P>
The clause also provides the Secretary of State with a 
power to disapply by order specified elements of the duty 
for any best value authority or categories of authority 
which would otherwise be subject to them. For example, 
smaller town or parish councils, or community councils 
in Wales, might be exempted from the full duty, where the costs of complying with it are considered to be excessive. I can tell the right hon. Member for Skipton 
and Ripon that one example would be magistrates' courts 
authorities, when they are fully constituted.
<P>
The clause provides the necessary flexibility to bring 
other bodies within the scope of the duty in future, if that 
is considered necessary, and to vary the duty where it 
would be sensible to do so.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 2, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we move to clause 3, I should 
tell the Committee that we are in slightly unchartered 
territory sitting at 9 o'clock in the morning. It has been 
drawn to my attention that the standing orders provide for 
the Committee to rise at 11.30 am which is when the 
sitting in the Chamber begins. I am not aware that any 
hon. Member has been equipped with a Tardis to get from 
her to the Chamber in zero time.
<P>
If any hon. Members particularly wish to attend 
Speaker's prayers, I shall be prepared to accept a motion 
at 11.25 am that further consideration be adjourned. I am 
not seeking to impose such a motion on members of the 
Committee; I am simply saying that I am willing to accept 
such a motion if any hon. Member wishes to attend 
Prayers.

</UL></FONT><B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I want to speak specifically to the 
Liberal Democrat amendments Nos. 74, 22, 78 and 83. 
I shall not speak to amendments Nos. 84 and 29, as they 
were earlier drafts which have been superseded by our 
later, superior thoughts.
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Clause 3 places a general duty on best value authorities 
to secure continuous improvement. I am sure that 
authorities are aware of the Minister's avowed strict 
standards in her previous guise as a teacher, and that she 
believes that improvement should and could be 
continuous. The clause states that, in exercising their 
functions, best value authorities will be judged against 
the criteria of economy, efficiency and effectiveness the 
three Es so beloved of the Audit Commission, the 
Conservative Government and the hon. Member for Mole 
Valley (Sir P. Beresford).
<P>
Our amendments attempt to persuade the Government 
to move beyond the narrow range of considerations that 
local government and others should have in exercising 
their functions. We want to widen the concerns that 
determine best value beyond that narrow list of three. 
Although two of the considerations in our amendment 
begin with E equality and equity we failed to find 
words beginning with E for sustainability or innovation, 
so we cannot dub our stipulations the seven Es.
<P>
Local government has been in trouble for taking other 
considerations into account when making decisions. 
Indeed, I was a member of a county council that found 
itself in great trouble in court for making a decision 
albeit one that did not involve spending money where it 
was deemed to have taken into account moral rather than 
practical considerations. I shall not, however, strain your 
patience, Mr. Gale, by explaining the famed story of 
Somerset county council and the hunting ban, except to 
say that the courts exposed what seemed to be a 
reasonable decision as one that was outside our powers 
because local government does not have the power of 
general competence.
<P>
When Labour was in opposition it expressed a desire 
and intention to give local authorities the power of general 
competence. The Minister shakes her head. That might be 
news to her and her hon. Friends, but I am sure that many 
Labour Members thought that there was an intention to 
give local authorities the power of general competence. 
There will be widespread dismay outside this place if the 
Minister's head shaking is indicative of the 
Government's attitude.
<P>
The power of general competence would enable local 
government to widen the considerations that it can take 
into account when making a decision, and the amendment, 
in the absence of that power, would widen the 
considerations that could be taken into account in 
determining a best value regime.
<P>
The three Es could be achieved, but there could still be 
unequal access to services, especially if a local authority 
decides to centralise all services in a town 20 miles away 
from rural villages. That decision may make services 
efficient, economic and effective, but it could lead to 
unequal access to those services for people in outlying 
villages because of a lack of transport links, poverty or 
disability. I will not strain the Committee's patience by 
listing all the other reasons that could contribute towards 
unequal access.
<P>
The three Es can be achieved, yet inequalities in service 
delivery may continue. For example, people may not be 
made aware that they are entitled to a service. Social 
exclusion, inequity and unfairness could remain 
unchallenged.
<P>
The Local Government Association and various 
authorities involved in the best value pilot scheme gave a 
briefing in this place on Tuesday. We were told about 
an innovative partnership that four east Sussex authorities 
entered into on council tax billing. Best value in the Bill 
misses the opportunity to write innovation into the list of 
what can be taken into account.
<P>
Moving on to sustainability, in the White Paper, 
Modern Local Government: In touch with the people", 
the Government showed a desire to place an obligation on 
local authorities to pursue sustainable development 
through the duty to promote the economic, social and 
environmental well-being of their areas. Again, that 
welcome policy has disappeared in the churning out of 
the Bill. During the debate on the Regional Development 
Agencies Bill, many people campaigned for the 
Government to place the duty of sustainable development 
at the heart of RDAs' duties and, finally, they were 
successful. I find it difficult to understand how the 
Minister could say, during our debate on clause 1, that 
RDAs should not be subject to best value because they 
were not precepting authorities. The Government 
accepted, during consideration of the Regional 
Development Agencies Bill, that they should have regard 
to sustainable development, although local authorities that 
have spending powers are to be subject to best value and 
should not include sustainable development among their 
most important criteria.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> I have some sympathy with the hon. 
Lady's last point. I must emphasise what I said in the 
debate to which she referred, namely, that the 
Government's proposal will put local authorities at a 
considerable disadvantage compared with RDAs. That is 
the point at issue: local authorities will have burdens and 
responsibilities that RDAs will not. The situation is 
inequitable in the way that the hon. Lady described.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I am surprised that a party that was 
opposed to quangos when it was in opposition should set 
up new quangos across the country that will have 
advantages over elected local authorities. Perhaps being in 
government turns the world topsy-turvy and makes people 
forget their previous beliefs and commitments.
<P>
Why will local authorities and other best value 
authorities not be able to move beyond the Conservative 
concepts of the three Es in the criteria that will be taken 
into account to establish best value?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> This key clause contains the Bill's main 
objective, which I am sure all Committee members share. 
The key elements that are currently in the clause 
continuous improvement, economy, efficiency and 
effectiveness are obviously the most important values 
for any service that is provided for consumers, customers 
or council tax payers. It is notable that we now have a 
governing party the new Labour party which does not 
advertise local authority services as a social employer, as 
a hedge against recession or as the source of other bogus 
economic benefits that could only damage the efficiency 
of local authority services.
<P>
The clause's objectives contain an element of 
motherhood and apple pie. Continuous improvement, 
economy, efficiency and effectiveness are good 
objectives, and we have naturally been assailed with lists 
of other objectives that should be included. Amendments 
Nos. 3, 4, and 5, which we tabled, promote innovation 
and partnering, equity and fairness and sustainable 
development, and I am sure that all Committee members 
agree that any private business or local authority should 
pursue those criteria.
<P>
We shall not press the amendment or any of those 
grouped with it to a vote, but it would be helpful if the 
Minister would explain why some criteria are included 
and others are not. In particular, will equity be protected? 
Is not the Bill as much about innovation, partnering and 
sustainable development as about, for example, giving 
direct labour organisations and direct service 
organisations the opportunity to campaign for the 
maintenance of the in-house provision of services?
<P>
We believe that the objective of sustainable 
development should apply to the United Kingdom 
economy as whole. For example, there is no way that a 
coal-fired power station could be sustainable in its own 
right, but power generation across the United Kingdom 
could involve a more sustainable outlook. It will not be 
possible for some local authority services to be 
sustainable, and it would be absurdly costly to try to 
create internal sustainability for every separate function 
of local authorities. However, it is important to understand 
how that will be tackled under best value. When, at a later stage of the Bill, we discuss how those functions will be consulted on, exercised and enforced, we shall need to 
know why those particular policies have been chosen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> If one is to try to measure every authority 
against an external, objective standard, that standard must 
be simple to understand. There is no point in making it 
too complicated. These are probing amendments, to 
discover what is embraced by those famous three Es. I am 
not in favour of adding a string of other criteria. As is 
usually the case with Liberal Democrat amendments, the 
amendment proposes plugging into the Bill every virtue 
that can be thought of instantaneously.
<P>
I rather like the three Es. We must be hard nosed about 
it; they relate to financial performance. The Minister says 
constantly that no Government can afford to ignore the 
amount that local authorities spend: its role in the national 
economy is too important and value for money is 
essential. No one in Government can afford to take a 
permissive attitude towards local authorities. It is 
therefore inevitable that some of the core criteria will 
relate to value for money.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to probe what is 
meant by efficiency and effectiveness and in particular 
how they will be judged. They must be judged not as 
though the local authority exists simply to serve its own 
internal purposes but on the extent to which services are 
delivered to and benefit people, producing maximum 
effect for minimum resources. I realise that the three Es 
are a well established triptych in assessment, but how will 
criteria such as the Liberal Democrats propose perhaps 
how recipients might judge services be incorporated into 
the three Es?
<P>
<B>Ms Sally Keeble (Northampton, North):</B> I am grateful 
for the opportunity to speak to the amendments, because 
they go to the heart of what the Bill is designed to do. 
They would profoundly damage the operation of best 
value. Amendment No. 74 and those with which it is 
grouped, which, I agree, constitute something of a wish 
list, show a complete lack of understanding of how local 
government operates, of local government's existing 
powers, duties and obligations and of the impact of the 
amendments' best value proposals.
<P>
The amendments that the Liberal Democrats and the 
Conservatives have tabled mention equality and equity. 
I assume that in proposing equity, the Opposition are 
using a word for equality that they consider to be 
respectable. However, both parties miss the point. Local 
government already has obligations under existing 
legislation to have regard to equality matters. For 
example, under the race relations legislation passed under 
the previous Labour Government, local government has 
an obligation to examine the provision of services in 
relation to ethnic minority groups in the area. 
Labour-controlled local authorities used that extensively 
during the Tory years to deal with such matters as letting 
premises to the British National party, for example.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I should be grateful if the hon Lady 
could tell us which legislation protects other 
disadvantaged, excluded or minority groups that local 
authorities can consider when placing contracts, which is 
what we are discussing.
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> The obligations relate to providing services 
and making arrangements that consider the implications 
for race relations. That covered various local ethnic 
minority groups. The previous Labour Government 
provided local authorities with those extremely positive 
powers. However, the Conservatives imposed on local 
government extremely negative equality obligations, such 
as section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988. We, in 
local government, had to ensure that due regard was given 
to equality issues.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Equality and equity will be driven by consultation 
under the best-value proposals. If users and providers of 
services are properly consulted, the pattern of services 
will reflect their needs much more accurately than perhaps 
they do now. I shall give a concrete example. 
Northamptonshire county council, which covers my 
constituency, is one of the pilot best value authorities. In 
particular, it is looking at residential services.
<P>
As any hon. Member who has experience of local 
government most of us have will know, most social 
services directors, most senior managers and most 
councillors on social services committees are men. 
Regrettably, that is even so in Labour councils. Most of 
the decision makers are men. Most of the people who use, 
or provide access to, social services, especially those for 
the elderly, are women. If the users and the front-line 
providers, who are also mostly women most care staff 
are women are consulted properly, a pattern of services 
that has much more regard to equality for women will 
be produced.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> On a point of information to reassure the 
hon. Lady, the chairman of the social services committee 
of North Yorkshire county council is a woman, as is the 
director of social services.
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> That is great for that council, but if one 
looks across the board all the surveys of local government 
show that the pattern that I have mentioned holds in very 
many areas. Real equality is driven by the people who use 
and provide the services. That is why the arrangements in 
the Bill on consultation will be the best guarantee of 
equality in local services.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> I am most interested in the theme that the 
hon. Lady is developing. She has had a distinguished 
career in local government, and I have a career 
altogether less distinguished in local government. I 
should be interested to hear how she would further 
develop her ideas. For example, street cleaning has no 
obvious gender connection. In fact, the overwhelming 
majority of services has no obvious gender connection. Is 
it not a bit of nonsense to talk about local authority service 
being driven by consultation with women? Are we not 
really talking about consulting the people who share 
those services?
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> Yes. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman 
for his intervention because it demonstrates my point 
exactly. Let us consider highways maintenance. 
Northamptonshire county council is running a best-value 
pilot scheme for that service. If any planning and 
decision-making structure in local government is 
dominated by men, it is obviously highways 
maintenance pavement and road repairs. All the surveys 
show that those who use pavements people who do not 
have cars  are overwhelmingly women and the elderly. 
They are most affected by the design and quality of 
pavements. The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon 
mentioned that his wife was on a footpath committee.
<P>
My experience as a councillor was that more elderly 
people injured themselves and even died as a result of 
tripping over paving stones and falling, breaking hips, and 
so on than suffered problems in social services 
accommodation. I am not talking about consulting 
women, but consulting those who use and provide the 
services and finding out what suits them best and what is 
the most effective and efficient way in which to deliver 
those services.

<P>

<B>Mr. Sanders rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> My speech was meant to be brief, but it 
seems to have gone on rather too long.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> The hon. Lady nodded in dissent to the 
concept of the power of general competence as being 
something that Labour politicians fought for in the past. 
We can consult until we are blue in the face but, without 
the power of general competence to act upon what the 
public say, such a process is not real consultation. 
Incidentally, the director and the chair of social services 
in my constituency are both women and very good they 
are, too.
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> That is excellent news. As for my nodding 
in dissent, members of the Committee will know that the 
ability to make decisions in local government and to what 
local councillors want to do depends to a great extent on 
the quality of a legal advice and the way in which the 
resolutions are framed. Several decisions can be made 
within the current framework. Under the Conservative 
Government, Labour-controlled councils as well as 
Liberal Democrat-controlled councils showed their great 
ingenuity in such matters, but were clobbered for doing 
so and abolished.
<P>
I do not agree that a power of general competence is 
necessary, which is one of the reasons why I am opposed 
to the amendment in the name of the hon. Member for 
Torbay (Mr. Sanders). I agree, however, with its 
sentiments; it is a wish list and, if people want to address 
the needs of local communities, provide good services and 
deal with the difficult issues such as equality, it is 
important that powers are carefully focused and used 
properly. The sentiments of sustainability and partnering 
are fine, but they are not appropriate under the Bill as 
they would cast its provisions too wide.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> I am happy to take an intervention, but I 
do not want to extend the debate too much, because I have 
not yet dealt with amendment No. 1.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> The hon. Lady seems to be advancing two 
arguments, one of which is that the services are not 
usually managed by women. However, the number of 
women in local government who chair committees is 
greater in proportion than the number of women who 
serve on councils in general. Secondly, her thesis is based 
on the curious feminist idea that only women can make 
decisions that are appropriate and good for women and 
that only minority groups can make decisions for 
minorities. [Interruption.] Well, the hon. Lady is going 
down a dangerous route. People outside this place would 
certainly not think much of her argument. She would do 
well to concede that good councils make good decisions 
on behalf of all the local community, while bad councils 
make bad decisions.
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> I am not advocating for the sake of it that 
only women should make decisions. I have not particular 
hang up about that, although I wonder sometimes whether 
the Conservative party does. The best way to get real 
value for money and make sure that the services are 
appropriate is for people at the front line to consult those 
who use the services. Decisions are often made several 
tiers away from the front line by people who do not have 
experience and who do not understand what is required.
<P>
For example, a chief executive once told engineers that, 
if they were designing pavements, they should take a 
buggy and push it along the pavements and that they 
should experiment with wheelchairs because, without 
such experience, they would not know about the value
of dropped kerbs and so on. I am talking about 
appropriateness and the degree to which one scrutinises 
what happens. I would defend Labour councils to the hilt, 
but they are not perfect and have things to learn. The 
council that I led provided, at one stage, around 400 
places in residential homes for the elderly. We carried out 
a study of how many of those places were taken up by 
people from ethnic minority groups, of which the borough 
had a large number the answer was one. One place out 
of 400. It was taken by a man of Turkish origin who lived 
in my ward and to my shame, he was completely 
miserable because no one in the home spoke his language, 
he was given inappropriate food and was isolated. That 
would not have come to light unless there had been close 
scrutiny of who was receiving and providing services; it 
would not have been achieved simply by looking at a set 
of Committee papers. That is why issues of equality are 
most powerfully addressed through consultation rather 
than by making up a wish list and imagining that it will 
somehow just be put into practice.
<P>
Amendment No. 1 seems an anodyne amendment but 
is actually a very sneaky one. It would subvert the whole 
purpose of the legislation. It also displays the kind
of short-termism and mean-mindedness that made 
compulsory competitive tendering so inoperable and 
cumbersome and which was such a millstone around the 
necks of many local authorities. The amendment states 
that improvement should be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"measurable in respect of each successive year"	;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I assume that that means that there would be a 
requirement to show some year-on-year improvement. 
I am not sure whether that means financial improvement 
or improvement in quality. If any local authority seriously undertook a best-quality exercise on that basis, it would be doomed to abysmal failure. As I shall explain in more 
detail, neither amendment No. 74 nor amendment No. 1 
would be achievable in a single Europe.
<P>
<B>Mr. Owen Paterson (North Shropshire):</B> I think that
I am right in saying that the Labour council in 
Northamptonshire is increasing council tax by 10 per cent. 
this year. Will the taxpayers there enjoy a 10 per cent. 
improvement in services? What effect will best value have 
on the council tax in two years' time, for example?
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> I am not sure of the exact figure, but that 
council has put the council tax up. [Interruption.] It is not 
just the Government's fault because local authorities make 
many decisions on their own. Some of us who were in 
local government during the Tory period realised that it 
was vital that local government had some independence, 
should stand on its own feet and make its own decisions. 
The issue of autonomy is not relevant to the amendments.
<P>
I shall deal with the practical points relating to 
Northamptonshire county council. Everyone knows that 
residential home schemes are difficult services to run and 
that it is difficult to make changes in that area. One is 
dealing with places that people who are often frail 
might have lived in for 20 years; any change is therefore 
disruptive and emotive. It is extremely unlikely that 
changes resulting in long-term benefits could be made in 
a year and certainly would not be measurable in a year. 
Any measures that showed financial improvements over a 
single year would be short-termism to the nth degree 
the only option would be closure. Changing or adapting a 
service is bound to take more than one year. If a local 
authority were hobbled by amendment No. 1, it would be 
unable to achieve long-term value for the local people.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Caroline Spelman (Meriden) rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> I shall not give way again; I have done so 
a lot and we need to make progress.
<P>
I strongly oppose the amendments because they would 
be counter-productive to the aims of what is an important 
piece of legislation for local authorities of all parties. I am 
sure that the Committee will turn them down. I thought 
that it was worth exploring some of the reasons.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Owen Paterson (North Shropshire):</B> That last 
contribution was astonishing. At our first sitting the 
Minister said that the duty of best value is to the public. 
We should be thinking about them, the people who pay 
the Bills. When I asked the Minister whether 
Northamptonshire council tax payers were getting good 
value for their 10 per cent. she completely ducked the 
question. We went back to the local government 
establishment and all their problems in establishing 
services, ignoring the public who pay these bills. That is 
what our amendments push for. We do not want a waffly, 
bland phrase. We want to know each year what the 
improvements are going to be. The Minister would not 
answer the questions about the value of the council tax or 
the services.
<P>
Over the gates at Delphi are written the words "gnothi 
seauton"	. That means know thyself. We have had much 
talk about the last 18 years. Labour Members should 
consider the state of their own House and their Augean 
stables. [Laughter.] They may laugh but they will not be 
laughing in the next couple of minutes, Mr. Gale, if you 
give me a fair run. I am talking about economy, efficiency 
and effectiveness.




<P>
Let us take Cardiff, the capital of Wales, which had the 
dubious distinction of being the council with the highest 
average council expenses in the country in 1997-98, In 
the last year of the city council, expenses totalled 
£125,000, but in 1997-98, the first year of the single 
authority, expenses rose to £725,000 even though the 
council was enlarged by only two members.
<P>
There is total silence on the Government Benches. 
Labour Members should think about the people and the 
Minister's statement that the duty of best value is to the 
public. The housing direct service organisation in Cardiff 
ran up a deficit of between £1.5 million and £2.5 million 
in 1997-98. At least 60 staff have been affected.
A business plan has been drawn up to deal with this 
inefficiency, and you will be pleased to hear, Mr. Gale, 
that the Conservative group is pretty dubious about this 
and has attacked the maladministration all along.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allen:</B> Dubious, full stop.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have to place on record that 
the Chairman is completely impartial and would take 
neither pleasure nor displeasure from that information.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I fully respect your impartiality,
Mr. Gale. The Whip, however, is not impartial. He mocks 
a deficit of between £1.5 million and £2.5 million in the 
capital of Wales. Seven Labour councillors in Blaenau 
Gwent have been charged with criminal offences relating 
to false expenses. Five were in court in December and 
three are due to go to court in January. They include the 
former leader, the former mayor and the current mayor. 
In all, 26 councillors have been questioned by police and 
more charges are expected.

<P>

<B>Mr. Meale:</B> Would the hon. Gentleman consider 
discussing the accounts for Westminster and some of the 
background details of its activities under previous 
Administrations?
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Every council should be affected by 
clause 3. We are talking about economy, efficiency and 
effectiveness, which we are not seeing in Merthyr Tydfil, 
for example, where the fraud squad is investigating a 
development deal by the former Merthyr Tydfil and 
Mid-Glamorgan councils. A building contractor to the 
Welsh Development Agency has been involved in a 
leisure complex that was not properly tendered. Again the 
Minister laughs. I find this extraordinary. We are talking 
about Labour inaction and Labour failing the people.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are in fact talking about 
amendment No. 74. That was the thesis upon which I was 
operating. While examples are certainly in order, it might 
be helpful if the hon. Gentleman made at least some 
reference to the amendment before us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. I was bringing 
my remarks to a conclusion. Amendment No. 1 would 
improve the chances of bringing economy, efficiency and 
effectiveness to the taxpayers of Wales. It is regrettable 
that the Under-Secretary of State for Wales is not here to 
reply in person, but I should like the Minister to tell us 
how she thinks this will work in practice. She laughs and 
utters bland phrases, but, like my hon. Friend the Member 
for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble), I think that when 
the Minister is confronted with hard facts, she will duck 
them. Will she take up that challenge?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> I shall address a few brief remarks 
specifically to amendment No. 1. I want to pick up a point 
made earlier about the importance of being able to 
compare year-by-year improvements in a local authority. 
I speak from the perspective of someone who has a 
genuine commitment to local government and local 
democracy. Experience has taught us that the ability to 
compare an organisation on a year-by-year basis is 
considerably more valuable than comparability across the 
whole country, and I question the usefulness of that. 
I make a non-partisan point; the theme I describe has run 
through debates about local government since the war. 
The notion that we need to compare authorities with 
widely different electorates, topography and so on is 
nonsense. But the ability to compare an authority against 
its own record, and to deliver targets which are 
measurable in that respect, is critical. It is much more 
valuable than comparing Lincolnshire with Manchester, 
which is of dubious benefit.
<P>
I reject per se the notion of a uniform set of targets 
which is implicit in the Bill. It is worsened by the fact that 
the Bill does not specifically suggest that the measurables 
which allow us to make that year-on-year comparison 
should be defined. On that basis, I strongly disagree with 
the hon. Member for Northampton, North, although I 
know that she, too has a genuine commitment to local 
democracy. The comparison proposed in the amendment 
will deliver a much better service to local people than the 
hon. Lady's suggestion.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I, too, speak in support of amendment 
No. 1, which would give force to the concept of the 
clause: that there should be continuous improvement. It is 
difficult to understand how that could be achieved without 
the force of the time 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is in order for hon. Members 
to leave the Committee Room, and to return, but the 
custom in Committee and in the Chamber is that Members 
entering and leaving do not walk between the Chair and 
the Member speaking.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale.
<P>
To reiterate, the amendment would give force to the 
Government's intention to achieve continuous 
improvement and thus improve the clause. It is difficult 
to see how that could be achieved without the annual 
dimension proposed in the amendment. My concern about 
the objections to the amendment is whether a process of 
consultation, though good on one level, will be an 
adequate driver to achieve the stated aims.
<P>
I return briefly to the points made by the hon. Member 
for Northampton, North, about consulting the service 
users. Although I have no personal experience of it, an 
interesting example of a pilot scheme for best value is that 
of Carrick district council, a small rural authority. It asked 
housing tenants whether they were satisfied with the 
service and made comparisons with a housing association. 
However, as we know from our work as Members of 
Parliament, the problem about such consultation as a 
driver for continuous improvement is that the vast 
majority of tenants would probably say that their 
experience of the service was good because they had little 
or no experience of another provider. The one or two 
exceptions the gentleman of Turkish origin in the 
constituency of the hon. Member for Northampton, North, 
for example might turn up at Members' surgeries to 
draw our attention to problems in the provision of such 
services.
<P>
That is just one example. My concern is that the 
consultation process gives the same value as the 
competitive tendering process, particularly in a 
geographical dimension. For example, we might ask local 
authority service users about their experience of that 
service in order to drive continuous improvements. They 
might, however, be unaware that the service is better 
across the geographical divide because they know only 
the local authority area. Even we, as Members of 
Parliament encourage them to seek improvements to 
justify their housing situation, for example, within their 
local authority area. Their experience of service provision 
is, therefore, constrained in a way that competitive 
tendering was not because it crossed geographical 
boundaries.
<P>
I feel strongly about the need to improve the clause by 
providing the time dimension. In that way service users 
can be assured that the quality of the services that they 
use gets better year on year.
<P>
<B>Mr. Armstrong:</B> We have had an interesting debate, 
much of which was wide ranging. In many senses, I have 
been dealing with the issue for four years. I have a good 
feel for what best value is about and for how I see it 
developing. I realise that many hon. Members are coming 
to the issue fairly new.
<P>
The clause deals with the duty of best value and the 
way in which it is defined through economy, efficiency 
and effectiveness. It will be delivered in a series of ways 
and will not depend solely on consultation. Any public 
service is, however, a public service it is a service to the 
public, whoever delivers it. Regardless of whether a 
private sector company, a private-public sector 
partnership, or a voluntary agency has the contract, that 
organisation is delivering a public service. The public 
ought to be part of the manner in which that service is 
defined and those responsible are held to account.
<P>
Many of the items that the hon. Member for Meriden 
(Mrs. Spelman) in particular mentioned are integral to the 
evaluation of best value and the comparison of 
performances year on year. I have already said in 
Committee and on the Floor of the House that the 
Government will seek continuous improvements year on 
year. We will do that through best value performance 
plans, which we will consider under clause 6.
<P>
I am trying to encourage hon. Members to accept that 
we will deal with many of the issues that they have raised 
in subsequent parts of the Bill. That is not a way of 
avoiding dealing with them now, but of reaffirming that 
in many senses I agree with the right hon. Member for 
Skipton and Ripon that the Bill has to be kept tight and 
clear. The more we seek to amend it and to add different 
concepts, the more diffuse it will be. People will say "We 
are doing that bit and that bit,"	 but they will not 
understand what the whole thing is about.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I just want to make some progress. 
I will then, of course, take interventions.
<P>
Best value is about delivering quality services at 
acceptable costs to those who use and pay for them. It is 
essential that authorities focus principally on service 
outputs and service outcomes to enable local people and 
those responsible for audit and inspection to assess real 
performance and achievement. That is why we have 
defined best value int he way that we have, backed by 
a set of national performance indicators giving effect to 
economy, efficiency and effectiveness. Those indicators 
will not be drawn narrowly. For example, we are looking 
at indicators under the effectiveness banner that reflect 
fair access to services that is equity, by any other name.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Those will be the key indicators against which best 
value will be assessed, but they will not be the only ones. 
That is an issue on which we have heard some interesting 
differences from Opposition Members this morning. The 
Government believe that there is a relationship between 
national and local government. The Bill expresses the 
nature of national Government's responsibilities and the 
national interest in local government.
<P>
However, we do not believe that it is the responsibility 
of national Government to define everything that local 
government should do and to legislate for that. That is 
why we argue for flexibility and why, as part of best 
value, indicators will be developed in line with local 
authorities' own ideas and consultations. They will 
develop their indicators to reflect the views and priorities 
of local people. That is a dual track approach. The Bill 
seeks carefully to define national Government's interest 
in local government and the national responsibility for 
protecting council tax payers. It also recognises that much 
must be generated locally, and that is why we look for the 
flexibility that some Opposition Members have criticised.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am due to give way first to the hon. 
Member for North Essex.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I should like to pick up some of the points 
that were made by my hon. Friend's about amendment 
No. 1, which is perhaps the most important amendment 
in the group. The Bill places no fundamental duty on local 
authorities to measure their own performance. That 
derives from outside the Secretary of State will specify 
targets and performance indicators. Alongside the duties 
of efficiency and economy, a duty should be created to 
measure the continuous improvement which the hon. 
Lady and I share as an objective.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I often think that I must be talking a 
different language. I have just said that clause 6 deals with 
that through local performance plans. I am sure that we 
shall debate the issue at some length when we reach 
clause 6.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> The Minister said that the Bill
refers to economy, efficiency and effectiveness. Local 
authorities will therefore rightly interpret that to mean that 
those are the most important criteria in the Government's 
eyes. Given that the Bill gives the Secretary of State many 
powers to control and influence local authorities, they will 
put those criteria at the top of any list that they draw up 
when considering best value. Because equity, equality and 
sustainability are not on the list of priorities, local 
authorities will assume that they are not the Government's 
priorities and that they do not, therefore, need to take them 
into account.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am becoming convinced that
I should make my speech and allow interventions at the 
end, because I was coming to the hon. Lady's point. We 
fully accept that quality services are more likely to be 
delivered efficiently and effectively if some of the aspects 
to which hon. Members have referred are reflected in the 
ways that services are delivered and developed. Changing 
the clause would mean creating a list so long that it would 
not be as clear and tight as is necessary for people to 
know what is expected of them. We accept that if people 
employed to deliver services are treated fairly and 
considerately and are well motivated and giving their best, 
the services are more likely to be efficient and effective. 
Our fair employment agenda recognises that. Hon. 
Members will know that the Bill dealing with that matter 
is published today.
<P>
Apart from introducing new fair employment 
legislation, the Government are seeking to amend the 
Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) 
Regulations 1981 to provide greater certainty for 
employers and employees alike. We are considering the 
scope for enabling local government employees to stay in 
the local government pension scheme when their work is 
transferred to the private sector. That demonstrates our 
determination to make employees a part of ensuring best 
value by involving them in its efficient, economic and 
effective application.
<P>
Similarly, we are working on race relations and equal 
opportunities. Of course, those issues are important in 
their own right, as well as in ensuring better local services. 
For example, we agree that the Government and public 
bodies generally should take a positive lead in setting key 
targets for developing all their staff and in considering 
policies' impact on the people affected. We have done 
that in central Government, and we continue to challenge 
ourselves on the matter. We take the same view of it in 
the public sector generally. We shall introduce statutory 
guidance to ensure that authorities fully consider the 
impact of all options when reviewing their services. We 
will encourage them to do so. As we make further 
progress in tackling social exclusion, new ideas and 
developments will need to be taken on board.
<P>
The Government have also made clear their 
commitment to sustainable development. Our White 
Paper on local government confirmed our manifesto 
commitment to place a new duty on local authorities to 
promote the social, economic and environmental 
well-being of their areas. That fulfils the Labour party's 
commitment before it was in government, and our 
manifesto commitment to the development of a power of 
community initiative rather than a power of general 
competence, a matter that was mentioned earlier. On 
another occasion, I may debate the precise meaning of a 
power of general competence with the hon. Member for 
Taunton. Most people do not know what it means, and 
said in research carried out before the election that a 
power of general competence was nonsense, which could 
not mean anything.
<P>
The Government want to ensure that local authorities 
play an active role as leaders of their communities. The 
new duty will place sustainable development at the centre 
of community planning. The principles of sustainable 
development will underpin authorities' policies, not just 
in relation to the services that they deliver but also to the 
activities that they undertake in partnership with others. 
Local authorities are already drawing up strategies under 
local Agenda 21 that give effect to sustainable 
development principles. We have published new quality 
of life indicators that can be fashioned for local 
government.
<P>
The Government have policies and plans to legislate 
that will promoted sustainable development and equal 
opportunities. The prime focus of the best value 
legislation is to secure real improvements to the services 
on which local people depend. We do not want to dilute 
that focus, and we will issue guidance under the best value 
provisions, which ensure that local authorities link the 
implementation of best value with wider issues such as 
sustainability and equal opportunities.
<P>
The Bill already makes adequate provision for 
approaches to service delivery based on innovation by 
requiring authorities to challenge both the manner in 
which they exercise functions and the level at which they 
do so. Those requirements are set out in clause 5, which 
deals with fundamental performance reviews.
<P>
Opposition Members are somewhat confused in 
wanting to put innovation in the middle of that. I see 
innovation as an important part of best value, but it does 
not mean that one must think up a new way of doing 
something every year. When the hon. Member for Mole 
Valley discussed waste disposal in relation to a previous 
clause, he seemed to argue that we should leave well 
alone and not encourage more inquiring views about 
innovations in that area, but I am sure that
I misconstrued him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I should just like to deal with the other 
aspect of the amendment: partnering. Clause 5 also takes 
account of that, because it caters for a partnership 
approach to service delivery by requiring best value 
authorities to consult with other best value authorities and 
external bodies about the manner in which they exercise 
their functions. That consultation will, in practice, involve 
a consideration of new ways of providing services and an 
explicit consideration of the contribution that can be made 
by other service providers outside the best value authority.
<P>
In other words, the issues that the amendment raises are 
covered elsewhere in the Bill. We want to restrict clause 3 
to the three Es.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for giving 
full responses.
<P>
We have stumbled on an interesting difference between 
Conservative Members and the Minister. When we table 
an amendment that talks about partnering, we intend that 
local authorities should seek partners outside the usual 
circle of local authorities. There is great scope for 
bringing in private capital and thus enhancing services as 
a result of partnering.
<P>
With regard to innovation, the reason why 
private-sector businesses are generally so much more 
efficient than the state is that there is constant innovation. 
People get up every morning and think of new ideas and 
new ways of doing the same things more efficiently. They 
are constantly testing the way in which they deliver their 
particular services or manufacture their products. That is 
not the culture of local authorities. The reason for 
stressing innovation as a core duty is to try and inculcate 
it along with the spirit of best value into the culture of 
local authorities. Competitive tendering certainly 
succeeded in getting many local authorities to innovate.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman has 
probably been in the House too long. He is not aware of 
the exceptionally good partnerships that are now being 
developed in local authorities, which I am anxious to 
support, extend and develop.
<P>
Had the hon. Gentleman talked regularly and 
effectively to the private sector, he would know why it 
welcomes the measure. It is not because the Government 
have the relationship with the private sector that he 
seemed to imply it does not go along with us just 
because we employ threats. We do not want that. We want 
an open relationship. The private sector says clearly that 
it wants a framework in which effective partnerships can 
take place. It does not want to be constrained by the old 
dogma of CCT, which meant limited-length contracts and 
constant hostility to the public sector with which it was 
dealing. That has not led to the innovation and the 
commitment to long-term investment that the private 
sector believes will bring better quality service and better 
effectiveness, with effective partnerships. Part of the 
Bill's purpose is to facilitate that in ways that CCT simply 
failed to do. What I said was not simply that authorities 
would have discussions with the authority next door 
although I would like to see that happen, too but that 
they will consider the range of providers and work out 
what will deliver best value for local people, those whom 
they seek to serve, rather than the council.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Hon. Members must begin to open their minds to grasp 
a concept that is very far from that developed by CCT. 
The approach is challenging and flexible; it is in keeping 
with the basic principles of best value, and avoids 
prescribing a single approach which all best value 
authorities must follow. Of course it involves innovation; 
of course it involves partnering, but it demands 
challenging and taxing discussions and deliberations by 
councils, because there will be checks on them that there 
never were before.

<P>

<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I may be getting old and let me address 
this remark to my Front Bench as well but when I go 
home, I do not go "wifeing"	. When my wife got married, 
she did not go "husbanding"	. Please can we say "creating 
partnerships"	 or "building partnerships"	, rather than using 
this silly new jargon. "Partnering"	 sounds like something 
from our recent debate on the age of consent.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I agree with the right hon. Gentleman. 
I could not understand why the word "partnering"	 was in 
the amendment. I do not use the word, although it is in 
the amendment. I refer to effective public and private 
partnerships. I hope that we can introduce more plain 
English into our use of language and also that of 
Parliamentary Counsel but that would give the lawyers 
too difficult a job, would it not?
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members:</B> rose 
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I hope that I have responded to all the 
inquiries of substance from Opposition Members. I was 
concerned for the hon. Member for North Shropshire
(Mr. Paterson), and wondered whether he was facing 
deselection. He seems so interested in talking about Wales 
that I wondered whether he was looking for a Welsh seat. 
However, there was little enlightenment about the Bill in 
his contribution. I could find nothing in it to which
I needed to respond.
<P>
Essentially, we want to ensure that councils consult 
with the public and provide them with the duty of best 
value in the most economic and efficient way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> I did wait to intervene, Mr. Gale, because
I tried earlier, and the hon. Lady said that she would 
accept interventions at the end of her remarks. On her 
specific point about duty to the public, it is inconceivable 
that she should not wish to build into the Bill, as defined 
in amendment No. 1, a consistent and coherent set of 
measurables that can be compared year on year. The 
Minister's response is understandable that the issue is 
dealt with later in the Bill under the provisions dealing 
with performance plans, but there is nothing to guarantee 
that performance plans will be consistent. Even within the 
same authority, those plans may vary and make it 
impossible for electors to make a proper and appropriate 
comparison in terms of the improvement in quality of 
service in their area year by year.
<P>
The hon. Lady talks about partnership with business. 
Some of us have spent a long time in business. If people 
in business were faced with this sort of uniformity of 
national standard and prescription on consultation, they 
would be horrified. The clause is counter productive in 
terms of innovation and flair and entirely unlike most 
people's experience of business.



<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am bewildered by that last 
intervention, as it contained a complete contradiction. 
However, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will enjoy 
dealing with contradictions. We all have to do it and it is 
important that we do.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman said that he wanted to make sure 
that there was no variation between local performance 
plans, so that people could compare their local services 
with those of others year on year. I explained earlier that 
there will be national performance indicators that will 
apply to each service and will therefore enable 
comparisons among authorities. We must recognise that 
Devon is different from Darlington. It is appropriate that 
some service standards should be specific to Darlington 
or to Devon, so that people can reflect the different 
composition of their communities through performance 
indicators specific to their area.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I know that the hon. Member for 
South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) will feel 
concerned about that aspect.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman or one of his hon. Friends made a 
general point about business. I am committed to ensuring 
that the private sector play a full part in the delivery of 
public services, but we must all recognise, whether we 
are in the private, the public or the voluntary sector, that, 
because of our responsibilities to the public, our 
accountability is greater than that of private companies, 
who are accountable only to their shareholders. The public 
pay for those services and they have a right to greater 
openness and accountability than that experienced by the 
private sector. We have a responsibility to help ensure 
that consultations are carried out properly. I know that 
many private sector companies are considering this matter 
carefully and are keen to become involved, because they 
believe that there may be spin-offs from it and lessons 
that they can use in other aspects of their business.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I have almost concluded my remarks. 
This approach 
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I shall give way once, because I have 
not given way to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I thank the Minister. Her remarks show 
utter contempt for the people who pay taxes in south 
Wales. If she wants, I can give her some examples much 
closer to home. She has not mentioned any specifics in 
her reply. I shall give the Committee one specific index, 
which is utterly transparent: that is the number of court 
cases where members of Labour councils are convicted. 
If one takes an index of 100 for 1999 when best value is 
introduced, what does the Minister think the year-on-year 
reduction in court cases will be?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The Government have a commitment 
on a range of local government issues which the hon. 
Gentleman's Government were never prepared to 
implement. If he wants to talk about standards and probity 
in local government, he must look at the mote in the 
previous Government's eye. He should read what Lord 
Nolan said on probity in local government and accept that 
the majority of those in local government are giving good 
and valuable service to the public, without the sort of 
remuneration that he and I can rely on as public 
representives.
<P>
The Government will introduce, through a draft Bill 
to be published soon, a new code of conduct and ethical 
standards, which I hope the hon. Gentleman and his 
hon. Friends will support. We begged the previous 
Government to be much clearer with public servants at 
the local level about what was and what was not 
allowable behaviour, but it suited their political ends to 
do nothing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way on a matter 
relevant to the Bill?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I will indeed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> Will the Minister explain further the 
Devon-Darlington point? If the people of Devon, for 
example, decided through the consultation programme on 
a different set of priorities for their services from those of 
the people of Darlington which is likely what powers 
will the Bill give them to express that?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman did not 
hear what I said. A balance is needed between national 
and local standards, and I do not baulk at that fact. Every 
child in the country has the right to a basic education, 
which happens to be delivered through local services 
although it is important that the national interest is 
reflected locally. We need to maintain national 
performance indicators about the basic services that are 
provided locally. Other services or other aspects of a 
service may not have that same structure, but they need 
to reflect local diffentiation. Consultations with the public 
in a locality will reflect, through the local performance 
plan, national standards and local differences.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr Haynes:</B> The Minister accused me of 
contradicting myself.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Minister is not giving way.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> With respect, the hon. Gentleman did 
not raise that matter earlier. I made it clear that I was 
winding up and while I was doing so I responded to a 
specific point raised by the hon. Member for Torbay. 
I have been generous in giving way.
<P>
Our approach is challenging and flexible and it is in 
keeping with the best principles of best value. It avoids 
prescribing a single approach for all best value authorities. 
I am satisfied that our approach deals with all the issues 
that are raised by the amendment and those grouped with 
it, and I hope that the Opposition will withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I shall be brief, because we have had 
a long canter round this course.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex said that the three 
Es were the most important criteria for service users and 
council tax payers, and the right hon. Member for Skipton 
and Ripon admitted that the three Es basically involved 
financial performance. In his speech, the hon. Gentleman 
did not show a strong commitment to the other criteria 
that are mentioned in the Conservative amendments. He 
made no arguments that I heard in favour of equity, and he 
made no reference at all to environmental sustainability. 
However, the fact that Conservative Members tabled 
amendments about those criteria is a reason to assume that 
they think that those criteria are important.
<P>
The hon. Member for Northampton, North explained 
very well why equity and equality are important to the 
public, who do not take the narrow view that all that 
matters is the size of the bill that they face in their council 
tax demands. They take the wider view that equality of 
access is important and that there should be equity in the 
delivery of services.
<P>
These days, many people accept that a higher, 
short-term economic cost may be needed to deliver 
longer-term environmental sustainability they are
not aware only of costs. One of the criticisms that
many of us on the centre, left or left-of-centre of British 
politics had of the Thatcher years was that
Mrs. Thatcher understood the cost of everything but the 
value of nothing. I hope that the Government appreciate 
the cost is not the only or even necessarily the most 
important element in the delivery of local services. 
People do not just pay the bills they use the services, 
live in the local area and enjoy or are subject to the 
environment. Best value should be about much more 
than cost or financial performance.
<P>
The Minister said that effectiveness will include equity 
and access and that she does not want to clutter up the 
Bill with a list of criteria. But she repeatedly returned to 
the three Es as being key criteria, and that is what local 
authorities will take into account. The Bill gives extra 
powers to the Secretary of State to determine what local 
authorities should do. They will have to have regard to 
the fact that this Government, like its predecessor, think 
that economy, efficiency and effectiveness are more 
important than equity, environmental sustainability or the 
other criteria listed in our amendment.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We will not be pushing the amendments to a vote today 
because we intend to return to them on Report. I beg to 
ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> No.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 115, in 
page 3, line 6, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"provided that such arrangements shall not create a competitive 
disadvantage by applying dissimilar conditions to equivalent 
transactions or impose supplementary obligations which, by their 
nature or according to ordinary usage, have no connection with 
such arrangements"	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This important clarifying amendment has a bearing on 
the previous debate. It is becoming apparent that there is 
scope in the Bill for the new Labour party to exercise 
a refreshing intolerance of the cronyism, nepotism and 
corruption that we have seen in so many Labour local 
authorities. We periodically hear the name of one 
Conservative local authority that got into difficulties, but 
we have a list of 114 Labour local authorities that are 
involved in sleaze of one kind or another. As I said on 
Second Reading, if the Bill reaches the dusty, dark and 
dingy corners of those Labour local authorities that 
compulsory competitive tendering failed to reach, the 
Government will find us behind their efforts to clean up 
their own backyard.
<P>
One of our concerns about the Bill relates to the ability 
of local authorities to set particular terms and conditions 
that exclude some parties from tendering for particular 
contracts, which was also a failure of compulsory 
competitive tendering. That ability has allowed local 
authorities to hang on to many relative inefficient direct 
service organisations and direct labour organisations. 
Although many local authorities have clung to their DSOs 
and DLOs by making them more effective and 
competitive, many have found an excuse to keep their 
uncompetitive, unattractive and expensive practices, 
which serve no one, least of all the people who are 
dependent on and pay for those services.
<P>
The amendment would insert the proviso
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"that such arrangements shall not create a competitive disadvantage 
by applying dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions or 
impose supplementary obligations which by their nature or 
according to ordinary usage, have no connection with such 
arrangements."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the law of the land and would apply to the Bill 
whether it is included or not. The words are based on 
those used in article 85 of the treaty on the European 
Union which determines rules on competition. When the 
rules on competition in that treaty were first applied, it 
was generally thought that they applied to trade and 
relations between member states, not within member 
states. But it has gradually become accepted that the 
provisions apply to transactions within member states. 
Article 85 prohibits, as being incompatible with the 
common market, practices
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or 
distortion of competition within the common market".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Technically, even the transactions between and, 
indeed, within local authorities are covered by those 
provisions. In particular, article 86 (1)(d) and (e) makes 
clear that it is prohibited to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"apply dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other 
trading parties, thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"make the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other 
parties of supplementary obligations which, by their nature or 
according to commercial usage, have no connection with the subject 
of such contracts".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the Bill did not contain clause 17, the amendment might 
not be necessary. However, clause 17 will enable the 
Secretary of State to allow distortions in the provision of 
contracts and services by local authorities. We want to put 
the provision of competition and free and fair contracting 
at the heart of the Bill because those principles are crucial 
to the objectives of best value.
<P>
Perhaps a hidden objective of the Bill is to do away 
with the culture of contracting. The Bill should instead 
ensure that that culture remains as strong as it was under 
competitive tendering. The amendment has been framed 
in a manner acceptable to the Minister, in that it does 
not impose competitive tendering. She will admit that the 
explanation of the operation of competitive tendering and 
open competition under the Bill is unclear. The 
amendment would help to ensure that council contracts 
are allocated on a fair and open basis, and in accordance 
with European Community law.
<P>
I am aware that we have potentially reached a legs and 
no legs situation typical to lawyers' negotiations. One 
lawyer asks, "What happens if my client loses his legs?"	 
The other replies, "He's not going to lose his legs."	, so 
the first lawyer says, "Well, you can put that provision in 
the contract."	
<P>
This is a fail-safe amendment that would ensure that 
local authorities understand their obligations. When local 
authorities contract out for services, the contracts should 
be open and fair and should not include extraneous 
matters that, it must be said, competitive tendering has 
failed to eliminate. We want to ensure that one of the 
Bill's objectives is to eliminate those abuses as a matter 
of United Kingdom law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for North 
Essex has introduced a definition of leglessness of which 
I was unaware. I am grateful for his erudition.
<P>
I wish to ask a question that the amendment poses, and 
which is central to the Bill. One of the Bill's principles 
is the establishment of universal criteria that enable the 
objective judgment of local authorities. At the same time, 
as the Minister said, account must be taken of the 
circumstances of individual councils. The circumstances 
applying to an education authority in, say Hackney, 
Tower Hamlets or the inner city are bound to differ from 
those applying to one of the shire counties.
<P>
The Secretary of State has heavy powers of 
intervention. He may decide that, in a particular case, the 
process which is an internal one, subject to external 
surveillance is not being carried out effectively, or is not 
yielding the required results. In such a case, and given 
that local authorities themselves have significant powers of initiation, it is important that the outcome of the process is at least equivalent. In other words, if a local 
authority tests itself, it must not be allowed to acquit itself 
on criteria that are less stringent than those applied to a 
different local authority. That makes the judgment as to 
how that is made in relation to the local authority's 
tasks dealing with clientele and citizenship resources, 
the application of council tax bands and so forth so 
important.
<P>
This amendment, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member 
for North Essex and myself, is intended to tease out 
exactly how that equivalence of judgment among local 
authorities will be secured, and to ensure that, when the 
Secretary of State is considering whether to use his 
powers, we and the local authority can have confidence 
that an intervention in Hackney can rest on the same 
basis regarding the particular anatomical features 
mentioned by my hon. Friend as an intervention in north 
Yorkshire or County Durham. I would be grateful if the 
Minister would clarify, to alleviate any anxieties, 
precisely how it will work. The process must be fair and 
must be seen to be fair. Authorities must be treated 
equivalently in relation to their tasks.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am pleased that our assumptions 
about the meaning of the amendment not immediately 
clear when we read it have been borne out by the hon. 
Member for North Essex. The amendment would impose 
constraints on the way in which best value authorities 
approach the task of complying with the general duty of 
best value. It would do so by obliging authorities to avoid 
the creation of competitive disadvantage by virtue of 
treating similar transactions in different ways, or not 
imposing supplementary obligations that have no direct 
connection with the arrangements being put in place.
<P>
I understand that hon. Members wish to be assured that 
best value will be played out on a level playing field. 
That was the point behind the comments of the right hon. 
Member for Skipton and Ripon. I found it rather amusing 
to be regaled by the hon. Member for North Essex with 
European law and the importance of abiding by it. I can 
assure him that I have no problem with that. The 
Government recognise that what is in the treaty must 
govern competition in the public sector at local 
government level. I was indeed pleased to hear the hon. 
Member for North Essex reading tracts from European 
documents the last thing I expected. he may be 
beginning to shift his views on what lessons can be learnt 
closer to those of the right hon. Member for Skipton and 
Ripon. However, I must not indulge myself any more on 
that matter.
<P>
Agreeing to the amendment would be a retrograde step 
for both practical and policy reasons. It is important that 
potential contributors to service delivery outside the 
public sector should not be discouraged from playing a 
role by artificial means. We are determined that that will 
not happen.
<P>
In practical terms, however, it would render the 
wording of the general duty of best value, which is the 
building block on which much else is founded, both 
opaque and extremely convoluted. I am sure that that was 
not hon. Members' intention. We have set much store by 
the need for transparency in the way that best value authorities conduct their affairs. The way in which we set out their legal obligations upon which they will be judged 
needs to be equally clear.
<P>
In policy terms, I must resist the amendment as it fails 
to take account of the key features of the duty of best 
value that appear elsewhere in the Bill. I share hon. 
Members' desire to ensure that best value authorities are 
truly competitive. That is why clause 5, which deals with 
fundamental reviews, specifically requires authorities to 
assess their competitiveness against both their peers and 
a range of external organisations. It also requires them to 
consult with other players bout the way in which their functions are carried out. Hon Members will not need to be reminded that the review cycle is intended to be a 
five-yearly one, which will ensure that authorities 
re-examine their assumptions about services and how they 
are delivered on a regular basis. That again adds 
competitive rigour to the framework.
<P>
The requirements of clause 5 will also be backed up 
by the performance measurement framework that we are 
putting in place under clause 4. All best value authorities 
will know that over a five-year period
