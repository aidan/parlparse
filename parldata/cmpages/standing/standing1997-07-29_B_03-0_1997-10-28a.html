<H4><center>Use of Information</center></H4>
<P>
Amendment proposed [this day]: No. 113, in page 2, line 25, leave out `social security'.--[Mr. Rendel.]
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking amendment No. 114, in page 2, line 29, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(2A) The Secretary of State shall as appropriate use any information to which subsection (2) applies to revise or supersede a decision on an award of a relevant benefit under section 10 or 11.
<P>
 (2B) If it appears to the Secretary of State that, on the basis of information to which subsection (2) applies, a person who has not made a claim for a relevant benefit may be entitled to such a benefit he shall inform him of that fact.
<P>
 (2C) Where the Secretary of State is in possession of information to which subsection (2) applies and which should have alerted him to the fact that a person might be entitled to claim a relevant benefit but he failed to discharge his duty under subsection (2B) and that person subsequently makes a claim for the benefit concerned which is determined in his favour, he shall be entitled to payment of the benefit from the time when the information came into the possession of the Secretary of State, provided that he would have been entitled from that time but for the requirement of section 1(1)(a) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 (claim necessary for entitlement).
<P>
 (2D) ``Relevant benefit'' shall have the same meaning for the purposes of this section as for section 9.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Keith Bradley):</B> Before the break, I was explaining that the Government are firmly committed to helping people who are most in need, especially pensioners who do not claim the income suport to which they are entitled. The hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) referred to that problem, and he may be aware that we are commissioning research that will help us to understand the complex reasons why pensioners do not take up their entitlement.
<P>
The research findings, which should be available next year, will show us how best to reach out to pensioners. We have made a firm commitment to examine the means of delivery and consider whether a more automatic system of help for the poorest pensioners is necessary. We shall then consider what further steps are needed.
<P>
As to the point made by the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) about clause 3(2)(a), the words are there essentially to ensure that nothing connected with the administration of social security, child suport or war pensions is not otherwise covered by the powers in the clause. The subsection will help us to ensure that all services are provided more efficiently, and that the Department is run as effectively as possible.
<P>
In certain instances, the Department's activities might be regarded as connected with the exercise of its functions, as when fines imposed by the criminal courts are deducted from benefit payments. Such deductions are governed by the Fines (Deduction from Income Support) Regulations 1992--S.I. 1992/2182--made under powers conferred by sections 24 and 30 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991. The fines themselves do not fall within the Department's functions, but their deduction from benefit payments is clearly connected with its functions. That is the purpose of this part of the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Rendel </B>(Newbury): Is the Minister saying that that is the only instance of such a connection that the clause covers, or are there others?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> That was an example, but there are other circumstances in which the Department's activities might be regarded as connected with the exercise of its functions. For example, if someone has received social security benefits for a particular period and then receives an industrial tribunal award, the Department may be entitled to recover payments from that award.
<P>
A further example would involve a person who has been overpaid certain benefits, perhaps because he or she has failed to declare a change in circumstances. If that person is working and therefore no longer claiming, the Department may wish to recover the overpayments directly from wages.
<P>
We expect, however, that in most circumstances the general wording of the clause providing for the use of information for the purposes of the exercise of functions related to social security will be sufficient. In the examples that I have given, the connection must be made for the efficient administration of the Department.
<P>
The amendments would not provide the best way of tackling the problem of helping those who are most in need. They would place a huge administrative burden on the Department by forcing it repeatedly to check all the information held on every person in the country with a record on the social security or national insurance system.
<P>
I hope that my assurances and the explanation of the operation of the clause will allow the hon. Member for Newbury to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his response. He has reassured me to some extent about the way in which the clause has been drafted. Some Committee members have been confused--perhaps not surprisingly--about the way in which the amendment was drafted. I apologise if the drafting is inadequate. The Minister indicated that the amendment would not achieve what I intended, but I hope that he understands why we think that our proposals would improve the Bill.
<P>
I should have liked the Minister to say that he would adopt the amendment's good aspects and bring them back, with the correct wording, at a later date. The Minister seemed to suggest that his only objection to the amendment's proposed subsection (2B) was that his computers were not yet capable of managing the system that it proposes. I had hoped that he would show more good will towards that proposal.
<P>
The Minister seemed to suggest that he would be pleased to include the proposal in the Bill if his computers were capable of managing it. To some extent that was encouraging, but he gave no hint as to when his computers would have that capability. At the very least, I hoped to have the suggestion included in the Bill as soon as it could be managed technologically, but he Minister does not seem willing to take that line at present.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> For the benefit of members of the public listening to the debate, I should say that it has been agreed that the Bill will be scrutinised clause by clause, but not in direct numerical sequence. We shall now proceed to clauses 9 to 12.
<H4><center>Clause 9</center></H4>
<H4><center>Decisions by Secretary of State</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 59, in page 5, line 3, after `(c)' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`subject to subsection (4) below.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 62.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The amendments will ensure that, with two exceptions, decisions about class 4 contributions--I was going to say clause IV, but that is not right--will be taken by the Inland Revenue, and will be subject to appeal through the tax commissioners. This simply takes forward the current arrangements for handling class 4 decisions.
<P>
Class 4 contributions are paid by self-employed people at a rate of 6 per cent. on all profits between a lower and upper limit. Assessment of class 4 contributions is the responsibility of the Inland Revenue, and those contributions are collected alongside schedule D tax.
<P>
The amendments will ensure that the tax commissioners still have the sole right to deal with appeals relating to the amount of class 4 contributions. They will ensure, however, that, as now, decisions about the liability to pay class 4 contributions and the deferment of that liability will remain with the Secretary of State.
<P>
The amendments are necessary to carry forward the current arrangements for efficient decisions and appeals on class 4 matters. I commend them to the Committee.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 60, in page 5, line 7, and at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `( ) Where at any time a claim for a relevant benefit is decided by the Secretary of State--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the claim shall not be regarded as subsisting after that time; and<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) accordingly, the claimant shall not (without making a further claim) be entitled to the benefit on the basis of circumstances not obtaining at that time'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment will put it beyond doubt that a claim, once decided under clause 9, will cease to exist as a claim. Such an amendment is necessary because, until recently, it has been understood that once a claim for benefit has been determined, the claim is disposed of and extinguished. It was possible to revise the award, but not to resurrect the claim itself. When the benefit terminated, entitlement could be re-established only if a new claim was made.
<P>
As a result of a recent decision by tribunal commissioners, there is now some doubt about whether that will be achieved by the current legislation. A claim might survive even a nil decision on entitlement, and be resurrected some years later.
<P>
An efficient, modern benefits system must have clarity about the responsibility both of customers and of the Department. Customers must be made aware that unless a claim has been made, there can be no entitlement to benefit. If no entitlement results from an initial claim, or if an award is made but is revised at a later date so that entitlements ends, there can be no further entitlement without a further claim. That is a key benefit provision and the Government are putting it beyond doubt with the amendment. I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>

<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 130, in page 5, line 7, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(1A) The Secretary of State shall make a determination on a claim under paragraph (a) of subsection (1) within 14 days, or such shorter period as he may prescribe, of the claim being made or the provision to him of the evidence necessary to support the claim, whichever is later:<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (1B) Where an applicant for a social fund payment applies for a crisis loan under directions issued by the Secretary of State under section 140 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, the Secretary of State shall make a decision within 24 hours of the application or the provision to him of the evidence necessary to support the application, whichever is later.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (1C) Where an applicant for a social fund payment applies for a community care grant or budgeting loan under directions issued by the Secretary of State under section 140 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, the Secretary of State shall make a decision within 5 days of the application or the provision to him of the evidence necessary to support the application, whichever is later.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would put time limits on decisions about claims. It has always been agreed that in order to provide a just and fair social security benefits system, claims should not only be correctly determined--this morning we discussed the fact that all too many claims are not correctly determined in the first instance--but should be determined as speedily as possible. It is most important that the claims are correctly determined, but a secondary feature of a just and fair system is that claims should be assessed in a timely manner.
<P>
At present, there are various forms of guidance about how quickly decisions on different types of claim should be made. That is right and proper; some claims will inevitably be more urgent than others. The amendment would provide that the Secretary of State is required to ensure that decisions are made without unnecessary delay. That would give claimants an extra chance to ensure that their rights are safeguarded properly, and that if claims are not dealt with speedily, there is some further recourse.
<P>
In proposed subsection (1A), we suggest a general time limit for most claims of 14 days, which is not an especially short period. The length of time needed for such decisions is seldom as much as 14 days if there are adequate staff. Some decisions are not made for 14 days or more, however, because there is a backlog awaiting decision. If our system is to be fair and just, we must ensure that there are enough staff to take decisions on claims within 14 days.
<P>
Proposed subsection (1B) deals with crisis loans, which by their nature demand a much quicker decision than is required for a general benefit claim. The name itself implies that some speed is required. We have suggested, therefore, that the time limit should be 24 hours. That is not out of order for situations in which a person might have to travel somewhere quickly and might not be able to wait for a decision. A crisis might be looming, and that would require a quick decision.
<P>
Proposed subsection (1C) falls between the two earlier subsections in terms of urgency. It relates to community care grants and budgeting loans, for which we suggest a time limit of five days for decisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Burns </B>(West Chelmsford): May I have clarification on proposed subsection (1B)? I see the good intentions behind it. It specifies that a decision must be made within 24 hours of the application or from when the necessary information is provided, but someone who makes an application may also have the necessary information. If the amendment were made, what flexibility would there be in the system to ensure that the Secretary of State did not fall foul of the law? An application with all the necessary information may be received on a Friday afternoon, making it impossible to reach a decision in the remaining hours of that working day.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> If people are in a crisis on a Friday, they do not want to have to wait until the following Monday simply because others are not prepared to work later into the evening. If people are in a crisis--if, for example, they do not have enough money to exist or to buy over the weekend, or if they must travel that day to deal with a family crisis--they will need to act on a Friday evening. The fact that it is a Friday, and thus a weekend, does not make the crisis any less immediate.
<P>
If the amendment were agreed to, a system would need to be established to ensure that the 24-hour deadline was met, even on a Friday evening or at other times when people are not normally at work. That is the nature of crises; if the system is so inflexible or so inhumane that we cannot meet a crisis on a Friday evening, there is something badly at fault with the system. I would certainly wish to keep the deadline in the Bill, despite the point that the hon. Gentleman has just made.
<P>
It might be said that such a provision is not necessary. Indeed, I suspect that that will be more or less the line that the Minister will take. It might be said that guidance is plentiful enough, and that the Secretary of State will be duty bound to do his or her best to follow guidance on what time limts are sensible for such cases. Those of us who have immense trust in the system of government in this country may be happy to go along with that.
<P>
There is however a need for such a provision in the Bill to ensure that the Secretary of State knows precisely what those time limits should be, that they are enforceable and that some redress is possible for a claimant when the time limits are not met.
<P>
Otherwise, if the process is left to guidance, decisions may not be made for considerable periods--as occurs at present--because of a backlog of other decisions to be made, and because the resources necessary to ensure that such decisions are all taken on a timely basis have not been provided. We need, therefore, some provision that gives the claimant some rights, not just guidance for the Secretary of State. It is with that in mind that I would like the amendment to be accepted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I appreciate the reasons for tabling the amendment, but I hope that I can persuade hon. Members that it is not necessary.
<P>
	As the hon. Member for Newbury guessed, we have tried to avoid making specific provision for processes directly involved in deciding claims and appeals. I emphasise the word ``processes''. That includes the time limits within which claims should be decided. It has become apparent that having such matters in primary legislation can simply hamstring the agencies and prevent them from providing service to customers in the most effective way possible.
<P>
	Moreover, we believe that it is most unhelpful to specify matters such as time limits in primary legislation. They are not set in stone, but are subject to constant change as we strive--this is the purpose of the Bill--to improve on the time that people have to wait to receive their entitlement. It goes without saying that, as now, the Secretary of State will set stringent clearance time targets within which claims for benefit should be decided as well as targets for the quality of decisions. As now, those targets will be published and details placed in the Library. The current published target is for social fund crisis loan applications to be processed on the same day. We have no intention of removing such a stringent target because, by definition, people in crisis cannot wait long for essential resources.
<P>
	In many ways the targets cut across the amendment because they are, for a variety of benefits, more stringent than those being proposed. To lay those targets and times in primary legislation would not allow the opportunity to improve. We would always be amending primary legislation to provide for better performance. That is not the best way to deal with the matter. The right way is through regulation, guidance and published targets. Improvement to benefit administration will be brought about by the Bill and by our actions elsewhere in our welfare reform programme. I hope that, following those assurances, the hon. Member for Newbury will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> Clearly, it is helpful to have an assurance from the Minister that he aims to do even better than we propose in the amendment, but I was a little confused to hear him say--I may have misheard him--that including such targets in the Bill would remove any chance for the social security system to improve the time scale in which such decisions are made. Having a deadline should not stop the Department trying to make gradual improvements, perhaps to a time scale much tighter than that which we propose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The Government are saying that once a time scale for the clearance of a benefit claim is put in primary legislation that becomes the legal framework within which we operate. That would be retrograde. We should be flexible and ensure that we take every opportunity, through regulation and guidance, to improve performance. We should not leave inappropriate time scales in primary legislation.
<P>
	While I am on my feet I should also say--we would ensure this through performance monitoring--that staff would always complete crisis loans applied for on a Friday afternoon. In no circumstances would we expect people to be turned away and told to return on a Monday morning. I give that assurance to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am pleased to hear that. The intervention by the hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) was worrying. I am happy that, on this matter at least, my party and the Government agree that crisis loans applied for on a Friday night should be dealt with straight away. I was sorry to hear the Conservatives imply that there might be a case, if they were still in government, for not dealing with such loans straight away.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I fully appreciate that the Liberal Democratic party loves to misinterpret things, and to interpret things to suit its narrow political advantage. The whole purpose of my earlier intervention was even if the hon. gentleman did not have the intelligence to recognise the fact to seek clarification, within the narrow confines of the amendment, as to what would happen if a 24-hour time scale had been set and someone made an application, with all the necessary information, on a Friday afternoon. I was seeking information; I was not suggesting that we agreed or disagreed, or that we had any sinister views about a weekend problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am delighted to find out that we are now all cosy chums together, and that all three parties are apparently in agreement regarding crisis loans on a Friday night. It was worrying that one party might have been taking a contrary view, but it appears that I misunderstood the intervention of the hon. Member for West Chelmsford. I am delighted to hear that he is pledging his party to come into line with us and make sure that all applications for a crisis loan on a Friday night are met.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): On a separate point, may I take this opportunity of registering the disbelief of those on this side of the Committee at the arguments in the previous intervention by the Minister? We understand the principle that one should not restrict in primary legislation the flexibility to enact through secondary legislation or guidance increasingly tough time limits over time. But to enact a limit does not prevent the subsequent enactment of tougher limits. It seems extraordinary that the Minister should, by implication, have been arguing that the setting of limit X prevents the setting of subsequently tougher limits in subsidiary legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> In the spirit of togetherness, I am delighted with that intervention because it made almost precisely the point that I was going to make in response to the Minister. There is obviously a great deal of difference between deadlines in primary legislation and anything that would stop further guidance coming from the Government about shorter time limits at which they intended their people to aim. Those may be targets for improvement, although they are not necessarily in the Bill. A deadline in the Bill would at least give claimants some rights, which they would not have if the deadlines were fixed by guidance.
<P>
It is important to have such deadlines in the Bill. Then, as the intervention by the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) made clear, it would be possible to have tighter and tighter guidance to bring down the time in which decisions were made. I would welcome such a move, as I think would most people in the Room, if it were possible. However, that does not alter our argument about having a deadline in the Bill. It would be a good thing if the Government reconsidered their view on that.
<P>
In the hope that we may have a further chance to argue the point later I am, for the time being, happy to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
However, I hope that the Government will think seriously about what we have said. We seem to have two-party agreement, and perhaps there will be three-party agreement if they reconsider. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 132, in clause 9, page 5, line 7, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(1A) The Secretary of State shall provide an explanation in writing of a decision which he makes under subsection (1) to any person who is directly affected by it (including a claimant for a relevant benefit)<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (1B) For the avoidance of doubt, the explanation provided under subsection (1A) shall be sufficiently full to enable a person affected by it to decide whether to apply for a review under section 10, section 11 or section 38 or make an appeal under section 13.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I seem to be working rather hard at present, but no doubt others will take over in a moment.
<P>
This amendment is rather different: its main aim is to overcome, or help to overcome, a problem that has been mentioned before. At present too many cases, for one reason or another, good or bad, are going to appeal. Proposed new subsection (1A) would require an explanation of the decision in writing. If a decision is given without a full explanation, that in itself poses considerable dangers. We go on in 1(B) to explain why it is important that an explanation be given in writing. The explanation should be clear enough to enable the claimant to decide whether an appeal would be sensible or viable. No claimant would put in his claim if he did not think that it had some validity. If we leave him, therefore, without a good explanation of what is wrong with it, he will almost inevitably feel that he might win his case on appeal. The first point is, therefore, that a good explanation of the reasons and arguments that the Secretary of State has used to turn down the claim will help the claimant to decide whether an appeal would be justified.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government have said, particularly on Second Reading, that part of the point of the Bill is to simplify the process and make sure that stupid appeals, which have no great point to them and which are never likely to succeed, are dealt with more quickly. Rather than dealing with appeals in a way that, on the face of it, might appear rather unfair because it is very speedy--we shall have more to say about that when we talk about the appeals system--how much better it would be if we moved to a system that helped people not to put in the appeals that the Government are trying to avoid. That would be much fairer and more satisfactory from the point of view not only of the Government, who want to reduce the burden of appeals that will never be successful, but of the claimant, who will not have to waste a lot of time on an appeal that has no chance.
<P>
There is a second point about the importance of a clear written explanation as to why the original claim failed. When an appeal is made, it is necessary to show why the original decision was wrong. Obviously, it is difficult for the claimant to explain clearly and carefully why he thinks that the original decision was wrong if he does not even know what arguments lay behind it.
<P>
Our argument is, therefore, in two parts. We want a proper explanation to enable the claimant to know, first, whether to appeal and, secondly, how best to appeal when he puts in the appeal. For those two reasons, the amendment should be made to the Bill, and I hope that the Government will see their way to agreeing with that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> On the grounds of logic and natural justice, the amendment has a great appeal to Conservative Members. As the hon. Member for Newbury said--
<P>
<B>Mr. Kevin Hughes </B>(Doncaster, North): A new alliance?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> A new alliance is the last thing that I want. I do not want to digress too far, Mr. O'Hara, because I know that you will pull me up, but I thought that the new alliance was between the Prime Minister and the Liberal Democrats, who seem to have hopped into bed with each other. Whether the Labour party will swallow up the Liberal Democrats or the Liberal Democrats will seek to take over new Labour remains to be seen. The alliance is, however, between those two parties.
<P>
On the more serious point of amendment No. 132, however, it is only right on the grounds of natural justice that someone whose application for benefit the Secretary of State decides to refuse should be entitled to know exactly why it has been refused. Justice can then be done and be seen to be done and that person can know exactly where he stands and understand why a decision has been taken. Furthermore, as the hon. Member for Newbury said, if someone wants to consider a review under the relevant sections of the Act, he will have the opportunity to decide whether that is a valid course of action.
<P>
However reasonable the amendment might seem, I am sure that the Government will shortly give us the reasons why they cannot accept the amendment. I should be pleasantly surprised if that were not so. However, I hope that the Government have listened carefully to the arguments because the amendment would cause no problems. It would enhance the service provided to the customers of the benefits system because they would know exactly where they stood. Given that those decisions involve claims for benefits, they will directly and acutely affect claimants' lives and could have far-reaching effects on their circumstances, so they should have all the information possible to explain to them why those decisions have been made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> The amendment seeks to include in the Bill a provision that is more appropriate to secondary legislation. As I said on amendment No. 130, in drafting the legislation we have tried to avoid where possible including in the Bill any matter that is directly related to the processes involved in administering claims or appeals.
<P>
I should also point out that the requirement to provide written notification of a decision is currently contained not in primary legislation but in adjudication regulations, and we propose to retain that approach.
<P>
I also assure the Committee that we will specify in regulations that customers must be notified fully and properly of decisions on their claim. Moreover, I fully recognise that if we expect greater responsibility from customers to provide the information that we need to decide their claims, we, too, must do all that we can to ensure that we notify customers in the clearest and most informative way possible.
<P>
In giving customers an explanation of decisions, we will be moving towards a more customer-focused approach, tailoring the way in which we provide the explanation to the needs of the particular customer. We may do that in writing, by telephone or in face-to-face discussions at the local office. We will tailor the type of notification to the needs of the customer. For example, oral communication may be preferable for non-braille-reading blind people. In the longer term, we may also wish to take advantage of new technology in our communications with customers.
<P>
By offering that improved service and at the same time improving the structure and content of our written notices, we will aim to help customers to exercise their choice to seek a revision of a decision from the agency or to pursue an appeal to an independent tribunal.
<P>
I hope that with that assurance the hon. Gentleman will want to withdraw his amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I was sorry to hear the Minister taking the line that he took on the previous amendment, which was that we must avoid including in the Bill any requirements on the Secretary of State to do whatever is possible to help claimants. He seems to be saying that it is important to try to reduce the burden on the Secretary of State, but that he is prepared to leave the burden on the claimants. Claimants are often in a much worse position to argue their case than Secretaries of State, who have all the powers of the civil service behind them.
<P>
We are beginning to notice a lack of good will by the Government towards claimants, which I hope the Minister will not regret, but I fear that he will do so because it shows the poorer members of our society--those who are in the most difficulty--that the Government are not on their side in the way that they had hoped. I regret that, and I think that the Minister may regret it too, but he is obviously unwilling to see a requirement imposed on the Secretary of State. I do not, however, wish to press the point to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I am following the hon. Gentleman's argument carefully, but can he explain why a power through regulation is any different from a power via primary legislation? Surely the Secretary of State is still accountable for that regulation-making power in the same way as he is for primary legislation. If so, how can we possibly be trying to undermine the rights of the individual customer?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's reassurance on that--he feels that the powers are exactly the same. I would have thought that there would be a greater assurance if it were written in the Bill that the Secretary of State would act in that way, but the Minister appears to assure me that that is not necessary. I shall be delighted if that turns out to be the case once the Bill is enacted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Can the hon. Gentleman explain how the provision being in primary legislation as opposed to regulation would give extra powers to the individual, as he suggests?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am not sure what the differences would be, and I hope that the Minister's assurance that the two options are, in effect, exactly the same, will turn out to be true. So long as that is so, I am perfectly happy; I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 61, in page 5, line 20, leave out from second `Act,' to `other' in line 21 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`the Social Security (Consequential Provisions) Act 1992 or the Jobseeker's Act'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a technical amendment to remove the reference to the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act 1997 from provisions in the Bill relating to decision making and appeals. It will also ensure that pensions legislation that has been preserved from before the Social Security Act 1973--in particular, the National Insurance Act 1965--is included in the Bill.
<P>
The Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act 1997 provides for the review of and appeal against certificates of recoverable benefits. We intend to bring those provisions into line with the proposals in the Bill to modernise the review and appeals process. However, the benefit recovery scheme is a special case because it makes compensators liable to repay benefits which have been paid or are likely to be paid in respect of an accident, injury or disease for which they are, or are alleged to be, liable. Consequently, some of the provisions in this chapter of the Bill are not appropriate to that scheme. We have, however, included amendments to the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act 1997 to align the review and appeals process as far as possible with the provisions that apply more generally in schedules 6 and 7.
<P>
On pensions decisions, the amendment will ensure that decisions which the Secretary of State may be required to make about graduated retirement benefit or provisions relating to employers who did not participate in the scheme will be covered by the Bill. It is necessary for such decisions to be included in clause 9 to enable the Secretary of State to continue to make decisions in such cases.
<P>
Now that members of the Committee have had a clear explanation of the amendments, I am sure that they will approve them.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 62, in page 5, line 26, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``(4) Subsection (1)(c) above does not include any decision relating to class 4 contributions other than a decision falling to be made--
<P>
  (a) under subsection (1) of section 17 of the Contributions and Benefits Act as to whether by regulations under the subsection a person is excepted from liability for Class 4 contributions, or his liability is deferred; or
<P>
  (b) under regulations made by virtue of subsections (3) or (4) of that section or section 18 of that Act.'.--[Mr. Keith Bradley.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question proposed, that the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. O'Hara, for allowing me to speak in the clause stand part debate.
<P>
This is an appropriate moment to signal what appears to have been happening until now. Where the Government have sought to make changes relating to process--for example, with their eccentricity towards computers--they find it convenient to and persist in, making changes without allowing amendment.
<P>
In dealing with amendments to clause 9, tabled not by Conservatives but by others who are ostensibly in alliance with the Government, the Government argue that they are not bringing issues of process into the Bill. They do not want to admit any enshrinement in the Bill of particular individual rights. They have even resorted to illogical arguments which would be thrown out by any well-trained teacher at an early stage of primary education--for example, their argument that it would be improper to determine a limit because a more flexible limit could not then be put in place through subsidiary legislation. As the Minister is clearly a person of the highest intelligence, his argument can derive only from his inquietude as to whether the briefs being read to us are truly representative of an appropriate approach to legislation.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is worth signalling at this stage of our debate that, as we move through the Bill, Conservative Members will want to stress the importance of trying to enshrine individual rights. There is little point in considering a Bill in Committee if we are to be told at every stage and on every clause that individual rights cannot be enshrined because issues of process are not be be admitted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I wish to pick up a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset. As highlighted in our debate on amendment No. 132, we have encountered an extraordinary new constitutional theory--that it is better for the nuts-and-bolts workings of an Act to be dealt with through secondary legislation. For the 18 years during which the Conservatives were in government and for many years before that, constitutionalists and even the text books that I remember reading at school when I studied the British constitution have constantly referred to the evils of secondary legislation as an abuse of power by the Government of the day--whichever party was in power. That philosophy was warmly embraced by Labour Members whenever the Conservative Government sought to do anything by means of secondary legislation throughout the 1979-97 period.
<P>
It is clear that consistency often goes out of the window when a party comes into government. However, it is truly extraordinary to hear the Minister's arguments--[Interruption]. I am not making value judgments about the merits of the case. I am pointing out that the Minister has stood up time and again, effectively extolling the virtues and benefits of secondary legislation. He then has the bravery to inform the Committee that there is basically no difference between primary and secondary legislation.
<P>
The Minister is an intelligent man who knows that there is a vast difference between primary and secondary legislation--but let me spell out the difference in case he has had a momentary lapse of memory. Primary legislation involves Committee members spending Tuesdays and Thursdays in a Room similar to that in which we are sitting today, studying a Bill line by line, debating all the amendments and trying to improve the legislation so that it works well, or to defeat it if it is anathema to our beliefs. As the Minister well knows, the vast majority of secondary legislation is not properly scrutinised. Some secondary legislation may be taken on the Floor of the House, but as a proportion of the number of statutory instruments taken in any one year, that is minimal. For the Minister blithely to tell us that this is the best way forward is contrary to what every Opposition spokesman has been telling the country and the House for the last 18 years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Waterson </B>(Eastbourne): Is not the picture even worse that that which my hon. Friend paints? Subject to what happens to amendments to which we shall come shortly, the Bill may be drafted in such a way as to permit the Government to introduce regulations that will be subject not to the affirmative but to the negative resolution procedure. Those regulations will receive very little examination save for that carried out by the Scrutiny Committee, on which the Minister relies heavily but which exists not to control secondary legislation but to scrutinise it in a narrow and limited fashion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Yes, I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend, who rightly draws attention to the fact that unless we can amend the Bill in Committee, all the secondary legislation that flows from it will be subject to the negative procedure. As the Minister well knows--and this is a matter of delight to a Government Whip--nine times out of 10, statutory instruments taken under the negative procedure escape proper scrutiny unless something unusual occurs or pressure is brought to bear to force the Government to provide time to discuss them properly. It is extraordinary that a Minister who was so recently in opposition, and who must have railed against the use of such procedures by the previous Government, can say that there is little, if any, difference between primary and secondary legislation.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have been extremely tolerant, but the hon. Gentleman is ranging over the previous debate and possibly anticipating that on the next clause. He is not directing his remarks closely to the terms of the clause. I ask him henceforth to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am grateful, Mr. O'Hara, for your guidance. I apologise for straying, but the Minister's sheer gall made me get carried away.
<P>
I am disappointed that amendment No. 132, which would have imporved the Bill, has not been accepted, and that the Government think that the relevant information and systems will be in place through guidance and secondary legislation. That view is mistaken and they have missed an opportunity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I shall be brief. We are handling the Bill in such a way as to ensure that matters of principle are set out in primary legislation and that, through flexibility, appropriate measures are introduced in secondary legislation and by means of suitable administrative arrangements. We intend to explain how we shall use each of those arrangements as we go through the Bill. As I said earlier, the Secretary of State will be bound by any legislation, whether it is primary or secondary. I therefore hope that the Committee will agree that clause 9 should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 9, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): I beg to move amendment No. 33, in page 5, line 30, leave out `the prescribed period' and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`7 days or such longer period as may be prescribed'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 120, in page 5, line 30, after `period', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`which may not be less than three months.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I assume that the clause is designed to stop what I would call the ping pong between the different layers or principalities of social security administration and to save costs. However, it gives appallingly wide powers to the Secretary of State--indeed, the whole Bill depends on the Secretary of State having extraordinarily wide powers.
<P>
The key issue relates to the prescribed periods and circumstances in which the Secretary of State can use such wide powers. The amendment would prescribe the period as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``7 days or such longer period as may be prescribed'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
while the amendment tabled by the Liberal Democrats refers to a period of three months. Clearly, some period must be prescribed because it would be unreasonable for claimants to have to adhere to time limits while Ministers have no time limits within which to overrule benefit claims. The question of which is the better formula will no doubt come out in the debate. I suspect that this is not a suitable matter for secondary legislation but that it should be prescribed by Parliament in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> As the amendment has been grouped with one which my party tabled initially, perhaps, Mr. O'Hara, you will allow me to say a few words to it.
<P>
The aim of our amendment--this is also the Government's aim--is to try to avoid unnecessary appeals, both in the interests of claimants, who will surely benefit greatly from decisions being made more quickly, thus avoiding the need to go to appeal if they have gone wrong at the outset, and of the Government, who do not wish to spend more money. We should like more time allowed for disputes and for this method of correcting errors in decisions taken on claims. We disagree with the seven-day limit proposed in the Conservative amendment; we think that it should be much longer. Hence the three-month proposal in our amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> Our prime purpose in clause 10 is to encourage customers who are dissatisfied with a decision to ask the relevant agency to reconsider it before they decide to appeal. The clause will allow decision makers to take a fresh look at decisions and, where they are wrong, to put them right quickly, with minimum fuss. I hope that will be seen as a sensible way forward. The clause allows for regulations that specify the time limit within which customers must ask for a decision to be reconsidered.
<P>
Amendment No. 120 would create a time frame of at least three months within which the Secretary of State must reach a decision under the clause. I am sure that that is not what the hon. Member for Newbury and the hon. Member for Arundel and South Down (Mr. Flight) intended. Amendment No. 33 would have a similar effect. I assume that in tabling the amendments both hon. Gentlemen sought to clarify how we intend to use regulation-making powers, and that their intention was to provide in the Bill a specified period within which a customer could dispute a new decision.
<P>
A three-month period would allow disputes to be raised long after the initial decision. The original facts might no longer be accurate and an inordinate length of time might then be needed to finalise a decision. The combination of a three-month time limit for disputing decisions, if added to perhaps three months for any subsequent appeal hearing, would mean that, routinely, the total time taken to hear appeals would exceed six months, and in many cases much longer. We feel that six months is far too long to expect people to wait while their appeal is resolved, as I hope Members of the Committee will agree.
<P>
It may assist the Committee if I explain how we envisage dispute arrangements working, and what the proposed regulations will provide for. As we progress I shall try to provide details to the satisfaction of hon. Members.
<P>
We intend to provide in regulations that the time limit for requesting that a decision be revised be one month in most cases. Where a customer has genuine difficulty disputing a decision within the time limit, regulations will provide for late disputes to be accepted. Analysis of existing benefit appeals suggests that most claimants appeal within one month. A one-month limit will encourage customers to exercise their rights promptly and will lead to more rapid settlement of cases. I believe that it offers a reasonable time within which the majority of clients can dispute their decision. It will also ensure that decisions are re-examined while the facts are still fresh.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for providing some thoughts about what might appear in future regulations. He referred to research on appeals that suggests that many are made within one month. What does the research show about appeals that are made after one month? Do specific sorts of claimants have particular difficulties? The Minister mentioned flexibility, but what is the point of a cut-off if there are to be exceptions? I would appreciate clarification.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The purpose of the amendments is to include a time limit in the Bill. I have explained the time limit that the Government consider appropriate, but there will be exceptions. That decision is based on research showing that people cannot always apply within the one-month time frame. The detail will be set out in regulations. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to write to me about circumstances in which people cannot make applications within the time frame, I shall be happy to hear from him.
<P>
We want to establish a time frame in which appeals will be made. A month will offer most people who seek a revision a reasonable time frame.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We do not intend to use the powers in the Bill to prescribe the period within which agencies must reconsider intitial decisions after a dispute. The quality of the outcome is important, not a specific time frame. However I assure members of the Committee that guidelines and targets will place a responsibility on the agencies to revise decisions as quickly as possible. However long it takes the agency to take appropriate action the right of appeal against the revised decision will still exist. There will be a separate time limit of one month in which to appeal, and that will not start until consideration is complete.
<P>
The arrangements will offer a better and fairer service to customers and will provide a means of resolving disputes speedily.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am not sure whether I understood the Minister's comments about an appeal following a revision--but they are relevant to amendment No. 124, which we shall consider later. I apologise for mentioning that amendment now, but the Minister's remarks may mean that it is irrelevant. They seem to contradict subsection (5), which amendment No. 124 would change. Subsection (5) suggests that one cannot start an appeal on the date on which the revised decision is made if the Minister rules that no such revision should occur. Perhaps the Minister's earlier comments apply only in the case of a decision to revise. An appeal against such a decision can be made. However, if a decision not to revise goes against the claimant, amendment No. 124 remains valid.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The hon. Gentleman may have misunderstood me. His interpretation is correct, but we shall examine his point carefully and ensure that the periods for the appeal and the revision are clarified before we discuss amendment No. 124. He can then decide whether he wishes to press the amendment.
<P>
The time frames that we put in place in the regulation will ensure that disputes are resolved speedily and do not in any way prejudice people's appeal rights. After those assurances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The Minister has made it clear that the Government propose one month, with some latitude, as the time limit in the supporting regualtions. That harks back to an issue that we have already discussed--what should be in primary legislation and what in secondary legislation. It strikes me that although the discussion has been about appeals and how they will be handled, the Bill as drafted will permit action the other way round; it will permit the Minister simply to reverse decisions for reasons that are not prescribed in clause 10, and to do so at any time subsequent to such decisions. I am surprised that a Government who claim to want less central government should want such strong powers. In my view it is better to have a tight time limit laid down by Parliament, with some let out, than for such matters to be dealt with in secondary legislation. However, the Minister said that one month is publicly on offer as the time limit in the regulation. That appears to be a reasonable balance between the two amendments. On that basis I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`where a manifest mistake of fact or law has been made by the Secretary of State''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
	The second crucial issue over which the clause as drafted gives the Secretary of State wide powers concerns the circumstances in which the unilateral power to reverse and revise decisions can be used.
<P>
	I appreciate that the machinery exists to deal with appeals, but the clause as drafted gives the Minister very wide powers. There is no defined basis on which, or reason why, he can reverse such decisions at whim. The amendment proposes a commonsense approach: the reversals should be limited to issues that are matters of fact, of law or of clear mistake. Those should be the only bases on which decisions taken by the machinery as prescribed can subsequently be reversed in the way prescribed. Without a definition of the circumstances and type of case in which the decisions can be revised, the Bill will give an arbitrary and excessive power to the Secretary of State. Other amendments suggest what the circumstances should be, but the commonsense issues of mistakes of fact or of law are the correct bases on which revisions should be made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> The amendment would restrict the circumstances in which decisions could be revised. It may assist members of the Committee if I spell out precisely how we intend to use the powers in the clause to prescribe the cases and circumstances in which decisions may be revised.
<P>
	At present, claimants seeking to have a decision reviewed must show that there are specific grounds for doing so. They must show that a decision was taken in ignorance of, or based on a mistake as to, a material fact or an error of law. It can be difficult and confusing for individuals to establish this, which often leads to claimants making unnecessary appeals.
<P>
	Under the new arrangements it will be necessary only to state why a decision is wrong. Apart from that simple requirement there will be no need to back the case up with evidence based on incorrect facts or law. That means that any decision may be disputed, and agency decisionmakers will be able to re-decide a case afresh without reference to the original decision.
<P>
	Decisions will be able to be revised not only because of an error of fact or law, but also where, on reflection, a decisionmaker decides that the evidence available points towards a different outcome, possibly because new facts have come to light, or where a decisionmaker looks at the same basic facts again, and concludes that a different interpretation should be put on them. A good example might be a decision whether two people are living together as husband and wife.
<P>
	The new dispute arrangements that the clause will make possible are designed to encourage clients to discuss the decision made in their case with the Department, rather than go straight to appeal. We want the new arrangements to apply to as wide a variety of cases as possible, and we intend to achieve that through flexibility. The amendment would limit that opportunity--and I do not think that the hon Gentleman would want that to happen. I therefore urge the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> the Amendment is certainly not intended to run counter to the aim of reducing both costs and the number of unsatisfactory appeals, by the Minister again seems to be describing the circumstances from the bottom up and is not focusing on the situation from the top down. The clause gives Ministers the power to reverse decisions for any reason chosen at whim. I should have thought it reasonable to require the primary law to contain a definition of circumstances in which decisions can be reversed--although I understand the point made the other way round about flexibility. I again express the hope that the secondary legislation will include a degree of protection against arbitrary use of power by the Minister. That is the essential point that I seek to make. With that assurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 121, in page 5, leave out lines 36 to 38 and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``(2) When considering whether to make a decision under subsection (1) above, the Secretary of State shall consider any issue which appears to him to be relevant to the claim, so that he shall not revise the decision in question so as to terminate an award of benefit or reduce its amount unless he is satisfied that it was given in ignorance of, or was based on a mistake as to some material fact or was erroneous in point of law.''<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (2B) For the purpose of this subsection ``relevant benefit'' has the same meaning as for section 9 above.''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> A minor change may be necessary to amendment No. 121, Mr. O'Hara. I do not know whether we made a mistake on the form on which we submitted the amendment, or whether it has been misprinted, but it should start ``(2)(a) When considering . . .'', as otherwise the subsequent identification of subpagraphs (b) and (c) does not make sense.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I shall consult about that. For the moment the hon. Gentleman should speak to the amendment as printed on the amendment paper.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I shall do my best, Mr. O'Hara. If I refer to ``subparagraph (a)'' I hope hon. Members will understand what I am talking about.
<P>
The important point is that the Committee has another opportunity to deal with a situation that can sometimes arise. When a claimant makes a claim or looks for a revision of a decision, during the discussion of that potential revision the Secretary of State can sometimes spot something that the claimant has not spotted. That may have an effect on the amount of benefit payable. When such a situation arises it is important that that information gets back to the claimant, but it will never do so unless we ensure that the Secretary of State does her best to take account of all the issues surrounding the claim. That is what happens in appeals at present; there is a requirement to take account of all issues. There is a danger that in future, further relevant issues that may increase the amount of benefit will be brought to the claimant's attention less often.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The other important aspect of what should be called subsection (2)(a) is that it would make it more certain that a Secretary of State--I do not want to cast aspersions on the present Secretary of State or those who work for her--could not arbitrarily revise an earlier decision.
<P>
In sub-paragraph (b) we insist that possible changes in the way in which claimants might make their claims should be brought to their attention, if there is an indication that they did not know that they were entitled to a relevant benefit.
<P>
We were talking this morning about the fact that for one reason or another many benefits are unclaimed. Probably the amount being unclaimed is greater than that being fraudulently claimed. We agreed that we would try to ensure that claimants claim everything to which they are entitled. The amendment seeks to further that cause, to which we are all now signed up, and I hope that the Government will accept it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Having clarified the situation, I can confirm the fact that there is a minor drafting error in amendment No. 121. Clearly there should be a ghost (a) after the (2), as a balance to (b) and (c). That is a minor matter that could be corrected at a later stage of drafting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> In the spirit of co-operation, I point out an even more trivial error in the amendment. In subsection (b), the word following the words ``relevant benefit other'' should read ``than'' rather than ``that''. That is not a major drafting error.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I think that we should treat that error in the same way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am sure that that is a wise ruling.
<P>
Moving on to a more substantive point, subsection (2)(b) in the amendment brings into high relief a question that Conservative Members would like resolved, and to which we drew attention earlier. The Minister signally failed to resolve the point at that time, but he promised to do some research. Perhaps between the morning and afternoon sittings that research has been conducted. We are under the apprehension that the Minister for Welfare Reform, the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) made an authoritative statement--coming from that source, of course, any statement must be regarded as authoritative--on the Floor of the House that benefits should be widely and appropriately advertised and special steps taken to alert everyone who is entitled to a particular benefit of their entitlement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman confirming what was said earlier, that my right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead stated that everyone entitled to family credit should be notified directly of that entitlement?

<B>Mr. Burns:</B> May I help my hon. Friend, and possibly the Minister if he is to track this issue down? Remarks were made in the context of targeting benefits that people may be eligible for but which they were not receiving, for example income support or, potentially, housing benefit in the case of pensioners receiving income support. The matter was mentioned at the same time in the context of a Government advertising campaign on family credit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that clarification. The particular importance of subsection (b) of the amendment is that it brings the issue into relief. The Minister said that the Government's objection to that method of dealing with matters was that they would have to write to everyone in work, advertising to them their potential entitlement to family credit, and that, somehow, that would be ludicrously burdensome.
<P>
However, if I have understood correctly, subsection (b) of the amendment contains the much more narrowly focused proposition that, when claimants are seeking an adjudication, the Secretary of State should ensure that, when it comes to light that they are entitled to another benefit, that should be brought to their attention. The example of a pensioner who was seeking a change in pension entitlement but had neglected to claim supplementary support might be a case in point.
<P>
In such circumstances, it would be illuminating to hear whether the Government now deny the principle put forward by the right hon. Member for Birkenhead and whether they take the view, as would certainly be the case if they reject subsection (b) of the amendment, that, on the contrary, entitlements should not be brought to the attention of those who hold them if they have not made an application. That would be an extremely important shift of principle to which the Committee's attention should be drawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Steve Webb </B>(Northavon): The comments that we have just heard raise the second of the two important issues--they are distinct, but we have grouped them--dealt with by the amendment. We will deal with the first matter, which falls under what should have been subsection (2)(a) of the amendment, more acutely when we deal with appeals under clause 13(7), which we discussed on Second Reading and concerns whether appeals should be inquisitorial.
<P>
It is our strong view that, even at the review stage, we should try to get the right answer. We should not restrict ourselves to what is in the papers or ignore things which are not in them. The Bill does not prohibit people from looking beyond the papers, but it allows them not to. There is no reason to permit that. If other, relevant material is available and easily obtainable, it is reasonable to expect the people making the decisions to pursue it and to try to get the right decision. We heard a great deal on Second Reading about getting the decision right first time. How about getting it right at least second time by not ignoring relevant information and by pursuing it where that is straightforward? This is a matter of process, so I am slightly puzzled why the Bill states that the authorities ``need not consider'' those other matters. We object to that.
<P>
The second issue concerns notifying people who have asked for one decision to be reviewed about other relevant benefits. There are circumstances in which people claim the wrong benefit, they put in a claim for unemployment benefit or the jobseekers allowance when really they should be claiming sickness or incapacity benefit. It would be helpful if, instead of simply reviewing the decision and turning them down because nothing had changed, the benefits office said, ``Given the information that you have provided, we draw your attention to the fact that you may be entitled to another benefit.'' That may not happen routinely, in which case I welcome it. If not, it would be good to have such a provision in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> Amendment No. 121 would do three things. It would reintroduce in statute the concept of formal grounds for revision. It would move away from concentration on that part of the decision which is disputed, or which appears to be wrong in relation to the position when undisputed aspects of a decision must be revisited. It would impose a duty on the Secretary of State to identify entitlement to other benefits and notify the customer accordingly.
<P>
The effect of amendment No. 135 is that the Bill would specify that decision makers must consider the whole application afresh, rather than just the point at issue, when considering whether to supersede a decision.
<P>
Efficient customer-focused services--those which simplify complicated, bureaucratic processes, reduce delays and cut out waste--are central to the Government's welfare proposals.
<P>
Clause 10 is about revising decisions that appear to be wrong. That should be a simple, easily understood process, yet current law requires customers to seek review by means of an application in writing to an adjudication officer, stating the grounds of the application. That is neither simple nor easily understood. We are constrained by a complex legal framework set out in statute and with rules which differ from benefit to benefit and from agency to agency.
<P>
The Government propose that in future customers may dispute a decision without such formality. Agency staff will check whether there are grounds for revising decisions. They will follow published departmental guidance when making those decisions. Grounds for revision will be set out in regulations and guidance.
<P>
That brings me to the question of focusing on the customer's concerns. The intention of subsection (2) is to ensure that staff in the Department's agencies focus on those areas which the customer queries or disputes. But amendment No. 121 undermines that approach. Let us take the example of a customer who queries one simple element of his or her decision, such as the date from which benefit is payable. The amendment would seem to require agency staff to revisit all other elements of the decision on his claim, even those not in dispute. The result is that a simple and quick disputes process becomes complex, cumbersome and slow. That surely cannot be the aim of modernising the welfare system.
<P>
Amendment No. 135 could also mean that decision makers would have to consider the whole application afresh, rather than just at the point at issue, this time in relation to superseding the decision that has been made. The amendment states that the Secretary of State need consider only issues that appear to be relevant, but it is unlikely that the letter of this provision could be observed without reviewing the whole decision just in case something went amiss. Again, that would lead to unnecessary delays in processing changes in circumstances. I believe that when reconsidering a decision under this clause, it is reasonable that there be no obligation for the decision maker to consider the entire matter afresh.
<P>
Finally, I turn to the last issue raised by the amendments--the identification of entitlement to other benefits. The Department and agencies provide comprehensive information explaining the rules for entitlement to the various benefits. Where it is clear that a customer is not receiving benefit to which he may be entitled it is, of course, normal practice for decision makers to advise him accordingly. However, it has always been for customers themselves to ensure that they receive all the benefits to which they are entitled. The amendment would have the effect of shifting the responsibility from the customers to the agencies, which is contrary to the principle of individual responsibilities as well as rghts. It would be counterproductive to place requirements in this area of primary legislation until we have the information needed to decide the appropriate way forward for the process of simplifying and ensuring that people receive their entitlement.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> A little earlier, when we touched on a related theme, the Minister referred to improving take-up of income support by pensioners through an automatic mechanism--I think that that was the phrase he used. An automatic mechanism does precisely what he has just said that he does not want it to do--it takes responsibility away from the ``customer'' and puts responsibility for delivery in the hands of the state. An automatic delivery mechanism is precisely what we want and the Minister has applauded it in the case of pensioners. Why does he not want the state to do what it can to give people what they are entitled to? Why is that a betrayal of people's individual responsibilities?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> What I said was that the reasons for pensioners not taking up income support were not simple--the matter is complicated and there are a variety of reasons. We want to research why people do not take up benefits and then put in place systems that address the issue. The dispute about a decision, when the customer wants an early reconsideration, is not the appropriate point at which to consider the issue of all the entitlements to benefit. We are talking about the decision on a particular claim for benefit and an item of dispute within it, which the claimant wants quickly resolved. We want that dispute to be quickly resolved and the decision on that entitlement to be reached quickly. Introducing additional mechanisms in the clause to force the decision maker to consider the whole claim and other entitlements to benefit will clearly clog up the system again. The purpose of the clause and of this part of the Bill is to deliver decisions as fast as possible. That is why the Government resist the amendment. With that explanation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will consider withdrawing the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am sorry that I cannot agree with the Minister. He has made several points, but they do not hold water. He said first that it was necessary for those who were considering revising a decision or introducing a new decision to supersede the first one--the amendments would have equivalent effects in the two clauses--to focus purely on the aspect of the original decision that was queried by the appellant or, rather, claimant. The amendment should in no way prevent those who are considering a revised decision or a decision to supersede the first one from focusing mainly on the aspect that was brought to their attention because the claimant was dissatisfied with the first decision. Of course, they will focus on that, but that should not prevent them from looking at other aspects. I accept that that will involve more time, but, as I said this morning, we are trying to improve two sides of the present system. On the one hand, we want it to work more quickly and efficiently; on the other, it should be correct more often. As my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon has just said, if one cannot get it right the first time, one should, for God's sake, make sure that one gets it right the second time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> Just a moment. I am sure that the Minister has come across cases--I certainly have--in which a decision is queried for some reason, maybe for the wrong reason. Yet there are other aspects of the same case that might allow the equivalent of the decision to be overturned, even if not for the same reason originally specified by the claimant. Those further cases need to be considered more fully and we must ensure that the answers come out right: if they have been wrong the first time, they should be considered again. Many aspects of the problem will not need to be considered in quite such detail where there is agreement between the claimant and those who work the system. Further relevant aspects must be properly taken into account.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I wanted to reinforce the point that the Government's position does not prevent that option. It is not a requirement that the whole range of options be pursued in every case. It is in the claimant's best interest if the dispute can be resolved quickly; there is no need to open up the dispute more widely in every case, as required by the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I accept that a longer process may be necessary since an answer may not arise quickly by focusing on the aspect stipulated by the Minister: other relevant aspects may need to be taken into account by those considering whether a revision can be made. Let us not forget that cases going into a second round before the outcome is finally decided are likely to be the more complex ones. There is thus a greater likelihood that other aspects, which may not have been fully understood by the claimant, will be relevant.
<P>
The amendment, including its second part, is important. A claimant may not be aware of other benefits for which he may be eligible and which should be brought to his attention. Because the amendment is so important, I shall press it to a vote.

<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 122, in page 5, line 39, leave out `subsections (4) and' and insert `subsection'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 123, in page 5, leave out lines 42 to 44.
<P>
No. 133, in clause 11, page 6, line 21, leave out `subsection (5) and'.
<P>
No. 134, in clause 11, page 6, leave out lines 24 to 26.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> This is a probing amendment. The Government may be pleased to know that we are not so determined to push the amendment to a vote as we were with the previous amendment. We merely want to find out what the Government are thinking in this case.
<P>
It must be normal and expected that a revised or superseded decision--again, the two pairs of four amendments relate to clauses 10 and 11, which cover revisions and decisions that supersede other decisions--should have effect from the date of the original decision. It seems only proper that if a decision was wrong to start with, one should go back to the date it was made. If it is wrong now, it was wrong then and the revised decision should take effect from then. We are therefore not certain why the Government are giving themselves the power through regulations under subsection (4) to change that date under certain circumstances. Will the Government provide some further explanation? I hope that the Government will be able to say what circumstances they have in mind and how the regulations will work, so that I can withdraw the amendment later on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> We can describe that introduction as a genuine probing attempt, and I shall try to satisfy the hon. Gentleman's queries.
<P>
The amendments would mean that any decision that the Secretary of State made under clause 9 or superseded under clause 11 could be revised only from the date from which the original decision took effect. Clause 10 sets out a legal framework for revising decisions within the disputed period, which will be one month. That will enable decision makers to take a fresh look at decisions and, where they are wrong, to put them right quickly. Normally, decisions found to be wrong, if they are disputed within a month of the notification of a decision, will be put right from the date of the original decision. However, subsection (4) allows for regulations to enable the date of the original decision to be changed to a different date. I shall explain how we intend to use that power.
<P>
Sometimes, when a decision maker considers a disputed decision, he or she may find that the original date of claim was wrong and that benefit should, perhaps, have been paid from an earlier date. We believe in a customer-focused service which responds to people's needs. It is only fair to the customer that such a mistake should also be put right.
<P>
Under clause 11, we intend to provide in regulations that customers should have one month in which to report a change of circumstances. If they do so, the decision would take effect from the date of change and be paid from the relevant pay day. If customers take more than a month to report a change, any increase would be paid only from the date on which the change was reported.
<P>
If, however, the change of circumstance leads to a reduction or cessation of benefit, the change will take effect from the date that it occurred. In some cases, customers might deliberately fail to report a change that would be disadvantageous to them. It is only right that we should be able to go back to the date of change and deal with any overpayment. For example, a person might have started work but not declared it.
<P>
We believe that a month gives customers sufficient time to notify the Department of any changes. In line with the principle that customers should take responsibility for keeping the Department up to date with their circumstances, we believe that to be reasonable.
<P>
The amendments would reduce the flexibility for handling reported changes in customers' circumstances in the most appropriate way, and would restrict the Secretary of State to superseding decisions only from the date of the application, taking no account of the late--or early--notification of changes. Customers do not always find it easy to report changes as soon as they happen. For example, it may take a while to obtain the documentary evidence that the Department requires. However, one month should give sufficient time for evidence gathering and for customers to report changes in general.
<P>
I hope that I have been able to explain why we believe the amendments are not necessary. Given the spirit in which the hon. Member for Newbury moved the amendment, I hope that he will not press it to a Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> The Minister said that it was sometimes difficult for claimants to get the necessary information together, but that a month might be a reasonable time in which to do so. That implies that it will take a month to get pay slips, bank statements and other documents together. However, under another provision in the Bill, claimants will be penalised if they do not get all the relevant information together and their claim will be dated from the time they have that information. Will the Minister comment on the inconsistency between his approach to this amendment and the arguments that he will deploy later?
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I fear that I would be ruled out of order if I started to talk about other parts of the Bill. On these amendments, I think that it is reasonable for a customer to notify a change in circumstance and to provide evidence, when it is required, within one month of that change. That is balanced and fair to both parties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I was pleased to hear the explanation on decisions that will supersede other decisions. However, I shall be interested to read the Hansard report of the debate because my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon may wish to take up at a later stage some of the comments that the Minister has just made.
<P>
Although I understand what the Minister said about amendments Nos. 133 and 134, I was slightly more concerned by what he did not say about revisions and clause 10. Will he confirm that, when he refers to a date other than the date on which the original decision took effect, he is talking only about the possibility of backdating a decision when it has been found to have been put off for too long? In such cases, claimants would receive rather more benefit than they expected.
<P>
It would be difficult, however, if a decision were made to bring the date forward, because that might leave a claimant severely out of pocket and in great difficulties. If I am assured that the provision relates only to backdating, I shall be more than happy to withdraw the amendment. I hope that the Minister will respond to that important point.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I do not think that that is what I am saying, but I shall look carefully at the hon. Gentleman's point. If someone fails to provide information about a change that has led to his receiving benefits to which he is not entitled, surely it would be appropriate to apply that decision at the appropriate time. It is in the interests of the taxpayer that people should not receive benefits to which they are not entitled. However, if I have not clarified the issue for the hon. Gentleman I shall look again at his argument carefully.
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Although I intend to discuss this long string of amendments, the Committee will be relieved to hear that they are similar and that they try to make the same point in different clauses and in a schedule to the Bill.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that when the Government lay regulations under the Act, they will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. We touched on this important debate, which deserves some time, a little earlier.
<P>
We have already considered the quite wide-ranging powers being concentrated in the hands of the Secretary of State. Although there are major arguments in favour of simplifying decision making and so on, concerns remain about how the powers are to be operated and used, and how much accountability there will be to the House, and through it to the people whom we represent. A number of useful discussions today have touched on that general principle.
<P>
I have already quoted the Child Poverty Action Group which referred to what it called
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the skeletal nature of the Bill''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>I endorse that description. In recent years it has not been uncommon for Bills to allow for much of the detail to be filled in by way of subsequent regulations. But that power must be used with discretion.
<P>
Most of us will have received a briefing from the Social Security Law Practitioners Association--lawyers who act regularly for clients who appear before social security tribunals. In a most useful briefing on the Bill's details--especially clause 10--they comment on the new power of revision that the Secretary of State is to enjoy:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We believe that the current grounds upon which a decision of an adjudication officer may be reviewed work well and that such grounds should be laid out in primary legislation.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>That theme was also taken up by the Law Society:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A further point of concern is that the Bill gives the Secretary of State extensive regulation-making powers, making it extremely difficult for Parliament, and those affected by the Bill's provisions, to assess their impact or desirability. It is hoped that Ministers will be able to provide more detailed information in order to clarify their intentions during the passage of the Bill.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>We wholeheartedly endorse that hope. [Interruption]. I hear murmurs of assent from the Liberal Democrat Benches, which is always a source of worry for me. I am reminded of the story about the infinite number of monkeys and the infinite number of typewriters eventually producing ``King Lear'': we have at last hit upon a subject on which we all agree, which is splendid.
<P>
The Law Society, while welcoming the proposals in clause 10--I do not think that there has been much argument about the principles behind the powers in the clause--also states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``However, it is unclear how the process will operate, since much of the detail remains to be prescribed in regulations.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>That is exactly the point made by other organisations.
<P>
The basis for these new powers--the way in which they will be used--has not been set out in primary legislation, as we mentioned this morning. When pressed, the Minister said, in effect, that the Committee would have the opportunity to consider the nature of the regulations. When pressed a little more by my hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford, he made a further concession by saying that in some cases we might even have the draft regulations to consider. That would be of great advantage to the Committee. I make a purely practical point at this juncture: it would be enormously helpful if draft regulations were available in good time for the Committee's deliberations on the relevant parts of the Bill.
<P>
In his initial answer this morning, I felt that the Minister put unjustified faith in the work of the Scrutiny Committee. As hon. Members will know, a Select Committee of this House considers secondary legislation and there is also a Joint Committee with the other place. I had the honour and privilege of serving on both Committees for almost the whole of the last Parliament. I say, with respect, that the Minister failed to see the difference between scrutiny, which is one thing, and control, which is quite another when it comes to secondary legislation.
<P>
The Joint Committee considers about 3,000 instruments a year. Thus the time available to spend on any one of these regulations, apart from other considerations, is extremely limited, because the Committee meets once a week. The ``Short Guide to Procedure and Practice'' prepared for Members by the Department of the Clerk of the House makes it clear that the Joint Committee or, as the Minister called it, the Scrutiny Committee,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``is not concerned with the merits of SIs, but with such matters as whether the authority conferred by the parent Act has been exceeded and whether the drafting is defective.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>That is a very different matter from that Committee, even if it had the time or the inclination, being in a position to be able to go into the merits of regulations made under this or any other primary legislation.
<P>
One need only look beyond that to the second edition of ``Statutory Instrument Practice'', which makes it clear in section 1 of part IV that there is a distinction between control and scrutiny,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the latter term being used in reference to the examination of instruments by the scrutiny committees''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
of the kind that I have just described.
<P>
The paper goes on to talk about the difference between affirmative and negative prcedures. Before I comment on it, I quote from the fourth report by the Select Committee on Procedure on delegated legislation. Discussing the work of the Joint Committee, it states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Its work is painstaking, unglamorous and goes largely unregarded within the House''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I say a hearty amen to that.
<P>
Returning to the two procedures, there is of course a distinction between the affirmative and negative procedures, although there has been some change in the effect of both in recent years following the implementation of the Jopling proposals. As the procedure now stands, an affirmative instrument is automatically referred for debate to a Standing Committee unless the Government agree that it be debated on the Floor of the House.
<P>
When it comes to negative instruments, as the fourth report makes clear, one of the options open to the Government is that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it may freely disregard it''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is the instrument. It continues in paragraph 7 to make it clear that Ministers are in a position to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``concede affirmative procedure in the course of debate on a Bill in committee.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
On that point, my final quote from the Select Committee report states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``only the affirmative procedure guarantees a debate in the Commons.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is really what we are debating now.
<P>
I return to the second edition of ``Statutory Instrument Practice'', which makes it clear that the affirmative procedure provides the more stringent form of parliamentary control. Conversely,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``negative procedure provides a less stringent form of parliamentary control than affirmative''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That point should be clear to members of the Committee, and especially to all new Members.
<P>
The amendments would make it clear that the Government were obliged to place regulations before the House for proper consideration and debate. Thus the great tracts of powers and their uses that are not set out in the Bill could be debated properly. Paragraph 14 of the Select Committee report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There is in our view too great a readiness in Parliament to delegate wide legislative powers to Ministers, and no lack of enthusiasm on their part to take such powers. The result is an excessive volume of delegated legislation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, I mention an issue that applies to different clauses in the Bill. It is a matter for the new Government to decide whether to proceed on the basis of the Bill, which outlines the broad scope of their aims, and fill in the details later through regulation. I have no quibble with that. However, the Minister is wrong to place so much faith in the work--albeit sterling--of the Scrutiny Committee. The regulations will have a substantial effect on the lives of many people. The Bill should contain a provision to ensure that those regulations are subject to proper review.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I have listened carefully to my hon. Friend's powerful argument. Does he agree that the evidence that he has produced disproves the Minister's suggestion that there is no difference between primary and secondary legislation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am happy to adopt my hon. Friend's formulation of a central error in the Minister's approach. There is a world of difference between primary and secondary legislation, otherwise, the process on which we have just embarked, and in which we may be engaged for many weeks or even months, would have no value.
<P>
The Minister should be better briefed on the House's procedures for scrutinising and controlling secondary legislation. He should recognise the difference between scrutiny and control. The amendments would put the onus on the Government to obtain the approval of both Houses for regulations made under the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> Following the Minister's earlier intervention in a debate about an amendment that I tabled, I am delighted to have the support of Conservative Members for my point about the difference between primary and secondary legislation. The amendments are worthy of support. They reflect the anxieties that we expressed earlier this afternoon. I am more worried after listening to the speeches that have just been made. The Minister tries his best to allay my fears, and he was succeeding, but my worries have now returned. I hope that the Minister will develop his previous explanation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The hon. Gentleman is clearly easily pleased and then easily displeased. I am not sure how we shall play that one in future. Can I make it clear in case there was any confusion, althought I do not think that there was any confusion on the Government Benches, that I did not say that there was no difference between primary and secondary legislation but that the Secretary of State was equally bound by both elements of legislation and accountable for them. That is the crucial point.
<P>
A 78-clause Bill can hardly be described as skeletal. There have been some skeletal Bills of one, two and three clauses in this House but a 78-clause Bill is hardly of that nature. The fact that I have been able to give more details about our intentions on our regulation powers has been generally welcomed today. Many hon. Members have recognised and understood how we will use regulation and have withdrawn their amendments because they have been satisfied with the explanation of those regulations and their use. It is a bit rich now to start complaining in the synthetic manner that set the tone of our deliberations this morning about the way in which we intend to use secondary legislation.
<P>
Part I deals exclusively with matters of process, in particular how decisions are made and reviewed and the way in which appeals are handled.
<P>
<B>Mr Letwin</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I hope that it is not about computers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> No. Will the Minister pause for a second and consider his last statement that this part of the Bill is exclusively concerned with matters of process having previously told us that matters of process were to be kept out of the Bill? Is there not some contradiction?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The point that we are making is that matters of process will be dealt with through secondary legislation and not in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> So does the Minister wish to withdraw his remarks that part I of the Bill is concerned with process?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Obviously the hours that we have spent on this matter already are taxing the hon. Gentleman and I will not rise to his protestations.
<P>
The provisions do not affect more fundamental issues, such as the amounts of benefit paid to claimants or the conditions of entitlement that attach to benefit. Regulations of this nature are commonly introduced using the negative resolution procedure. Let us take an example from a recent enactment brought forward by the previous Conservative Government,--I know it is hard to remember that time, but there was such a Government--the Social Security Administration (Fraud) Act, 1997. Of the twenty-six delegated powers in that Act, only two require introduction using the affirmative procedure. This is because, as with this Bill, they mainly affect administration. When making regulations it is incumbent upon the Government to ensure that Parliamentary time is used efficiently while at the same time ensuring that there is adequate opportunity for proper scrutiny. It is my view that the regulations introduced under the powers in this Act are entirely appropriate to the negative resolution procedure and that they are in line with the recommendations of the Brooke report on delegated powers. And I have no reason to believe that, when the provisions are placed before the Delegated Powers Scrutiny Committee, it will do otherwise than concur with my view.
<P>
There is also the opportunity for further scrutiny of such regulations through the Social Security Advisory Committee. Many of the powers in the Bill come from existing legislation contained in the Social Security Administration Act 1992. We are re-enacting a large part of that Act in the Bill so they are not new powers.
<P>
I strongly believe that the protestations and track record of the previous Government on the matter do not give any credibility to their presentation of the amendments, which I know will be resisted by Labour Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I listened intently to the Minister, who took exception to the word ``skeletal''. I remind him that that was not my description, but that of Child Poverty Action Group, a body which cannot be described as a natural bolt-on of the Conservative party. Although the Minister read out his brief prettily, he has not grasped the essential difference between parliamentary scrutiny and control, which are two distinct matters.
<P>
There is confusion, which has been shown up more than once today by my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset, about process and whether it is in or without the Bill. Although the Minster would like to believe that process is a matter best left to regulations, it does pop up here and there in the Bill.
<P>
In the absence either of a clear undertaking from the Minister that he will make all such regulations available for the Committee's consideration as we go through the Bill or of his acceptance of the amendments or at least of their thrust--they could be dealt with in other ways--I should like to press the amendment to a vote.

<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 124, in page 6, leave out lines 1 to 3 and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(5) Where an application has been made under subsection (1), for the purpose of any rule as to the time allowed for bringing an appeal, the decision in question shall be treated as made on the date it is revised or the date the Secretary of State notifies the claimant of his refusal to revise.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In passing, may I just say that that vote gives a new meaning to the words ``constructive opposition''? The Opposition are now being constructive among themselves and are supporting one another in a way that was unfortunately not apparent a moment ago.
<P>
When I mentioned amendment No. 124, the Minister said that before we came to it he might relieve my concerns and the reasons for my tabling the amendment. He has not yet done so, but perhaps he will be able to do so in his response.
<P>
The amendment deals with the case in which there is the possibility that a decision may be revised. The issue is when an appeal must be put in, depending on whether that revision goes ahead. We agree with the wording of the Bill to the extent that, where a decision is revised, it clearly makes sense for the start point of the period during which an appeal must be put in to be the date on which that revision is made. Clearly that may affect whether the claimant wants to lodge an appeal. The revision may be such that the claimant has all he wants and has no need to appeal. Equally, the revision may go against the claimant--in other words, a decision that has previously been apparently satisfactory to the claimant, and in respect of which an appeal is not sensible, may be revised against the best interests of the claimant; he may then decide to appeal against the revised decision. In that case, it is clearly sensible for the period within which an appeal has to be made to start on the date of the revised decision.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I suspect, however, that there is a difficulty in the wording of the clause. A claimant may believe that a decision is about to be revised--he may think that there is an obvious fault in the original decision which he has every reason to suppose the Secretary of State will revise. In waiting for that revised decision, he may well feel that there is no need to make an appeal, assuming that the revision will be in his favour. The Secretary of State may then decide not to revise the decision, in which case subsection (5) will not take effect--because, as it states, it takes effect only where
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``a decision is revised under this section''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The difficulty comes when the Secretary of State decides not to revise an initial decision. Can the claimant believe that his period for appealing starts from the date of the decision not to make a revision? If not, claimants will be under pressure to put in an appeal at an early stage, in case a revision that they hope will achieve what they want it to is not made and there is no change to the original decision.
<P>
Under amendment No. 124, if the Secretary of State refused to revise a decision, the period during which an appeal could be lodged would start on the date on which she notified the claimant of her refusal to revise--that is, the date on which the claimant knew that there might, after all, be some point in his appealing. I hope that the amendment would achieve what I am sure is the Minister's intention--I cannot believe that he would not intend that result to come about. He might be able to persuade me that that result is already incorporated in the Bill, but if it is not, the amendment should be accepted.

<P>

<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I shall try to be as helpful to the hon. Gentleman as I promised. It may be useful if I start by explaining how clause 10 will work. The clause will introduce greater flexibility into the decision-making process. One way, in which it will achieve that is by replacing the current process of changing a decision only where a customer can show that there are specified grounds to do so. Under the new arrangements, a customer will have to state why a decision is wrong, but he will not need to back that up with evidence that is based on incorrect facts or law. The new arrangement is fundamental to understanding why the amendment is unnecessary. It not only means that any decision may be disputed, but, critically, in the absence of statutory grounds for revising a decision, the Secretary of State can have no reason for refusing to consider the decision again within the disputed period. Regulations will make that clear. Of course, the Secretary of State will inform the customer of the result of the application.
<P>
In devising the new arrangement, we have been mindful of customers' rights of appeal, but they flow naturally from what we intend to put in place. If a decision has been reconsidered and revised, there will be a fresh right of appeal against the new decision. If the decision has not been revised--that is, there is not a refusal to revise, but simply to change, because the Secretary of State considers the original decision to be correct--the customer will still have the right to appeal against the original decision. All that will be explained in the notification that will be sent to the customer.
<P>
I might also add, following the point made by the hon. Member for Newbury on time limits for making a decision, that the power to describe a period within which an appeal may be lodged is in clause 13(6) and does not need to be amended under clause 10 in the way that he has suggested. I hope that that clarifies the position and will enable the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am not entirely happy about what the Minister has said. He made it clear that, in practice, an appeal will still be possible if it is decided that no change should be made. I accept that. However, the critical point about the amendment is not whether an appeal is still possible, but the time within which it must be brought. He pointed to clause 13(6) as providing the answer to that question. That clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Regulations may make provision as to''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
how that will be done but is not specific; once again, we go into secondary legislation under regulations.
<P>
It is not clear whether those regulations will be such that, if it is decided not to revise a decision, claimants will have rather longer to appeal--time will have been taken to decide not to revise--than would otherwise be the case. Will the regulations make that clear? It not, the point of the amendment still stands.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The intention is that there will be one month for the appeal to take place. That flows from our debate on previous amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> Do I understand that to mean one month from the decision not to revise being given to the appellant?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> That is correct.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am delighted that that is the case. That seems to be more reasonable; in effect, it means that the point of the amendment will be met by the regulations that we are promised. Once again, it is unfortunate that regulations are promised rather than provisions being included in the Bill. Nevertheless, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
