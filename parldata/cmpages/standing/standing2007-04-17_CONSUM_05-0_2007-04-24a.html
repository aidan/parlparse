						<b class="B">
							<a name="07042427000300"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> Good morning, Mr. Weir. I shall make
comments on the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Hertford and
Stortford (Mr. Prisk) and my right hon. Friend the Member
for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke) and I
shall explain in detail the purpose of amendment No. 60 and the
consequential amendments Nos. 61 to 66. I hope that members of the
Committee will first permit me to reiterate the intentions behind parts
1 and 2 of the Bill to set in context what the amendments are
about.</div>
					<a name="07042427000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill is
intended to introduce new measures to strengthen and streamline the
current system of consumer advocacy and redress. Our vision of how that
new model for consumer representation will work is centred on the case
for the new National Consumer Council, which we debated at great length
last Tuesday and Thursday, as a strong, independent consumer champion
in a position to take a cross-sectoral approach to consumer
representation across all markets.</div>
					<a name="07042427000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Consumer Direct is an existing
telephone and online advice service and has enjoyed considerable
success in providing help and advice to consumers with inquiries 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column128" />Column number: 128</div>and simple complaints. The service will be extended alongside the
measures in the Bill to act as a first port of call for consumers in
all sectors. It will help consumers in the energy and postal service
sectors to progress their complaints about their service providers.
</div>
					<a name="07042427000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">When a service
provider is unable to resolve a complaint to the satisfaction of the
consumer, redress schemes in those sectors will ensure complaint
resolution, as decisions made in the redress schemes will be binding on
providers. The schemes will also be able to offer compensation or other
forms of redress to consumers if they are warranted. The measures in
the Bill are therefore about empowering and protecting the
consumer.</div>
					<a name="07042427000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government amendments will ensure that the regulated providers in the
electricity, gas and postal service sectors have in place and operate
appropriate and effective internal complaint handling procedures.
Consumers will be assured of an approved standard of complaint handling
by the regulated providers in the energy and postal services sectors,
whoever those providers may
be.</div>
					<a name="07042427000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the new
arrangements for consumer representation to be introduced as a result
of the provisions of the Bill, there will no longer be a
sector-specific consumer body with a complaint handling function for
the energy and postal service sectors. Regulated providers in those
sectors will be required to take full and proper responsibility for
handling their own complaints, which means that service providers will
need to take better ownership of complaint handling. It is important
that the right incentives be put in place to enable that to happen.
Regulated providers are, of course, entirely free to improve standards
beyond the level prescribed by the regulator if they so
choose.</div>
					<a name="07042427000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Consumers
will therefore benefit from getting their complaints handled
effectively by the regulated service provider to an approved standard,
but the regulated providers can also benefit. Recent research
undertaken by Ernst and Young found that the retailers that are best
able to resolve customer complaints quickly, satisfactorily and with
the minimum of fuss are more likely to retain customers than those that
do not.</div>
					<a name="07042427000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Complaint
handling standards have been debated extensively, and I believe that
there is no difference between us on it. However, while we understand
the intention behind hon. Members&#146; amendments, they would not
fully achieve their desired affects. The Government amendments will
place a requirementon the regulators to make regulations
prescribing standards for complaint handling. Regulators are best
placed to determine what is appropriate and necessary for their
sectors, and they must be able to exercise a degree of flexibility in
determining what standards should be set, to which complaints they
should apply and how they should be
enforced.</div>
					<a name="07042427000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 61 allows for future changes in the energy and postal service
sectors. It provides for the Secretary of State to make an order
prescribing a date on which the duty on regulators to prescribe
complaint handling standards will change to a power to do so. Before
making such an order, the Secretary of State must consult the
regulator, the new council and other persons as appropriate.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column129" />Column number: 129</div>
					<a name="07042427000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment is required to
allow for future changes in the energy and postal services market that
may make the requirement for regulators to prescribe complaint handling
standards obsolete. Any decision by the Secretary of State to remove
the duty in question will be informed by representations
madein the consultation and in particular the views
ofthe regulator on the continuing need or otherwiseof
the standards. For example, in the postal services sector the
UK&#146;s mail market was opened to competition only recently, on 1
January 2006. Over time, stronger competitive pressures might result in
greater incentives for firms to deal effectively with consumer
complaints in order to win or retain a larger share of the market. When
all firms in the market meet or exceed the prescribed standards, the
prescription of complaint handling standards might no longer be
necessary. I am sure that hon. Members will recognise that that is in
line with better regulation
principles.</div>
					<a name="07042427000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 73, in the name of my right hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge,
Chryston and Bellshill, raises a reasonable point: the need to ensure
that regulated providers</div>
					<a name="07042427000259"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;collate information on the number
of complaints received by subject-matter of a complaint, or the
description of a person making a
complaint.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07042427000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I
can reassure my right hon. Friend that that is provided for already in
the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07042427000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 43(2)
provides for the regulator
to</div>
					<a name="07042427000045"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;prescribe standards
in relation to all consumer complaints, or...complaints of a kind
specified&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07042427000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 43(3)
states that, complaints can be specified</div>
					<a name="07042427000260"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;by reference to the
subject-matter of a complaint, or the description of person making a
complaint.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07042427000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us assume
that standards prescribed apply to all complaints received. In order to
comply with the relevant requirements detailed in schedule 5, and to
provide the regulator with information regarding compliance, providers
must record all complaints received and standards relating to
them.</div>
					<a name="07042427000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule 5 to
the Bill amends the ElectricityAct 1989, the Gas Act 1986 and
the Postal ServicesAct 2000, to require regulators to collect
information on compliance with standards, and gives the
regulatornew powers to direct its regulated provider to do
that. Clause 45 also places a duty on the new council to publish
appropriate statistical information about levels of compliance by
regulated providers with the prescribed complaint handling standards.
For that reason, amendment No. 73 is
unnecessary.</div>
					<a name="07042427000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
complaints, in a previous sitting of the Committee, my hon. Friend the
hon. Member for Ealing, North, raised the question of how complaints
about the activities of the new council would be dealt with. The
parliamentary health service ombudsman investigates
complaints about Government Departments, their agencies and certain
other public bodies in the UK accused of having not acted properly or
fairly, or of having provided a poor service. The Bill makes provision
for complaints about the activities of the new national consumer
council to be subject to the same procedure. That is set out in
paragraph 37 of schedule 1.</div>
					<a name="07042427000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the basis of my
explanations, I hope that hon. Members, including my right hon. Friend
the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill, will be minded 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column130" />Column number: 130</div>to withdraw their amendments, in favour of the Government amendments,
which have been designed to address all the issues raised in another
place and this
Committee.</div>
					
					<a name="07042427000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07042427000301"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Mark Prisk</b> (Hertford and Stortford) (Con): Thank you,
Mr. Weir. I, too, welcome you to the Chair for
today&#146;s
deliberations.</div>
					<a name="07042427000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 33, 34 and 30, which are in my name and that of my hon. and right
hon. Friends, are probing amendments. I have to say, on this occasion,
I am encouraged that that probing has generated that positive reaction
from the Minister. We welcome the Government&#146;s recognition of
our view, which has been discussed here and in another place, of the
need for effective complaint handling standards. I believe that that is
essential for good business service, as he alluded to, and for
meaningful reform of consumer
redress.</div>
					<a name="07042427000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Interestingly,
the Government&#146;s regulatory impact assessment relating to the
amendments echoes that point. It argues that requiring companies in the
energy and postal services sectors to adhere to complaints handling
standards will ensure that more customer complaints are dealt with
first hand by the regulated provider to the satisfaction of the
consumer. So we are at one on the principle, which is very
encouraging.</div>
					<a name="07042427000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
amendments seek to ensure that regulators put in place effective
standards through the simple device of prescribing
&#147;shall&#148; rather than &#147;may&#148;. However, I
recognise entirely that, in content and on the nature of the powers
provided, the Government&#146;s amendments are more comprehensive,
flexible and, indeed, more sophisticated. Again, the regulatory impact
assessment recognises that we are dealing with standards and not
procedures, which is important. I know that a number of players in the
field are concerned about a prescriptive approach to procedures, so
that is understandable. However, that is not what we are debating. The
Government propose to establish standards. How each company responds to
that will be up to them. Good companies with good procedures in place
have nothing to fear from the amendments. On that basis, I am pleased
that the Government have recognised the strength of the argument that
we put both here and in another place, and I will be more than happy to
support the Government amendments. I will not, therefore, press
amendments Nos. 33, 34 and 30 or, in due course, amendment No. 36 to a
vote.</div>

Mr. Weir, I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to

Friend&#146;s support. He does not realise how appropriate that test
would have been this morning.</div>
					<a name="07042427000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us return to amendment No.
73, before we test your patience any further, Mr. Weir. That
would
insert:</div>
					<a name="07042427000261"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;(3A)
The regulations must require a regulated provider to collate
information on the number of complaints received by subject-matter of a
complaint, or the description of a person making a
complaint.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07042427000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am half
convinced by what the Minister has said. However, those who advise me
and, if I am not mistaken, Energywatch&#151;if I am mistaken, I
apologise&#151;have not, in the absence of further information from
my right hon. Friend, been convinced that the Bill is as explicit on
those matters as we would wish it to be. Therefore, I offer this
probing amendment. As I argued on Second Reading, in order to spot
trends or weaknesses in the industries, the new NCC will need access to
accurate, transparent data. However, as it will not be fielding most
complaints, it will not be in a position to collate the
data.</div>
					<a name="07042427000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 43
requires suppliers to deal effectively with complaints, and later
clauses require information on such matters to be made publicly
available. For example, clause 45 requires the new council to publish
statistics on the compliance of suppliers, and clause 46 requires
suppliers to communicate information tothe public. All of that
is welcome. However, my contention, and the raison d&#146;être
of the amendment, is that there is nothing between those two to say
that suppliers must keep track of the data needed to fulfil those
requirements. If I am right, then when the NCC attempts to publish
statistics on complaint handling, suppliers will be justified in saying
that no records have been kept. Perhaps my right hon. Friend will
clarify that later. I shall be glad to be told that I have got it
wrong, in which case I will not press the amendment, but the point is
worth putting. The amendment seeks to close the loophole, if it exists,
and to ensure that reliable, transparent data will be provided to the
NCC in order to facilitate evidence-based policy making by the new
council. Some might ask why I seek to be so firm about suppliers. Let
me be blunt. I do not believe that they have served the public
well.</div>
					<a name="07042427000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not alone
in taking that view. A headline in this morning&#146;s <i class="I">Daily
Record </i>reads:</div>
					<a name="07042427000064"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Power

ditching ScottishPower&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07042427000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Later on in the paper another supplier
spends a full page telling us how inadequate Scottish Power is,
particularly in providing information, the very point that my amendment

political balance, indicating how the Committee&#146;s thinking is
perhaps ahead of the world outside, some of us might have seen in the

							<b class="B">Lorely
Burt</b> (Solihull) (LD): I welcome you to another exciting
day on this Bill, Mr. Weir. We are pleased that the
Government have paid attention to the amendments tabled in another
place requiring the regulator to prescribe standards for complaints
handling. It should be noted that Ofgem and Postcomm were not very keen
on this idea. But we certainly feel that it goes to the heart of the
matter of whether companies themselves be able to have full control
over all complaint handling. The right hon. Member for Coatbridge,
Chryston and Bellshill mentioned earlier that although we have a
requirement for competition, and competition will drive service, it is
still not necessarily in the company&#146;s interests to gold-plate
service unless it will result in bottom-line profits. We support the
amendment. The question is this: would redress schemes on their own be
a big enough stick to force companies to raise their
game?</div>
					<a name="07042427000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
question is do these companies have the physical ability to take on the
extra volume of complaints when Energywatch and Postwatch are
abolished? We saw stories in the press last week involving British Gas,
which indicate that there are one or two problems that need to be
addressed.</div>
					<a name="07042427000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 60 is highly commendable, but amendment No. 61 seems to take back
with one hand what the other hand has just given. It gives more leeway 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column133" />Column number: 133</div>
						than we would have wished to see. I take it from the
Conservative Members that there is no desire to push this matter to a
vote. However, we certainly wouldhave preferred if we could
have voted separately onthe two amendments and we would have
liked tosee amendment No. 61 not being implemented.
Nevertheless, in the light of the conciliatory attitude from the
Conservative Members, to push that amendment to a vote would be
somewhat churlish.</div>
					<a name="07042427000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have supported amendment No.33, which the Conservatives tabled. I
appreciate that the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford is going to
withdraw it, but we think that that amendment is the one that the
Government should have made in the first place.</div>
					<a name="07042427000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">As far as amendment No. 34 is
concerned, that is another proposed change from &#147;may&#148; to
&#147;shall&#148;, which again we support. We think that amendment
No. 30 is very important. It matters because Energywatch in particular
keeps detailed records on complaints by categories and how complaints
are broken down&#151;the capture of that data in that way&#151;is,
we feel, very important
indeed.</div>
					<a name="07042427000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">We certainly
would support amendment No. 73, which was tabled by the right hon.
Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill. We feel very strongly
that complaints data is useless until and unless it is broken down. So
we would certainly support that
amendment.</div>
					
					<a name="07042427000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07042427000310"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> First, I again thank my right hon. Friend the
Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill for the passionate way in
which he has pursued this issue. I hope to reassure him, not simply for
the purposes of asking him to withdraw the amendment. What he has
expressed, describing what has goneon and what continues to go
on, shows a totally unacceptable situation. That is why in this Bill we
have given such extensive powers regarding redress; that is why these
amendments are set out in the way that they are. They incentivise the
industry to clean up its act. If the industry does not do so, it will
potentially face having to make, each day, compensation payments of
significant amounts, along with the loss of reputation in a market
place that is filled with alternative providers of the services that
they seek to provide.</div>
					<a name="07042427000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">So it is important that, as we
approach this subject in the way that we are, that we incentivise
improvements; build on the good practice that exists, and, where good
practice does not exist, create good practice and give the relevant
powers to the regulator to do that.</div>
					<a name="07042427000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposal improves the
situation regarding both regulators and companies. We know, because
both companies and regulators have been telling us during the
consultation process and since, that great strides have been made in
the sector to improve performance, and that improvement is set against
a backdrop of difficult issues for the sector. For example, British Gas
claims that the issues that it faces are due to migrating 14 million
customers into a new billing system. As a consequence of that, we know
that there have been substantial problems in the implementation of that
system.</div>
					<a name="07042427000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
situation currently stands, there is little that customers can do but
wring their hands. After this Bill becomes law, they can do more than
wring their hands; they will have not only a complaints procedure, but,
if 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column134" />Column number: 134</div>the matter is not resolved, they will have a procedure that will allow
them compensation, including financial compensation, for the failure to
respond effectively to their
complaint.</div>
					<a name="07042427000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right
hon. Friend asked me to ensure that there is an umbilical cord between
the provider, the regulator and the NCC. I want to reassure him on that
point. <i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.]</i> I know that it is a three-way
umbilical cord, but I think that I am entitled to some licence. Clause
20 requires the new council to enter into co-operation arrangements
with designated bodies such as the OFT, which supports Consumer Direct.
That is intended to allow information about complaint numbers and
trends to be sent to and used by the NCC.
</div>
					<a name="07042427000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">In each part of the
process, whether involving a provider, a regulator or the NCC,
information is important, not only for establishing trends, but to
confirm whether there is compliance with the customer complaints
processes and to identify the areas in which significant customer
complaints are received for a particular company and what that company
must do in conjunction with the regulator to resolve those issues. We
also need to know the issues and trends that will require the NCC to
improve complaint-handling processes and to improve and extend redress
schemes. Information is a critical factor in ensuring that the system
works effectively at all levels. My right hon. Friend is absolutely on
the money on this issue, which is why I want to reassure him and why I
took care in talking about his amendment to clause 43 and its
relationship to schedule 5 and the relationship of those provisions to
clause 20.</div>
					<a name="07042427000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the Bill is to put the building blocks together, which will
show that ours is a comprehensive approach. As we move into the
implementation phase, I assure the Committee that I will review all the
points that are raised here. Whence they are raised is irrelevant; I
aim to ensure that all the practical comments made here are reflected
by the implementation of the proposals. Since the debate in the Lords,
we have taken a great deal of time to consider the bringing forward of
the amendments. I have acted in good faith. I thank the hon. Member for
Hertford and Stortford for his kindness, although to extract a
political point it was he who first took up the idea. We will not argue
about that. The main thing is that there was a level playing field, in
that everybody recognised the need for incentives. I hope that I have
reassured my right hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and
Bellshill that there is a deliberate link between the different
elements. I shall write to him during the development of the
implementation strategy to discuss it with him in detail, so that he
can be certain that what I am saying will happen in practice.</div>
					<a name="07042427000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Solihull
made a criticism of the sunset clause&#151;I think that that is the
jargon that is used in the industry. I have a reputation for being in
favour of red tape and bureaucracy, but that is not true. I never count
employment rights and the minimum wage as red tape; they are
reasonable, decent measures and I am pleased to say that I think that
the party of the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford now accepts
that. Amendment No. 61 will merely facilitate market changes in the
event of improved handling and complaints processes. There will be
potential, after 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column135" />Column number: 135</div>public consultation by the Secretary of State and if the regulation is
redundant, to secure changes under the provision. That is all that the
amendment will do. It is not a back-door policy; it will not undermine
the principle set out in amendment No. 60, but it is a process that has
been widely used, and reasonably so, in the last few years.</div>
					<a name="07042427000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Until the hon. Member for
Solihull made her remarks, I thought that there was a common purpose in
regulatory matters and that if improvements in the market place made it
clear that a regulation would become redundant, that should be accepted
after consultation and an evidence-based assessment. Amendment No. 61
does not give with one hand and take away with the other, as the hon.
Lady so luridly put it. I hope that with those explanations, hon.
Members will accept my amendments and that we can proceed with
improving the
Bill.</div>

							<a name="07042427000311"></a>Mr.
Clarke:
						</b> My right hon. Friend is always remarkably
convincing. Nevertheless, I hope he will agree that it was right for
the Committee to take the opportunity of amendment No. 73 to give these
issues an airing, even before we read the <i class="I">Daily Record </i>and the

umbilical cord. I also welcome what he said about information being a
critical factor. It is at the heart of everything that we are trying to
achieve and was the purpose of amendment No. 73.</div>

that is typical of the Committee, but consistent with the clear

(b).</div>
					<a name="07042427000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">This simple,
probing amendment would remove the Secretary of State&#146;s
administrative role when setting up a redress scheme and leads to a
single, simple question for the Minister: will he explain why the
Secretary of State would need to directly administer a scheme? It is
important that redress schemes are approved by a local regulator, but
it is also important that they are independent of central Government,
and are seen to be such. Therefore, could the Minister explain why the
Government deemed it necessary to be so involved, directly or
indirectly, in the administration of redress schemes? What exactly
could the Secretary of State do that the regulator could
not?</div>
					
					<a name="07042427000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07042427000313"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for the spirit in
which he moved his amendment. I accept that it is a probing amendment,
and I hope that my response will explain fully the intention of clause
47. If he has any further questions to put to me, I will respond to
them, and I hope that he will then feel able to withdraw his
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07042427000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment relates to clause 47 and the redress provisions in this part
of the Bill. The clause will introduce a power for the Secretary of
State to require service providers in the energy and postal services
sectors to belong to a redress scheme. It will, in effect, give
consumers in those sectors greater assurance of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column137" />Column number: 137</div>achieving certainty in the resolution of complaints. So that there is no
doubt, I will explain how the measure will work in
practice.</div>
					<a name="07042427000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
Bill, the Secretary of State will be given the power to make an order
that requires regulated service providers in those sectors to belong to
an approved redress scheme. If minded to exercise the power, the
Secretary of State can consult the relevant regulator and others who
represent those with an interest in the
matter.</div>
					<a name="07042427000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of
that consultation includes the need to obtain confirmation of sectoral
redress requirements and to look at the appropriate scope of the
redress schemes. The Bill stipulates that, before making such an order,
the Secretary of State must be satisfied that there is at least one
qualifying redress scheme that regulated service providers can join or
that such a scheme will be in existence when the order comes into
force. That is critical. Parliament, through the Secretary of State,
has a role to play in this. Having set out the principle of redress
schemes in the Bill, it must ensure that they are established in
practice and within the context of the clauses on the standards
expected of the schemes.</div>
					<a name="07042427000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth emphasising that we
have no reason to believe that at least one suitable scheme for each
sector will not be established by industry. However, we need to cover
all eventualities, and in the highly unlikely event of a scheme not
being established by industry, the clause contains provision for the
Secretary of State to establish one. That is also critical, as it is
Parliament&#146;s role. There is all-party consensus on establishing
redress schemes on behalf of the consumer. Therefore, we must take
responsibility in extreme circumstances&#151;and they would be
extreme&#151;to make sure that a redress scheme is established. Hence
clause 47(1)(b) allows for the establishment of a redress scheme
administered by the Secretary of State or by a person appointed by him.
That will provide an additional guarantee that a qualifying redress
scheme will exist for regulated providers in the energy and postal
services sector, to comply with an order made by the Secretary of
State.</div>
					<a name="07042427000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">To be perfectly
clear, under these provisions, the term &#147;redress scheme&#148;
holds the same meaning regardlessof whether it is established
under clause 47(1)(a) by industry and approved by a regulator, or
underclause 47(1)(b) and administered by the Secretary of
State or by a person appointed by him. Hon. Members can rest assured
that, if it were necessary for the Secretary of State to use the
fall-back provisions contained in clause 47(1)(b), there would be no
compromise over the need for the independent person to be independent.
It would still be possible for consumer complaints to be made to, and
investigated and determined by, an independent person. That would be
based on the principles set out in the legislation.</div>
					<a name="07042427000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 47(7) provides that, in
designating a scheme in relation to regulated providers under clause
47(1)(b), the Secretary of State must be satisfied that the scheme
meets the same criteria for approval by a regulator as those set out in
clause 49. The important assurance that the hon. Gentleman wants is
that, if the Secretary of State were to establish a scheme in extreme
circumstances, it would not be&#151;in popular parlance &#151;a
Mickey Mouse scheme; in all respects, it must at 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column138" />Column number: 138</div>
						least be compatible with a scheme established under
clause 47(1)(a). Therefore, I can say with certainty that this
provision is not a stop-gap to fulfil in practice what is set down in
the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07042427000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
will not provide the Secretary of State with the power&#151;if ever
it had to be exercised&#151;to provide a second-class or third-class
scheme, or a scheme that complies with the law but not with the spirit
of the law. It is very important that, if we have to do this in
extremis, we do it on the basis of fulfillingthe commitment in
the legislation to ensure that all consumers in those sectors are
covered by a redress scheme. I hope that, given that assurance, the
hon. Gentleman will be minded to withdraw his
amendment.</div>
					
					<a name="07042427000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07042427000314"></a>Mr.
Prisk:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his remarks. I
would not imagine for a moment that the current Secretary of State
would organise a Mickey Mouse redress scheme, and I am delighted that
the Minister has confirmed that.</div>
					<a name="07042427000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">The main point is the use of
the word &#147;administered&#148;. If the word
&#147;established&#148; had been used, there would have been no
concern in my mind. I agree with the Minister that, quite
understandably, if we wish to have redress schemes, we must ensure that
the Government can put them into practice if they exist. Therefore, I
understand the use of the word &#147;administered&#148;, but I am
not entirely sure whether the Department would wish to run such a
scheme directly, although the Secretary of State reserves the power to
appoint someone else to run it for him That was the essence of my
inquiry.</div>
					<a name="07042427000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I
was assured by the fact that the Minister made it absolutely clear that
the provision would be used only in the most extreme circumstances
where,for whatever unforeseen reason, such a scheme
wasnot available. Having wished it to occur, it would be
peculiar if the Government were unable to put that wish into practice,
having legislated for it. Therefore, on that basis and having had that
clarity put on record, I am more than happy to beg to ask leave to
withdraw the amendment.</div>

						</b> I want to probe the Minister a little and get one or
two assurances from him. Liberal Democrat Members are a little worried
about multiple redress schemes, which, among commercial entities, may
prompt a race to the bottom. Therefore, we are interested to know what
the rationale is and how the Government will ensure that, if there are
multiple redress schemes, they can adhere to a good minimum standard,
to ensure that there is no race to the bottom.
</div>
					<a name="07042427000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would like to know
whether there will be an ombudsman scheme. We understand the logic in
having the scheme for gas and water supplies, but we have one or two
concerns about the Post Office, because the typical redress offered by
the Post Office is a bookof first-class stamps. Given that the
ombudsman or redress scheme will require evidence to
demonstratethe problem, we are stretching our imagination to
understand what the evidence might be in such small-scale complaints or
problems that might apply. For example, if the Post Office has not
delivered a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column139" />Column number: 139</div>parcel, will someone need proof of posting? If the Post Office is
closed, must someone stand in front of the CCTV and wave an envelope
around before popping it into the post box as proof of
posting?</div>
					<a name="07042427000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we are
promising a redress scheme, people have the right to expect a redress
scheme. We are getting rid of watchdogs, so redress schemes will have
to be really good. Can the Minister perhaps give an example of a
suitable redress scheme that might apply in the circumstances that I
have
outlined?</div>

						</b> I thank the hon. Lady for her question. I would
like to point out that we are not getting rid of watchdogs; we are
creating a new, more effective independent one. For the first time, all
sectors will have redress schemes. What is the point of having a
watchdog with no teeth?</div>
					<a name="07042427000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Liberal Democrats are
strangely wedded to maintaining the old system on the basis of
&#147;Well, that&#146;s what&#146;s there&#148;. Actually, we
believe that a great deal of improvement can be made in all the
sectors, and that is why, for the first time, there will be at least
one redress scheme per sector&#151;a redress scheme and regulator
with teeth and a new body representing consumers, also with
teeth.</div>

am</div>
					<a name="07042427000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill leaves
open the possibility of a regulator creating just one scheme for each
sector. Of course, we have set out and debated the high standards that
will apply, so no Mickey Mouse schemes will get in under the radar, as
I put it in the last discussion. No schemes will be set up in any of
the sectors that do not meet and operate to the standards set out. That
is important. Our policy preference is for one scheme per sector, but
we cannot prescribe that because it will be a matter for the regulator,
and rightly
so.</div>
					<a name="07042427000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Circumstances
might change in years to come to facilitate more than one scheme in a
particular sector. Changes might take place in the market for which the
current arrangements are inappropriate and act as a barrier to other
entrants to the market. Amendments might, therefore, need to be made.
That is the reason for the flexibility&#151;not to rush downwards, as
thehon. Lady said, but to ensure that, in a changing
marketplace, consumers&#146; rights are always paramount. Changes
made in the future will improve people&#146;s rights, not undermine
them. That is
important.</div>
					<a name="07042427000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rest
assured, the clause will establish an essential means of ensuring
effective schemes covering all sectors in the Bill and, hopefully,
after 2008 and further consultation, the water industry as well. I hope
that, well before 2008, those schemes will be operating effectively. I
hope that those explanations have helped the hon. Lady with her

I hope to give a detailed response to help hon. Members.</div>
					<a name="07042427000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 35 relates to
redress schemes under clause 49 and the matters that a regulator must
take into account prior to approving a redress scheme in its sector.
The interests of &#147;relevant consumers&#148; is one of the
aspects that a regulator is required to consider when approving a
redress scheme. By deleting the word &#147;relevant&#148;, the
amendment would require the regulator to have regard to the interests
of consumers in general when dealing with the regulator&#146;s
regulated providers, instead of to those specified as &#147;relevant
consumers&#148; in the second column of the table in clause
42.</div>
					<a name="07042427000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;Relevant
consumers&#148; of the regulated providers listed in clause 42(1) are
defined in the Bill. For gas supply licences, it
is:</div>
					<a name="07042427000264"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A person
who is a consumer in relation to gas supplied by a gas supplier (within
the meaning of Part 1 of that
Act)&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07042427000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">or, on

					<a name="07042427000265"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
person (other than a gas licensee) who is a consumer in relation to
services provided by a gas transporter (within the meaning of Part 1 of
that Act).&#148;</div>
					<a name="07042427000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
the second definition was an amendment in another place following a
cross-party debate.</div>
					<a name="07042427000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
electricity supply licences, it
is:</div>
					<a name="07042427000266"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A person
who is a consumer in relation to electricity supplied by an electricity
supplier (within the meaning of part 1 of that

licences:</div>
					<a name="07042427000267"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
person (other than an electricity licensee) who is a consumer in
relation to services provided by an electricity distributor (within the
meaning of Part 1 of that
Act).&#148;</div>
					<a name="07042427000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">For postal
services, it
is:</div>
					<a name="07042427000268"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A person
who is a consumer in relation to relevant postal
services&#148;</div>
					<a name="07042427000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">within the
meaning of section 41 in part 2 of the Postal Services Act 2000. For
water, it
is:</div>
					<a name="07042427000269"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A person
who is a consumer in relation to services provided by a water
undertaker, sewerage undertaker or licensed water supplier in its
capacity as
such.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07042427000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
no intention to attempt to limit or exclude any particular consumers in
the sectors to which the redress provisions are to apply&#151;the
energy and postal services sectors. The main point to note is that the
provisions are to be applied by more than one regulator, so each will
be required to take account of the interests of relevant consumers in
relation to its regulated providers. The expression
&#147;relevant consumer&#148; refers to the consumers identified in
the table inclause 42, as I have just
explained.</div>
					<a name="07042427000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Orders made
by the Secretary of State concerning membership of a redress scheme
introduced under clause 47 will be binding on regulated providers. It
follows that the consumers in a position to benefitfrom the
introduction of the redress provisions will be those who qualify by
virtue of the fact that they are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column141" />Column number: 141</div>consumers of services supplied by those regulated providers. They are
the relevant consumers whose interests a regulator must take into
account when deciding whether to give approval for a redress scheme. I
hope that that explanation will provide clarification for the hon.
Gentleman and encourage him to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07042427000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">We expect
that service providers will establish their own redress schemes, which
will be funded by their members. The members of the schemes will decide
and agree on their funding structures, but we expect that they are
likely to follow a pattern similar to that of existing redress schemes
whereby a subscription fee is levied, typically based on the size of a
firm or its turnover, coupled with a case fee payable by each member
for every case referred to the scheme. The scheme is then free to
consumers.</div>
					<a name="07042427000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">The redress
schemes are expected to operate on a cost recovery basis. General
practice is for fees to be set at a level that covers the costs of the
scheme, based on the anticipated number of complaints. Fees can then be
reviewed regularly and adjusted to reflect any differences between the
actual number of complaints received and the estimated level of
complaints.</div>
					<a name="07042427000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly, any scheme
administered by the Secretary of State would operate purely on a cost
recovery basis and could not be profit-making. Any subscription costs
or case fees charged to members of a scheme would be set and
periodically adjusted only to cover the costs of running the scheme. I
hope that that provides additional clarification. The schemes will not
be profit-making enterprises; fees will cover their costs to ensure
that they are free in all circumstances to the consumer who wants to
make a complaint and have it dealt with
effectively.</div>

Burt:
						</b> Our understanding is that the amendment is intended
to remove the flexibility of the regulator to withdraw general or
specific parts of a scheme. I have a deep and dark suspicion that the
Minister will say that it is important to keep the flexibility so that
the scheme might run as well as possible, and I have a great deal of
sympathy with that. However, will he provide an example of how some of
a redress scheme could work, but not all of

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07042427000322"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> I thank hon. Members for their comments and
questions.</div>
					<a name="07042427000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 39 relates to the redress scheme approval provisions of clause 50,
and the discretion available to a regulator in considering the
withdrawal of approval for a redress scheme. Circumstances might occur
that make it necessary for a regulator that has given approval for a
redress scheme to operate to consider withdrawing that approval. The
Bill allows for a regulator to have the option either to withdraw
approval from a whole scheme or to do so in relation to a specific type
of consumer complaint. The hon. Lady was right to say that it is the
Government&#146;s view that the regulator must have the flexibility
necessary to protect consumers.</div>
					<a name="07042427000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those circumstances could
include problems in the operation of the scheme, including processes,
service standards, outcomes of cases or other issues affecting its
effectiveness. Other circumstances might arise in future, such as the
introduction of new regulations that guarantee automatic compensation
in respect of certain types of complaint, resulting in less need for
the redress scheme to focus on a particular class of complaint. That
takes us back to a point made bymy right hon. Friend the
Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill in amendment No. 73. For
the measure to work in practice, information is required on, for
example, service standards; the outcomes of cases; the interaction
between the processes and the individual consumer who makes a
complaint; and, in later years, complaints of such a nature that they
will be guaranteed automatic compensation. The redress scheme will then
be able to concentrate on thedifficult, complex cases that
need to be resolved in an effective way.</div>
					<a name="07042427000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The effect of the amendment
would be to removethe discretion to withdraw approval in
relation to consumer complaints of a specified description. That would
not be helpful for consumers, because it would remove the flexibility
that regulators require to ensure that schemes operate effectively on
their behalf. Redress schemes are about advocacy and achieving
appropriate compensation&#151;whatever it might be&#151;for the
consumer. Therefore, we have to be absolutely diligent in the way in
which we operate schemes, and must be able to effect change if change
is required.</div>
					<a name="07042427000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that the amendment is intended to be a probing measure, but
I have to say that being obliged to take a blanket approach to the
withdrawal of approval for a scheme would risk disadvantaging consumers
in areas in which the scheme is operating satisfactorily. That goes to
a point made by hon. Lady. On occasions, a scheme might not operate
effectively in a specific area, and the regulator will decide that
improvement is required. It would be nonsensical to have to withdraw
that scheme in areas in which it operates effectively. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column143" />Column number: 143</div>That would mean that thousands of genuine complaints were not resolved
effectively and the scheme would be brought into disrepute. In
addition, it would be unfair on the companies that were paying for it
to work; they would have a way of resolving disputes but would not be
able to use it, so would become the butt, as it were, of complaints
because complainants would have nowhere else to go to. Flexibility is
important so that schemes can operate satisfactorily and the regulator
can change anything that is unsatisfactory to resolve issues.</div>
					<a name="07042427000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">In deciding whether to approve
a redress scheme, a regulator must consider a number of factors, such
as the provisions of the scheme. We must ensure that those include the
interests of consumers and generally accepted principles of best
practice. Having given approval for a redress scheme covering
complaints in a range of categories such as billing, customer service
and metering, a regulator might need to withdraw approval in respect of
just one aspect of it. For example, a change in technology might mean
that the service being provided for a particular category of complaint
no longer met all the conditions on which approval had been given. It
would, therefore, have to change. This is about keeping up with changes
in a way that is not detrimental to the consumer who has a legitimate
complaint that needs to be resolved. The amendment could also result in
putting members of that scheme who would have a statutory requirement
to belong to an approved scheme at risk of being in breach of that
requirement if they are unable to find an appropriate alternative
scheme to
join.</div>

Burt:
						</b> Thank you, Mr. Weir. I shall speak first
about new clause 4, which would require estate agents to register with
the Office of Fair Trading. It is likely that for estate agents the
ombudsman will be the only redress scheme in this place. At present,
about 70 per cent. of estate agents are members of, and licensed for,
the redress scheme for home information packs. As the ombudsman is
doing a very attractive two-for-one offer at the moment, it is likely
that by the time the Bill has completed its proceedings the vast
majority will be members of the scheme.</div>
					<a name="07042427000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Despite the Minister&#146;s
comments earlier, the Liberal Democrats reiterate our concern about
competition for redress schemes and the possible danger of a race to
the bottom. However, we do not want to press that argument, because we
take the Minister&#146;s point.</div>
					<a name="07042427000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposal is about two
important things: first, positive, as opposed to negative, licensing.
It is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column145" />Column number: 145</div>important that a service should be good from the beginning; it is not
appropriate to wait until one has to pick up the pieces when things go
wrong.</div>
					
					<div class="hs_Para">Secondly, it is
about actively looking for compliance. The proposal will facilitate
things such as mystery shopping exercises. Consumers will not
necessarily know if they have been misadvised. For example, there may
be interests that the seller of a property may not be aware of, when a
lower price than might otherwise have been achieved is recommended.
Unless there are individuals such as mystery shoppers and an active,
positive constraint on how estate agents practice, the vast majority of
misdemeanours and mishandling against the interests of the consumer may
never come to
light.</div>
					<a name="07042427000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">As drafted, the
Bill will catch the absolute fraudsters but not the majority who
mislead customers in what for most people is the biggest purchase of
their lives, involving what to them is a very large amount of money. We
feel that this is more important than how much the fine should be when
those individuals are caught, which is covered by amendments 26 to 28.
I remind the committee that this was originally drafted with a Labour
colleague and was based on an amendment that we drafted in
collaboration with a Labour colleague. We would, therefore, like to ask
the Minister to reflect on how consumers will know if they are being
ripped off and losing thousands of pounds unless there is a positive
requirement for someone actively to look at
this.</div>
					<a name="07042427000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause
2, which is proposed in my nameand the name of others,
similarly relates to positive licensing as opposed to negative. Here,
we give the Secretary of State the power to designate a body of persons
as an approved body to which estate agents must belong, as opposed to
the Office of Fair Trading. This does the same thing, but in a
different way.</div>
					<a name="07042427000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
amendment was first tabled in another placeby the Earl of
Caithness. It does two new and very important things. It broadens the
scope of the Bill to incorporate lettings and, in subsection (2), it
lists the things that an estate agent&#151;or a member of a
scheme&#151;would have to do to be eligible to join. This includes
vital things like professional indemnity insurance; a minimum
requirement for professional development; and minimum competency
standards. This
introduces&#151;</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07042427000326"></a>Mr.
Clarke:
						</b> I listened carefully as the hon. Lady made her
case. How would that minimum competency be determined and who would
determine whether it met those standards?</div>
					
					<a name="07042427000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07042427000327"></a>Lorely
Burt:
						</b> The idea behind including a minimum competency
standard is that compulsory training could be introduced, but in a
flexible way. I think that it would be for the industry to determine
what those compulsory, but minimum standards ought to be.</div>
					<a name="07042427000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The National Association of
Estate Agents fully supports this new clause, because it creates a
level playing field and empowers and encourages the good estate agents
and attempts to weed out the bad. The Government have previously made
some encouraging remarks. They have said that they will look at this.
Has the Minister had an opportunity to reflect further and can he give
us any assurances?</div>

							<a name="07042427000328"></a>Mr.
Prisk:
						</b> The new clauses cite the arguments in favour of
positive licensing. If I may, I would like to address them
both.</div>
					<a name="07042427000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause
2 seeks to introduce higher standards of confidence by requiring all of
those who trade as estate agents to be a member of an approved body or
a trade organisation. While I wish&#151;as does the hon.
Lady&#151;to root out rogue estate agents and give greater confidence
to homebuyers and vendors, I have some reservations about this
approach. I should also preface my remarks by reminding members of the
Committee that I am a member of the Royal Institution of Chartered
Surveyors. I suspect that this is one of the organisations that the
hon. Lady has in mind in terms of the membership aspects of the new
clause.</div>
					<a name="07042427000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">My first
concern is that a members-only industryhas the potential to
create a barrier to entry for new players. After all, as it stands, the
new clause specifically requires firms to meet certain standards that
would require training and management procedures to be in place. The
principle of that is fine, but there are difficulties for new
entrants.</div>
					<a name="07042427000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
the new clause 2 requires that appropriate professional indemnity
insurance be secured. As anyone who has traded in this market will
know, itcan be extremely difficult for a professional firm,
particularly a new entrant, to secure insurance. It is especially
difficult for a new entrant to demonstrate the track record on which
the provision of insurance is often
dependent.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07042427000329"></a>Lorely
Burt:
						</b> I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
comments are not reassuring to me or to the many other people who have
suffered at the hands of estate agents. The thought that one can
receive a service from a new entrant to the market who is not required
to have a qualification and who has no insurance to provide for things
going wrong is not reassuring. Those should be minimum standards of
entry for anyone who professes to give advice to someone for the
biggest purchase of their life. If that is a barrier to entry for
people who are uninsured and untrained to give such advice, what other
measures would enable an individual to approach an estate agency with
confidence?</div>
					
					<a name="07042427000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07042427000330"></a>Mr.
Prisk:
						</b> I shall clarify that point for the hon. Lady. Her
new clause seeks specifically to have a requirement for membership of a
trade organisation. That is a separate, although important, matter from
having a qualification or having gone through a training
procedure. It is important to understand the
implications of the new clause. Of course we want to ensure that people
come into the industry with the right approach and from the right
background, but to require them to be a member of an organisation and
already to have indemnity insurance is to set an unrealistic
standard.</div>

						<a name="07042427000331"></a>
							<b class="B">Stephen
Pound</b> (Ealing, North) (Lab):The hon. Gentleman knows far
more about the subject than I do, but from the perspective of the
semi-literate layman,it appears that the new clause would
create a self-regulating cartel, which would be anti-competitive. From
the standpoint of his personal knowledge, will he either disabuse me of
that notion or confirm me in my prejudice?</div>

							<a name="07042427000332"></a>Mr.
Prisk:
						</b> I always hesitate to disabuse the hon. Gentleman.
In this instance, I am happy to say that much of what he says, albeit
in more colourful language than I might cautiously use, is absolutely
right. There is a danger that, under the new clause, it would be
difficult for new entrants to come into the market. I have always taken
the view that the consumer is often well protected if there is good
competition and turnover. If there is a requirement for new entrants to
be members of an organisation&#151;there might be several, such as
the National Association of Estate Agents, the Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors or others that the hon. Member for Solihull might
have in mind&#151;we could end up with a cartel, as the hon. Member
for Ealing, North,
said.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07042427000333"></a>Lorely
Burt:
						</b> I still do not feel reassured, particularly by the
idea that a new entrant to an industry can set up with no insurance
whatever. There is an assumption that competition will create some kind
of standard of service. I ask the hon. Gentleman to reflect on how that
can be achieved, because it seems to me that the more people who vie
for a customer&#146;s attention, where the customer is a
naïve&#151;nay,
semi-literate&#151;individual&#151;</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07042427000336"></a>Mr.
Prisk:
						</b> I was not sure what the end result of that
intervention was going to be. I shall be fair; the new clause has
serious drafting weaknesses, but I shall look at the intent behind the
words. The aim, quite rightly, is to rule out rogue estate agents. The
hon. Lady&#146;s chosen method is by setting higher standards of
confidence. My concern is that that is perhaps the wrong way to try to
tackle the
problem.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07042427000277"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div>
					<a name="07042427000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us be very
clear who we are talking about. The rogue estate agent&#151;that is
who we want to tackle&#151;is often a cunning and canny individual.
They know perfectly well how to work their way around the membership
rules of professional organisations. So, simply setting new rules will
not stop them. I share the hon. Lady&#146;s desire to tackle them and
root them out of the industry, both from the industry&#146;s point of
view and, more importantly, from the consumer&#146;s point of
view.</div>
					<a name="07042427000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I
think that the unintended consequenceof this particularly
restrictive new clause would be to further burden the law-abiding firm
with just more paperwork and costs. In that sense, this sort of members
only approach is trying to tackle the root of the problem through
competence, when, in truth, the real issue is ethics, not competence.
Ethics is the issue that we must address. That is why I do not feel
that this new clause is one that I can
support.</div>
					<a name="07042427000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 4
similarly seeks to tackle the issue through the route of positive
licensing. There is a perfectly reasonable aim behind it, as there is
with the hon. Lady&#146;s new clause. There are some pretty dreadful
practices undertaken by a minority, but nevertheless undertaken by some
estate agents, and we must 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column148" />Column number: 148</div>consider how we deal with that. Having said that, I would like to
commend the work of the Office of Fair Trading and the many local
trading standards officers who police the industry. I would also like
to commend the work of Which?; it has also sought to expose rogue
estate agents and it is right to continue that work. The key point here
is this: how will the powers of the Bill and the legislation that it
seeks to amend help us to tackle, catch and rule out rogue
agents?</div>
					<a name="07042427000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
although I applaud the sentiment that lies behind the two new clauses,
the real issue is how we deter such people from entering the industry;
we will debate serious fines later on, if we catch your eye,
Mr. Weir. Also, how do we stop those rogue agents from
continuing? I must say that the approach that the two new clauses
advocate&#151;the approach of positive licensing&#151;is one that I
am not convinced about.</div>
					<a name="07042427000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, mandatory registration
with the OFT would only work if the OFT has the means to screen all the
businesses thoroughly. Clearly, past criminal records can be identified
when the Home Office&#151;what remains of it&#151; is actually
working, but what other information would be required for such
registration to be
meaningful?</div>
					<a name="07042427000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
the rest of new clause 4 merely seems to restate the provisions that
are in the Estate AgentsAct 1979, or indeed in the Bill; for
example, the issue about a liability on maximum fines for some
reconvictions.</div>
					<a name="07042427000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
not saying that there is not a case for raising standards; there is. I
am not saying that there is not a case for trying to change practices,
in order to make it harder for rogue agents to do what they do.
However, I am just not convinced that the measures outlined in new
clause 4 are
adequate.</div>
					<a name="07042427000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">What matters
is what the Government&#146;s approach is going to be. We need to
know whether there will be a clear commitment from the Minister, and
therefore from the Government, to ensuring that the OFT and the trading
standards officers will have the ability and the resources to crack
down on rogue agents. I know that the Minister has made that commitment
clear on Second Reading. However, what we need to understand better are
the Minister&#146;s views as to whether he thinks that any form of
positive licensing would be something that he could
support.</div>
					
					<a name="07042427000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07042427000337"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> I will give a detailed response to the hon.
Member for Solihull. This is one of those clauses that deals with a
genuine issue that, for many years, people in the political field, the
professions and consumer advocacy bodies have spent a great deal of
time investigating. In some instances, they have been able to expose
acts that are totally unacceptable in undermining the individual
consumer.</div>
					<a name="07042427000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important to consider the issues related to what people call positive
licensing, and the alternatives to it. I tend not to use the phrase
&#147;positive licensing&#148; myself. Why? It gives the impression
that, if there is a genuine alternative, that alternative is a negative
approach. In drafting the Bill, I wanted to do the best by the consumer
and those elements in the industry&#151;the overwhelming
majority&#151;that want to support good practice and open up the
transparency of relationships within the industry to protect not only
their reputation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column149" />Column number: 149</div>but their ability to work effectively in a marketplace, providing goods
and services, against a minority of people who could have a
disproportionate effect on the purchase of a property because of their
unacceptable conduct in the running of their business and their
relationship with their
client.</div>
					<a name="07042427000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I
can explain in detail the intellectual thought processes behind our
approach to this and its evidential base. I know I will not be able to
persuade the hon. Lady, who has a legitimate view about she would like
us to proceed, and nor am I attemptingto do so. She may want
to divide the Committee. However, I shall give her a detailed response
which will try to set out the reasons why we are doing this in the way
that we are and not in a way that people would describe as
&#147;positive
licensing&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07042427000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
53 gives effect to schedule 6, which makes provision for the Secretary
of State to make an order requiring all persons who engage in estate
agency work in the United Kingdom to belong to an approved redress
scheme. Schedule 6 sets out the detail of the estate agents&#146;
redress scheme provisions and how they will be enforced. More
specifically, it enables the Secretary of State to make an order to
require persons engaged in estate agency work in relation to
residential property to be members of an approved redress scheme. It
allows enforcement officers to issue penalty charge notices if an
estate agent is in breach of the duty to be a member of an approved
redress scheme. It requires enforcement officers to inform the Office
of Fair Trading of estate agents not complying with this duty and
finally it defines &#147;residential property&#148;. Clause 53 also
amends section 3(1) of the Estate Agents Act 1979, so that not
belonging to an approved redress scheme will become a ground for the
OFT to issue an order banning unfit persons from practising. It will
affect both individuals and companies. This is vitally important. It is
a major tool, in the hands not just of consumers, but the regulator and
those in the industry who want to operate in market in the sure and
certain knowledge that they are not competing against dodgy characters
in dodgy companies with dodgy practices, but in an open and fair way,
providing excellent and transparent services for the consumers who want
to use their company for the purpose of buying and selling
property.</div>
					<a name="07042427000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want to
ensure that consumers have access to redress for complaints against
estate agents related to home buying and selling. Having an ultimate
sanction of losing your livelihood should ensure that estate agents
comply with the obligation to belong to a redress scheme. That goes
back to a point that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for
Trade and Industry made earlier. My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing,
North also alluded to this. There are those out there at the moment who
believe that they can operate with impunity and consequently do quite
significant damage to individuals who wanted them to provide a
first-class service. That can range from a very big problem to a small
problem and nothing seems more challenging in terms of one&#146;s
mental well-being than buying or selling a property. We all know what I
am talking about.</div>
					<a name="07042427000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 2 seeks to increase the regulation of estate agents beyond what
is proposed in the Bill and seeks to introduce bureaucracy where I do
not think it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column150" />Column number: 150</div>is necessary. The Government are going further than
any Government before by putting in place redress
schemes to act as gatekeepers to the high street. If people are not in
it, they cannot practise. That is a big incentive. It is big and
legitimate barrier. It is not the kind of barrier that the hon. Member
for Hertford and Stortford described. For the first time, every
consumer will have the certainty of knowing when they walk into an
estate agent&#146;s office, that they have access to redress if
something goes wrong. For the first time, every consumer who has been
misled about a property will have access to redress. For the first
time, every seller who has had an offer withheld will be able to seek
redress. For the first time, all consumers who received a bad service,
even if an estate agent has not acted illegally, will have access to
redress.</div>
					<a name="07042427000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">This comes to
a point that the hon. Lady made in moving the amendment. She asked how
someone could tell that they had been badly treated. The Bill will
improve the audit trail for transactions by requiring estate agents to
make and keep records, including records of offer letters, not for six
weeks, six months, or a year or two, but for six
years.</div>
					<a name="07042427000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill gives
the OFT and trading standards officers the powers to go into premises
and inspect records in a wider range of circumstances. That will enable
them to investigate all breaches of the law and of undertakings given
to enforcers, and not just criminal offences. The Bill also expands the
circumstances in which the Office of Fair Trading may consider the
fitness of an estate agent to practise, and take regulatory action
against them. That is in addition to the estate agents regulations 1981
and the Money Laundering Regulations 2003, which also contain a
requirement to maintain records, for obvious reasons. This is a huge
improvement, even when a consumer does not realise what has happened,
and it allows the investigation of the operations of a company that
someone has expressed concern about. These audit trails and that
information will provide valuable opportunities for trading standards
officers and the OFT to investigate complaints, or cases in which there
has been a cover-up by an organisation in relation to its relationship
with its consumers.</div>

						</b> I have been listening carefully to what the Minister
has said, and I welcome the requirement for estate agents to provide
satisfactory and appropriate records for an audit trail. However, a
customer still needs to have an idea about whether he or she has been
&#147;ripped off&#148;&#151;and I cannot think of a
more parliamentary phrase&#151;before anyone
investigates a complaint. The point of these new clauses is that they
make provision for something like a mystery shopper, so that a company
that is systematically misleading customers can be detected; otherwise,
it may not
be.</div>

						</b> The hon. Lady makes an interesting point. I know of
three cases in which people have offered their houses for sale through
an estate agent and sold them to an apparently legitimate purchaser,
but it subsequently transpired that the estate agent was making the
purchase through an agent, who happened to be a member of the same
fraternal organisation. How would the victim know about that without

						</b> I am trying to suggest to you that that is what
we are trying to provide in practice. It is not just an audit trail in
respect of an individual, but in respect of the whole company. One
complaint may be made or one concern expressed, but it is only when the
OFT, the trading standards officers, or both get into the company that
they can look at the extensive records. At the moment, that is not
possible. The activity that my hon. Friend was talking about is already
a criminal offence. In addition, there would now be a redress scheme
for compensation, and, when someone pleads guilty to such a serious
offence, I imagine that the OFT would take action to close the entire
business.</div>

							<a name="07042427000342"></a>Mr.
Prisk:
						</b> Without wishing to interrupt the Minister&#146;s
flow, I must say that the point here is that, rather than try to
second-guess what may or may not be in the mind of a mystery shopper,
we should put a system in place that deters those who would behave in
that way, whether an estate agency or other business. That would make
it crystal clear that these practices are unacceptable, that there is a
clear redress scheme, and that there are penalties, which such
businesses would rather not face. Therefore, the deterrent element is
important. Does the Minister
agree?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07042427000343"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> The hon. Member has put it more eloquently than
I have managed in the past five minutes, and I thank him. He is
absolutely right, and that is why the capacity to establish the records
and maintain them is so important as a deterrent. There must be
absolute certainty that there is an evidence trail and that it is an
offence not to maintain it. Failing to maintain the records in order to
try to get away with ripping somebody off or undertaking a dodgy
activity would itself be an offence. It might be a serious enough
offence for the individuals concerned&#151;separately or collectively
as a company&#151;to be prevented from practising. The Government has
a big role to play in incentivising industry, in terms not only of good
practice and the way in which companies are run, but of how industry
increases the skills of its staff. Significant financial pay-outs are
at stake&#151;for example, up to &#163;25,000 under the current
voluntary scheme&#151;so estate agents would be mad not to take up
the proposals.</div>

schemes for staff, to ensure that standards rise rather than fall, are
important and, as the survey published yesterday by Ernst and Young
shows, it is in a company&#146;s best interests to deal effectively
with customer complaints. That is the key to customer satisfaction.
Most companies providing goods and services that do that get a benefit
from it. Not only are they well run, but the customers want to buy
their goods and services because they are certain that if something
goes wrong it will be dealt with.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column152" />Column number: 152</div>
					<a name="07042427000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe that that approach
will give estate agents the incentive to address not only big issues,
such as not passing on offers and lying in respect of properties, which
my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North mentioned, but service
issues, such as not turning up to show people around and not returning
keys on time. Consumers will have access to redress for those things
too, even if they are not on the scale that would trigger serious
enforcement actions or investigations, including criminal
investigations.</div>
					<a name="07042427000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">Slapping on more bureaucracy
would be an easy option. Our approach will get the same results without
the disadvantages associated with blunt regulatory
measures.</div>

Burt:
						</b> The key to this is the point that I was struggling
to make earlier. When someone wishes to sell or buy a home, they cannot
necessarily tell from indications on the high street who has had
training and who has not, or who is a member of an appropriate scheme
and who is not. Every consumer, whether buying or selling, should be
able to expect a minimum standard of service. However, when they walk
through the door, there is no way in which uninitiated individuals can
tell whether the person whom they deal with has no experience or
insurance and does not provide a service that meets specified
standards. That is the situation that we seek to
address.</div>
					
					<a name="07042427000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07042427000345"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> I understand what the hon. Lady is saying.
However, estate agents, whether companies or individuals, must be
members of the redress scheme or they cannot practise, so somebody
walking throughthe door with a complaint&#151;whether a
small one or a major one&#151;will get redress. That does not happen
at the moment, except in the context of the recent scheme that will
build on good practice. However, the scheme will not cover two thirds
of the industry; it will cover all of it. That is important, and it
seems to be forgotten when we talk about the positive aspects of
licensing. We cannot get more positive in my view than preventing
people from practising unless they belong to the redress scheme.
Without that, they cannot open their doors, advertise or take in
customers. In future, the minute that any of us walks in the door, we
will have certainty that the individuals who we are dealing with, as
well as the company in which they are employed, must be part of the
redress scheme.</div>
					
					<a name="07042427000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07042427000346"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Ben Wallace</b> (Lancaster and Wyre) (Con): I understand the
Minister&#146;s point and recognise the correct angle of it. Are the
Government planning to publish a list, so that people can go online and
find out that estate agent X is listed under the redress scheme? If
that were the case, we would know; we would be able to
check.</div>
					
					<a name="07042427000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07042427000347"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> That information will be available through the
Office of Fair Trading and local trading standards offices. It will
also include whether regulatory action is being taken against someone,
including closing the organisation down. That information will be in
the public domain if an offence 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column153" />Column number: 153</div>has been committed, and I thank the hon. Gentleman for raising the
matter, which enabled me to make that point.</div>
					<a name="07042427000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">The OFT report on estate agents
looked in detail at licensing them. The OFT unearthed little evidence
that competency standards would prevent rogue agents from entering the
market. Its findings clearly showed that dodgy dealings are not the
result of a lack of qualifications or knowledge, but a lack of
integrity in the management and running of the company&#151;a point
made by the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford. That is why the
measures are so important as a disincentive and to provide certainty
that estate agents will be apprehended if they operate in those ways.
If necessary, individuals and the organisation as a corporate body will
not be allowed to offer services in what is an effective and lucrative
marketplace.</div>
					<a name="07042427000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">The OFT
concluded that licensing estate agents would raise costs for consumers
and inhibit competition in the industry, without delivering adequate
benefits to justify it. That is why, on an evidence base, the scheme in
the Bill was proposed. It has the benefits of being a positive scheme,
for which hon. Members have argued, and it has none of the disbenefits.
It provides certainty for consumers who come off the high street and
seek an estate agent&#146;s
services.</div>
					<a name="07042427000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
confident that requiring estate agents to belong to approved redress
schemes will improve standards in the industry, but we are not
takingany chances. The Bill lengthens the stick as well as
introducing a carrot. At the same time as requiring estate agents to
belong to an approved redress scheme, we are strengthening the 1979
Act&#146;s enforcement powers. The Bill will ensure that breaches of
statutory undertakings and enforcement orders, as well as criminal
offences, can result in an investigation of an estate agent&#146;s
fitness to practise, which will include its records as evidence. It
will enable enforcers to deal more effectively with rogue agents and
take them out of the market
altogether.</div>
					<a name="07042427000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause
4 may be dressed up as a lighter-touch regulation, but it just
replicates, in a confused way, what is already happening or will happen
shortly. First, the 1979 Act already requires estate agents to provide
information to the OFT and to trading standards officers. As I have
explained, the Bill will extend those powers, so that trading standards
officers can require information to investigate a much wider range of
wrongdoing&#151;a point made by the hon. Lady. If an agent fails to
provide that information, the OFT will be able to consider that
person&#146;s fitness to operate as an estate agent, and it could
lead to it ultimately banning him or her from practising. Their ability
to hide their wrongdoing by not supplying their records would be a
disastrous strategy if they tried to deploy it. They would end up with
the same result at an earlier stage and simply be banned from
practising. The threat of a banning order is a more serious deterrent
than the fine of &#163;5,000 proposed in new clause 4.</div>
					<a name="07042427000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the OFT already has a
statutory duty to keep the estate agency market under review, as
required under section 25 of the 1979 Act, and has a unit dedicated to
investigating complaints against estate agents and taking enforcement
action. It is a matter for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column154" />Column number: 154</div>the OFT how it carries out those functions and is not something that
needs to be set out in
statute.</div>
					<a name="07042427000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, if
the OFT wishes to require all estate agents to register with it and to
charge a fee for doing so, it will be able to do so under the third
money laundering directive that will be implemented in the UK in
December. As the hon. Lady said, the OFT has the capacity under that
directive to take action if it wants to do so. It is an independent
regulator, and it is for the OFT to make that
decision.</div>
					<a name="07042427000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I
fail to see any benefit whatsoever in getting estate agents to certify
that they comply with legislation or a code of practice. They are
already required to comply with the Estate Agents Act 1979 and other
legislation, such as the Enterprise Act 2002. Knowing
that consumers can bring complaints to an independent
ombudsman is much more of an incentive to raise standards than making
an empty promise.</div>
					<a name="07042427000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
serious set of arrangements therefore protects access to the market for
legitimate estate agents. Not just in individual cases, but when there
is a lack of integrity, it provides an opportunity for
regulators&#151;either local regulators or the OFT&#151;to
investigate appropriately and to use the records to do so. Regulators
can look at the level of offences taking place, not just significant
offences with the capacity for criminal investigations, but the small,
niggling problems that make people&#146;s lives an absolute misery
when trying to buy and sell property. We will deal with those problems
as well.</div>
					<a name="07042427000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill is
the right way forward. Making estate agents belong to a redress scheme
will raise standards; enforcers will have the powers needed to catch
the minority who continue to rip off people. That is why I reject the
hon. Lady&#146;s proposals and hope that my explanation has helped
her to understand how effective the scheme will
be.</div>
					
					<a name="07042427000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07042427000348"></a>Lorely
Burt:
						</b> The Minister is being extremely patient with me. I
want to raise a point that I did not catch in his remarks. I am sure
that the fault is mine, because I alluded to it only fairly briefly:
new clause 2 would broaden the scope of the Bill to include lettings. I
am very concerned because of developments in the market&#151;I let
out properties myself&#151;and it would be of great benefit if the
scope of the Bill could be broadened to include lettings, as there are
many similarities. Before he concludes his remarks, would he care to
comment on
that?</div>
					
					<a name="07042427000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07042427000349"></a>Mr.
McCartney:
						</b> That issue will come up later today, so I shall
leave my remarks on it until then. I think that it will be a sparky
debate by all concerned. That was not meant to be threatening, but
there is a genuine debate to be had about the best way forward, as
there was on the matter just discussed. I look forward to that and
apologise to the hon. Lady, but let us keep our powder
dry.</div>
					<a name="07042427000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">An estate agent
will have to provide consumers with the details of the redress scheme
to which they belong. In my view, they must therefore provide such
information on their premises, so that when people enter to seek to use
the estate agent, they can find out which redress scheme the agent is a
member of. That is important.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column155" />Column number: 155</div>
					<a name="07042427000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						If a
consumer complains to trading standards or the OFT, the latter will
check immediately whether the agent is a member of a redress scheme. If
they are not, it will take enforcement action against them. Let us say
that someone walks off the high street and into a company&#146;s
premises and says, &#147;I want to buy a property in this area. Are
you a member of a redress scheme?&#148;, and the company replies,
&#147;Yes, here are the details.&#148; If an issue arises at some
point, and the consumer goes to trading standards or the OFT and is
told, &#147;Well, actually they are not a member of that
scheme&#148;, under the Bill, trading standards or the OFT do not
have to wait; they can take immediate action.</div>
					<a name="07042427000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">The consumer will suffer no
detrimental effects. People can say, &#147;I am sorry about that, but
they should have been a member of a redress scheme&#148;. That is a
big incentive for and signal to those who want to act improperly. They
will not be able to do that anymore. At every level of their engagement
with the consumer, the consumer will be protected, and if the
organisation wants to hide impropriety, it will not get away with it,
because the records will provide a significant audit trail, not just of
individual cases, but of the management and running of the business as
a whole.</div>
					<a name="07042427000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the hon. Lady understands what weare trying to do: inventive
positive licensing plus, if Members do not mind me putting it like
that, to protect those in the marketplace operating effectively, to
allow legitimate businesses into the marketplace and to provide no
hiding place for rogues who want to rip off
customers.</div>

&#147;positive licensing plus&#148;. I look forward to further
discussions on that concept. I understand completely that his primary
motivation is the protection of the consumer. Having said that,
however, new clause 2 in particular is supported fully by the National

					<a name="07042427000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady refers to mystery
shoppers. Like a lot of people who consider the matter open-mindedly, I
find that an extremely attractive and sensible option. Before she winds
up, will she give some indication of the extent of mystery shopping as
she envisages it? Surely, she is not anticipating an entire purchase
and sale of a property being undertaken by a mystery shopper. Does she
imagine that someone will simply inquire at an estate agent&#146;s?
What will be the limit of the mystery shopper&#146;s participation in
the process? I am very much attracted to the
proposal.</div>

					<a name="07042427000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Lady&#146;s amendment has stimulated me to delve deep within the
entrails of proposed newsection 23A(1) of the Estate Agents
Act 1979, particularly the use of the word &#147;complaints.&#148;
When my right hon. Friend the Minister responds, will he comment on
third-party complaints? I raise thatpoint because, like many
Members, I am constantly approached by aggrieved constituents
complaining about the proliferation of sale boards. In many cases,
there is a veritable forest of them.</div>
					<a name="07042427000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have discovered that, in a
number of cases, estate agents place boards on properties in which they
currently have no interest but may at some stage. Inmy
constituency, on the corner of Ruislip road and Rectory Park avenue,
there is an absolute forest of boards, providing a windbreak if anyone
happens to be playing football behind it. If one wishes to complain,
there is no obvious direct first or second-party complainant, because
the boards are on the corner of the road, so we come to a stage at
which there must be a third-party
complainant.</div>
					<a name="07042427000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
public-spirited constituent, Tessa West, has drawn to my attention a
problem in Queen&#146;s walk in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column157" />Column number: 157</div>Ealing, where an estate agent has placed a board outside a property on
the assumption that they may have an interest in disposing of that
property at some point in the future. Like all people of good will, I
look to my right hon. Friend the Minister to resolve such problems in
the style for which he is so well known.</div>
					<a name="07042427000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like to discover
whether there is some way in which we can consider third-party
complaints, particularly in respect of sale boards. I have pursued such
a case through the small claims court, and I was told that the damage
done to a property by the affixation of a sale board was so minimal
that there could be no claim in law. The estate agent was then required
to take down the board within 21 days, which gave them 21 days of free
advertising.</div>
					<a name="07042427000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">In such
a massive industry&#151;agency charges in England and Wales are about
&#163;3 billion a year&#151;there is inevitably great pressure on
estate agents to get their name into the public domain. I am concerned
that in some cases, keen and hungry estate agents, who are not
necessarily unscrupulous, use the entirely legitimate sale board in an
illegitimate way.</div>
					<a name="07042427000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">When my right hon. Friend sums
up, will he offer some comfort to the many people, such as my
constituent, Tessa West, and, I am sure, many hon. and right hon.
Members, who suffer in that way and do not see an obvious remedy? Local
government planning law does not apply, because a board is a temporary
structure. There appears to be some size regulation in the industry, so
it is not as though estate agents produce massive billboards, which
could be a hazard under highway legislation. Such use of sale boards is
certainly a nuisance, however; it is sharp practice and something that
we could address, even though in the grand scheme of things, it may
seem small
potatoes.</div>

advertise their fairs in conjunction with local estate agents.
Throughout the village in which I live, Chorley Wood, one sees what
