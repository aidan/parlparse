                        <p class="tabbed">We
are considering a large group of amendments relating to clause 27, but
amendment 62 relates to clause 46. The Bill proposes a radical
transformation of the regulation of the postal market by removing the
mandatory licensing regime and replacing it with a system of
authorisations, although persons may provide 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 478<a class="bkMark" name="Column478">&#160;</a>
                           </div>postal services without any licence or authorisation. The Bill states
that the Secretary of State may require postal operators to notify
Ofcom before carrying on business. A system of notifications is a basic
minimum for a regulated market, and the Bill should stipulate that
regulations must be made requiring all postal operators to notify Ofcom
of their activities as a minimum obligation, in order to ensure that it
has an overview of the postal
sector.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000025">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A
complete regulatory framework cannot be established without full
information about provision of the postal service. Lots of discussion
on the Bill has been about individual words, but they are all
important. As I pointed out, where the wording has not been carried
through, we want it strengthened, and as Government Members said, where
“must” has suddenly appeared in a clause, there is
clearly less need for amendments. Amendment 62 is one of
many of our amendments that would simply change “may” to

65 and 66 relate to clause 50, but link into clause 27(2)(g), which
relates to a consumer protection condition. Clauses 49 and 50 relate to
that paragraph. Our amendments pertain to clause 50, which deals with
the provision that may be made by consumer protection conditions. The
purpose of our amendments is to strengthen the clause and ensure the
best possible service and protection for the consumer. As I said this
morning, the public in this country are impressed and pleased with
their postal service. I have experienced other countries where nothing
like the same level of service is provided, and where there are myriad
tales of items being lost and suppositions by the public about what
happened to their mail. We are fortunate in that that is extremely rare
here, and that we have a good service.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000027">&#160;</a>

lucky to have a good first-class service that arrives the next day. I
have been visited by friends from other countries who have been

that many hon. Members have tales similar to the one that I told this
morning: poorly addressed envelopes are still looked after and
delivered to the correct address, despite scrawly handwriting or a
half-constructed address. The postmen and women do an excellent job.
However, when there is a complaint, satisfaction levels with its
handling are not so good. That is why we want this clause to be as
robust as possible. A consumer protection condition would cover
complaints handling procedures, including whether the complaint was
dealt with courteously, efficiently and promptly and whether all the
necessary information was made readily available to ensure a full and
fair investigation into the complaint; dispute resolution and redress
schemes; what the procedures are and whether they are used effectively;
and the publication of information about complaint numbers and
complaint handling. That is the sort of information that we want to
know. The public, quite rightly, expect to know about such
things.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000029">&#160;</a>

I was saying, when the complaint happens, that is when there is less
satisfaction. It is rare for people to have a complaint, but when they
have, the way in which the complaint is handled is not always ideal.
The Bill, as currently drafted, suggests that Ofcom “may”
impose consumer protection conditions on postal operators and
“may” require the reporting and publishing of complaint
numbers and compliance with complaints handling standards.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000031">&#160;</a>

2009 customer survey found that of the 8% of residents and 13% of small
and medium-sized enterprises that made a complaint to Royal Mail, 73%
of the residents and 70% of the SMEs were not satisfied with the
customer service that they received, which is obviously a very serious
issue. Things do go wrong and it is not always easy to say why it has
happened or whose fault it is, but nevertheless there are proper ways
in which to deal with complaints. It is sad that 70% of the complaints
handled were not handled to the satisfaction of the complainant. The
figures indicate the problems that consumers experience, even with
legal protection. Imagine how much worse the situation is likely to be
if there is less protection, as there would be if the Bill were kept in
its current

that have been made about it. Hon. Members will be pleased to hear that
that means we have nearly finished discussing the amendments. We have

have bad news for you, Mr Amess—I realise I have missed out
amendment 70, and will come to it in a moment; it is on a separate
issue. We feel that the amendments I have just been discussing are
particularly important in the context of full-scale privatisation. In
theory, people might say there should be no difference between a
privatised and a public Royal Mail, but we are talking about a public
service with a good record of service and a good reputation. Many
people are all too aware of problems they have had with some privatised
utilities. There is always the risk that a privatised company will put
profit before people, in particular in an area in which that company
has a monopoly service and so does not worry about losing custom. A
privatised monopoly is likely to exert pressure on the regulator to
reduce its requirements. We have, therefore, a particular reason for
wanting to be absolutely certain that we are getting the strongest
possible consumer protection. It is essential to get that protection
and for Ofcom to have such
powers.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000043">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
70 is about accounting separation and transparency of costs—in
clause 38, but linked with clause 27(2)(c) on accounting conditions.
Amendment 70 is pertinent to clause 38, about the universal
service provider accounting conditions which Ofcom may impose on a
universal service provider, in order to maintain separate accounts for
different matters, as directed by Ofcom. Clause 38 also links in with
European legislation—article 14 of the directive on the
separation of accounts by universal service providers.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000044">&#160;</a>

intended effect of our amendment? The Bill as it stands provides that
Ofcom “may” impose an accounting condition on a universal

USPs.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000045">&#160;</a>

have the word “may” in the clause would mean that
accounting separation and cost transparency could be treated lightly

be an area that is conveniently given lower priority. We can imagine
the scenario whereby Ofcom is not bothered about that particular matter
and Royal Mail finds it a bit awful to do and does not make it a
priority. Ofcom does not chase it up and, lo and behold, the tasks are
not completed to the standards that we would

have heard a lot about whether “may” should be
“must”, and whether “may” should be
“will”. We have had lots of musts and wills, and I shall
deal with them in due course. However, this is the first time that I
have had a chance to talk about part 3 and, before I go into detail
about the group of amendments and christen them in my usual way, I
shall explain briefly some of the key principles that underpin the
regulatory framework in this part of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000060">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Protecting
the universal postal service collection and delivery, six days a week,
at uniform affordable prices is at the heart of our Bill. The
Government’s priority is to secure the future of the universal
postal service. All the elements of the Bill, which must be seen as a
package, are focused on that single objective. As Richard Hooper has
made clear, the greatest threat to the universal service comes from
falling mail volumes, and in particular the impact of digital media.
The regulatory regime therefore needs to consider mail as part of a
wider communications sector. To that end, the Bill transfers regulatory
responsibility for the mail sector from Postcomm to Ofcom, which has a
necessary overview of the whole communications sector. This was an idea
first put forward by the previous Government. It was an idea with which
we agreed in opposition and which we have accepted in government. The
Bill ensures that Ofcom’s primary duty is to exercise its
functions in relation to postal services in a way that will secure the
future of the universal postal service. I want to underline the phrase
“Ofcom’s primary duty” in relation to securing the
future of the universal service.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000061">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> As the hon. Gentleman knows, we are looking forward
to a long debate on access points and criteria later. He knows that the
universal service, as defined in the legislation, mirrors what was
defined in 2009, which takes its legal basis from the European postal
directive. Unless he is suggesting that we are not securing the
universal services demanded by the directive—indeed, as I have
said before, we are gold-plating that—I am sure he will accept
that we are meeting our legal
obligations.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000063">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Ofcom
will also need to have regard to the financial sustainability and
efficiency of the universal service, which is critical to securing the
service in the long term. I bring that particular duty to the
Committee’s attention, because it was not in the 2009 Bill. In
reflecting on whether the regulatory regime was strong enough to
protect the universal service, I felt that we needed to have extra
strength in it, hence the additional duties for Ofcom. So, as well as a
change of regulator, the postal services sector needs a new regulatory
framework. Regulation must be proportionate to the needs of the market,
and the framework must allow for deregulation where there is
competition. The Bill reduces the administrative burden on businesses
by scrapping the licensing regime and establishing a more flexible
authorisation regime modelled on that in the electronic communications
sector. Indeed, the hon. Member for Llanelli welcomed the shift and
understands that it is deregulatory and more flexible. Postal services
operators, including Royal Mail, will consequently have more
flexibility to
innovate.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000064">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government have moved to a more flexible and deregulatory authorisation
regime. The Bill sets out Ofcom’s overarching duties and gives
it the tools needed to meet those duties. That will be at the heart of
my response to the hon. Lady’s amendments today. Crucially, it
also gives Ofcom flexibility in determining how to use the tools. As I
said at the beginning, this group of amendments primarily seeks to
substitute the word “may” with “must” or,
in some cases, “will” in relation to Ofcom’s
powers or the making of
regulations.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000065">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
listened with great intent to the hon. Lady’s speech. She talked
about the need to get more oomph into the clause, so I wonder whether
we should call her amendments “the oomph amendments.” She
also talked about getting a little more aggro in the determination of
the regulatory regime, so perhaps they are “the aggro
amendments.” However, I prefer to call them “the musty
amendments”, because of the need that she sees to have
“must” in them. I could have called them “the will
’e amendments”, but I thought “musty” was
more parliamentary.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000066">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">With the
amendment grouping now christened, I understand the concerns of the
hon. Members proposing them. They are keen to ensure that the
regulatory regime imposed by the Bill is fit for purpose and can secure
the future of the universal service. I share that concern and that is
why, as I have already outlined, we are ensuring that the new regulator
will have the necessary duties, powers and regulatory tools to regulate
the postal services market effectively.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000067">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman will know that there are three
effective tiers of the universal service. The first is the postal
directive, which is the underlying legal directive. Then we have the
minimum requirements for the universal postal service, which we will
come to in clause 30. Finally, as he knows, Ofcom must by order set out
a universal postal service order. I think he will find that anything
that needs to be in the universal service will be there in those three
parts.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000069">&#160;</a>

                           <strong> </strong>I think the Minister understands, and it
is inevitable, that there is a vagueness in what he said, for the
simple reason that unlike the other parts of a universal postal
service, statutory criteria for post offices or access points are not
going to be in the Bill. The Minister began his discussion with a kind
of philosophical grounding of the Government’s position. It
seems odd that although we are talking about a universal postal
service, access points and counter services are not seen as worthy of
statutory protection, unlike the six-days-a-week service. I just want
to ask him about that again.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000070">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Let me help the hon. Gentleman with one particular
point: the access points that he seems to be concerned
about—even though we will deal with them in due course. Clause
28(4), which mirrors the language used in the 2009 Bill and echoes in
the current licence that Royal Mail has to agree with Postcomm,
states:<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000071">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Ofcom’s
duty under subsection (1) includes a duty to carry out their functions
in relation to postal services in a way that they consider will secure
the provision of sufficient access points to meet the reasonable needs
of users of the universal postal
service.”<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000347">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That
is in the legislation. It is quite clear and mirrors what the law has
said in the past and what the 2009 Bill
said.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000072">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                              </span>
                           </strong> I think there are a couple of points to be made
in response. The first is that the language clearly says “they
consider”. The six-days-a-week service will be protected by
statute, and Ofcom has to work around that. As anyone with a reasonable
grasp of English can see, there is much more latitude for Ofcom
vis-à-vis access points, for the simple reason that there will
not be statutory protection.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000073">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The second
point—I guess this anticipates something that the Minister will
come to in later clauses—is that it is not good enough to
compare the language to what was used in 2009, as there is a
fundamental difference. It did not matter previously that there was no
statutory provision for post offices because Royal Mail was not going
to become a separate private entity with the right to contract with
other parties. It was not going to have a legal duty to prioritise
shareholder interests and profitability as its overriding concern. That
seems to me a fundamental difference between any previous or putative
legislation, when both were still in public ownership, and the
situation that we are moving towards with a privatised Royal
Mail.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000074">&#160;</a>

suggesting that the separation

                        <p class="tabbed">I
say simply to the hon. Gentleman: he is mixing up organisational
structure with the law. The law under clause 28(4) will require exactly
what the law required in the past. Therefore I am afraid that his point
does not wash. We have had that argument before, and I am happy to have
it again. However, if the hon. Gentleman can restrain himself, I would
like to make some progress in answering the points made by his hon.

                           </strong> I am tempted to say “Danke
schön” to the hon. Gentleman. It is absolutely essential,
when we are considering every single clause in part 3 of the Bill, that
the primary focus of the regulatory regime imposed by the
Bill—indeed, the primary focus of the Bill itself—is to
secure the future of the universal service. That is clearly set out in
clause 28. My hon. Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe put his
finger on that point in an earlier intervention, and explained why the
arguments put forward by the hon. Member for Llanelli in most of these
“may/must” and “may/will” amendments are
completely misguided and reveal a misunderstanding of the way that the
Bill works. He rightly referred the hon. Lady to clause 28(1), where
the duty to secure the provision of a universal postal service is a
must for Ofcom.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000080">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I will read
subsection (1) and subsection (3) of clause 28, so that
Committee members will be absolutely clear that it is an obligation and
a must in terms of the overarching framework. Subsection (1)
states:<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000081">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“OFCOM
must carry out their functions in relation to postal services in a way
that they consider will secure the provision of a universal postal
service.”<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000348">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>So
let us be absolutely clear—that is a primary duty. Subsection
(3), which is the new additional duty that was not in the 2009 Bill,
strengthens the duties of Ofcom. It
states:<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000082">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“In
performing their duty under subsection (1) OFCOM must have regard
to—<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000349">&#160;</a>
                        </p>(a) the need for the provision
of a universal postal service to be financially sustainable,
and(b) the need for the
provision of a universal postal service to be
efficient.”<p>So
there we are. It is absolutely clear—the word
“must” is used. It is the prime, overarching duty. With
the many parts of part 3 where “may” is used for Ofcom
operating the different tools, rather than “must” or
“will”, as the hon. Lady would like, we are leaving it up
to Ofcom to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 486<a class="bkMark" name="Column486">&#160;</a>
                           </div>decide when and where it is appropriate for it to use those tools. It
has to use them to meet the primary duty and it is absolutely clear
that that is its legal
obligation.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000083">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendments would risk constraining Ofcom and placing unnecessary duties
on it. The amendments risk imposing unnecessary and excessive
regulatory burdens on the postal industry. I hope that hon. Members
would be against that. As I have already outlined, by shifting to a new
regime based on general authorisation—one that is more aligned
to a modern, liberalised market—we are seeking to reduce the
bureaucratic burdens on operators. The amendments would seriously
undermine that approach and could place unnecessary regulatory burdens
on postal
operators.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000084">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> There may be cases in the future with different
operators where Ofcom will choose not to use particular powers. I will
go through the amendments that the hon. Lady has tabled. Hopefully I
will reassure her that the structure ensures that we get what both
Parliament and the public want, which is a universal postal service,
but with the regulators deciding how and when they use their various
powers. That seems appropriate, rather than requiring them—here,
in 2010 and for the foreseeable future—to use a particular power
in every case, in every place. We are giving them flexibility. That is
the approach that works, and the regulatory provisions in the Bill are
written to reflect the provisions that Ofcom relies on in the
telecommunications market, in many ways. In the same way that the Bill
is drafted, those provisions are permissive, rather than directive.
Ofcom finds that, in practice, that gives it—in a market as
complicated as telecommunications—the flexibility that it needs
to do the job, without in any way weakening it as a regulator. It is
important to remember that we have a duty not to
over-regulate—there has to be a balance. If we were to follow
the hon. Lady’s suggestion, we would be in danger of going down
the road of over-regulation.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000086">&#160;</a>

telecoms providers will have to meet new regulatory requirements.
Therefore things are not necessarily always perfect as they are; we

commented on Ofcom’s not regulating so much, but there are some
musts for it, too—and it appears that there will be some
more.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000088">&#160;</a>

the way in which it bundles different services together, which it had
been prohibited from doing. It has been using its regulatory powers
flexibly in the telecommunications market and we hope and expect it to
do so in this market. The more we require, force and demand Ofcom to
use the panoply of powers that we are giving it, the more we will
constrain it and the more we will thus impose the necessary regulatory

must be targeted, proportionate and justifiable—some may apply
to all postal operators, while others may apply only to those operators

clause 35(1) to “OFCOM must impose a designated USP condition on
all designated universal service providers”. The clue is in the
change in the words. It would restrict Ofcom’s flexibility. That
is the general point that we are trying to make, and it is what we have
learnt from the previous Government. The primary duty is set out in
clause 28(1) and (3) and uses the word “must”, and that
is in relation to the primary duty of securing the universal postal
service. That is the overarching duty, and underneath it there are a
set of tools and a set of actions that Ofcom can choose to meet that
primary duty. Therefore, we have put forward an approach that ensured
that we achieve that objective without imposing too many requirements
and burdens that would result in too many regulations on the industry.

possible it is much better if the regulator is enabled to deregulate
and not impose regulations. I have had this debate with many people
over the course of developing the Bill. I have been clear that
flexibility for the regulator is a good thing. Ofcom’s duties in

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman says that I should spend a night
at an airport. It is very tempting, but unfortunately, living in
Surbiton and representing Kingston and Surbiton, I do not often have to
use aeroplanes to fly to the House of

                        <p class="tabbed">Let
us be clear. What lies behind a lot of the hon. Gentleman’s
interventions is the desire to suggest that seeking private capital
and, potentially, a majority holding of private capital in Royal Mail
creates a problem for the regulatory framework. The ownership of the
universal service provider should have no impact on the regulatory
decisions taken by an independent regulator. The postal service
directive requires ownership and regulatory decisions to be kept
separate. That is what the European postal directive says, and this is
a regulatory framework for all postal operators, not just Royal Mail. I
hope that the hon. Gentleman will also understand that point, unless he
wants Ofcom, with each and every power it has, to impose regulations on
the whole industry all the time. I think that if we adopted that
approach, we would really see the death-knell of the postal industry in
this country, because it would be hidebound with regulation, and the
ability to be freed up, to innovate and to respond to consumer needs
and to competitive pressures rather than regulatory pressures would be
reduced, which would be very deleterious.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000112">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister is raising a really interesting
philosophical distinction—if you want to call it that, which he
has. As I listened to the Minister’s encomium to deregulation
and what he calls an injection of private capital but is in essence a
largely privatised Royal Mail, I was struck by the thought, “Do
the events of 2009 and 2009 not suggest to all of us that perhaps we
have to rethink in some ways our attitude to privatisation and
deregulation?” Even if he does not think that the events of 2008
and 2009 would encourage such reflection, what about the evidence that
has emerged in the last week about the energy utilities and about the
inquiry that Ofcom is about to undertake into what seem to be massive
hikes in profits and prices by energy companies operating within this
kind of deregulated system that we have all been living with for 30
years?<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000113">&#160;</a>

that the financial meltdown—I hope I’m not straying too
far from the topic of the debate, Mr Amess; I am sure that if I do you

this debate, after all. I have reflected on those events, and on what
they suggest for economic policy. They did suggest that the last
Government got the regulation of the financial sector wrong and I am

My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation
and Skills, working with my right hon. Friend the Chancellor, has set
up the Banking Commission, which there was a debate about in this House
yesterday. There are many measures that this Government are taking that
the last Government refused to take, in order to address and learn some
of the lessons from those events.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000115">&#160;</a>

the idea that one should learn a lesson which the hon. Gentleman seems
to want us to learn—that the private sector is wrong, that
privatisation is bad, that regulation and nationalisation are good, and
so on, is a completely illogical conclusion to draw and I certainly do
not draw it. Indeed, one of the lessons that I draw is that sometimes
competition is not strong enough and sometimes we see vested interests
and markets that are not working well, which need to be corrected to
ensure that they are functioning properly as markets. Often that is the
lesson to learn, rather than the need for yet more onerous
regulation.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000116">&#160;</a>

train of thought, because he began by saying that he had reflected on
those events of 2008 and 2009, but everything that he subsequently said
was on the privatisation and deregulation model. I was trying to make a
reasonably subtle point to him. I listened to what he was saying and
the language that he was using was exclusively drawn from that school
of thought. There are schools of thought among those who study
politics, political science and history that say that language does not
just reflect the world, it shapes it; and based on the language that
the Minister is using, it seems to me that we have not learned any
lessons and this Bill seems to reflect the fact that we have not
learned those lessons.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000117">&#160;</a>

that, yes, I am using words such as “privatisation” and
“deregulation”—I make no apology for

the Royal Mail and introducing a more deregulatory framework, so
perhaps that is why I am using those words a

make some progress. In no way do I want him to go away with the
impression that I am some sort of laissez-faire, let the devil take the

the Conservative party who would like that description of me, but there
are differences between some people in the Conservative party and

this Bill is written in. It is very much the language that has been
used by Governments on both sides. I am not making a partisan point. It
just struck me as interesting when he added that he believed that the
Government should own some things, which was a different position from
that of Moya Greene in the evidence session. The point struck me as
interesting; no more than
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000121">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Well, indeed. We did have some of these debates
earlier in our proceedings, Mr Amess, when I explained why I thought
that developments in postal markets meant that a change of ownership
was appropriate. The hon. Gentleman can take from that the implicit
point that at certain times in history it made sense for Royal Mail to
be publicly owned. For example, as it moves from an extremely
labour-intensive industry to a more capital-intensive industry, from an
environment in which paper communication is the norm to a
communications market in which paper communication will not be the
norm. During such changes, it makes sense to look again at the
ownership question. We are not alone in doing that; other countries are
doing it.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000122">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As the
“production function”—to use the proper economic
phrase—of collecting and delivering physical items becomes more
capital-intensive, it makes sense for the ownership to change so that
the organisation undertaking this more capital-intensive industry has
easier access to more readily available and deeper sources of capital.
We could continue to have this debate, but I would not mind going back
to amendments 52 and 53 because they are deeply interesting. I am not
sure whether they would result in any meaningful change in the
legislation. Clause 35(3)
states:<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000123">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“OFCOM
may impose a designated USP condition only if they consider it is
necessary to do so in order to secure…the universal postal
service.”<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000351">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>Given that Ofcom is
bound by its overarching duty to secure the provision of the universal
service, it would run the risk of being in breach of its duties if it
did not impose a designated USP condition if it thought it necessary to
fulfil its duty. That reprises the argument I have been making for some
time. These amendments are, therefore, not
needed.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000124">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
54 changes “may” to “must” in
clause 35(6) and it places yet again an unnecessary
additional duty on the regulator, which would create a risk of needless
regulatory burden. Ofcom will be best placed to determine whether and
when performance targets should be imposed. Making it a statutory
requirement to impose them would eliminate Ofcom’s
discretion.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000125">&#160;</a>

with the other amendments in the group, hard-wiring the requirement

believe that achieving accounting separation—the hon. Member for
Llanelli spoke a little about it—and cost transparency is a
priority. Postcomm recently announced that it would be taking measures
to deliver that; as outlined in a joint statement published alongside
the Bill, Ofcom is committed to taking over that work once the Bill
comes into effect.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000128">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Bill
allows Ofcom to impose accounting conditions if it deems them
necessary. I hope that the hon. Lady welcomes that. She will know from
her discussions with Postcomm and others that accounting separation and
cost transparency have for some time been the subject of a big debate
between it and Royal Mail. At its heart, it is important to understand
whether the universal service obligation for downstream access pricing,
headroom and the rest of it will impose extra costs on the universal
service provider. I believe that Royal Mail will work with Ofcom to
make that accounting separation a reality.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000129">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Some
difficult accounting principles are involved; when one is dealing with
a production process that has economies of scale and of scope, it is
not easy to untangle the various costs and apply them appropriately. I
believe that Postcomm and Royal Mail have done a good job in that
respect. They are getting to the root of the matter, but they admit
that there is still some way to go. It is important to give Ofcom this
power, but the fact that progress has been made shows that it is much
better to have “may” not “must”. If they
can agree on a process, it will enable them to go forward and possibly
settle some of the long-running debates.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000130">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 62
to clause 46 seeks to substitute “may” with
“must”. Once again, it would force the Secretary of State
to require all postal operators to register with Ofcom before carrying
out their business. The Bill acknowledges that there may be a need for
a registration system at some point by allowing for the possibility,
but a registration system should not be imposed without clear
justification.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000131">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Ofcom has the
power to require notification in other areas of the communication
sector, but has never seen the need to use it. Most important, it is
able to take action against rogue operators without a registration
scheme. Once again, I turn to Ofcom’s practice. It has the power
to take action under the Communications Act 2003, but chooses not to
use it; it does not need it to meet the public policy aims that it is
tasked to undertake. It is a good example of what we mean by ensuring
that Ofcom uses its powers when appropriate, but not requiring or
forcing it do so when it is not appropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000132">&#160;</a>

evidence to suggest that moving from a licensing regime to one of
general authorisation would lead to a sudden increase in cowboy postal
operators, a fear that may lie behind the amendment. We have talked a
great deal about declining volumes in our debates over the last few
weeks, but it is hardly a market in which fly-by-night operators would
set up in order to make a swift buck, ripping off consumers in the
process. Hon. Members are of course right to be concerned that Ofcom
has powers to require pre-notification if needed, and it is something
that the Secretary of State can provide for.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000133">&#160;</a>

conditions” on postal operators. The conditions listed

universal service provision was required to meet those requirements.
The UK already complies with many of the essential requirements under
our national law. For example, we have legislation covering terms and
conditions of employment, security schemes, data protection,
environmental protection and regional planning. Such things are not
peculiar to post, and will not need to be secured by imposing
conditions under the Bill. Some aspects of essential requirements that
apply specifically to post are already addressed in part 5 of the
Postal Services Act 2000, which covers offences in relation to postal
services and is not affected by the Bill. It remains on the statute
book. In those contexts, it would not be necessary or appropriate to
impose conditions on postal operators under the regulatory

                        <p class="tabbed">We will,
however, still recognise the need to cover all eventualities. That is
why the Bill accounts for essential conditions that may be applied
where appropriate. Those conditions must be proportionate and
justifiable, in accordance with a test for any new regulatory
conditions imposed by Ofcom.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000135">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 63
to clause 49 would substitute the word “must” for the
word “may”, thus forcing Ofcom to impose consumer
protection conditions on postal operators. Amendments 64, 65 and 66 to
clause 50 would replace the word “may” with
“must”, which would force Ofcom, if it set any form of
consumer protection condition, to require the postal operator
associated with the condition to become a member of a redress scheme
and provide and publish information on complaints handing.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000136">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is at this
point that we should perhaps stand back, because the amendments are
about consumer protection, and I want to stress the fact that consumer
protection is an important element of the new regime. Ofcom has a
principal duty to further the interests of consumers, and that will
apply to its new duties with respect to post. Everything that Ofcom
does is guided by that principal duty. Its duty to protect the
universal service, and the Bill, give it the tools it needs to fulfil
those
duties.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000137">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
wrote to you, Mr Amess, and the Committee on 22 November, to
remind members of more details of consumer protection in the new
regulatory framework for post under the Bill. I did so because several
of the concerns that have been raised by the hon. Member for Llanelli
were raised by Consumer Focus when it gave evidence to the Committee. I
wanted to set out why I thought those concerns were not valid, or, at
least, why we should not be as concerned as Consumer Focus.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000138">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One of the
key arguments of my letter was that it was almost as if Consumer Focus
and, indeed, the hon. Lady, were not reading the Commucations Act 2003
alongside the Bill. It is incredibly important to do so if one is to
understand the statutory duties that apply to Ofcom, because many of
the statutory duties applying to it under the 2003 Act will apply as it
takes on its new responsibilities for postal matters.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000139">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The 2003 Act
gives Ofcom a principal duty to further the interests of consumers. It
is necessary to have regard to a range of things under the Act when
performing its duties, including the needs of the disabled, the
elderly, people on low incomes, the opinions of consumers, members of
the public in general and the different interests of people in
different parts of the UK, including those in rural and urban
areas.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000140">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Those
are not mere warm words; they are not mays. They are statutory
obligations, which Ofcom must fulfil as it addresses consumer
protection issues for postal affairs, once the Bill receives Royal
Assent. I hope that that explanation, following on from my letter of
22 November, will reassure the hon. Lady, because I believe
that Ofcom has consumer interests hard-wired into its constitution. If
one considers its record, it has gone about those duties in an
exemplary way.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000141">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I agree with
the sentiments behind the amendments in question, but they would
require Ofcom to do things that might be unnecessary and would risk
putting excessive regulatory burdens on postal operators, especially
those in competitive areas of the mail market, where contracts with
customers already offer adequate protection. Where consumer protection
regulation is needed, the Bill gives Ofcom the power to apply and
enforce it.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000142">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Bill
maintains and provides the necessary protection for consumers, and
allows us to implement our obligations under the postal services
directive, including extending the requirement for simple, compact
handling systems to all postal operators and not just those licensed
under the licensing regime. That is another point that I wanted to
bring to the attention of the hon. Member for Llanelli. The Bill is
implementing obligations under the postal services directive, so we are
strengthening the requirement on postal operators—mostly
competitors of Royal Mail—to handle complaints more effectively
than under the previous
regime.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000143">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady raised the issue of alternative dispute resolution schemes.
Let me reassure hon. Members that clause 50 allows Ofcom to approve a
new redress scheme—in effect, an ADR scheme—which will
cover existing licence holders. Ofcom is able to do that, so I hope
that the hon. Lady is reassured. Basically, the approach is an
improvement on the current regime. The Bill also allows Ofcom
discretion and flexibility to ensure that the sector is not
over-regulated and that all regulation is appropriate and
proportionate.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000144">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
55 concerns schedule 8 and the information provisions. The amendment
would force Ofcom, rather than allow it, to require information from
postal operators, again restricting its ability to use its regulatory
tools as it sees fit and only when it needs
them.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000145">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">At
one point, the hon. Lady said that Ofcom would not get the information
that it needs because there are too many mays in the Bill. If I refer
her to clause 53 and to schedule 8, however, they make it clear that
Ofcom can get all the information it needs. Paragraphs 1(1) and 2 of
schedule 8 enable Ofcom to enforce the information-gathering powers. It
has powers to obtain the information as required to meet its primary
obligation to
consumers.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000146">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is important to look at the underlying legislative framework—not
just the 2003 Act, but the directive. Ofcom is obliged to carry out its
duties in accordance with any relevant EU law. The Bill provides Ofcom
with all the powers necessary to meet the requirements of the directive
in relation to the provision of information to consumers. That is what
we have tried to achieve. We have built on the work in the 2009 Bill,
so I hope that the hon. Lady is reassured on that
point.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000147">&#160;</a>

I conclude on the musty amendments, I would like to reflect on one or
two of the hon. Lady’s other points. She talked about the
importance of mail integrity

			Column number: 496<a class="bkMark" name="Column496">&#160;</a>
                           </div>and of ensuring that people are not opening the mail and somehow getting
in the way of the mail arriving in the right place. She talked about a
Norwegian film and a Norwegian postman putting sacks of mail in a
tunnel—I think that was the
reference.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000148">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
might interest the Committee to know that I once had the great
privilege of going to Buenos Aires to visit Correo Argentino, in the
early ’90s. The Argentine mail service was already
liberalised—this will interest the hon. Member for Cumbernauld,
Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East—and there were many postal
operators. In fact, I think a charge of $5 would get a licence to
deliver mail in Argentina. At the time, a Bill was before the Argentine
Parliament—very much ahead of us—proposing the
privatisation of Correo Argentino. The Bill was controversial at the
time because of the Minister sponsoring the Bill in Parliament.
Unfortunately, there were not too many liberals in
Argentina—<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000149">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman is so wrong to say that there
are not many liberals here. One could say that there are not many
socialists here—that is the reality. I am happy to
see my actions and those of my party judged by liberalism, and compare
that with his party being judged by socialist theories. That would be
an interesting comparison—I know which side would come out on
top. However, he tempts me from my exposition of postal politics in
Argentina in the early
1990s.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000151">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
responsible for privatising Correo Argentino had a business associate
who was a well-known gunrunner and drugs baron in Argentina. It was
thought that he wanted to buy Correo Argentino as another distribution
mechanism for his guns and drugs. A very interesting debate was
reported in the Argentinian press at the time. Although we feel we have
problems with mail integrity in this country, I pay tribute to Royal
Mail and particularly to its employees, who do a fantastic job. One
reason why mail flows in this country are still far higher than in many
other countries, such as Argentina, is because people trust Royal Mail.
It is a critical point for the industry. If the public and business do
not trust the mail delivery company, they send less mail. For my sins,
I once did an analysis of mail flow problems in different countries,
and it was clear that where the legislation and the culture with
respect to mail integrity was not as strong, mail flow volumes were
lower. It is a critical point, which is pretty obvious on one level,
but we sometimes forget the benefits of living in our great
country.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000152">&#160;</a>

Postal Service, thus improving its mail performance. In Mexico City,
there was a particular problem because they did not have a
well-developed postal code as we do in this country. There were 110
streets called Calle San Juan, which created many problems for the
postmen trying to decide which Calle San Juan they had to deliver the
mail to. I am straying slightly outside this group of amendments, but I
have made my point in agreeing with the hon. Member for Llanelli that
mail integrity is extremely

the regulatory part of the Bill, we aim to strike the right balance
between ensuring proper protections and safeguards are in place in
relation to the universal service and consumer protection, while at the
same time freeing the sector from unnecessary burdens and regulations.
The best way to achieve that is to give Ofcom clear direction through
its overarching duties and then give it the tools and flexibility that
it needs to do the job. The Bill allows Ofcom discretion to utilise
regulation in the way that it considers most appropriate to meet its
statutory duties. We feel that that is the right way to go about
regulating dynamic markets. We do not believe that regulations should
be made for their own sake, nor do we believe that regulations should
be set in stone. The Bill strikes the right balance in terms of setting
up Ofcom’s overarching duties and giving it the tools needed to
meet those duties. I am delighted to have the full support of the

find it a rather strange dialogue, to be frank. I noted the dialogue on

proper regulatory framework and proper teeth for the regulator to use.
We want the strongest possible expression of that in this Bill. Added
to that, the Minister seems to think that all the things that we
suggest that Ofcom should do and that are mays in the text are
desirable anyway. Many of them are things that are being done, so

Minister asked what I was referring to when I mentioned the additional
requirements on Ofcom in respect of the telecommunications industry. It
was precisely that area of consumer protection that interested me. From
July 2011, telecoms providers will have to meet new regulatory
requirements in relation to their complaints handling systems. They
will have to adhere to a minimum set of standards and procedures and
belong to an improved alternative dispute resolution scheme. It is
precisely in the area of consumer protection that Ofcom is clearly
seeking to strengthen the requirement. Our amendments on consumer
protection are therefore important, and it would be helpful for Ofcom
to have the “must” in there rather than the
“may”.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000164">&#160;</a>

the Minister has said that he fully expects Ofcom to do many of the

reasonable amendments and include them in the Bill to strengthen the

                           </strong> Absolutely. The Royal Mail network has very
particular circumstances. It is, in many ways, similar to other types
of utility, where it is difficult to work out how much can be open to
competition, because of the difficulty of the final “may”
in the universal service provision. It is not quite as straightforward
as other things. It involves the same sort of ideas that we have about
water companies. It is not quite so easy to say 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>that anybody and everybody can compete at every level. We might be able
to say that for some parts of the industry, but it is not really a
practical option to have more than one provider actually providing the
universal service provision as we know it at the
moment.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000169">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I did not
spend a great deal of time discussing amendment 50, because it is
mirrored by comments that I made on other clauses. Interestingly,
however, there is an EU directive on essential conditions. So, again,
on what we are suggesting Ofcom should do, much of it would be covered
already by the instructions in that EU directive. Therefore, to say
“must” rather than “may” again seems to be
very sensible; it is putting everything into the same sort of context.
So the EU says, “You’ve got to do this,” and we
are saying likewise. That seems to be very sensible.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000170">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That brings
me back to clause 27, which is entitled, “The general
authorisation to provide postal services”. The initial
statements are there about what Ofcom “may”—in the
wording of the clause—do. It seems to me that we have looked at
those different categories as we have gone through the different
clauses in the Bill, and it is quite clear that they are all important.
Therefore the idea that there should be a “may” in
subsection (1) again seems to make nonsense of having those categories
there, of having their importance explained in other clauses and of the
Minister’s words about all the good work that Ofcom is
doing.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000171">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Therefore,
it seems to be very sensible to make this Bill look uniform and to make
it look as if we mean what we say by having a “must” in
clause 27, so that the fine words about what a good job Ofcom is doing
and what a good job the postal services provider—Royal
Mail—is doing can be put in legislation. They
“must” do those various things to ensure that we continue
to have a very good service and to ensure that where there are one or
two problems, and we have noted that there are one or two
problems—we know that there are not many, but there are some
problems with complaints handling, for example—such matters can
be dealt with. If there is a “must” in the wording of the
clause, obviously Ofcom will carry out that work. Ofcom will find out
where there are some weaknesses and, as I mentioned earlier, an action
plan can be put in place to improve things. If we are to do what the
Minister has clearly stated we should do, the word “must”
should be put in the clause. Does the Minister want to come back on
that point?<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000172">&#160;</a>

each and every case where she wishes to change “may” to
“will” or “must”, she believes that Ofcom,
in every case and every circumstance for ever, will want to use those
powers and will have to use them? Can she envisage no circumstances, as
the market becomes more dynamic and more competitive, where the
regulator may not want to use those powers? If we accept her
amendments, however, Ofcom would have to use
them.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000173">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Ofcom will obviously use its discretion on the
methods that it actually uses, but Ofcom will want to know how the
principles of accounting separation, universal service provision and
consumer protection are

			Column number: 500<a class="bkMark" name="Column500">&#160;</a>

require, the particular methods that it will want to use and the
frequency and quantity of information that it will want to gather. Many
of those decisions are, of course, operational, and I would not want
for one moment to suggest that they are otherwise. However, what is
stated in the clause is the general principles of the types of
areas—<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000174">&#160;</a>

different in the future, is

                           </strong> This reminds me of what Moya Greene said. She
gave her commitment on an inter-business agreement, but nobody knows
what will happen if she gets a job somewhere else or if circumstances
change. Nobody can be absolutely certain, because there will be nothing
in the framework that will force that agreement between a privatised
Royal Mail and Post Office Ltd. We have exactly the same situation
here. We have got a lot of very fine words about what we want Ofcom to
do, about how it is a jolly good thing and about how it is doing a
jolly good job, but that does not match what we hear on giving it the
necessary tools. For those reasons, I would like to see
“must” not “may” in the clause. That is why
we have tabled the amendments, and we want to press some of them to a

begin by thanking my hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli for holding
the fort today. I am sure that she did a sterling job, and it is my
responsibility to give her a little rest—“little”
being the appropriate word given amendment 40. The amendment calls for
a specific insertion in the Bill to transfer Postcomm’s current
funding agreement to Ofcom. In one of the Committee’s evidence
sessions, Mr Brown, the chief executive of Postcomm, referred to the
relationship between Postcomm and Royal Mail as being like a marriage.
He said that he sees an advantage in moving regulation across to Ofcom,
because it has a wider field to regulate. In the same session, Mr
Richards, the chief executive of Ofcom, said that he could see a number
of advantages in regulating Royal Mail in the broader regulatory regime
for which Ofcom is responsible. I believe that many Committee members
agree that the experience of regulating many powerful companies, as
Ofcom does, means that the focus would not stagnate on the single
relationship as it could do—I am not saying that it
does—in the current Postcomm-Royal Mail relationship. That could
be a good step forward, because there would always be something new to
move on
to.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000203">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Mr
Richards went on to say that he can attract high-quality people to the
Ofcom work force and that that is vital in arguing detailed economic
and legal issues with some of the most well resourced companies in the
UK, Europe and, indeed, the world. He also said that it is important to
know about network industries, such as Royal Mail, and that Ofcom
currently regulates network industries, such as telecoms and
broadcasting. I do not necessarily disagree with any of those
statements, which go some way towards assisting me in building my
argument on the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000204">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
asked Mr Richards whether there would be adequate resources to allow
Ofcom to deliver a quality regulatory service that would not only
protect but, where possible, stimulate the sector. I also asked him
what portion of Postcomm’s budget Ofcom would receive, how many
staff Ofcom would deploy on postal matters and how that would compare
with Postcomm. In response, Mr Richards stated that Ofcom
has already

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I think that
Mr Richards meant that Ofcom’s budget had been reduced by 3.6%
for this financial year, after it made a £7.5 million saving in
the previous financial year. The latest annual report also refers to
delays in the implementation of decisions as a result of its current
responsibilities, and with those delays come delays in the benefits to
consumers. He also highlighted additional operational and financial
challenges in defending its 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 502<a class="bkMark" name="Column502">&#160;</a>
                           </div>positions in prolonged and detailed appeals processes, which have a
significant impact on the financial operation. That reinforces the
point about the need for top-quality staff who can argue Ofcom’s
case well in those protracted discussions and legal arguments. As I
have said, I hope that Mr Richards is right and that the operation
comes through at the other side in such a way that people can do their
current and future jobs—we are talking about future jobs in this
regard—in a professional and rewarding manner and, indeed, with
the range of responsibilities that Ofcom currently enjoys. We all need
that to be the
case.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000207">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Adding
Royal Mail to Ofcom’s basket of responsibilities
will undoubtedly place an additional burden on it,
so there is a need to ensure that the organisation is funded
and staffed in a way that is fit for purpose. This is not a debate
about the funding of Ofcom in general, but it is a debate about the
funding of Ofcom’s ability to regulate the postal sector
appropriately, which is what amendment 40 is
about.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000208">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Evidence
given to the Committee was partly responsible for amendment 40
appearing on the amendment paper. Mr Richards told the Committee
that<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000209">&#160;</a>

                        <p>That
suggests that he believes that the Treasury will be intent on reducing
the £10 million budget currently enjoyed by Postcomm when
responsibilities are transferred to Ofcom. I support Mr Richards in his
hope that he will have the resources to do the job properly, and,
although the budget is agreed with the Treasury, we all know that
current Postcomm funding comes from the licensed operators, and
therefore, largely from Royal
Mail.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000210">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment would ensure that Ofcom enjoyed the £10 million budget
currently enjoyed by Postcomm when responsibilities are transferred.
Perhaps we should look at some of the numbers, to put things into
perspective. Postcomm, with its £10 million budget, employs
approximately 66 staff to carry out its current functions on mail
regulation. That includes interim staff members, external commissioners
and directors. On the other hand, Ofcom has a budget of around
£142 million and employs 873 staff, excluding non-executive
members of the Ofcom board, content board and advisory committees, and
employees seconded to Ofcom.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000211">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Seeing the
comparative sizes of the operations gives me some concern. I fear that
without the carry-over of Postcomm’s budget, there is a danger
of future regulation in the Royal Mail sector being underfunded. If it
is underfunded, it is under-resourced. Indeed, I wonder whether the
Minister believes that, with the possibility of a range of players
entering the market, there may be an even greater need to increase
levels of funding in future. I will be happy to hear his comments on
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000212">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The amendment
provides Postcomm’s funding levels to Ofcom for the new job of
mail regulation, for which it will be responsible. Accepting the
amendment today will ensure that Mr Richards can get on with his job of
running Ofcom, for all our benefits, instead of arguing with the
Chancellor, which may be to nobody’s
benefit.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000213">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Mr Richards should be running Ofcom, not arguing
with the Chancellor about budgets. That is the point that the amendment
makes.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000215">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The future
job of regulating Royal Mail will be more complex. In the immediate
future, the transfer of responsibilities will undoubtedly be complex
and, potentially, more expensive; perhaps the Minister can expand on
that. Such things usually happen when transfers take place. I firmly
believe that Ofcom needs to be funded appropriately for its new job,
and the amendment creates the opportunity for that to happen. I urge
the Committee to accept it. I am not concerned that Ofcom, in theory,
will not be able to do the job, but if Mr Richards’s
concerns come to fruition and extended discussions take place with the
Treasury, I worry that the portion of the Postcomm budget that will
arrive through Ofcom’s letter box—be it first class or
second class—will not be
guaranteed.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000216">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
the portion is not adequate, a number of things could occur. First,
Ofcom may not, as I have said, be able to regulate the mail sector
appropriately, and secondly, there may be pressure on its existing
budget to incorporate some or all the costs needed to regulate the mail
sector. Those things may lead to greater challenges and impacts on
Ofcom’s carrying out the jobs that we expect it to do here and
now. Neither potential outcome is desirable, and I am sure that when
the Minister gets to his feet he will tell us that neither will occur;
we argue that they will not if the amendment is accepted. I am sure
that he would not want to be responsible for either
outcome.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000217">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister can ensure that Ofcom has the funding that would allow Mr
Richards to create the staffing levels necessary to carry on the work
of regulating Royal Mail, clearly and precisely, by securing the
funding stream that Postcomm currently enjoys. That would ensure that
when Ofcom starts to regulate the sector, it is adequately funded. I
look forward to the Minister’s
response.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000218">&#160;</a>

amendment 40 relates to Postcomm’s current funding
agreement being transferred in its entirety to Ofcom. I should welcome
the hon. Gentleman back to the Committee—I had hoped that we
would hear a detailed description of his journey. It is important that
we understand that Royal Mail employees have to endure a lot of
inclement weather at times, which can affect their journeys, so sharing
such anecdotes helps us to have a full understanding of the industry
that we are discussing. I am sure, therefore, that a detailed
description would be in order.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000219">&#160;</a>

Ofcom’s 2010 spending review settlement, the Chief Secretary to

powers for Postcomm will transfer to Ofcom. I hope that the Chief
Secretary’s commitment will reassure the hon. Gentleman.
Although there is no intention to reopen the settlement, the hon.
Gentleman will understand that Her Majesty’s Treasury reserves
the right to do so for any settlement should that be necessary to meet
the Government’s deficit reduction

                        <p class="tabbed">It
would not be sensible to try to bind the Treasury to the particular
spending review settlement for Ofcom, as the amendment seeks to.
Legislation is simply not a sensible and appropriate vehicle for making
such spending commitments, and I am not aware of any precedent for
doing so in primary legislation. It is possible that secondary
legislation might be the recourse, because, as we all know, that can be
changed relatively easily. I am not aware of any such primary
legislation, but if the hon. Gentleman knows of any, I would like him
to bring it to my attention and to that of the Committee. He did not do
so in his initial remarks, which suggests that the proposal is not the
usual way of going about dealing with budgets, be they for regulators
or anyone
else.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000221">&#160;</a>

hon. Gentleman was fair in his description of the position of Ed
Richards, the chief executive officer of Ofcom. In my private meetings
with Ed Richards, he has at no stage raised any concerns regarding the
measure. In his evidence to the Committee, he was clear that he felt
that some efficiencies should inevitably be found because of, for
example, savings in back-office functions, which we want to see in a
number of areas. He was in no doubt, however, that Ofcom would have the
necessary resources to deal with its increased responsibilities in
relation to post.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000222">&#160;</a>

Transfer stages tend to be more expensive and less productive once a

                           </strong> Having worked with Ed Richards and Tim Brown, who
is the chief executive officer of Postcomm, I am impressed with how
they manage their respective organisations. They have not raised the
matter with me. Their joint statement at the time of the policy
statement or the Bill—I forget which—set out their
intention to work together to bring the measures in the Bill to
fruition so that the transition from Postcomm to Ofcom could be as
seamless as possible. It will not require the additional resources that
the hon. Gentleman
suggested.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000224">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Both
organisations realise that we are in difficult financial circumstances.
They know that they need to make the transition and realise the savings
that Ed Richards said could be realised in the process. Some very
talented people are in both organisations, and I take this opportunity
to pay tribute to them.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000225">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For the
record, it is worth my paying tribute to the chairman of Postcomm,
Nigel Stapleton, who steps down at the end of this month, having served
Postcomm for many years in two terms. He is extremely well regarded. He
would agree that he and Tim Brown have overseen a professional approach
in the past few months to ensure the transition from Postcomm and its
employees under the auspices of Ofcom. I do not think that the hon.
Gentleman has made the case for the need for huge extra amounts of
money, which seemed to lie behind his
questions.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000226">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Does the Minister agree that the amendment is about
appropriate amounts of money? It is about current amounts of money.
Does he also agree that the transfer of responsibilities is a
particular pressure point? It could impact negatively on Ofcom. The
hon. Gentleman said that Mr Richards and Mr Brown said that they will
do it, but will he acknowledge that the transfer period is a potential
pressure
point?<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000227">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Organisations throughout the public sector have a
degree of pressure on them at the moment. The Government have not
sought to hide that. There is a need for all organisations to ensure
that they are keeping their costs under control. It is fair to say,
though, that the budgets of Ofcom and Postcomm have not been as
severely hit as some other budgets elsewhere. There is a reason for
that, of course. All of Ofcom’s work as a sectoral regulator is
funded by levies on the industries that it regulates. The principle
that the industry, not taxpayers, should pay for its own regulation is
well
established.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000228">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under
the current regime, licence holders and operators pay fees to fund
Postcomm, according to the volume of mail that they handle. It is
because the industry has been paying for Postcomm and Ofcom that their
budgets have not been hit as hard as other parts of the public sector.
The hon. Gentleman should take that into account. Those at Ofcom and
Postcomm know that they still need to control their budgets even
though, compared with some parts of the public sector, they have a
degree of
protection.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000229">&#160;</a>

                              </span>
                           </strong> The reduction in the budget that the Minister is
referring to in respect of Ofcom is about 3.6%, which takes the budget
for 2010-11 down to about £127.5 million, but one of my worries
concerns the pressure point at the time of the transfer. I have been in
businesses and organisations when there is an influx of new
responsibility. Such times are always a pressure point, and all I am
saying to the hon. Gentleman is that he should recognise it. It might
not require money. Grit and determination, blue-sky thinking and bright
guys might solve the problem, but will he acknowledge that such a
transfer period is a potential pressure point and, as he suggested, an
additional pressure
point?<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000230">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The pressures on organisations that are making such
transitions are clear. Such times are particularly difficult for the
staff. To be honest, management of staff is probably a bigger pressure
and a bigger challenge for organisations, and those leading them, than
budgets.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000231">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
pay tribute to Nigel Stapleton, Tim Brown and all senior managers and
staff at Postcomm. They have had a difficult time; they were all geared
up for change in relation to the 2009 Bill, but it was pulled by the
last Government. Those in Postcomm who were getting ready to move to
Ofcom were put on hold and had to stay in Postcomm. That created an
awful lot of uncertainty for Postcomm staff. I am sure that the last
Government regretted having to do that, but they nevertheless caused
some pressure within Postcomm.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000232">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In discussion
with Tim Brown and Ed Richards, I tried to ensure that we did not add
to those pressures, which had been there for some time. We were aware
of the difficulties that some talented individuals had in 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 506<a class="bkMark" name="Column506">&#160;</a>
                           </div>deciding on their career plan. My clear message to Ofcom and Postcomm
was that they needed to work together for two big reasons.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000233">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">First, we had
to ensure that the transition happened as soon as possible. However, to
get a transaction—we are trying to achieve it to secure the
universal postal service—we needed to ensure regulatory
certainty. We needed to ensure that Ofcom would be able to regulate the
new Royal Mail after the transaction. We therefore had to make
decisions about the time and speed of the transaction. We did that in
consultation with Postcomm and Ofcom, and the Bill sets out a speedy
transition.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000234">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is
important not only to get regulatory certainty for the transaction; we
also need to give a clear path for employees who have had to live under
a cloud of uncertainty for some time. Those are the real pressure
points in this transition. When talking about merging quangos and
abolishing one of them, we should remember that we are talking about
people’s lives and jobs. Many talented people have given their
time to this public service; it is they who are under the real
pressure, and I have been mindful of that in respect of the
change.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000235">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Again, I make
it clear that the Bill provides for the costs of transfer to be
recovered under the normal procedure for setting charges.
Sub-paragraphs 2(3) and (4) of schedule 4 make provision for the costs
of transfer to be recovered. I hope that I have dealt with the specific
point, but I do not wish my answer to deflect from the overall point
that it is the staff of the organisation that we should be thinking of,
as it is they who are under pressure. Through the legislation and how
we have worked with the organisations and encouraged them to work
together, I believe that we have reduced that pressure. However, I
realise that it is real.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000236">&#160;</a>

to do so. It started at 10 o’clock yesterday morning and
finished at 3.30 this afternoon, when I arrived here. I am extremely
grateful to the captain and crew of BA2391 from Edinburgh to Gatwick;
it was the only flight to leave Edinburgh today or yesterday. The
flight was excellent, although I am not so happy about the other three
flights that did not leave. But that is enough about my

                        <p class="tabbed">I pick up on
some of the Minister’s opening remarks. Perhaps I should have
intervened on him earlier. Did he say that the funding of Postcomm was
being transferred in its entirety, or did he say that all
responsibilities will be transferred? It was not clear to me, but
perhaps being up for 36 or 40 hours stopped my ears from working
properly.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000238">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to go back to the issue of a pressure point during transfers. I
support wholeheartedly the Minister’s view that the pressure is
on individuals. It is always the pressures on individuals, because
individuals make organisations—without individuals, we have
nothing. We need individuals to be creative and to have a work
environment that allows them to be
creative.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000243">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My
worry about pressure points remains, although it might be unfounded.
The Minister has already alluded to a lot of existing pressures on
organisations such as Ofcom, and the initial transfer period might be
one of those pressure points that I keep describing. Something might be
needed to make the transition go as smoothly as we want it to. That
something might not be pounds, shillings and pence. I am not asking for
the Minister to say that if Mr Richards comes along needing another
£1 million that he will be given it. I just want to be sure that
the Minister recognises that such transfer periods are potential
pressure points—on individuals. The Minister alluded to the
impact on individuals, and that is what is driving this, because we
want to ensure that the individuals responsible within Ofcom for
regulating Royal Mail will have the resources to do the work. If they
do not have the resources, they will not be fulfilled, they will not be
able to do their jobs and they will probably not stay in Ofcom doing
those jobs.

                        <p class="tabbed">I
think that it would be very sensible to look, first, at the title of
the clause: “Duty to secure provision of universal postal
service”. That is extremely important, of course. We know that
it is going to be taken over by Ofcom and we obviously know of
Ofcom’s current role as a regulator, regulating the TV and radio
sectors, the fixed-line telecommunications and mobiles, and the
airwaves over which wireless devices operate. Moreover, we know that
Ofcom has a reputation for ensuring that people in the UK receive the
very best in their telecommunications service and are protected from
scams and sharp practices. Indeed, that is Ofcom’s
aim.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000255">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As has been
mentioned earlier, Ofcom operates under the Communications Act 2003,
which spells out exactly what Ofcom should do. It
states:<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000256">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“It
should be the principal duty of Ofcom, in carrying out their
functions…to further the interests of citizens in relation to
communications matters; and…to further the interests of
consumers in relevant markets and where appropriate, by promoting
competition.”<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000359">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>Meeting
those two duties is at the heart of what Ofcom does.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000257">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Accountable
to Parliament, Ofcom is often involved in advising and setting some of
the more technical aspects of regulation, in protecting and enforcing
the law. It is particularly pertinent here to emphasise Ofcom’s
concern with the “interests of citizens” and the
“interests of consumers”, because that is very much the
role that we want Ofcom to play when it takes over regulation of the
mail services. It is one of the reasons why we are particularly keen to
push amendment 73, which would amend subsection (3).<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000258">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Of course, we
all appreciate what the universal postal service is and how important
it is to us in this country. People value that six-days-a-week service
and they appreciate the uniform affordable price. I think that people
would be quite horrified at the thought that there could be variable
pricing according to how far they were going to send their letter,
because they are so used to the idea that that is not the case and
that, from the south-west of Wales to the north of Scotland, they can
send a letter for exactly the same price that it costs to send a letter
three streets from their home. So they are very much attached to the
idea of that uniform price and to the six-days-a-week
service.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000259">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Of course,
the difficulty with trying to cut that service down is that, although
businesses might like the Monday to Friday service, the home consumer
service likes the Saturday service, because that is the day that they
are at home. So there is really no way of pleasing people if we were to
say that we should just use the European directive of a five-day
service. That is not what we want; we want a proper six-days-a-week
delivery service.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000260">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Hooper
stressed that it is important for business that people can use the same
price, however far they are sending something. It is also, however,
important from a social point of view. We still enjoy sending things
socially, and we expect to be able to do so. Clearly, there have been
all sorts of innovative things, such as internet trading, which mean
that some people who had previously stopped using postal services have
returned. Personal things are still sent. While we may not get that
weekly letter from family members—some of us will remember that
from our youth when we first went away from home—we find that
people are sending all sorts of greeting cards through the post. There
has been a decline in things such as bills being paid through the post,
but that is because there are so many other ways to do that.
Nevertheless, keeping the universal service is
crucial.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000264">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Some
people may be confused and think that it is odd that we are proposing
to remove subsection (3), so it merits some explanation. We are not
saying that, because it was not in our 2009 Bill, it cannot be in this
one. There is an important underlying principle behind why it was not
in our Bill. The clause suggests that when Ofcom is considering how to
regulate and influence the universal service provider, it needs to
factor in financial sustainability and efficiency. That sounds
absolutely fine—of course we want everything to be efficient and
financially sustainable—but the difficulty is that that is the
opposite of what a universal service is. If something is to be operated
in as cost-effective a way as possible, post should not be taken to
some of the UK’s remotest areas every day—certainly not
to an island. If every bit of a service needs to be financially
sustainable, the company will not want to pay for the hours and the
fuel of somebody who is delivering a small amount of mail every day to
a remote area. The company would say that it would be better to switch
those areas to fewer services a week, as they do in Canada. That would
make it more financially
sustainable.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000265">&#160;</a>

words in clause 28(3). That subsection discusses the need for a
universal postal service to be efficient. It does not discuss a postal
service being efficient. If those words had been in the Bill, the hon.
Lady may have had a point. I am sure that she would agree that it is
necessary for the universal postal service, delivering to all parts of
the UK at a uniform price, to be
efficient.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000266">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Of course we want to see efficiency, but the
danger with the clause is that it puts in certain conditions that may
make people act in certain ways. If

                           </div>cost is all important, the operator may be driven to do things to the
service which it might later regret or which might be detrimental to
service users. For example, it might be inclined to cut things.
Likewise, if the operator wants the service to be absolutely efficient,
it would not deliver six days a week, because that is not efficient
compared with delivering three days a week. A universal service
provision of six days a week is not necessarily compatible with
financial sustainability and efficiency.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000267">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The difficulty that I have is that this clause
has been included specifically to indicate that those factors will be
considered to be more and more important. In other words, will the
service be viable? Will it be cost-efficient? Will it be financially
sustainable to continue providing it at the current level? Obviously,
we would like to see that important service at the affordable uniform
price continue across the whole UK and every one of its 28 million
doorsteps. The worry is that the clause will open the door to a
different type of thinking, such as “That’s a bit
expensive; we won’t bother with that. We won’t bother
ensuring that the service runs for that many days per week and goes to
remote areas.” If that idea is first and foremost in the
regulator’s mind, the worry is that it may drive a different
type of agenda from the one that we would like to see in order to
safeguard the universal postal service.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000269">&#160;</a>

may try to argue that the whole service will be taken into
consideration and that it will all be financially sustainable and
efficient. We would not argue with efficiency—any business would
want to make itself efficient. The regulator’s role would
concern what an affordable price to charge for the service would be. We
want definite reassurances that this measure does not seek to drive
some sort of agenda where cost is always the most important issue.
There is more to universal service provision than cost. The whole idea
is that it is universal, and we must accept that the service will not
be cost-effective in some areas of the country and that higher volumes
of usage in certain areas will help to cross-subsidise some of the more
expensive routes.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000270">&#160;</a>

which are clearly the types of community that he represents and
understands. He would strengthen the obligation on Ofcom to ensure that
whatever it does, it will not be detrimental to businesses that operate
in remote and rural areas. As I have mentioned, it is often difficult
to attract big industries to the more far-flung corners of the UK,

make it clear that clause 28 has a central role in underpinning the
entire regulatory framework in part 3 of the Bill. Clause 28
is essential in securing the long-term provision of a strong universal
postal service. It gives Ofcom a primary duty in subsection (1) to
ensure that when Ofcom carries out its functions in relation to post,
it does so in a way that it considers will secure provision of a
universal postal service. All Ofcom’s other powers in relation
to post will be subject to this 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 512<a class="bkMark" name="Column512">&#160;</a>
                           </div>overarching duty, which is why it is so critical to the whole Bill. The
clause should also be read in conjunction with paragraph 57 of schedule
12. Together, the provision explicitly requires Ofcom, when carrying
out its functions in relation to postal services, to give priority to
securing provision of the universal service if there is a conflict with

(3) ensures that in performing its primary duty, Ofcom must have regard
to the need for the provision of a universal postal service to be both
financially sustainable and efficient. Ofcom will have to take those
two facts into account at all times. As the hon. Lady has said, that
requirement was not included in the 2009 Bill. I am glad that she is
not moving her amendment simply because these extra duties were not in
the 2009 Bill. However, it is important to recognise that there will
sometimes be a tension in regulatory terms between encouraging
competition and supporting the provision of a universal service. I want
to emphasis that point to the hon. Lady and to Opposition Members. The
duties for the provision of the universal postal service need to be
strengthened, which is the reason why subsection (3) has been included.
There is no other reason, so I hope that the hon. Lady is
reassured.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000279">&#160;</a>

means that, when Ofcom regulates the different markets within the

Ofcom to think about. I think that it is common ground that Ofcom has
to secure the universal postal service, because it was in the previous
Bill. However, I want to ensure that, when it thinks about how to do
that, it has to ensure that the universal service provider is

                        <p>It
is important for the long-term sustainability of the universal postal
service that it is efficient. The hon. Lady spent some time trying to
suggest that our introduction of the notion of efficiency is somehow a
threat to the universal postal service when, in fact, the reverse is
the case. I accept that it is likely that some elements of
the universal postal service will cost more to provide than the revenue
they bring in. That is a common finding in the analysis of postal
markets. It is essential, however, that in meeting the standards of the
universal service, the universal service provider should be as
efficient as possible so as to avoid unnecessary cost to consumers and
prevent yet more users from moving from post to other forms of
communication. I would have thought that the hon. Lady would understand
that a requirement for Ofcom to ensure that the provision of a
universal postal service is efficient is actually in favour of the
provision of the universal postal service and in favour of the sorts of
things for which she has been
arguing.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000291">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The whole point of having a regulator in the market
is to ensure that the balance between the universal service provider
and competitors in the market, who will no doubt want to have access to
the downstream provision of the universal service—the last
mile—is properly regulated. Regulating that will be a core task
for Ofcom, as it has been for Postcomm. Ofcom will have to balance the
interest between the competitors and the universal service provider.
That is what happens now; it is what Postcomm has to do. In the 2009
Bill, certain duties were placed on Ofcom, as a new regulator,
regarding how it should go about achieving that balance. When I looked
at that Bill and asked myself whether we need to refresh or change it
in any way, I thought that the balance in terms of the manner in which
Ofcom was being asked to go about that duty was not sufficiently
correct. I wanted to ensure that when it thought about the balance of
those difficult judgments, which it must achieve on many things, one of
the factors it took into account was the financial sustainability of
providing the universal postal service. One could give almost any
example of anything that the regulator must make judgments on in making
that balance.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000293">&#160;</a>

this is not necessarily the intention behind the measures, but it may
be the way that it chooses to use the powers—Ofcom might decide,
in a decision on prices, that if it held the price down too much, it
could create financial problems for the universal service, and hence it
might not be financially sustainable. In making these fine balances,
Ofcom might decide that it has a duty under subsection (3)(a) to ensure
that the universal postal service is financial sustainable. It
might—this is not a suggestion of what it should
do—decide that the price that the universal service provider,
Royal Mail, can charge to competitors accessing its downstream service
could be a little bit higher to ensure that the universal service was
financially sustainable. I hope that that is quite a central example

The hon. Gentleman seems to be suggesting that the universal service
provider would be cross-subsidising in some way, from another activity
unrelated to the universal postal service. He is, therefore,
strengthening my argument that we should specify in the Bill in terms
of the universal postal service and not in terms of the universal
postal service provider. If we had done what he is arguing, Ofcom could
look at a particular company that was providing the universal service
and say, “Well, it is financially sustainable, because it is in
offshore banking somewhere in the Caribbean, and it is
cross-subsidising. Therefore, we should not worry.” That is not
what the regulator should be doing; it should be focusing on the
universal postal service and whether that is financially
sustainable.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000300">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman is seeking to say that clause
28(3) should contain the phrase “universal postal service
provider.” He is questioning why it contains “universal
postal service.” I thought that I had answered that question.

to amendment 73, which would remove Ofcom’s requirement

provision of a universal postal service to be financially
sustainable”<p>and
efficient when carrying out its functions in relation to post, we would
strongly resist such a proposal, and I hope that that is self-evident.
As I have already outlined, that requirement will ensure that, as it
approaches regulatory decisions, Ofcom will look beyond the immediate
term. The clause, as drafted, ensures that Ofcom considers the impact
that it could have on the long-term sustainability of the universal
service and ensures that it does not support the development of the
market in a way that would undermine the long-term viability of the
universal
service.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000306">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is also essential that that requirement should be balanced by a duty to

                        </p>
                        <p>It
is common ground that Royal Mail needs to modernise and to become more
efficient. I would not want the Bill to require Ofcom to use its
regulatory tools to entrench inefficiencies in the USP. That is in no
one’s interest, least of all that of the users of the postal
service. The Bill strikes the right balance in ensuring that Ofcom has
regard to<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000308">&#160;</a>

me move on to amendment 6. I hope that the hon. Member for Angus will
join us in due course. Perhaps we shall see him later in the week,
although his part of Scotland might be difficult to leave at the
moment. The aim of his amendment is laudable. He wants to ensure that
the needs of small business in rural and remote areas continue to be
met, no doubt come

                           </div>rain or shine. However, the hon. Gentleman need not worry as that is
amply provided for under the Bill. Under the section 3(4))(l) of the
Communications Act 2003, to which I referred in our previous discussion
on consumer protection, Ofcom is already required to take into account
the needs of<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000310">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“the different
interests of persons in the different parts of the United

                        <p class="tabbed">In
that context, persons can also mean businesses. We are extending the
duties to the functions of Ofcom in respect of communications matters
under section 3(1)(a) of the Act to include postal matters. Amendment 6
would therefore offer no new protection. Such protection already
exists. The clause and subsection (3), in particular, provides the
appropriate balance between protecting the long-term sustainability of
a universal service, while ensuring that the regime promotes
efficiency. The clause also ensures that the needs of small business in
rural and remote areas continue to be met and provides ample
protection. I therefore ask that the amendment be
withdrawn.<a class="bkMark" name="10113054000311">&#160;</a>
