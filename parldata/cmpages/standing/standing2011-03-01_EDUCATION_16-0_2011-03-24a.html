facing down an accusation from the Chairman of the Select Committee
that I was devoid of principles.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000022">&#160;</a>

110 is a genuinely probing amendment to determine the Minister’s
thinking on changing the arrangements relating to the chief regulator,
chair and chief executive of Ofqual. I do not understand the reasoning
behind it. How will it help enhance standards for examinations in this
country? How will it increase the perceived independence of the
regulator of examination standards? How will it improve the governance
of Ofqual as an institution? The amendment is designed to probe the
Minister so he can provide the Committee with some outline of his

clarify and strengthen the public-facing role of Ofqual’s chief

                           </strong> These are quality matters and are for Ministers
rather than arm’s length bodies to decide. In its written
submission to the Committee, Ofqual pointed out the confusion with the
role of non-executive chair. Ensuring the credibility of
Ofqual’s public figurehead and chief executive is vital if we
are to secure the improvements needed for our qualifications to match
the best in the world.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000035">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It flows from
those reforms that we must have a separate chair of the Ofqual board.
An authoritative and assertive regulator for qualifications and
assessment is critical if our education system is to keep pace with the
best in the world. These provisions ensure that the chief regulator has
the understanding and credibility to lead Ofqual in securing the rigour
of exam standards. With that brief explanation, I hope that I have
persuaded the hon. Gentleman that this is the right course of
action.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000036">&#160;</a>

is essential for any organisation, and particularly one that is so
important to the public in providing reassurance about standards. Will
the Minister outline further how he imagines the governance
arrangements will work? He touched on it briefly, but will he make it
clear for my benefit whether the chief executive will be accountable to
the chair, and through the chair to the board, or directly to the
Secretary of State? Is independence being compromised in any way here?
That is the reasoning behind the amendment. How does the Minister think
the new arrangements will enhance the governance standards of Ofqual? I
am not convinced that he has reassured me on

inquiry into the annual report of Ofqual, as it does with other
arm’s length bodies that relate to education. The board will
retain collective responsibility for Ofqual’s function, allowing
the board to hold the chief regulator properly to account. I wanted to

The Minister has not, however, provided real reassurance to the
Committee on how this will work. Ultimately, I think it will work, but
I cannot understand the relationship between the chair, the chief
executive and the Secretary of State and why there is a need, unless it
is for consistency across Whitehall, for the arrangements to be
changed. Is he suggesting that Ofqual has been ineffective in its
governance arrangements and in the achieving of its

                           </strong> It was slightly odd how it worked. Isabel Nisbet,
who was the chief executive of Ofqual, was conducting the day-to-day
operations of Ofqual. She would appear in the media to discuss issues.
The chairman, Kathleen Tattersall, was the chief regulator, and she was
a non-executive appointment. It seemed an odd arrangement, and Ofqual
itself caused the worst confusion about who was the single face. We
want to avoid problems arising, which could happen if people were not
clear about Ofqual’s position. Making the chief regulator a
full-time position with executive responsibility will mean a single
figurehead with day-to-day knowledge of the sector and the
organisation. That is the key driver behind matters, rather than having
the role of chief regulator wrapped up with the non-executive position
of chairman. That seemed to be an odd governance
arrangement.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000044">&#160;</a>

more sense. We have the chief inspector of schools and other bodies
coming before the Education Committee regularly who both represent that

                           </div>standards globally and, in particular, sets examinations globally in
English. It has several worries about the clause. Under the current
Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009, Ofqual has
five objectives: the qualification standards objective, the assessment
standards objective, the public confidence objective, the awareness
objective and the efficiency
objective.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000053">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
have several probing questions. Given the emphasis in the Bill on
comparing standards of our own qualifications with those
internationally, to what extent should Ofqual’s priority be its
qualification standards objective above the other objectives given to
it under the Act? Does he consider that Ofqual’s public
confidence and awareness objectives form naturally out of the actions
taken under its qualification standards objective, and that public
confidence and better awareness will emerge if Ofqual is allowed to
focus on a primary function of standards
regulation?<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000054">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government have emphasised the role of higher education in developing
post-16 qualifications in their recent White Paper, but that emphasis
does not appear in the Bill. Does the Minister agree that those
interested parties who use qualifications—such as subject
communities, professional societies, employers, higher education,
schools, colleges and teachers—should have a greater role in
determining the content of qualifications than they do at present and
therefore a greater role in determining their standard? Does he
consider a system that incorporated those views to a greater extent
would have an impact on the role that the regulator would then be
required to play? Does he agree that the detail of individual
qualifications is something that should concern primarily those who use
qualifications, such as higher education and employers, or should the
regulator or the Government look at each qualification in
turn?<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000055">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
does hon. Gentleman think that international comparisons are always
helpful? For example, higher education requirements are likely to be
different given the types of demands made for different subjects in
different HE systems throughout the world. The standards to be reached
for a four-year degree course, as taken in many countries around the
world, or for a non-specialist degree are likely to be very different
from those demanded by three-year specialist degrees, in which the UK
is dominant. Does that mean we should be looking more to the demands of
the qualification users, rather than comparing qualifications
internationally?<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000056">&#160;</a>

am sympathetic to a number of the points made by the hon. Member for
Preston. As I have said before in Committee, clause 22 appears to be
poorly drafted. It could contain tensions between the different
requirements on Ofqual, pushing in different directions, in particular
if we look at proposed new subsection 2(b)(ii), which states that the
qualifications standards objective is to

                        <p class="tabbed">The provision
requires a consistency of attainment between regulated qualifications
in this country and comparable ones outside. Different territories have
different needs and different structures of education. I will be
interested to hear from the Minister what exactly he means by
“comparable”—it is hard to work that out. If, in
Committee, we are looking at the clause but struggling to get much
concrete meaning out of it, it is hard to see it as well drafted
law.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000059">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not know if the Minister has had chance or occasion to look at the
clause again, perhaps asking civil servants to think some more or
talking to Ofqual, and to come up with something clearer. Good sense
might be buried deep within the tangled meaning of the words, but it is
far from obvious. I hope that any such meaning, if it is consistent and
sensible, can be drawn out by rephrasing—a rephrasing that I
have not been able to come up with myself, which is why I have not
tabled an amendment, because I found the intent of the clause so hard
to
divine.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000060">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
the broadest possible sense, we want to ensure that our qualifications
are not dumbed down over time. The Bill, perhaps, responds to a sense
of that happening, as borne out by the recent Wolf report, which
suggested that the explosion of vocational qualifications has meant
that some courses have been rather too poor and are leading hundreds of
thousands of young people in the wrong direction, to somewhere from
where there is no progression into further education or
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000061">&#160;</a>

the clause stands, it is flawed, so I hope that the Minister will take
that on board and, whether in Committee or the other place, might
suggest improvements. On the face of it, the clause looks like it needs

                        <p class="tabbed">Everyone
probably agrees on the need for consistency and for comparing our
education system with others. However, on my broad question, which I
pursued in our oral evidence session with the Ofqual representatives,
can the Minister give some clarity about what he means by the
international comparison, bearing in mind that, as the Chair of the
Select Committee said, other countries will have different needs,
requirements and objectives for their examination systems? We will not
be comparing apples to pears when doing so. What form will the reviews
take? Which countries will be used? Which research methods will be
incorporated?<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000064">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
specific question relates to comparisons between regulated UK and
international qualifications, and how they provide reasonable
adjustment provisions for disabled examination candidates. The Alliance
for Inclusive Education told us that it is seeking assurance from the
Government as to how they will ensure that Ofqual is mindful of its
equality duties when determining which countries’ qualifications
it wants to use when setting appropriate educational standards under
the standards objectives

awarded outside the UK. It ensures that the importance of international
comparability of qualification standards is properly recognised by
Ofqual. It will enable Ofqual to raise the standards of qualifications
to keep pace internationally, rather than being bound to look only at
keeping them consistent over time.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000067">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The quality
of education in England has fallen behind while our competitors, such
as China and Singapore, plough ahead. The 2009 PISA results, which
compare countries’ performance in key subject areas, show that
we are falling behind in the international rankings as other countries
move more quickly, as we discussed this morning. Without wanting to
raise the ire of the hon. Member for Cardiff West, we are now 25th for
reading, 28th for maths and 16th for science, which is around the
international average for OECD countries. We are therefore looking to
maintain standards, and comparing them with the past is not enough.
Candidates need to be sure that a qualification has a highest possible
value in the international job market. Unless our exams keep pace, they
run the risk of acting as a ceiling of ambition for our students, thus
robbing them of the opportunity to compete with their counterparts in
other
countries.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000068">&#160;</a>

hon. Member for Preston asked to what extent the standards objective
should be a priority. The clause amends only subsection (2) of section
128 of the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009. All
the other objectives—the qualifications standards objective, the
assessments standards objective, the public confidence objective, the
awareness objective and the efficiency objective—that are set
out in section 128(1) will still be in force. Section 128(2) of the
2009 Act refers to giving<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000069">&#160;</a>

lot of thought went into that, and while my immediate reaction when the
first draft came to me was precisely as my hon. Friend said, the
provision is correct. There is a difficult tension between
sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii). We need Ofqual to use its judgment to
determine whether standards are high enough. The measure allows Ofqual
to do just that—to raise them when they are not high enough and
to stop them from drifting downwards if they are of a high standard
internationally. Ofqual made clear in its evidence that it will be able
to manage what is required. Its deputy chairman, Sandra Burslem, said
in her
evidence:<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000074">&#160;</a>

think it is right to say that there is a creative tension. Dennis
Opposs from Ofqual told

lot of thought is needed to try to determine what we mean by comparable
qualifications so that we are making a fair comparison. Clearly,
different countries operate in different ways. If we look at
18-year-olds, as we are at the moment, we will find that in some
countries students take many more subjects than they do in this
country. That raises some questions. For example, if someone here is
doing history and someone somewhere else is also doing history but the
subject forms a much smaller part of their curriculum, how do you make
the comparison?”<em>––</em>[<em>Official Report,

explain the phrasing of the clause, although I think he has gone native
on it. The provisions that we put in a Bill should involve a great
degree of clarity. The clause could have said that Ofqual should in
future judge the currency or value of UK qualifications against other
jurisdictions to ensure that they remain relevant internationally. As I
said, I struggled to come up with alternative wording, which was why I
did not table an amendment, but it should be possible for the provision

that he, with all his experience and eminence as Chair of the Education

that parliamentary counsel had when drafting the clause. The final
wording is deliberately drafted so that there is a creative tension
between the two. One can ask what will happen if standards over time
are fine but they are not fine internationally—which of those
two compete? My understanding is that such judgments are for Ofqual,
but it will want to ensure that we compare internationally if there is

                           </strong> It means that Ofqual, as well as obeying all the
objectives in section 128(1) of the 2009 Act, has to ensure that our
qualifications must at least maintain their standards over time and
also that they are comparable with the best regulated qualifications
abroad. It is almost a question of the highest of those two
requirements. I think that Ofqual is clear that that is what it means.
Its challenge is to take into account all the factors raised by the
hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and
Holderness about how we compare like with like, given that a history
student in one country may be spending 10% of their curriculum time on
the subject while such a student in another country spends 15%. Ofqual
is ideally suited to tackle those issues. I am confident that the work
it is conducting will be of a very high quality. It means that, for the
first time, we are taking into account what is happening in countries,
given that many school leavers and graduates will be competing for jobs
in the world market in the years
ahead.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000087">&#160;</a>

deal with proposed new subsection (2)(b)(i) and
the issue that<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000088">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“a consistent

                        <p>should
be maintained “between comparable regulated
qualifications”. As we know, newspapers come out every year with
stories about dumbing down and how exams have become easier. It always
strikes me as a rather sterile debate, because the number of people who
take qualifications is now much higher than it was 50 years
ago. If we have a measure that differentiates between the top 60% of
the population, rather than the top 7%, it will necessarily be less
accurate. It is a different qualification for different times and
different needs.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000089">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Is there a
danger if things can freeze in time? Suppose that Latin became
phenomenally popular because it was proven by research to be the best
subject ever and we wanted a vast percentage of the population to study
it. It would make little sense to have a standard that could not be
reached by most of the population. Instead, there should be a
qualification that people can pass and is proven to be good for
them—I do not know whether that made any sense. My point is
that, over time, it might not always be appropriate for a qualification
never to be dumbed down, if it needs to serve a different purpose from
the one it serves today.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000090">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My hon. Friend goes to the root of the problem. Some
of our qualifications do not have the public support—no,
“support” is the wrong word. The public have lost some
confidence, however, that a number of qualifications have maintained
the standards of previous years. To an extent, there has been a
deliberate policy of widening access to qualifications and enabling a
wider proportion of the cohort to get a pass in certain subjects. There
has been a tacit acceptance that we do precisely what my hon. Friend
describes. If that is the objective, however, it is not the right
approach if we are to maintain public confidence in our exam system. If
that is the objective, we should say so, but when Ofqual or the
Qualifications and Curriculum Authority—its
predecessor—have been asked, they have said that there has been
no dumbing down of the qualifications over the years. Such statements
undermine people’s confidence in the exams, and we are trying to
get away from that. If there is a desire for an exam that everybody is
able to pass, it should be called something different. I do not
disagree with the objective suggested by my hon. Friend, but we need
honesty in the exam system to restore public
confidence.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000091">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Is it not the case that dumbing down would be
less likely to occur if communities of interest, as Cambridge
Assessment calls them, were more involved in determining the content of
many of the qualifications? By communities, I mean professional
societies, employers, higher education institutions, schools, colleges
and teachers. If they had a leading role in determining the content of
each qualification, dumbing down would not take place. We could give
awarding bodies greater ownership over the development, design and
content of qualifications that were previously under the remit of the
QCDA.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000092">&#160;</a>

crucial that HE and employers are involved in the design of
qualifications, and he is right to raise that point. Standards of
qualifications are important, which is why we need effective
regulation. He is also right to suggest that less central Government
diktat over qualification content is necessary, and that is the thrust
of what we are trying to do. He is right that exam awarding bodies need
an important say in the content of the qualifications, and that is the
direction in which we seek to move.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000093">&#160;</a>

tension in it reflects the tension in the real world. We want to have
standards that are equal to the best in the world as well as
qualifications that are usable. That is the challenge that Ofqual
faces, and it is capable of delivering on that challenge. It fully
understands what the clause means—as I do, and as I think the
hon. Gentleman does—and it is well equipped to deal with that
challenge. It is an important step forward that we are asking a UK
regulator for the first time to look at what is happening in other
countries. We need a less insular and more global approach in the new

our qualifications are lagging behind those of comparable nations
abroad for rigour and standards, the priority will be to ensure that
our qualifications rise to those standards. Ultimately, as an
independent regulator, it is for Ofqual to decide what is best for
students in this country. The clause sets out clear objectives to
ensure that there is consistency over time, that the best
qualifications around the world are looked at, and that standards are
comparable with other non-regulated qualifications. Those are
Ofqual’s objectives, and I am absolutely confident that, based
on the wording of the clause, it is capable of delivering

addition, schools are expected to follow the core programmes of study
from September 2013 and the other curriculum areas from September 2014.
It is understood that the curriculum materials will be made available,
to enable proper preparation by schools, at least one year before the
curriculum’s introduction. It would be helpful if the Minister
clarified whether that will happen if, by then, the functions have been
transferred to the Secretary of State. We tabled amendment 113 to seek
clarity on the specific functions that will be transferred from the
agency to the Secretary of State. I shall take your advice, Mr Walker,
about whether we need a stand part debate on that
matter.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000111">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It
is not clear why the QCDA is being abolished, although I fully
appreciate that the Secretary of State is not a friend of the
agency—he has never much liked it. Will the Minister share with
the Committee the evidence that the Secretary of State considered that
led him to abolish the body? It is unclear which functions will be
transferred to the Secretary of State, which will go to other bodies
and which will cease. Will the Minister clarify that? Will he tell us
what will happen to the existing functions? On the functions that will
transfer to the Secretary of State, how does the Minister intend to
consult to ensure that his decisions are informed by the views, wishes
and needs of the teaching
profession?<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000112">&#160;</a>

and expertise to carry out the new functions that will transfer to him
from the QCDA. I do not wish to rehash or recycle previous debates in
which we have discussed the Training and

for England, and so on, but the same principles apply. Parliament must
be satisfied that the Secretary of State is demonstrably capable of
taking on such functions. How will the Minister ensure that the
Secretary of State is able to carry out each of the new functions that
he will undertake as a result of the abolition of the QCDA? The
centralising aspect of the Bill is a concern, bearing in mind every
other function and agency that he will take on. Again, what
consultation will he have with the profession when he makes decisions
on matters such as curriculum development? It would be most helpful to
have a clearer outline of what functions will be
transferred.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000113">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Amendments 111 to 115 were tabled to seek clarity
about the future of the QCDA’s functions and reassurance that
those areas that are due to transfer to the Department will be
adequately resourced and efficiently transferred. The detailed
consultation with the QCDA and staff from its representative, the
Public and Commercial Services Union, has already begun. Through that
process, staff will be informed whether their job is at risk or whether
they are likely to transfer to the Department. At this stage, it would
be wrong to pre-empt that process by giving specifics on structures, or
on how many jobs will be available for a specific function. The staff
who are affected should hear first, in a manner that is consistent with
protocols agreed between the Cabinet Office and the PCS. I am happy to
commit to writing to hon. Members with further details before Report,
but I shall give a summary now, which I hope they will find
useful.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000114">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">A new
Executive agency, the standards and testing agency, will be established
in Coventry to develop and deliver statutory assessments of children up
to the age of 14. The QCDA’s functions in that area will
transfer to that agency, along with the relevant staff who currently
work on statutory tests and assessments. We have made it clear to the
QCDA that our priority is to effect the transfer as smoothly as
possible, thus minimising any risk to test delivery. Clear and robust
arrangements involving senior QCDA representatives are in place to
manage that change and keep a close eye on any potential
risk. The independent examinations regulator, Ofqual, will have an
important role, as it does now with QCDA. It will keep under review the
agency’s functions in relation to statutory assessments and it
will ensure the integrity and impartiality of national curriculum
tests.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000115">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Part of the
QCDA’s work is to support the effective delivery of
examinations. That work will also transfer, but to the Department
itself rather than to an Executive agency. That function will continue
to include collecting and delivering exam scripts, as well as the key
elements of the central service that the QCDA provides to support
examination offices. The collection of exam scripts is a vital service
that the Joint Council for Qualifications and Ofqual were keen to see
continued for fear that its withdrawal might jeopardise the
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000116">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Since
the introduction of the national curriculum, responsibility for the
curriculum has always rested with the Secretary of State, both under
the previous Administration and this, and nothing is changing as far as
that is concerned. The QCDA simply acted on behalf of Government in
advising and helping to design the curriculum and, as such, no
functions are transferring from the QCDA to the Department. It is
simply that the QCDA’s often duplicative functions in keeping
the curriculum under review are ceasing. In future we will appoint
directly the curriculum expertise we need as and when necessary to
support specific tasks such as curriculum and qualifications reviews.
This is just the approach we have taken already in the current national
curriculum review. We will also make better use of the expertise of
teachers and subject experts in universities and industry to support
our policy-making, rather than relying on intermediary bodies such as
the QCDA to provide curriculum
advice.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000118">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
QCDA’s production and publication of 566 separate pieces of
curriculum guidance overwhelmed teachers. That activity had to be
stopped. We want teachers and head teachers involved in setting the
curriculum in their school to use their professional expertise, not be
bound by reams of guidance. The slimmed-down curriculum we intend to
introduce will be simpler to understand and focused on core subject
knowledge. It will give schools the freedom to design a full curriculum
that is rigorous, relevant and engaging, without the need for
interference from the Government or their
agents.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000119">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Turning
to the QCDA’s role in developing qualifications, its role was
already reducing as a result of the creation of Ofqual as an
independent regulator. Our intention is to move away from centrally set
exam requirements over and above the necessary core that will be
established by the curriculum. Instead, we want to encourage more
direct influence by universities—and learned societies,
reflecting a comment by the hon. Gentleman—over the content and
design of exams. We need much less state involvement in the design of
qualifications. I hope that the Committee will find that
useful.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000120">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman asked when the QDCA will close. It will close soon after
Royal Assent, subject to the will of Parliament, and we are winding
down anything unnecessary. That is already happening. The staff have
stopped doing things that are not good value for money for the
taxpayer. We have halved the QDCA’s budget since we came to
office in May last
year.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000121">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Of course, if the functions decline there will be
fewer activities taking place and, given that the budget is reducing,
there will ultimately be fewer staff performing these functions. How we
manage that decline is subject to negotiation and there is obviously a
desire to minimise any compulsory redundancies. In May 2010, 509 people
were employed by the QCDA and as at

                           </div>the end of January 2011 that figure was 326. Much of that fall was
achieved either through natural wastage or transferring staff to other
functions within
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000123">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
conclusion, the abolition of several departmental arm’s length
bodies, including the QCDA, signals a reduction in centralised control
over aspects of education where there is no need for the Government to
be involved and supports greater devolution to localities and the front
line. Abolishing the QCDA is vital to allow improvements in standards
to be driven by professionals—school leaders and teachers. It
will ensure that Ministers, rather than unelected officials, are
clearly accountable for those national functions which are continuing.
It will maximise the amount of the education budget that goes directly
to schools and
colleges.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000124">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
must not delay in moving towards the abolition of the QCDA, as proposed
by one of these amendments. Unnecessary work has already ceased and
arrangements are in place to transfer any essential remaining functions
over the course of the coming months. It serves no one, least of all
the taxpayer, to prolong the closure process unduly. I hope that with
those few remarks, I have assured Members of the Committee that this
transfer is happening efficiently and sensitively, that the Department
has the resources, the expertise and the capacity to take on those new
responsibilities and that it is setting up a new executive agency to do
some of those important functions, such as national curriculum testing.
On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be able to withdraw
his
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000125">&#160;</a>

to specify the period in which stakeholders can submit evidence for

be 12

                        <p class="tabbed">I
agree that we should encourage contributions from those concerned in
the matters if a change in the national curriculum is being considered.
The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right that there should be a robust
process for ensuring that any such changes are consulted on widely, and
there must be a proper opportunity for people to comment and discuss.
He will know that in the previous regime, of which he was part, the
Government developed and introduced a code of practice on consultation
in 2000, setting out how consultation exercises are best run. The third
version of the code was published as late as 2008, setting out the
approach that the Government should take when they are involved in 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 645<a class="bkMark" name="Column645">&#160;</a>
                           </div>a consultation and the timetables concerned. The current Government take
the same view as the previous Government on consultation and support
the code. The code recommends that such consultation should normally
last 12 weeks, not 12 months—that is the practice adopted by the
previous
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000140">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am sensitive to what the hon. Gentleman said and I accept that there
are circumstances where time scales will need to be varied because of
feasibility. For example, if a consultation takes place over Christmas
or summer, it is absolutely right to have flexibility about the total
time that it takes, to account for those events. Consultations that the
QCDA managed in the past on the national curriculum have been in line
with the guidance set out in that code of practice, and we intend to
continue the precedent established—in this respect, at
least—by the previous
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000141">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
mentioned Catholicism briefly this morning in your absence, Mr Walker,
and you missed the interesting contribution on that subject. Strangely
and coincidentally, I was reading a recent biography of Cardinal Newman
this morning over breakfast, which was given to me by the Secretary of
State for Christmas. I was reading about Newman’s use of
empiricism. I am not a great fan of empiricism; I like the mystery that
Chesterton said is an essential component in happiness. Notwithstanding
that, it is important that we look at evidence. If the hon.
Gentleman has evidence that stakeholders are uncomfortable or unhappy
with that code of practice, I am prepared to listen to it. If there
were difficulties with the period of consultation in the past when
responding to changes to the national curriculum, we should know about
them. If the previous Government were plagued with complaints, let us
get them on the record here, because we want to improve on what has
gone on before, where necessary. I see that the hon. Gentleman has been
passed a note about Catholicism, and I know that he will use it with
the assiduity for which he is known in this place.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000142">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">What is
seriously important for schools and other stakeholders is that they are
able to offer any views that they have on proposals about the national
curriculum. We share that view—it is absolutely right, as the
hon. Gentleman says, that those views are fed in in a timely way and
that we see the results of such consultation reasonably quickly.
Specifying a period of 12 months for those consultations is likely to
be seen as pretty cumbersome, not by the Government, but by
stakeholders, and would delay the completion of procedures for making
and implementing changes related to the national curriculum. I think
that that would generally apply to most such changes, given what I said
about precedent and about the national code. In practice, it would mean
that the implementation of a change to the national curriculum would
take a full year longer than under the previous
arrangements—arrangements that will be continued under the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000143">&#160;</a>

would place a duty on the Secretary of State, requiring him to make
orders or regulations related to the national curriculum in such a
manner as to be likely to bring those proposals to the attention of any
person concerned with education in schools. I am sympathetic to what I
interpret to be the intended effect of the amendment and I agree that
those who are

                           </div>interested in the national curriculum should have the opportunity to
comment on any proposed changes to it. We must be open-minded about
such matters, and drawing on the expertise, the understanding and the
proper concern of important stakeholders is important. I understand why
the amendment has been tabled and I respect the purpose behind
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000144">&#160;</a>

recognise that what is taught in our schools, particularly the elements
that require the national curriculum, is of the utmost significance and
generates interest. It generates debate, too, and inevitably dissent
from what is the natural part of life in a democratic and civilised
society. It is a good measure. We should care about what is taught in
our schools, and I want as many people as possible to be involved in
the process. I am open-minded about such matters, as members of the

have made a commitment to ensure that the review of the national
curriculum we launched earlier this year is carried out in an open,
consultative and inclusive way. The change proposed under the Bill is
who conducts the consultation, not the nature and quality of the
consultation itself. We are committed to ensuring that, when exercising
powers in relation to the national curriculum, there should be
widespread and thorough discussion. That is why we have been careful to
leave the current arrangements for consultation to those groups that
must be consulted under proposed new section (96)(2) under the
schedule. It names local authorities, governing bodies and other
representative organisations. In addition, subsection (3) of the
proposed new section requires the Secretary of State

                        <p>That is important. The
hon. Gentleman is asking for a more open process. The Bill specifies
that anyone who desires to consult should be included in that
consultation, in addition to the names and organisations that it
outlines. That is the slightly more permissive approach that he wants.
It will, of course, include parents, pupils, representatives of further
and higher education, and employers. We heard about some of those in
our earlier discussions and it is absolutely right that those affected
by such changes should be party to the discussions and consultations
that take place. I imagine that was what the hon. Gentleman wanted to
tease out. The measure will achieve the same effect as intended by his
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000148">&#160;</a>

gaining a reputation in Committee for being a fair, open-minded,
responsive and listening Minister, and I do not want in any sense to
demur from those observations. I confirm absolutely that we will adhere
to the guidance under the code. In the light of my immensely reasonable
response, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the

                        <p class="tabbed">The purpose
of amendment 118 is to enable the Secretary of State to transfer any
property to a charity. The Minister and I debated that with regard to
the TDA. Will the Minister explain whether that would be possible in
respect of the QCDA? Could it cover intellectual property, for example?
Could it cover the non-statutory framework for, say, religious
education? If the Secretary of State does not wish to maintain this
framework as part of the functions that are transferred to him, the
amendment would enable it to be transferred to a charity that supports
religious education in schools. That is the purpose of the amendment. I
hope the Minister will feel positive and able to accept the amendment.
He can put something on the record and explain how amenable he is to
the content of the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000158">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Amendment 118 would allow Ministers to transfer any
residual QCDA staff and assets at the time of closure to a charity, as
well as to Ofqual and the Department, as we have in the Bill at the
moment. The provision for the making of a transfer scheme allows
residual staff and assets that remain in QCDA immediately prior to
closure to be transferred to the Department or Ofqual in a simple and
efficient manner. I can assure members of the Committee that in the
process of transferring and disposing of assets, the Department is
actively considering the benefits of transferring some assets to
charities, including awarding bodies and their representatives,
particularly where the benefit brings about savings to the public
purse. If that is the intention behind the amendment, I can readily
confirm that we have sympathy with
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000159">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
we do not need a transfer scheme to provide for such transfers, as they
would be sorted out well in advance of the closing date. For example, I
outlined  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 648<a class="bkMark" name="Column648">&#160;</a>
                           </div>previously that we have already agreed in principle, at the request of
the Joint Council for Qualifications, that the access arrangements
online tool will continue and transfer to the Joint Council for
Qualifications. In addition, we are planning to transfer curriculum
resources in the form of video to educational forums such as TES
Connect, so that it can build them into its existing resource catalogue
under the open government licence. As we work through the details, we
will of course ensure that those assets are disposed of and protected
in accordance with statute and Cabinet Office
requirements.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000160">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
key point is the timing of the transfers. There is no need to introduce
legislation to allow for a transfer scheme between the QCDA and a
charity, such as an awarding body, as transfers of this nature will
take place as part of the ongoing closure process. The transfer scheme
in schedule 8 will only be required for residual staff or assets, where
those need to transfer to the Department or Ofqual as part of the final
closure arrangements. With those remarks, I hope that the hon.
Gentleman can withdraw his

take the accountancy out of the boy—and, as of 31 March 2010,
there were 675 staff. The Minister has been helpful on staffing,
because in an earlier intervention he said that there were about
325—I might have got the precise figure wrong—as a result
of natural wastage and the transfer or cancellation of functions. Will
he update the Committee further? Given what he has previously said
about other organisations, such as the General Teaching Council for
England and the Training and Development Agency for Schools, will he
give us some reassurance, because staff will be concerned about whether
their jobs will continue and the possibilities for future employment?
Is he able to give any reassurance, through the Committee, on how that
is

which is in a relatively new building. As I will come on to say, lease
payments still have to be made for a long time. Will the Minister
outline, in relation to the estate strategy, what is happening? Off the
top of my head, I understand that the agency has premises in
London—in Piccadilly, I think—so what will happen to
that?<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000166">&#160;</a>

balance sheet or “statement of financial position”, as it
is called for a Government agency, shows that the QCDA has net
liabilities of almost £56 million—£55.8
million. That is an astonishingly high figure. Will the Minister
confirm that that liability position will be transferred to the
Department? That will again leave the Department at risk of financial
exposure, and to such a large degree that it might impact on other
elements of its work. What is the Minister doing about that
£56 million?

external to the Government, which has significantly increased from the

Cabinet Office protocols, we are taking all reasonable steps to avoid
compulsory redundancies, but obviously cannot rule them out. We must be
sensitive in handling staff reductions, as we are being. I hope that
the hon. Gentleman will understand that when we debate these issues
across the Committee. The numbers have reduced, as I have said, through
loss of contractors and temporary staff, through natural wastage and
through access to other vacant positions. Also, some functions have
transferred to Ofqual and a number of people have left through
voluntary arrangements. That number will be reduced further through the
more comprehensive voluntary redundancy

to the speech of the Secretary of State, then the shadow Secretary of
State, to the Conservative party conference in 2009 in which he really
had a go at QCDA. The Secretary of State is no friend of QCDA. He
mentioned 76 spin doctors employed by QCDA, but figures, real figures,
for the communications department said that the figure used by the
Secretary of State—those 76 spin doctors—included all
staff in the communications department, QCDA and Ofqual customer
service departments. They included switchboard and helpline operators,
web and publishing editors and people who support schools and local
authorities. Is it not the case that the Secretary of State wanted to
abolish QCDA and made up some figures in order to justify it? Will the
Minister put on the record that he realises that, actually, staff have
played an invaluable role in making sure that schools, local
authorities and others get assistance with the national curriculum and
that this does not do the Secretary of State any favours
whatsoever?<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000177">&#160;</a>

staff at the QCDA. However, we object to the continual
production—whatever the quality of the product—of the
large volume of guidance and revisions to the curriculum that I think

                           </strong> We now come to an important part of the proposed
legislation—the radical changes to careers guidance in England.
The Government intend to abolish the current Connexions service and
introduce an all-age careers service for young people aged 13 to 19,
and for adults some time in the future. I pay tribute to the Minister
for Further Education, Skills and Lifelong Learning on this matter. The
measure has received wide-ranging praise from stakeholders in the
sector. This amendment grouping is designed not to reinstate, or even
to delay, the abolition of Connexions, although there could be a case
for that, but to probe the Government for more detail on the important
transition period between the abolition of Connexions and the start of
the new all-age careers service.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000195">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Time is
running out. Many Connexions staff have received redundancy notices,
and will lose their jobs on 31 March, which is just a week away. Unison
estimates that a quarter of Connexions centres have already closed, and
that some 8,000 professionals are in the process of imminently losing
their jobs. It is clear that once that expertise and professionalism is
lost to education, it is difficult, if not impossible, to get it back.
There is a risk that these professionals will be lost to education, and
to the cause of helping to raise the ambitions and aspirations of young
people, for ever. At a time of record unemployment and genuine
heartfelt fear from young people and their parents on the prospects of
a lost generation, we need excellent careers advice now more than ever.
It is not the time to leave the careers service in
limbo.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000196">&#160;</a>

that. I know that there is a case for the abolition of Connexions; we
are not here to determine whether that is suitable. Things like the
future jobs fund, which was abolished and which helped 720 young people
in my constituency alone get a foot on the job ladder, are essential.
This Government have no strategy for young people. It is a real shame
that this country will have to pay the costs of that for decades and

argument. Although the future jobs fund is not within my purview,
apprenticeships are. I give him the opportunity to welcome the fact
that we announced a further 50,000 apprenticeships yesterday, some
40,000 of which are targeted at young

be fair, he is building on the work that my hon. Friend the Member for
Cardiff West and I carried out when we were in government, but I
believe that he is passionately committed to this issue. Now is not the
time to ask, but I would be interested to know whether the money to
fund those apprenticeships is new or recycled, and whether the targets
are

accusations against this Government given the previous one’s

under the previous Government before the credit crunch. There is no
doubt, however, about what happened to young people who ended up in
unemployment, which did not go down throughout the period of economic
growth, and went up when we reached the credit crunch. A humble
atonement is required from an Opposition Member. I welcome additional
apprenticeships. I know that the shadow Ministers genuinely tried to
tackle that matter, but they failed. We all need to take a tone of
humility, because, collectively, we must do a lot better for young
people. We do not want a lost generation.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000201">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> In the previous Government, I was the Minister
with responsibility for the Connexions service. I remember being before
the hon. Gentleman’s predecessor’s Select Committee, and
the Chairman questioned me harshly on that matter. The hon. Gentleman
is quite right. Throughout the good times and the bad, 10% of young
people have been disengaged—they have not been in employment,
education or training—and successive Governments have found that
difficult to solve.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000202">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We can look
at the various segments of young people who are not in education,
employment or training. It is the nature of some to go in and out of
jobs. They might not have responsibilities to family and so on, so if
they do not like a job, they can go. Depending on the fluidity and
flexibility of the job market, they might be able to get another one.
To do so, however, is becoming increasingly difficult in the current
economic situation. A core segment of approximately 30% of young people
found it more difficult to choose a suitable career or training
pathway, for which careers provision is essential. If we get that
right, we do an awful lot to reduce that core 10%—which is
rising—of young people who are
NEET.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000203">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">At
some point in future, there will be a transition period between the
abolition of Connexions services and the rise of the all-age careers
service. During that time, people who might really benefit from an
efficient, effective and personalised careers service will be lost
through the cracks, and we may not see them re-emerge as economically
active people for decades to come. That is a tragedy for the people
concerned and for our economic growth as a nation,
too.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000204">&#160;</a>

this discussion, has my hon. Friend read the work of Paul Gregg from
the university of Bristol? He has discussed how not getting into
employment early on becomes a scar on young people’s employment
prospects throughout the course of their life. They become less
qualified and less attractive to employers, even if they subsequently
get into the labour market. It is important to have a career service
that helps stop that

could put people on the right path before we get to the stage of having
an all-age careers service. If we try to intervene when people are age
25 or 26, we are already dealing with people who will never earn as
much as their contemporaries, because their career trajectories have

university of Bristol work. I imagine that although her constituency is
in a London borough, her experience is similar to mine. I want to put
on the record that she is considerably younger than I am, but we are in
the same ball park—there are only five years between us, I
think. I grew up in the 1980s, when industry in my part of the
world—the north-east—was closing fast. Some people whom I
went to school with have never worked to their potential. They have
embarked on low-paid, low-skilled jobs. It is an absolute tragedy for
them, their families and the economic growth potential of my region.
One of the reasons that I wanted to come into politics was to ensure
that that would not happen again. Given the global economic
circumstances and the economic policies pursued by the Government,
despite the best efforts of the Minister, I fear that we will see a
return of a lost generation. The tragedy will be difficult to

                           </div>it, some services will be available from September, with the full
service up and running by April 2012. Will he clarify more fully the
timetable for setting up the new careers service? What will be the
handover period between Connexions and the new careers service, given
that we are days away from wide-scale redundancies and loss of
expertise to the careers service? Such a handover service does not seem
possible. In any case, is September too late for the setting up of some
services? We heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow that
the longer someone, in particular a young person, is out of the job
market, the more difficult it is to get gainful, meaningful
employment.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000212">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
risk of the current plans is that students might be in the last year of
a qualification—they might be examined in May or June this
year—and will soon be thinking about their next steps, perhaps
for entry to a new course in September. Where, perhaps in July or
August this year, will they get advice from on their various options?
What is the Minister putting in place with regard to that? Does the
all-age careers service require primary legislation, and if not, why
not? If it does, why is nothing planned in the Government’s
legislative programme? Would that mean a further
delay?<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000213">&#160;</a>

(a total of £2,222 million in 2011-12 and
£2,307 million in 2012-13) with new flexibility to
enable local authorities to act more strategically and target spending
early, where it will have the greatest impact. The organisation of
services is for local authorities to determine, in the light of their
statutory responsibilities. Any changes that may be necessary in the
current provision of careers guidance services will be for local
authorities to work through, involving, where appropriate, Connexions
service providers.”—[<em>Official Report</em>, 18 March

sounds great. No one could disagree with that. But if we look into it,
the new early intervention grant is being cut by 11% this year and a
further 11% the year after. The Connexions budget now sits within the
EIG, but that replaces 22 separate funding streams, including teenage
pregnancy and children’s social care work force funding, to
which we in the last year of the previous Government provided
£2.8 billion. So there has been a £311 million cut
already this year. As I said, there will be an 11% cut the following
year. That money will not be available, given what else needs to be
funded as part of the early intervention grant. I plead with the
Minister—will he consider more fully the transitional agreements
and the loss of professionalism and commitment to the ambition of young
people that will happen in a matter of days unless we get a very full

Secretary of State that looks bold and is designed to curry favour with
a certain element of the media, but their policy is muddled, ambiguous
and ill-conceived and fails to consider the legislative,
administrative, logistical and financial implications of such an
announcement. This is a big issue. I know the Minister is committed to
the ongoing ambition and aspiration of young people, but as the measure
currently stands, he will fail in his task if he allows that to happen.

Amendments 100 and 122, which are the substantive amendments in the
group as chosen by your good self, Mr Walker, focus on the transition
between the current provision to the new all-age careers service.
Reading between the lines of the shadow Minister’s
speech—or perhaps one does not have to—one can tell that
there was an acceptance that Connexions, despite the good work that it
carried out, has not delivered in the careers arena in the way that we
would all like to see, and that a move to an all-age careers service is
one of the positive steps of the Bill. A lot of the devil is in the
detail, and there is a certain amount of devil in the transition as
well, which I will focus on.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000227">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We all
know—or ought to know—how important careers guidance is.
It contributes to young people getting on the right pathway in life and
being able to progress educationally and ultimately in employment. If
we are to reverse our position on unemployment, particularly for young
people, and the calamitous fall in our manufacturing, it is important
that we get it right. The shadow Minister mentioned, as Opposition
Members frequently do, the terrible decade of the 1980s when
manufacturing was, according to them, put to the sword. However,
despite the earlier high-minded speech of the hon. Member for Cardiff
West about not being selective with information and always mentioning
everything regardless of whether it is helpful to one’s case,
they never mention the fact that manufacturing suffered worse under the
Labour Government than it did under the Government of Mrs Thatcher in
the 1980s. The Labour Government did not inherit, as Mrs Thatcher did,
a bankrupt economy on its knees, but a golden legacy. I am aware of my
need to return to the amendment, and I will swiftly do so.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000228">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The whole
point of good careers advice is to ensure that people do not end up
unemployed and that manufacturers and others find people who have been
guided through the pathways to the right education and skills so that
they can be employed. It is well worth hammering home that Opposition
Members should remember the Labour Government’s poor record on
manufacturing, which we need to turn
around.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000229">&#160;</a>

different place. Also, there are fewer jobs in manufacturing

further education and skills-based training. If we are to reverse the
decline in social mobility that occurred under the previous Government,
we must ensure that all students—especially those from
disadvantaged backgrounds—fully understand their educational
options and are encouraged to have aspiration and to be ambitious. I am
pleased that the Government announced that young people aged 13 to 19
and adults would be able to begin accessing new arrangements for
careers guidance from September and, as has been said, that service
will be fully operational by April 2012. That will provide a
comprehensive and co-ordinated careers service for all age groups for

Minister’s question? People in the sector—they have made
representations to me, as Chair of the Education Committee—are
not clear what the budgets are, whether they have been finalised and,
if not, when they will be finalised. Will the Minister clarify how the

to push the Minister on the online offer. As the shadow Minister was
keen to make clear, a lot of work is being done building on the work of
Ministers in the previous Government, and so it should be, where that
work is of value. There was a lot of work on the online offer, but that
was not targeted at young people. How will the online offer be made
suitable for young people? What is the budget for that? What is the
time period? Does the Minister recognise the importance of getting that
right and soon, so that we minimise any negative impact of the
transitional period before the new all-age service is
running?<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000238">&#160;</a>

authorities? What duties do local authorities have in this period? Is
there a role for MPs or Ministers in ensuring that local authorities,
schools and others, particularly during this transition and the move to
the new all-age service, are aware of their responsibilities and that
we ensure that everyone does everything they can to ensure that young
people have the direction, support and information that they need to

do not want to digress too much, but I worked with unemployed young
people over a 10-year period in the 1980s and 1990s and those young
people had their future lives destroyed by that period of unemployment,
because when employment rises again, does an employer take on a
16-year-old who has just come out of school, all keen, still used to
getting up in the morning, or the 26-year-old who has never worked and
has got into poor patterns of behaviour? It is crucial that young
people get the right advice and support to get them into employment as
soon as
possible.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000242">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">A
gap is developing where there are these enormous cuts. I have heard
some of the information coming through: no service now in central
Bedfordshire; Essex to go down to six or seven staff from 150;
Newcastle to have a 50% cut; Cheshire Connexions to have no funding
from 31 March. Those are just a few examples of what is happening to
Connexions services. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool said,
Connexions had this dedicated funding and now it is all in the early
intervention grant, a much reduced pot, but we know the emphasis that
people rightly put on early years, on Sure Start and those other
programmes. Connexions is now competing with pregnancy services, with
drugs and alcohol services, with youth services and all those other
services within the early intervention grant. Because of the Bill and
the all-age service, local authorities believe that they can cut staff
and projects
now.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000243">&#160;</a>

among us might think that that is something to do with the fact that if
staff are cut now, there will be no TUPE obligations to come along in
the future. I am sure that that is just a cynical view and that it is
not what the Government are thinking about, but we clearly need to
remind local authorities that they still have a statutory duty and will
continue to have a statutory duty to provide certain services. As my
hon. Friend said, we need to look at enforcement and say to them,
“You cannot do what you are doing; it is against the

was a threat to take his mum to court because Thomas would not attend
school. Eventually, through our intervention, Thomas was diagnosed with
an autism-related condition, but he would not leave home, go to school
or do anything else. He had a Connexions adviser who came to the house
regularly and, using the funding available, was able to take Thomas out
to the library, to various other activities and to experience work
programmes. Thomas’s life has been transformed. His mum and gran
are now desperate about what will happen to him if Connexions

and where he lived, of taking the wrong path. He says that he left
school with very little confidence when it came to talking to people

but it was also about targeted support. For background
reasons—about being in poverty, being a young carer or coming
from a difficult family background—young people may have needed
additional support to help them into employment, education or training.
But it was also about the universal service of providing careers
advice. As I acknowledged earlier, pure careers advice suffered through
the Connexions programme. However, that is not to say that we do not
need that programme; it means that we need to harden up careers advice
for everybody and to ensure that all young people receive the support
they need. Connexions was also about providing general support to
people—for example, with careers interviews and options for the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000249">&#160;</a>

quality service for individuals that is sufficient to meet the required
statutory duty remains. We need to ensure that there is clarity on
roles and responsibilities in relation to local authorities and the

to ring-fence dedicated funds to ensure that the service continues at

of Connexions was about young people defining, contributing to and

cuts to services. What are we doing about consulting young people on
what they currently need from Connexions? I look forward to the

                           </div>members, although it would be unfair to point that out—I remember
them as a fairly cursory thing, with little in-depth advice about the
breadth of careers that might be open to us or the experiences that it
would be important to gain in order to get access to those careers, as
well as the academic or vocational routes that might lead to them.
Things have improved hugely since then—Connexions made great
progress in addressing such issues, as well as in tackling the barriers
in the way of some young people. However, a lot more needs to be done.
The issue of all-age careers advice is important, to ensure that young
people at earlier stages of their education and development are not
closing off options. We need to address

about what is now happening in the careers services. As we have heard,
funding for Connexions was previously ring-fenced, but has been
amalgamated with 22 other previously ring-fenced grants into the early
intervention grant, which the Local Government Association tells us has
been cut by
25%.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000261">&#160;</a>

are told that the same early intervention grant will fund Sure Start,
the cost of extending free education to two-year-olds, the cost of
short breaks for disabled children, all support programmes targeted at
preventing children from engaging in crime and at tackling substance
misuse, and all support programmes for teenage pregnancy. It also has
to provide support for children with mental health problems and
learning difficulties, and for all transition arrangements—into
education, between primary and secondary, and between secondary and FE
or employment. The grant has to support all behaviour support services
in schools and local authorities, as well as local authority-led child
and adolescent mental-health services and children’s community
paramedic services, such as speech therapy, and special educational
needs, youth services and the transition funding to an all-age careers

recall the Chancellor telling the House that he would not balance the
books on the back of the poor, but I am sure that all of us in the room
agree that there is little within the list that would be suitable for
book balancing. Given that, it is not surprising that Connexions is
disappearing before our very eyes. Those staff who are not taking the
opportunity of early retirement or voluntary redundancy on 31 March
face redundancy next year. Will the Minister explain what action he
will take now to stop careers disappearing because, if we do not do
something, the careers guidance service in this country is unlikely to
recover from what is happening today?<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000263">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Joy
is of the will which labours, which overcomes obstacles, which knows
triumph.”<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000394">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>I
hope that in overcoming the obstacles that have been well-articulated
in Committee and in labouring to achieve the objectives that the hon.
Member for Hartlepool has generously identified with me, we will indeed
know triumph in respect of careers advice and guidance. That is not in
the brief—civil servants get nervous when one starts speaking
off the brief, as Ministers and former Ministers know—but it is
so important, because of the difference that good advice and guidance
make to those that otherwise would not get
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000265">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is true that most people who are already advantaged benefit from pretty
good advice through familiar contacts or social networks. They do not
tend to struggle to fulfil their potential. That is an advantage that,
I guess, most of our children—I am thinking of my children in
particular, because one thinks of one’s own children
first—are likely to benefit from, but it was not an advantage
that I benefited from any more than the hon. Members for Cardiff West
and for Hartlepool or my hon. Friend the Member for Stevenage, because
our parents did not have the knowledge. It was not that they did not
care or that they did not have the aspiration; they did not have the
wherewithal. Good advice and guidance makes the marriage between
ambition and outcome, through the advent of wherewithal. That is why it
is so important for social mobility and in assisting those who start
with the fewest advantages to gain, through that wherewithal, their
chance of glittering prizes. That is why I am so passionately
committed.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000266">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am not alone in that commitment. If one looks, for example, at the
report produced by the former Cabinet Minister, Alan Milburn, entitled
“Unleashing Aspiration: The Final Report of the Panel on Fair
Access to the Professions”, which was essentially about
broadening access, he specifically highlights advice and guidance as
being salient to the purpose that I have described. He is not alone.
Lord Browne, when asked to look at access to higher education, again
highlighted advice and guidance as being critically important. His
report
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000267">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Students
will be better informed about the range of options available to them.
Their choices will shape the landscape of higher
education.”<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000395">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Hartlepool was extremely generous in what he said about
what I believe in. I think it was Ruskin who said that greatness is
defined by humility, so I had better not dwell on it too much, but he
was generous both in terms of the principle and in terms of what I am
trying to do about that principle. The points that have been raised in
Committee about the details deserve a full answer, and they will get
one today. It is important that young people in schools and in further
education and beyond have access to the kinds of life-changing advice
that I have described and that the Committee cares about. Therefore, I
want to speak at some length—you will be delighted to learn, Mr
Walker—to reassure the Committee about our plans for careers
guidance and to address all of the points that have been made so
far.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000268">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">First
of all, let us be realistic about Connexions. I do not want to condemn
it, because a lot of good work was done by people in that service, and
it would be quite 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 665<a class="bkMark" name="Column665">&#160;</a>
                           </div>wrong to stigmatise Connexions as having failed. In all kinds of ways,
Connexions did not fail and did good work, but we asked too much of it
to be a jack-of-all-trades and to excel in every area. It is a big ask
to expect people to be high-quality, professional careers advisers as
well as being able to offer good advice on a range of lifestyle issues.
That is not merely my own view. I have mentioned Alan Milburn’s
report “Unleashing Aspiration” in which he
recommends:<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000269">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Abolishing
the Connexions careers service and replacing it with a dedicated,
professional and flexible careers advisory service in every school and

                        </p>
                        <p>That
was part of what was necessary to achieve the objectives that he set
out in his
report.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000270">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
liked all the people whom I shadowed, but the hon. Member for Cardiff
West was the most effective of them. I do not want to offend anyone,
but luckily most of them have left the House now, so it is not going to
cost me a great deal. I know that the hon. Member for Hartlepool, who
was responsible for Connexions, also took these matters very seriously.
The previous Government made some strides in this area, and I would
like to put on the record that I inherited a rising tide in the number
of apprenticeships. We can go much further, and this Government will do
so, but the previous Government made considerable progress. That was
perhaps partly provoked by my almost tedious concentration on the
subject—no, not tedious; I am now being too humble, and if I get
too humble I will become too great—because I banged on about
apprenticeships for five years. We are looking to build on that, to
extend it and to go much further. That needs to be put on the record,
because these Committees, and debates in the House generally, are often
too partisan and not good enough at recognising the achievements of
previous regimes.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000271">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I do not
think that anyone would say—indeed the hon. Gentleman was
careful not to—that Connexions was doing the job that is
necessary in order to provide the kind of quality advice that is
essential to delivering the social mobility that we all seek. Its focus
on a minority of vulnerable young people was a distraction, or at least
a displacement, from providing proper careers advice and guidance to
the much larger number of young people who need it. It required a
radical rethink. Responsibility for securing advice needs to go back to
schools and colleges, which are in the best place to know the people
who study there. We will be discussing shortly how the primary
responsibility for securing provision of independent careers advice for
young people will in future lie with schools. That is in the Bill, and
we will be debating
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000272">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let me be
clear about local authorities. They will retain the responsibility that
they currently have under section 68 of the Education and Skills Act
2008 to “encourage, enable, or assist” the participation
of young people, and of young adults with learning difficulties and
disabilities—people such as Thomas, if I may say so—in
education and training. These are significant and necessary changes to
the way in which young people gain careers guidance, especially the
all-age service, as has already been mentioned. I am aware that
well-informed voices are calling on the Government to ensure an
effective transition to these new arrangements. Much 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 666<a class="bkMark" name="Column666">&#160;</a>
                           </div>work has already been done. We set out when we published details of the
early intervention grant that it would support local
authorities’ responsibilities in respect of careers guidance for
young people in advance of the establishment of the all-age service.
Local authorities retain their statutory responsibility to make
available<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000273">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“such services

effective participation of those young persons in education or
training.”<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000397">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>Clearly,
local authorities must decide locally how they fulfil their duty, but
it is a statutory duty. In a number of local authorities, of which
Northamptonshire is a good example, action is already being taken to
secure careers guidance services to young people until April 2012 and
to develop a well thought-through transition process. I acknowledge,
however, that we could do more to guide local decision making. That is
why we intend to support local authorities and schools by setting out
more clearly how responsibilities will change over the next 12, then
18, months.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000274">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is a perfectly fair question. In the end, it
will be measured by destinations. Once the change is effected and the
service is in place, we want the kinds of improvements that Alan
Milburn wants to see, that Lord Browne has argued for, that I have
articulated many times, and that a number of colleagues from the
Opposition have argued for. If destinations do not change and there is
not clear and palpable evidence that the advice that people receive
under the new system improves the link between people’s
ambitions—their potential—and its
fulfilment—frankly, what we have offered will have failed. All
the evidence from other countries, the academic evidence, the advice we
have received, and the consensus of opinion, which the hon. Member for
Hartlepool generously acknowledged, suggest that the measure will not
fail and that it is the right strategy.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000276">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">To be fair to
the previous Government again, an adult careers service has been
introduced. I take a sliver of the credit for pressing for that for a
number of years, but none the less, the plans were laid to introduce
that service before we came into government. When I became a Minister,
I had to make the decision whether to allow the process to continue and
to roll out the next steps service that came into effect last summer,
or whether to do something else. I chose to go ahead, because a lot of
work had been put into it. It seemed the right stepping stone towards
what I ultimately wanted to achieve, which was the all-age service. The
service has been well received, and I hear positive messages about it
in reports from careers professionals. Destinations will be the
ultimate test of the effectiveness of the
measures.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000277">&#160;</a>

local authorities? I recognise and admire the self-discipline of this
Government in not bombarding local authorities and schools with endless
letters and instructions. However, in a period of flux on careers
guidance such as we are entering now, would it not be appropriate for
him to write to local authorities specifically on the measure? If he
does so, the whole Committee

clear about the steps that we will take. First, we will
issue short, focused guidelines to local authorities regarding their
continuing duties under section 68 of the Education and Skills Act
2008. It is essential that local authorities are absolutely clear about
what needs to be done for them to meet such duties. Currently, the
response is patchy. I have described Northamptonshire and the
arrangements that it makes. Other local authorities are retaining their
Connexions service, but taking out the careers part, which will
subsequently be dealt with by the new service, and others are
considering creative ways in which to provide the service. It is
essential, however, that they all know that they must continue to meet
their statutory
requirements.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000280">&#160;</a>

suggests that local authorities make arrangements to deal with their
statutory responsibilities when they are in purdah, just as Governments
have to do. All local authorities, as a matter of course, put in place
arrangements that allow them to continue the proper exercise of their
functions. I hear what my hon. Friend says, but none the less, the
imminence that the hon. Member for Hartlepool called for is the
significant
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000287">&#160;</a>

want to set out clearly that schools will need to think about how they
will fulfil their responsibility in ensuring access to careers guidance
in advance of the commencement of the Bill’s provisions. It
would have been perfectly proper for the hon. Gentleman—I do not
know whether he was saving this for a later amendment, but I will put
this on the record now as this has not yet been mentioned so
far—to point out that because of the Bill’s timetabling,
it is important that schools start to reflect on what they are going to
achieve before they are statutorily obliged to do so. I want to make it
clear to schools that they need to plan the fulfilment of their
responsibilities in the way that I have
described.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000288">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Hon.
Members raised concerns about funding through amendments 121 and 122. I
take this opportunity to correct the misunderstanding that is apparent
in amendment 121—it is obviously inadvertent; I am
not suggesting that it is anything else. Funding for Connexions has not
been ring-fenced since 2008, contrary to what was said earlier. That
decision was taken by the previous Administration before the hon.
Gentleman was the responsible Minister, to provide local authorities
with greater flexibility in the use of their resources. In bringing a
number of funding streams together into the early intervention grant,
which will be introduced this year, we are simply taking that decision
a step further. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the character and size of
that grant and its substance, and I do not want to repeat what has been
said. He knows that it is there to enable authorities to act more
strategically and start the investment early, where it will have the
greatest impact, with greater flexibility in response to local needs
and to drive reform.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000289">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The grant is
not ring-fenced, to enable local authorities to target resources at the
areas of greatest need. Of course, as I have said, schools have
responsibility for securing guidance for their pupils. Members of the
Committee have made reference to the pressure on schools budgets, and I
do not want to suggest that schools, like all of us, will not face
difficult decisions over the coming years as we seek to get our
finances back on track. That is about as partisan as I get, by the way,
so do not worry. I will not talk about the sorry record of the previous
Administration in the running of the
economy.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000290">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Whereas
the Government have had to reduce funding in many areas, we have
protected school funding. In addition, the pupil premium, which lies at
the heart of our overall schools programme, provides £2.5
billion of extra money by 2014-15, following poorer children directly
at the school they attend. There will be clear transparency
requirements to ensure that it is spent on improving the life chances
of our poorest young people. More than that, it is important that we
communicate what the new arrangements will mean for schools, and we
will do that as a matter or urgency. I want schools to understand their
responsibilities under the new arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000291">&#160;</a>

his speech that he made out was already in the content. He has now said
that he will contact schools. Can I confirm that the Minister will

notes, by the way. Look at the shocked faces all around the Committee,
mainly from the non-members, actually. This is not in my notes, so I am
playing fast and loose here. I want to go further and suggest, as a
result of the comments that have been made this afternoon, that we put
together a summit of interested parties, including local authorities,
career professionals and representatives of the education sector to
talk through the transitional arrangements and the set-up of the new

second summit of some of the users of the services. A good point was
made by the hon. Member for Bolton West about the clients. She is not
listening to me now. She made the point and now she is not listening. I
am making a concession and she is not paying attention. This is a
glorious moment. I think we should have a summit for young
people—and other people, because this is all-age, after
all—about the use of the service. I am conscious of what the
hon. Lady said about getting good learner and user involvement in the
process of shaping the service in the right way. As a result of
today’s discussion, I am happy to say that they should also be
put together as a matter of urgency to facilitate the

say that—again, we will come back to this—the careers
profession has done a great deal of work, since the policy was
announced and since it knew that it was likely to be in the Bill, on
clarifying its responsibilities and capabilities, so that capacity in
the profession will be sufficient to meet the new demands placed on it.
It is working from a good base, because the careers profession is a
rightly proud profession. It is working on a set of professional
standards, which is coherent to an unprecedented degree and which will
inform the character of that service. I also think we should go further
still. We need to be clear about what the architecture of the service
will look like. We need to develop a narrative which can be
communicated in addition to all I have
said.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000296">&#160;</a>

enough. He mentioned the abolition of Connexions and how that was
recommended in the Alan Milburn report about access to the professions,
and it is true. The Government of the day rejected the Milburn
recommendation to abolish Connexions. I thought long and hard about
that recommendation, and the reason I came to that decision was because
I thought that Milburn, in producing his report, had not taken into
account developments in the Connexions service over the past couple of
years. In the new information, advice and guidance strategy
“Quality, Choice and Aspiration”, which I produced in
October 2009, I put the Connexions service on notice that we would be
reviewing it within 18 months. However, I think Milburn failed to take
into account the real progress that had taken place. For example, I
went to Connexions in Merseyside and saw the fantastic work being done
in a really disadvantaged part of the community. Connexions Merseyside
has now been dismantled, with jobs and professional expertise lost, at
a cost to the public purse of
£900,000.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000303">&#160;</a>

Minister has said warm words about guidance that will be produced
imminently and about a summit that will be provided for young people
and interested stakeholders. As far as I can recall, he announced the
establishment of the all-age careers service at the Institute of
Careers Guidance conference in Belfast in November. We have had
something like five months for him to pull together a comprehensive
transition plan for between the end of Connexions and the start of the
new

worked for Connexions in the very area the hon. Gentleman highlighted,
Merseyside. That

			Column number: 671<a class="bkMark" name="Column671">&#160;</a>
                           </div>first alerted me to the need to set up an all-age service, because
Connexions was not working, and that was five years
ago.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000306">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman made a point about the timetable. During that period
since November, over Christmas, January and last month, my Department
and my officials have been working with members of the
profession—with some assiduity on their part and some enthusiasm
on ours——to put in place the necessary components to
deliver the kind of quality service that I want to put together. We
have not been standing still; a great deal of work has gone on. We are
ready to go in September, but the truth is that transition is tough
when a change of this kind is being made. I am determined to make the

working hard on this, but he has used some phrases, such as saying that
he wants to pull people together so that they are clear about what the
architecture of the service will look like, when this a huge leap in
the dark. We will have nothing in place for a large part of this
country for the best part of six months at a time of redundancies and
the loss of service for young people. That is so important given the
current economic circumstances. It is simply not good enough. On that

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment would maintain the duty on schools and colleges to permit
access, which clause 26(4) is designed to remove. I genuinely cannot
understand the purpose behind the Government’s intention. For
all their rhetoric about trusting professionals, they seem rather
intent on making life difficult for the careers professionals who are
providing help and guidance to young people. My hon. Friend the
Member for Walthamstow mentioned this issue in an intervention in
relation to the earlier group of amendments, and I will reiterate the
points that I made then. It is important to trust the professionals.
Why are they not able to have access to schools and
colleges?<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000335">&#160;</a>

                        <p>including,
for example, a computer, telephone and, importantly, confidential
interviewing space. The removal of the duty to allow access will reduce
the likelihood of provision of such facilities and therefore risk a
reduction in the effectiveness of the
service.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000337">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Likewise,
it is suggested that effective service is provided by face-to-face
practitioners, as opposed to online advice facilities, and by someone
who is able to build up a relationship with the student over time.
Access by the practitioner is required to enable that effective level
of service to be
provided.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000338">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Of
course online provision has its role in the 21st century,
but we did not have online provision when I received careers advice in
the 1980s. I met someone on a wet Wednesday afternoon I had never met
before. He took a look at a one-page summary of me and said,
“You’re interested in politics. Have you ever thought
about being a solicitor?” I said, “I’m not
interested in the law at all.” He said, “Go on. Go and
try to be a lawyer.” That just was not something that I wanted
to do. I received completely ineffective careers advice and I always
vowed that I would try to do something to ensure that other people did
not have a similar experience.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000339">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Schools
may not ask a teacher, supply teacher, or other individual employed by
the school to be the sole source of careers guidance for any pupil. But
they may still employ their own careers adviser or involve a careers
coordinator or other member of the school staff in providing careers
guidance, as long as pupils have access to an external source of
guidance
too.”<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000399">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>This
is the key phrase as far as I am
concerned:<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000341">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“That
might include (but would not be limited to) access to online resources,
support via a helpline, or face-to-face guidance from a specialist
provider.”<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000400">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>It
seems to me that, with that last sentence, schools could just provide
students with access to a computer for an afternoon and say,
“Why don’t you look online and see what’s
happening?” I hope that that is not the case. I made the point
about building up a relationship with someone who can act as a signpost
to different facilities and provision. That is the right way to
go.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000342">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Another
concern that I have relates to logistics and accessibility. Removing
the duty to allow access risks reducing the accessibility of careers
service providers. What do I mean by that? Let us say that someone who
is independent comes in only on that wet Wednesday afternoon to which I
referred. What happens if a student is doing a vocational course and is
not in one location during normal school hours? What happens if someone
is in a pupil referral unit during sporadic hours? What if someone is
attending school or college part-time for another reason? In the modern
world of learning and work, not everyone is in a classroom or even on
the school or college estate during school or college hours. If a
career adviser is allowed access, it is far more likely that the pupil
will be able to access the service. There is a big risk with the
provision that there will be element of, “If you’re not
there when the careers adviser is there, frankly tough.” To that
end, I ask the Minister to reconsider removal of the duty to allow
access for people providing professional education and training
support.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000343">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">At
the very least, I seek the Minister’s assurance that he will
ensure that guidance is implemented and made available to schools and
FE institutions, perhaps imminently and perhaps with the provision of a
summit, to ensure that careers service providers remain accessible to
all pupils, that career and training services remain effective, and
that pupils—this is the key point—continue to receive the
quality and level of service pending the transition from Connexions to
the new all-age career
service.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000344">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The shadow Minister is doing a good job of asking
questions. I have had experience of FE colleges saying that they cannot
currently gain access to schools, which seem to block them in case they
poach pupils on to alternative courses. Are schools acting illegally,
and does he have any idea whether they have a right to behave in that

for that day are out on a school trip. I know the practices that go on.

understanding from when I was on the other side of the fence is that
that would not be legal, and that there is a statutory duty to ensure
that providers give impartial information, advice and guidance to their

Minister will consider the amendment favourably and positively in the

continue to receive good careers advice and guidance, which is so
important at their stage of

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman highlighted the importance of ensuring that young people
in schools and colleges have access to appropriate advice. We are
introducing in the Bill a duty on schools to secure access to
independent and impartial careers guidance for their students. We made
it clear in the policy statement circulated to the Committee about
clause 27 that we intend, subject to the consultation, to extend that
duty in due course to all young people up to the age of 18 who attend
schools and institutions in the further education sector. Simply put,
that duty removes the need for us to place a separate duty on schools
and FE institutions to permit access by those providing education and
training support services. Schools and colleges will no longer be
required to work in partnership with the local authority on the
provision of careers guidance; they will be free to determine who to
make those arrangements with in the best interests of their
students.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000350">&#160;</a>

acknowledge that the current duty refers not only to careers guidance,
but to advice and guidance on other matters impacting on a young
person’s ability to participate in education or training, but it
is time that we trusted schools to engage appropriately with other
agencies—and with services provided by the local authority under
section 68 of the Education and Skills Act 2008, to which the Minister
for Further Education, Skills and Lifelong Learning referred in a
previous debate—to ensure that their students receive
appropriate
support.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000351">&#160;</a>

are taking other measures; for example, we are developing a destination
measure relating to key stage 4 and post-16 that will ensure that
schools are held to account for the outcomes of their students,
including their progress on leaving school. That is the new regime, and
we do not need provisions in law to require schools

                           </div>to give access to statutory services, because we want to trust schools
to make those decisions. They have a statutory duty to provide
independent careers advice, and it is for them to decide from whom to
take that
advice.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000352">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is an important point. Will the Minister put
on the record his view on whether face-to-face advice is considered the
cream of the provision of information, advice and guidance? Will it be
considered acceptable if the advice is literally, “That’s
the website that you need to look at, and there’s access to a
computer—you’ve got access to that for an
afternoon”?<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000353">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It would depend on the school, which might think it
was appropriate for all its students. We are changing the whole
approach to education policy, because we want to trust the
professionalism of schools and to trust head teachers and teachers to
make such decisions. We are providing a very clear statutory duty to
provide advice that is independent and impartial, and we are providing
increased accountability measures, such as destinations. That is the
approach that we think will be successful, not top-down prescription
that sets out precisely from whom schools must take advice and that
requires them by law to allow access to this or that individual. Under
our regime that will no longer be
necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000356">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am worried about what the Minister is saying. Is
there not an inherent risk that there will be an elitist approach to
the provision of information, in which the brightest and the best will
be given access to, and have face-to-face time with, a careers
professional, whereas people who are not considered to be the brightest
and the best might be told, “You’re a girl—you can
go into secretarial work,” which is something that could have
happened in the 1950s? It was inappropriate then and it is certainly
inappropriate now. Will the Minister reassure me—so far he has
not done so—that we will not have an elitist, narrow-minded
approach to the provision of careers
advice?<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000357">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> There will be a destinations measure for schools, so
they have every incentive to provide high-quality advice to all
students. The approach taken by the previous Administration clearly did
not work, which is why we have to take remedial measures to sort out
the quality of careers advice in schools. The better approach is to put
into law very clear and strengthened duties on schools to provide
impartial careers advice. When we go through clause 27 in detail, we
will see the clear duties on schools to provide that high-quality and
impartial careers advice to their pupils. We are combining that with
our destinations measures, our increased accountability and our whole
approach to trusting professionals, so the hon. Gentleman should not
have any concern about the quality of advice being different for pupils
in a school. The school will be under enormous pressure to provide the
highest-quality careers advice to all pupils, particularly to those who
are floundering and are not clear about what they intend to do when
they leave school. I would

the Minister is talking about will continue. I have experience of five
examples at the moment. A year 11 student applied to a college and
asked the school for a reference. The head teacher intervened with that
pupil, which left the pupil feeling harassed. As that happened
frequently, the college stopped asking for references from the school.
A college set up a fresher’s day event for year 11 students; it
was scheduled for June. A grammar school in a particular town changed
the school calendar and insisted on year 11 pupils coming into school
on that day to return textbooks under threat of fines for not returning
books on that particular day. There are Catholic schools providing
advice only on Catholic options at post-16, colleges that have been
barred from talking to school pupils who wanted to study A-levels, and
academies that are not allowing any advice or guidance other than for
their own sixth form. School governing bodies are being
advised—<a class="bkMark" name="11032511000359">&#160;</a>
