						<a name="07102557000454"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Edward Garnier</b> (Harborough) (Con): I shall be as brief as
I sensibly can, but as the Bill consists predominantly of schedules
rather than clauses, it is incumbent on us to spend a little
time&#151;not an excessive time&#151;considering what clause 2
does. I shall not ask the Committee to divide on whether the schedule
should stand part of the Bill, but this is an opportunity to consider
what we are doing. I said on Second Reading that this is predominantly
a schedule Bill. For example, clause 2 does nothing except to bring 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column274" />Column number: 274</div>schedule 2 into effect. I want to highlight a number of issues, which
might even touch on other schedules.</div>
					<a name="07102557000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard
to procedural matters, first, when a court comes to consider a sentence
involving the breach, revocation or amendment of a youth rehabilitation
order, it will have to examine the schedule closely to work out where
it stands, almost as if it were in a game of snakes and ladders. I
would urge, if at all possible, that simplicity enter into the drafting
process&#151;I dare say that it is too late for this Bill. I
appreciate that the Government do not want to miss anything out or to
produce legislation that leaves a court in doubt as to its powers or to
how the sentencing regime is to be governed.</div>
					<a name="07102557000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example, in respect of the
powers of both the magistrates court and the Crown court, the schedule,
on page 113, in part 3, at paragraph 11(2)(a) and (b), essentially
provides the court with the power to revoke the existing sentence, to
re-sentence for the original crime, and to deal with the breach. Rather
than a court going all through the detailed paragraphs of part 3, it
would be far simpler as a matter of drafting, and therefore as a matter
of efficient use of court time, and our own, if a straightforward power
to revoke, re-sentence for the original offence and deal with the
breach could be built into the Bill and replicated across each of the
jurisdictions&#151;be it the summary jurisdiction or the Crown court
jurisdiction.</div>
					<a name="07102557000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government may be fearful that if they do not set the measures out in
such complicated detail, no one will fully understand the powers that
apply to each respective court or to particular sorts of breaches and
what a court can do. However, I have a suspicion that, when those who
are training magistrates or Crown court judges come to look at this on
Judicial Studies Board courses&#151;of which I have been on a
few&#151;they will ask why it is like this and why it could not be a
little simpler.</div>
					<a name="07102557000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second point touches on some of our earlier debates in relation to
schedule 1. It is essential to build into the system a flexibility to
allow a judgment to be made about each breach so that the court, be it
the magistrates or the Crown court, does not feel boxed in by too rigid
a framework, and the discretion referred to by my hon. Friend the
Member for Enfield, Southgate is left in the hands of the
court.</div>
					<a name="07102557000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other points
that need tightening up include paragraph 3, in relation to the warning
system. Clearly, it is sensible to give to a young person who is about
to commit or has committed a breach, a warning that if he continues in
that way, something worse could happen. I would ask the Committee to
bear in mind what sort of person we are likely to be dealing with. They
will not be very organised or responsible for their own lives, by
virtue of the fact that they are before the criminal justice system at
all. Some of them may have no contact with formal schooling; some of
them may be riddled with substance abuse; they simply may not be very
clever people, in the loosest sense of the word. Therefore, any warning
must be clear and there is no better way of achieving that than in
writing. Although other provisions deal with notices and certificates
later in the schedule, it might be worth considering whether warnings
should be given in writing, because it brings a little more
authority.</div>
					<a name="07102557000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07102557000455"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> I would expect that warnings would be given in
writing.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column275" />Column number: 275</div>
					<a name="07102557000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07102557000456"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> Good&#151;I am glad. I do not suggest that we
amend the schedule, but it should be made quite clear to the
supervisors of these youngsters, in practice notes, protocols or some
other form of guidance, that they must give warnings in writing and
copy them to the responsible adult. It may be that the parent of the
child in question is not very responsible either, but it is important
that no provision is built into the system that allows for any excuse
for failure by the criminal justice system or the individual
offender.</div>
					<a name="07102557000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
practical question that needs to be addressed concerns the summons that
can be issued by a court for failure to appear, which is set out on
page 108. We must be careful that we are not just passing optimistic
legislation in the absence of a knowledge of what normally happens. If
a person does not appear in answer to a summons, a judge can issue a
bench warrant. No doubt a magistrate can do so too; my hon. Friend the
Member for Enfield, Southgate will be able to tell me about that. That
power is fine, but very often there are not enough police officers to
go and find that person. Such people do not necessarily stand around on
the street corner advertising the fact that they are late or do not
intend to appear. We must ensure that the personnel and resources are
available for bench warrants and summonses of this nature to be not
only issued but
implemented.</div>
					<a name="07102557000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
6, on powers of magistrates courts, deals with the fining of young
offenders under the age of 14. There may be some offenders of that age
who have &#163;250 in their accounts that can be extracted and given
to the court, but I do not suppose that many of the sorts of people who
unfortunately come in front of the courts will have that sort of money
at that age. Essentially, we are fining the parent or guardian. We need
to be careful that we are not just airily writing legislation that
looks good on paper but provides an empty remedy. Even if the parent is
the one who pays, we should bear it in mind that the benefits system
might actually pay, not an individual, so the force of the penalty
might be limited to some extent. I am not making a fundamental
criticism, merely urging us to be
careful.</div>
					<a name="07102557000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
6(4)
states:</div>
					<a name="07102557000394"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
dealing with the offender under sub-paragraph (2), the court must take
into account the extent to which the offender has complied with the
youth rehabilitation
order.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07102557000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is repeated
throughout the schedule. Surely, any court will look at the
circumstances of the person in front of it. That does not need to be
spelled out in black and white. Sub-paragraph (5)
states:</div>
					<a name="07102557000395"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A fine
imposed under sub-paragraph (2)(a) is to be treated, for the purposes
of any enactment, as being a sum adjudged to be paid by a
conviction.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07102557000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wonder
whether that is a typo or a term of art. Are we intending to say,
&#147;on a conviction&#148; or &#147;by a convicted
person&#148;, or is the expression &#147;by a conviction&#148; an
accepted legal term in such
circumstances?</div>
					<a name="07102557000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
7(2)
states:</div>
					<a name="07102557000396"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
court may instead ... commit offender in
custody&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07102557000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a word
missing. I suggest that it should say &#147;commit the
offender&#148;. More importantly, in relation to that sub-paragraph,
surely all that we need to say is that the court may remand the
offender in custody or in bail to the Crown
court.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column276" />Column number: 276</div>
					<a name="07102557000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07102557000457"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> I am grateful for the comments
of the hon. and learned Gentleman. I am inquiring as to the logic of
not tabling amendments to the schedule, as they could have been
discussed. There was an opportunity to do so. I am quite happy to look
at the concerns that he has, but these are issues that could have been
subject to discussion and amendment, and we could have reflected on
them before
Committee.</div>
					<a name="07102557000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07102557000458"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> I am trying to speed up the
process. I am hurling at the Minister a number of small and
medium-sized points along with some fundamental
points.</div>
				
					<a name="07102557000419"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div>
					<a name="07102557000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is not an attack on the Government. The Minister need not worry; the
Government will not fall this afternoon as a result of these points. I
am simply asking us to be careful as we rush together to create
legislation. The Committee is under time pressure, as you reminded us,
Sir Nicholas. I could have tabled any number of amendments, but
sometimes one loses the will to live. <i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Laughter.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i>
However, I think that it is important that I chuck the occasional
pebble into the Government pond. I just ask the Minister to take these
ideas away. I do not expect a detailed response. I realise that if I
had tabled an amendment, he would have a ministerial brief and so could
comfortably respond, but I am not after that this afternoon. I am
instead quietly tugging at the prefect&#146;s spats. We will see how
we get on.</div>
					<a name="07102557000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are a
number of areas in this schedule which are susceptible to the greater
or lesser criticisms that I have addressed so far, but bearing in mind
your strictures, Sir Nicholas, and bearing in mind my need to remain on
very friendly terms with the Minister of State, I shall finish on this
one point. It relates to page 115 and part 4 of the schedule. It says
something that we have not just a schedule, but a schedule that is
divided into many parts. It has more parts than Caesarean Gaul, one
might add. But there we are.</div>
					<a name="07102557000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 13
is headed &#147;Amendment by appropriate court&#148;. This is a
perfectly sensible suggestion. If an offender moves from one local
court jurisdiction to another, it is important that the order should
follow him and can be applied in the new area. However, we must ensure
that the communication and co-operation systems are available to ensure
that this happens. Far too often&#151;I say this from my experience
in sitting in courts in London&#151;even within a petty sessional
division, things do not get done because nobody bothers to tell the
person who needs to implement the thing that has been decided. Will the
Minister please ensure that an adequate communication system is in
place before the Bill becomes law, so that the force of order can
follow the offender geographically as he moves
about?</div>
					<a name="07102557000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am beginning
to feel inhibited from making further remarks, for no better reason
than that the clock is ticking. If I do not continue to talk about
schedule 2, I do not want anyone&#151;particularly the
Government&#151;to think that I have no further things to say in
relation to it. I
do.</div>
					<a name="07102557000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07102557000459"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> Take your
time.</div>
					<a name="07102557000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07102557000460"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> You are very kind, Sir Nicholas. In that case, I
shall just say two more things. Taking a random example, paragraph
22(5)
states:</div>
					<a name="07102557000397"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
powers of a magistrates&#146; court under this paragraph may be
exercised by a single justice of the peace, notwithstanding anything in
the Magistrates&#146; Courts Act 1980&#148;.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column277" />Column number: 277</div>
					<a name="07102557000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">In many ways that is a sensible thing to
do to avoid having to bring together two or three magistrates to make a
decision that could be made by one, but it underlines the point that
the hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead made on Tuesday about the need
for adequate representation of youngsters within the criminal justice
system. When decisions about the future of young offenders are being
made by a smaller court, which is in the interests of efficiency, we
must be careful that the offender is not left alone in the court. I
suspect that no humane magistrate would want to do that, but we need to
take care.</div>
					<a name="07102557000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore, on the issue of
making sure that these young people are dealt with properly, if copies
of the revoking or amending order are to be provided to the parent or
guardian of someone under the age of 14, as stated at the top of page
122, why are they not to be provided to the parent or guardian of any
other minor who comes before the
court?</div>
					<a name="07102557000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
paragraph 25, &#147;Power to amend maximum period of fostering
requirement&#148;, gives the Secretary of State quite a big power in
terms of the disposal of youngsters. It is not simply a question of
raising or lowering the limit of a fine or the number of hours of
unpaid work; the paragraph deals with the length of time for which a
child can be taken away from its natural parents and handed over to the
local authority. It can happen for all sorts of good reasons, as we
discussed on Tuesday, but we ought to be careful. Such a power should
not be exercised without far greater parliamentary
intervention.</div>
					<a name="07102557000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
always, I am deeply grateful to you, Sir Nicholas, for your patience
and forbearance as I seek to tease the Government into producing better
legislation. I look forward to hearing from the Minister either now, or
in writing in due course.</div>

							<a name="07102557000461"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> I hope to reassure the hon. and
learned Gentleman that I am relaxed about discussing any aspect of the
Bill. If he wishes to spend time on schedule 2, that is fine by me. The
point of my intervention was that if even moderate drafting changes are
to be made, the purpose of the Government and the Opposition is to
ensure that those changes make good legislation. As part of that
process, we must consider the potential legislative impact of drafting
changes with parliamentary counsel outside Committee. I know that he
will understand that, but I am genuinely relaxed and willing to go at
whatever pace the Committee wishes. We do not have any knives in the
process. I am content for us to consider anything.</div>
					<a name="07102557000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall read
<i class="I">Hansard</i> when it is published for the hon. and learned
Gentleman&#146;s points. If he has made valid points about the
detailed aspects of potential amendments, we are always willing to
consider them if they will improve the Bill. The purpose of Committee
is to have political arguments, but also to ensure that the Bill is
clear and usable and achieves the desired objectives. I did not mean to
criticise him. I am sure that we will get on as far as possible within
the constraints of Opposition
politics.</div>
					<a name="07102557000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall respond to a couple of the hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s
points. To reiterate my point about warnings given directly to young
people by the officer responsible 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column278" />Column number: 278</div>for the order, I confirm that it would be appropriate for the
responsible officer to make an internal record of any warnings and
normally to confirm those warnings in writing for the individual. That
is in line with the current good practice of the Youth Justice
Board&#146;s national standards for the enforcement of orders and
will provide a balance between the need for compliance with an order
and the individual&#146;s circumstances, as well as ensuring that the
individual understands the message. I hope that that reassures
him.</div>
					<a name="07102557000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. and learned Gentleman mentioned the danger that combining
provisions to cover magistrates and Crown courts could lead to more
complex provisions. The schedule&#146;s merits lie in setting out
separate provisions for each court. For example, magistrates will need
to digest only those provisions relating to youth courts. We are trying
not to over-complicate the schedule, which is why we have drafted it as
we have. The separate provisions will assist each court in
turn.</div>
					<a name="07102557000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. and
learned Gentleman mentioned bench warrants. I take on board his points.
I accept that such warrants must be executed quickly, and I hope that
that will be the normal practice.</div>
					<a name="07102557000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am happy to reflect on the
points that the hon. and learned Gentleman made. In general, he
mentioned a number of drafting points. I am happy to consider them in
light of his comments. Different drafting styles impact legislation
differently. If hon. Members prefer that the detail should be settled
in a broad order-making process, perhaps we can do that next time
around rather than this time. I will consider the hon. and learned
Gentleman&#146;s points, because there are details that need
reflection. However, given those brief comments and the assurances I
have offered on a couple of his substantive points, I hope that the
Committee will agree to the schedule.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
David Heath</b> (Somerton and Frome) (LD): Welcome to the
Chair, Sir Nicholas. I shall speak briefly and I will understand
entirely if it turns out that my point would be more appropriate in
relation to schedule 4.</div>
					<a name="07102557000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a simple question. The
clause and schedule 3 deal with the transfer of orders into the
jurisdiction of Northern Ireland. Government amendment No. 44 will deal
with Scottish jurisdiction. I simply wish to inquire why Scotland will
be dealt with by a consequential order-making and revocation amendment
and whether the provisions for Northern Ireland and Scotland are
comparable. I find it difficult to understand Scots law, so I do not
know whether the provisions for the two jurisdictions are comparable.
If a young offender is subject to an order in England, will he be able
to avoid the responsibilities placed upon him by crossing the Scottish
border and, say, becoming a resident of Gretna
Green?</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column279" />Column number: 279</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07102557000463"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> To clarify, clause 3 introduces schedule 3, which
sets out the procedure for the transfer of a youth rehabilitation order
to Northern Ireland when a young person either &#147;resides or will
reside&#148; there when an order takes effect. Neither the Bill nor
Government amendment No. 44 provides for the transfer of youth
rehabilitation orders to Scotland.</div>
					<a name="07102557000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government officials have
discussed the matter with Scottish Executive officials, who have
concluded that they do not wish to have equivalent provisions.
As the hon. Gentleman will be aware, the Scottish Executive
have competence for these matters in Scotland and it is important that,
in the spirit of devolution, we respect their wishes. That is my
understanding of the position after the matter was discussed at
official level.</div>
					<a name="07102557000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause provides for Northern Ireland because my hon. Friend the
Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office, who holds a post that
both my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Justice and I have
held&#151;this year is the year of the three Ministers of State in
Northern Ireland&#151;has agreed to and is content with the
provision.</div>
					<a name="07102557000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07102557000464"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I am most grateful to the Minister but,
importantly, he has confirmed my suspicions. I understand entirely the
devolution arrangements and that there is an entirely separate Scottish
jurisdiction, but a young person who is subject to an order in England
will not be subject to it if he goes to Scotland. Is it correct that
such a person will not be subject to an order unless he returns to
English and Welsh
jurisdiction?</div>
					<a name="07102557000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07102557000465"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> My colleagues in the Scottish Executive have been
closely involved with the development of the youth rehabilitation order
policy and have worked closely with the Ministry of Justice and the
Home Office. Scottish Executive Ministers have decided that
youth rehabilitation orders should not transfer to Scotland,
but that will not make orders unworkable.</div>
					<a name="07102557000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand the difficulties
of border issues&#151;I represent a constituency on the border
between Wales and England, but provisions are easily transferred over
that border. However, I do not believe that the arrangements will
damage the workability of the orders because, potentially, the numbers
involved are small. Where such a transfer does arise, I would expect
the local youth offending team, the relevant Scottish local authority
and the court to work closely to find a workable solution with the
Youth Justice Board and the courts in England and Wales to ensure that
we examine public protection
issues.</div>
					<a name="07102557000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
hon. Gentleman has raised a very important point and I will certainly
reflect on it, because I would not wish someone who has an order placed
on them in Berwick-upon-Tweed suddenly to decide that they are much
more comfortable living in Galashiels or wherever is just over the
border from Berwick-upon-Tweed. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will
allow me to reflect on that matter, given the valid points that he has
made
today.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07102557000468"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> As you can see, Sir Nicholas,
subsections (3) and (4) give the Secretary of State the power to amend
legislation. However, they do not give him the power to amend only
secondary legislation or even the Bill; he is being given the power to
amend other primary criminal justice legislation. It is rather more
than interesting that the Act that he is being given the power to
amend&#151;the Criminal Justice Act 2003&#151;is, in terms of its
implementation, the most ridiculous piece of legislation that it is
possible to
imagine.</div>
					<a name="07102557000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">In written
questions, I have asked the Home Secretary how much of the 2003 Act is
in force, how much has been repealed before even coming into force and
how much is not yet in force. Although it is a big fat Act, it is
incredible how many of its provisions are not in effect, have not been
implemented, or have been repealed before being brought into
force.</div>
					<a name="07102557000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">That point is
reinforced, or at least I like to think that my arguments are
reinforced, by a quick glance at schedules 4 and 23 of the Bill, in
which great reams of amendments to recent legislation are identified.
There is a constant cascade of legislation that is being amended before
it is even brought into force, yet here we are giving the Secretary of
State power to effect amendment by the writing of his name, rather than
by any fully scrutinised legislative
process.</div>
					<a name="07102557000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">I tabled
amendments Nos. 3 and 4 because I believe that Parliament should amend
the criminal law; Parliament should amend the Criminal Justice Act
2003. Parliament, not the Executive, should make the decisions on how
we frame our criminal law, which deals with the removal of
people&#146;s liberties and the conduct of our police, courts and
criminal justice system more
widely.</div>
					<a name="07102557000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07102557000469"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> These amendments are the first of several that the
hon. and learned Gentleman has tabled that seek to remove delegated
powers from the Bill. The use of order and regulation-making powers is
a well established means of removing unnecessary detail from primary
legislation and of conferring a sensible degree of flexibility on the
legislative scheme. It has been used not just by the current Government
but by previous Governments.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column281" />Column number: 281</div>
					<a name="07102557000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have set out the rationale
for each delegated power in a memorandum that we published on the
introduction of the Bill, and I hope that members of the Committee can
reflect upon that rationale. I must say to the hon. and learned
Gentleman that the parliamentary scrutiny element of that memorandum
will be considered in due course by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory
Reform Committee in another place. That Committee, as members of this
Committee may know, is never slow to criticise any excessive use of
delegated powers. In the event that the delegated powers aspects of the
legislation are considered by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory
Reform Committee and the Committee makes suggestions, I will certainly
consider those suggestions in the normal way and give sympathetic
consideration to recommendations that the Committee
makes.</div>
					<a name="07102557000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
believe that the order-making power is necessary and justified, and
that it gives us the flexibility to adapt the interpretation of
legislation, particularly relating to the responsible officer in this
case. The order-making power will enable the Secretary of State to
require courts to determine who should be the appropriate responsible
officer where the order contains more than one
requirement.</div>
					<a name="07102557000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
that basis, I commend the order-making power in the Bill to the
Committee. I understand the hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s
concerns. I hope that the fact that the Delegated Powers and Regulatory
Reform Committee will examine this legislation in detail reassures him.
The Committee will make recommendations and those recommendations will
be considered by the Government, and if it suggests changes, I give a
commitment to consider them sympathetically, in the light of any
comments that it wishes to make.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07102557000470"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> I hear what the Minister says. It is seven-all in
this Committee, and I gather that there may be other people interested
in this debate who are not currently present. However, I will not
disturb the hon. Member for Tooting and require him to go outside,
because that would lead to a further delay of our proceedings. However,
it is important that, as a matter of constitutional propriety, we are
careful about what powers we give a Secretary of
State.</div>
					<a name="07102557000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is the place where the Executive should be held to account. It may be
said that this is a convenient and well used procedure to amend the
detail of legislation, but just because it has been done before does
not mean that it is right to do it again. I think that, from time to
time, Committees of this House and the House itself should just check
the Government, because Governments, if they are not careful, take
power because they find it convenient to do so. The Government are not
here for the convenience of anybody apart from the electorate of this
country, as represented by us.</div>

					<a name="07102557000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

					<a name="07102557000399"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In

beliefs&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07102557000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems to me
that when an young offender&#146;s religious beliefs are placed in a
position of conflict as a result of the making of the order, it will,
or it could, impact equally on his family. Under the Bill as drafted,
the court may well say that the offender&#146;s religious beliefs are
incorporated in his wider family&#146;s beliefs in any event, but I
think that the court ought to be careful to inquire about the nature of
the family structure of the individual offender. If the offender is 13,
14 or 15, the court should consider whether they cannot go to an
attendance centre on a Friday evening, a Sunday morning or at some
other time. If the offender is a minor, as he surely will be, the
ability of the family to co-operate with the court and to ensure
compliance with the order is something that we ought to consider. That
is the simple point, and I hope that the Minister can address
it.</div>

offenders&#151;those under 16&#151;as it would seem entirely
appropriate to take into consideration the family&#146;s religious
beliefs. We ought to assume that young persons aged over 16 have formed
their own religious beliefs and are capable of answering the question
properly themselves, but it is not unreasonable for an inquiry to be
made about the family&#146;s religious background in the case of
younger offenders. I hope that the Minister will be sympathetic to that
view.</div>

Hanson:
						</b> I want to make two points in discussion with the
hon. and learned Member for Harborough and the hon. Member for Somerton
and Frome. First, the responsible officer&#146;s first duty is to the
young person. As the hon. and learned Gentleman has pointed out, under
subsection (3)(a), potential conflicts with an offender&#146;s
religious beliefs should be discussed as part of the consideration of
such matters.</div>
					<a name="07102557000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment states &#147;family&#148;. It is possible for a
family&#151;however that is defined&#151;to have different
religious beliefs within it. It is quite possible for Catholic to marry
Protestant, for Jew to marry Catholic and for Muslim to marry Church of
England, and it is also possible to have different emphases within
that. That might be confusing to the individual. The individual who is
before the responsible officer may have strong religious beliefs, and
they will be taken into account. We must avoid the potential for
confusion.</div>
				
					<a name="07102557000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s amendment refers to the family, but

						</b> I am still not sure what that
means. I am making two points. The first is about the definition of
family and the second is about the fact that a family may have
different religious beliefs within it, and that the duty of the
responsible officer is to the young person. I do not believe that it is
practical to extend clause 5 to include the religious beliefs of the
offender&#146;s family. The point that I would also make&#151;I
referred to this earlier&#151;is that when sentencing, the court has
to take into account the young person&#146;s family circumstances
before it makes a youth rehabilitation order. In practice, that means
that a youth offending team would have to make an examination of the
offender&#146;s family and some of the consequences and details that
might impact upon the offender and sentence in that regard. If, as the
hon. and learned Gentleman suggests, we impose a mandatory requirement
in the legislation, it would cause some difficulties. The approach in
the Bill is also consistent with similar provisions in section 217 of
the Criminal Justice Act 2003 relating to the adult community order. I
hope that those points have some resonance with the hon. and learned
Gentleman.</div>

						</b> Let me give one example. The
individual might have to work on a religious holiday. It might be a
religious holiday for one individual but not for another. That is one
example of how that could work in practice. I do not think that the
amendment is workable because there could be different religious
beliefs in the family. It is also possible in these sad and troubled
times that there could be divorce and separation within the immediate
family. There could be conflicting requirements within the religious
beliefs of the family in that circumstance. I accept that the hon. and
learned Gentleman may not find such arguments helpful, but I am
proposing&#151;as I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column284" />Column number: 284</div>hope I have done with my remarks&#151;that the interests of the young
person are central, and that the assessment will be made around those
interests and the family circumstances. In doing so, that requirement
will be brought forward, but not in a mandatory legislative
capacity.</div>

						</b> Am I right in assuming that the court will
determine whether these religious beliefs are genuine? It would be
quite easy for someone to say, &#147;I don&#146;t do Sundays
because I am a Christian,&#148; when, in actual fact, they have never
been seen in church and never worshipped before. It is just a good

states:</div>

giving instructions in pursuance of a youth rehabilitation order
relating to an offender, the responsible officer must ensure, as far as
practicable, that any instruction is such as to
avoid&#151;</div>
					<a name="07102557000401"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a) any
conflict with the offender&#146;s religious
beliefs,&#148;</div>
					<a name="07102557000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example, if
the offender is an orthodox Jew and the rehabilitation order says that
community work should be undertaken on Friday, that might be in
conflict with the offender&#146;s religious beliefs. That may be
something that the court wants to take into account. We want to build
the order around its deliverability to ensure that the
offender&#146;s beliefs are taken into account. If we extend the
measure to the wider family, we could have a circumstance in which the
offender might be an orthodox Jew who has lapsed, but the parents may
be orthodox Jews who wish to see their religious beliefs taken into
account. There are discussions that we can have around that, but the
key thing is that the duty of the responsible officer is to the young
person. We are trying to avoid conflict with religious beliefs but not,
as the hon. and learned Member for Harborough has put it, to extend
that to the wider
family.</div>

mentioned a lapsed orthodox Jew whose parents none the less were still
observing orthodox Jews. I do not want to get too silly about this. Let
us assume that this lapsed orthodox Jew under the age of 16 was not
worried about working on the Sabbath, but his parents could not
physically take him in their car to the place where he had to work on
that day. We need to think about such a practical problem. Whether we
think about it via the vehicle of subsection 3(a) as currently drafted

							<a name="07102557000489"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> In amendments Nos. 7 and 8, I seek to add a
requirement that the instructions should be given to the offender in
writing. I made this point a moment ago. The Minister has indicated
that the normal practice is that such instructions should be given in
writing. I am not one for over-legislating but, if it helps, let us
stick it in. If we can be assured that written instructions are given,
we need not
bother.</div>
					<a name="07102557000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
amendment No. 15, which is of greater substance, first, I wish to
ensure
that</div>
					<a name="07102557000403"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Any
instructions given in accordance with subsection (5)(a) must be
recorded in the offender&#146;s probation

					<a name="07102557000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, a
copy of the instructions
should</div>
					<a name="07102557000404"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;be provided to
the offender on
request.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07102557000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not trying
to over-bureacratise the system and add more paperwork to it, hence my
suggestion that a copy of the instructions should only be given to the
offender if he asks for it. If we are to have end-to-end management of
offenders, which was the philosophy behind the setting up of the
National Offender Management Service and which was touched upon during
our discussions on the Offender Management Act 2007, it is important
that we have an audit trail. In that way, a supervisor&#151;whether
from within the national probation service or from one of the
commercial or third sector organisations that will be involved
following the passing of the 2007 Act&#151;should be able to see the
records and say, &#147;This is what he has been asked to do; this is
what he has not done.&#148; We need an audit trail of breaches and so
forth&#151;a trail of instructions and of the offender&#146;s
behaviour.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column286" />Column number: 286</div>
					<a name="07102557000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Too often, as we know from the
current state of the prison estate, records do not follow prisoners,
and there is a tremendous amount of churning of prisoners from one
prison to another. Those on remand in prison can be taken to court in
the morning, with no guarantee of being returned to the same prison.
Nor is there any guarantee that the records attached to that person
will follow&#151;and if they do follow they are frequently late,
which means that medical and other forms of rehabilitation are that
much more difficult to achieve. That results in a waste of money,
because the people looking after the prisoners have to start all over
again. </div>
					<a name="07102557000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
broad point that I want to ensure is catered for by amendment No.

						<a name="07102557000490"></a>
							<b class="B">David
Howarth</b> (Cambridge) (LD): I shall speak briefly to
amendment No. 173. It seeks to add to the requirement in subsection
(5)(b), that the offender</div>
					<a name="07102557000405"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;must notify the responsible
officer of any change of
address&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07102557000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">the rider that
it should happen</div>
					<a name="07102557000406"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;within
a reasonable period of
time&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07102557000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The underlying
problem has to do with the chaotic lives of many young offenders. I am
sure that many hon. Members have come across such problems in their
advice surgeries. Those young persons who are subject to the criminal
justice system will not always have a particularly clear
address&#151;they might live with one parent for some parts of the
week and the other parent for the remainder of the week, or move
between hostels and other sorts of accommodation.</div>
					<a name="07102557000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our concern
is that because the clause is enforceable under subsection (6) as if it
were part of the order, and therefore subject to all the enforcement
procedures of clause 2, it may become a sort of &#147;gotcha&#148;
clause for a particular group of young people. Because of the way that
they live their lives, it is a provision that they are almost bound to
violate. For example, requirements can be imposed under antisocial
behaviour orders that the defendant cannot but violate, which will
trigger enforcement. I would not want the clause to have a similar
characteristic for a particular group of
offenders.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07102557000491"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> I shall deal first with amendments Nos. 7, 8 and
15. I hope to reassure the hon. and learned Member for Harborough that
his desire for matters to be placed in writing is already covered by
the guidance issued to the Youth Justice Board on the national
standards. They already require a responsible officer to produce an
agreement with the offender, in writing and signed. It will include a
number of conditions, such as the criteria for acceptable or
unacceptable absence, the right to be treated fairly and with respect,
and the requirement to behave acceptably and to have adequate and
proper timekeeping. The Youth Justice Board national standards cover
the point raised by the right hon. and learned Gentleman, and I hope
that he will withdraw the amendment.</div>
					<a name="07102557000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for
notification by an offender of a change of address, the priority must
be the immediacy of the notification. In my view, it is essential that
the responsible officer knows as soon possible of any change of
address. That is best done by telephone or text message. Placing a
requirement to notify the change of address in writing would also
potentially be difficult for young people who have literacy
problems.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column287" />Column number: 287</div>
					<a name="07102557000422"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2
pm</div>
					<a name="07102557000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. and
learned Gentleman also tabled an amendment that would require
instructions to be recorded in offenders&#146; records and would
require those records to be disclosed upon request. Youth offending
teams and other responsible authorities already routinely keep records
pertaining to young people, not least because they need to be produced
by the court. If the hon. and learned Gentleman wishes that young
people should be able to see their records, that could be dealt with
quite properly under current data protection procedures and does not
need to be reiterated in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07102557000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Cambridge spoke to amendment No. 173, which is a reasonable
amendment. Although I wholly endorse the sentiments expressed in the
amendment, if the hon. Gentleman refers to subsection (5)(b) he will
see that there is a requirement for the responsible officer to be
notified of any change of address by the young person. As he mentioned,
if such notification were not provided, that would be a prima facie
case for a breach of order. I wish to see speedy notification of
changes of address, but if we set out a time scale in the Bill it may
lead to the consequences that the hon. Gentleman has mentioned. I would
like to allow the responsible officer to have discretion. They will
have to set out for the young person the obligations contained in the
clause and make it clear that notification of any change of address is
a key part of the order that could lead to a breach. Any instruction
given must be carried out as quickly as is practicable by the young
person, but I am not persuaded that putting a time scale in the Bill
will assist the
process.</div>
				
					<a name="07102557000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07102557000492"></a>David
Howarth:
						</b> I am glad that the Minister understands the
underlying problem. There needs to be some indication, by using a word
such as &#147;reasonable&#148; or &#147;practicable&#148;,
which were used by the Minister, that the notification requirement
should not be enforced in a rigid way. That indication does not have to
be in the Bill, but it could be; I presume that there will be some
guidance for that enforcement at some point and perhaps it should go in
there. However, either through the Minister&#146;s remarks today or
through a change to the Bill, the Government&#146;s precise intention
should be made clear. I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about
strict timetables.</div>
					<a name="07102557000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07102557000493"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> As ever, I am happy to reflect on these matters.
However, the Bill has been framed to make it clear to the responsible
officer&#151;and I hope, through the responsible officer talking to
the offender&#151;that the offender has a clear duty to provide
notification of a change of address. Obviously, it is a duty that, if
delayed for several weeks or months, would be a clear breach of the
order and would require action to be taken, which would create
difficulties for the offender. Putting a time scale in the Bill might
militate against the flexibility that the hon. Gentleman wishes to see.
At the same time, the Bill must put a duty on the offender and the
responsible officer to take account of the need to have an up-to-date
address for the offender.</div>
					<a name="07102557000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07102557000494"></a>David
Howarth:
						</b> The Minister and I do not
disagree about this very much, but surely the real point is that if the
responsible officer&#146;s lack of knowledge of the address 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column288" />Column number: 288</div>interferes with the requirements of the order, there ought to be
enforcement. Enforcement should be concerned with the purpose of
knowing the address, not just the mere technical fact of a change of
address. If it were written into guidance that officers should bear in
mind the purpose of the provision, rather than just the technicalities
of it, that would deal with the point.</div>
					<a name="07102557000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07102557000495"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman and I are
more or less in agreement that it is important that the responsible
officer knows where the offender lives and has a record of that, and is
informed straight away if there are any changes to that address. The
hon. Gentleman suggested that we insert a time scale. We note that
issue as a potential breach, but we have that common-sense discretion
whereby if a long period of time were involved, the judgment could be
made accordingly.</div>

Sally Keeble</b> (Northampton, North) (Lab): May I urge
caution the other way? I am thinking of a pregnant girl of only 15 who
moved house at extremely short notice and nobody knew about it,

living.</div>

						<b class="B"> </b>I accept that. The Committee is as one on
the need to have up-to-date addresses because communication is
important; the responsible officer needs to know where the offender is.
That is a clear duty; there will be a breach of the order under
subsection (5)(b) in the event of a change of address not being
notified. There should be discretion to ensure that the circumstances
are managed, and to decide within the guidance, and with knowledge of
the offender, whether a breach has occurred. That is important because
I can think of circumstances in my constituency in which individuals
have had to move at short notice because of domestic violence, drug
abuse at home or other circumstances that are sometimes beyond their
control.</div>
					<a name="07102557000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
Bill, the offender is obliged to notify the responsible officer of any
change of address and, self-evidently, that means within a reasonable

indicated, or on guidance and advice given at the
time.</div>
					<a name="07102557000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the light of

							<b class="B">Mr.
David Burrowes</b> (Enfield, Southgate) (Con): I have a few
brief but, I hope, appropriate comments. My hon. and learned Friend the
Member for Harborough has already made a plea about the implementation
dates. The youth court is perhaps a victim of the criminal justice
system in being subject to a sentencing regime that covers the span of
many pieces of legislation and implementation dates that are dealt with
in a less than logical fashion.</div>
					<a name="07102557000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">That allows me to refer again
to the reading material from the Prison Reform Trust recommended
earlier, in which the sentencers said that they were all grappling with
the new legislation. They referred to the new provisions, not
necessarily in temperate language, as &#147;idiotic&#148; and the
introduction of so many complex changes as &#147;lunatic&#148;.
They made particular reference to the piecemeal introduction of the new
provisions. The plea with regard to the clause, when the logic is
obviously to abolish certain youth orders and related amendments, is
that the implementation of the new regime in relation to youth
rehabilitation orders and associated matters should be done in a
logical and comprehensive fashion. That should be made clear at a very
early stage to all practitioners to ensure that, at the point of
delivery, the youth court is not trying to work out what is, or is not,
implemented and can deliver justice in a consistent
manner.</div>

							<a name="07102557000500"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> As the Committee will recognise, clause 6 will
abolish the five existing community sentences for young offenders and
replace them with a generic youth rehabilitation order, which
we have spent some time discussing in Committee. The question of
implementation is important and I am grateful to the hon. Member for
Enfield, Southgate for raising that today. Obviously, the Bill needs to
pass through both Houses of Parliaments before it will receive Royal
Assent. It is likely that that process will be completed by early to
mid-2008 at the earliest. My perspective is that the sooner that that
is done, the better, but obviously it will take some time. Given that,
I do not expect that we will implement the legislation until 2009 at
the
earliest.</div>

Garnier:
						</b> I do not know whether my contribution will be
considerable, but I hope that it will be a considered reference to new
clause 16. I do not have a quarrel with the Government amendments; they
are, as the Minister has said, necessary and partly
consequential on clause 6 and, I suspect, the other changes to the way
that youth offenders are dealt with in the criminal justice system.
Some of the later Government amendments touch, although not directly,
on what I want to say about new clause 16. Essentially, I want the
Government to have a proper understanding of the need to put the right
people in the
right places.</div>
					<a name="07102557000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have been to Glen Parva young offenders institution, which is partly in
my constituency and partly in that of my hon. Friend the Member for
Blaby (Mr. Robathan). I have been to the YOI at Warren Hill
and Hollesley Bay, which is near Woodbridge in Suffolk. I have been to
Feltham YOI and Lancaster Farm YOI, which is in the north-west. All of
those are institutions for young men. I also went to Bullwood Hall
about a year ago, when it was being used as a YOI for young
women.</div>
					<a name="07102557000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Bullwood Hall
has been re-roled at least twice since then and hit the news last week,
no doubt to the Minister&#146;s enjoyment. It was associated with HMP
Canterbury because those two institutions are now used exclusively to
accommodate foreign national prisoners. I will not talk about that, but
I will talk about my experience of young offenders institutions. Based
on that, I urge the Minister to ensure that we send the right people to
the right sort of custodial institution, as I said at the outset of my
remarks.</div>
					<a name="07102557000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">Compared with
the adult prisoner estate, young offender institutions are very
troubled and troubling places. That is not just because they are full
of young people who are there because they have committed serious
crimes&#151;some of them very serious indeed. There is a unit within
Warren Hill and Hollesley Bay where youngsters who have committed
murder&#151;some of them quite nasty murders&#151;are held, and
will be held for long periods. At Feltham, about 20 young men are
serving the equivalent of life sentences, and there are other young men
who have committed serious crimes in the other YOIs to which I have
referred.</div>
					<a name="07102557000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are dealing with a difficult collection of people and nothing that I am
about to say should be taken as a criticism of the governors, the
governing staff or the prison officers who work in these difficult
institutions. We need to be very careful that we do not put into
institutions that are for over-18s younger teenagers of the age group
that is to be brought within the youth rehabilitation order and youth
custody remit. We need to be extremely careful in ensuring that there
is sufficient capacity to house those under the age of 18 securely and
safely in secure sites. If we get that wrong, those youngsters could be
badly damaged. We could face  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column292" />Column number: 292</div>the sort of circumstances that the hon. Member for Northampton, North
spoke about in her Adjournment debate over the death of a young
constituent of hers in a secure unit outside her constituency. It was a
story that caused a great deal of alarm. The Minister responded to that
Adjournment debate and I was on the Opposition Front Bench as he did
so.</div>
					<a name="07102557000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are a whole host of issues&#151;easy, not so easy and plain
difficult&#151;that we have to be aware of when talking about the
incarceration of young people. I want the Minister&#146;s assurance
that the Ministry of Justice has the resources and the personnel to
deal with the imprisonment of youngsters, has trained those personnel
and has fully understood the difficult nature of the task. A number of
people who have spoken about the imprisonment of young people say that
we should not be sending children or young people to prison. I am not
sure that I would go that far because there will be some young
teenagers who commit crimes that society would expect to result in
custody. However, custody, whether of young people or adults, must be
humane and carried out in a way that improves the chances of their
being able to return to society in a better
state.</div>

							<b class="B">Harry
Cohen</b> (Leyton and Wanstead) (Lab): What is the hon. and
learned Gentleman&#146;s view of young people who have been
incarcerated in an adult prison, even if they have committed an
horrendous
offence?</div>
					<a name="07102557000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07102557000509"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> I do not like it. The problem that we face, which
is one of the Government&#146;s own making, is that the custodial
estate is full to the gunnels. I might be wrong, but I do not think
that young offenders are kept in police cells or court cells overnight.
There is no more room on the custodial estate. It has more than its
official capacity. Last Friday, there were 81,533 adult prisoners. That
is about 30 prisoners over the establishment. It might be thought that
30 is not a big number, but the Committee must bear in mind that about
20,000 adult prisoners are in cells that were designed for one person
and which are now having to be shared by two or three
people.</div>
					<a name="07102557000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have an
accommodation problem. To deal with it, people are being put into cells
or accommodation with others of a different age group. I accept fully
that some people look 14, but are 20 years old, while some look 20, but
are 14 years old. We must be careful that people are put in the right
place.</div>
					<a name="07102557000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">Because of
overcrowding, young offenders convicted of offences or on remand in
custody in courts in the east of England, for example, are having to be
taken in a sweat box hundreds of miles overnight and brought back to
court the following day. On some occasions, they do not arrive at their
overnight accommodation until well after 9 o&#146;clock. When I was
at Lancaster Farms, the governor and his senior colleagues said, with
huge regret, that there was not much that they could do about the fact
that young people were arriving in their care at almost midnight. That
has an effect on the child or young person as well as on the staff who,
by the time that they have gone over their shift and are waiting to go
home, are not necessarily in the best frame of mind to deal with
disoriented, difficult or plainly bad teenagers in need of
overnight accommodation.</div>

Keeble:
						</b> Given that the hon. and learned Gentleman referred
to very disturbed young people who have committed murder, he and my
right hon. Friend the Minister might like to visit Northampton and see
the model of care that is provided by St. Andrew&#146;s for
such people. It is different from the Home Office estate. The way in
which it deals with those young people is
stunning.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07102557000511"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> I should be interested to visit St.
Andrew&#146;s. It comes under the auspices of the Department of
Health, not the Ministry of Justice. When I visited Grendon Underwood,
a special and marvellous institution that is run by the Ministry of
Justice and the Prison Service, I asked the governor whether it was a
hospital with bars or a prison with doctors. He said, &#147;It is a
prison with doctors, but I wish that it was a hospital with bars
because we would get more money to do what we have to do.&#148; I
accept that we are not debating such matters this afternoon, but at
some stage we, as legislators, will have to work out the best way in
which to deal with disturbed people who end up in the criminal justice
system. I have made my point. It is important that we not only lock up
the right people for the right offences, but that we lock them up in
the right place, and that people do not come to any harm once they are
locked up.</div>
					<a name="07102557000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
on a happier note, I wish to draw the Committee&#146;s attention to
the fact that this might be the first time that Members of Parliament
have tabled a new clause that would</div>
					<a name="07102557000407"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;substitute the full stop for a

					<a name="07102557000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">One can see it by

					<a name="07102557000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not wish to add anything
to what the hon. and learned Member for Harborough said&#151;his
argument was extremely cogent, and I support it. I simply wish to ask
the Minister a more general question about what Government amendment
No. 44 will do regarding amendments to Scots law? Will it simply
replace terms, or will it have a real effect on the way in which Scots
courts will deal with the matter? If it will have a real effect, should
there not be an amendment to clause 127 about its
extent?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07102557000516"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> I thank the hon. and learned
Member for Harborough for raising this issue because it gives 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column294" />Column number: 294</div>the Committee an opportunity to consider his point. Like him, I have, in
the course of my duties, had the opportunity to visit a number of youth
offender institutions and secure training centres in the past few
months. Indeed, in my previous role, I was responsible for the criminal
justice system in Northern Ireland and for secure units and youth
offender institutes. I understand the challenges of managing the young
people and of working with the staff of those institutions.</div>
					<a name="07102557000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">My most recent visit to such an
institution was to the Hindley youth offenders institute near Leigh in
Greater Manchester. Difficult and challenging behaviour problems need
to be addressed in those centres. I am due to visit the Oakhill secure
training centre in Milton Keynes with my right hon. Friend, the
Minister for Children, Young People and Families to examine some of the
issues arising from the way it operates and performs, and at how we can
improve it.</div>
					<a name="07102557000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree
with the hon. and learned Gentleman that we must provide a safe and
productive environment for young people in those establishments. I say
&#147;safe&#148; because it is important that we protect young
people not only from self harm, but from the potential harm they might
suffer from other young people in the centres. We also need to create
an environment in which staff are protected and secured from potential
attack. We must ensure that people in the centres have a productive
regime. The whole thrust of the legislation, the Bill and Government
policy is to ensure that whatever mistakes people have made, we prevent
them from reoffending.</div>
					<a name="07102557000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are a
number of measures in place to provide broadly for the safety of people
in secure units and youth offender institutions. Under the Children Act
2004, governors and directors of young offender institutions and secure
training centres are already required to have regard to the need to
safeguard and promote the welfare of children in discharging their
functions.</div>
					<a name="07102557000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">What is
certainly true&#151;the hon. and learned Gentleman mentioned this in
passing&#151;is that these establishments contain some very dangerous
young people. According to our most recent figures, which are dated 22
October, 64 young people in custody are charged with murder. Those are
very dangerous individuals and that requires not just a safety regime,
but a productive regime to try to turn around the offending behaviour.
That comes back to the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for
Leyton and Wanstead. We must ensure that we have proper investment in
education and skill training. Nearly every young person in that
accommodation will come out into the community at some point in the
future. They need a proper regime, a safe regime and one that invests
in them to turn their lives
around.</div>

						</b> On the point about funding for
education and hospitals, St. Andrew&#146;s hospital, for example,
does not get funding for education. There needs to be some parity.
Would my right hon. Friend accept that if young people are convicted of
murder and sent to a psychiatric hospital, they should have access to
education in the same way as they would if they were sent to a young
offenders institution or a Home Office
establishment?</div>

certainly look at that matter outside the Committee to ensure that that
is the case.</div>
					<a name="07102557000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">The whole thrust of our
discussion today is the prevention of reoffending. We have young
people, some very young, who need education and investment, who need to
have their offending behaviour addressed and who ultimately need to
come out of the young offender institution as better people than when
they went into it. From my visits to such institutions, both secure
training centres and young offenders institutions, I know that that
work is ongoing.</div>
					<a name="07102557000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
statistics still show that we are facing very difficult and challenging
times in working through that. There is still a high level of
reoffending by those young people when they leave secure training
centres and youth offending institutions. Our purpose has to
be&#151;I agree with the hon. and learned Gentleman&#151;to ensure
that we have a safe and productive environment. I am not able to accept
his new clause, but I accept some of the thrust of the arguments about
having that safety and that positive regime in the centres.</div>
					<a name="07102557000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. and
learned Member for Harborough will know, as will my hon. Friend the
Member for Northampton, North, that one of the issues we have looked at
recently is restraint and its use in secure training centres and other
establishments. My hon. Friend has been very assiduous in pressing the
concerns of her constituents. She will know, as the Committee knows,
that there have been two serious inquests following the deaths of
individuals in custody. We need to reflect on those issues and take
them on board.</div>
					<a name="07102557000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
July, I instigated a full review across the estate of the use of
restraint in the young persons&#146; estates. With the Minister for
Children, Young People and Families, I recently appointed two joint
chairs to conduct the review, which is now taking evidence. I hope that
the hon. and learned Member for Harborough and the hon. Member for
Somerton and Frome will submit their views to the joint review on
restraint. That review will report to me by 4 April 2008. My right hon.
Friend and I will be taking decisions on the use of restraint. I hope
that the regime will ultimately have an effect on disturbed behaviour
by young people, either through self-harm or against each
other.</div>

a visit that I made to St. Andrew&#146;s, where different methods of
managing young people&#146;s behaviour are used. The whole design of
the building and the regime there have a very different impact from
those of the secure training centres. Although St. Andrew&#146;s is a
health establishment, in his review will he consider the methods used
in such establishments as alternatives to
restraint?</div>

published the terms of reference of the review, and we have appointed
two individuals to conduct it, both of whom are strong professionals in
their field. The review will report to me. They have sent invitations
this week for evidence to be presented to them. In terms of the safety
issue, the use of restraint in secure training centres and other
establishments is being looked at in the round, because of the
challenging nature of some of the individuals.</div>

							<a name="07102557000523"></a>Harry
Cohen:
						</b> I welcome the review announced by the Minister and
I congratulate him on it; it is very important. One of the
organisations with which I have worked in the past that is very active
in this field is Inquest. May I recommend that he meets them as part of
the review process, at a suitable
time?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07102557000524"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> I am not sure that it is entirely relevant to
the debate, but it could
be.</div>
					<a name="07102557000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07102557000525"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> The review will provide
important background information to our debates on how to improve
safety. My hon. Friend has mentioned Inquest. The review is, in a
sense, an arm&#146;s length Government review. With my right hon.
Friend the Minister for Children, Young People and Families, I have
appointed two independent chairs. They are conducting the review
independent of Government. I am sure that Inquest will submit evidence
to them. When I gave evidence in another place last week, Inquest were
present. I have no doubt that they will follow the process with
interest and play an active role in it.</div>
					<a name="07102557000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I cannot accept his
clause, I feel that the hon. and learned Member for Harborough has made
some very strong points. I take seriously the safety regime in young
offender institutions and secure training centres. In my view they are,
for the most part, very positive. In future, I want to tackle some of
the causes of offending behaviour which have brought young people into
custody in the first place with a positive education and health
regime.</div>
					<a name="07102557000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have taken
a number of important general measures such as the separation of
under-18s from over-18s, and we are developing new high-dependency
units for more vulnerable boys to help support those individuals. To
give the Committee some context, there are more than 300 places in
secure training centres; more than 2,500 in young offender
institutions; and more than 230 in secure children&#146;s homes. They
are very cost intensive: secure training centre places cost
&#163;170,000 a year; young offender institution places cost
&#163;50,000 per year; and secure children&#146;s home places cost
&#163;190,000 per year. I want those resources to be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column297" />Column number: 297</div>used effectively to prevent reoffending. It will be a failure of our
system if the young people who are sentenced to and attend those
institutions leave them and graduate to adult prisons. I want both
security and effective rehabilitation to be part of the
process.</div>
					<a name="07102557000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
ask the hon. and learned Gentleman to reflect on those points. I hope
that I have offered him some satisfaction, and I ask him to not to
press his new clause. I urge the Committee to accept the Government
amendments.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07102557000527"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for reminding
me about the position in Scotland. No amendments to extend the clause
have been requested, as it already provides that amendments made by the
Bill to existing Acts have the same extent as the Act as amended, if
that makes sense. Amendment No. 44 makes no substantive change to the
law, as it replaces references to the existing community order with
references to the new youth rehabilitation order. I hope that that
satisfies him.</div>

examine it in the cold light of day, I am happy for him to do so. I
hope that that satisfies
him.</div>

							<a name="07102557000530"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> If it were appropriate for me within the rules of
procedure of the Committee to ask your leave to withdraw the new
clause, Sir Nicholas, I would do so, but it is not, so I shall not. I
wish to respond briefly to the
Minister.</div>
					<a name="07102557000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
we would not admit this on a party political occasion, I believe that
the Minister and I have much in common in our concern about what is
happening in the custodial estate. He mentioned the huge cost of young
offender institutions, secure training centres and some secure
children&#146;s homes. He says that he wants to prevent failure and
that failure is reoffending. Well, we are already failing. The
reoffending rate for people under 21 is about 75 per cent., and some
studies suggest that it is over 80 per cent. We are already failing, so
that huge investment per young person that the Minister spoke about is
already wasted money. We are not seeing a
dividend.</div>
					<a name="07102557000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">Prisons,
young offender institutions, secure training centres and other places
where children are kept in custody are part of a secret world, about
which we do not know enough. I hope that this short debate has acted as
a window through which we as parliamentarians can look into the secure
estate. It is unfortunate that this occasion did not provide a window
through which those inside can look out to a world that is prepared to
welcome them back as long as they are reformed, rehabilitated and
prepared to live useful lives. It is essential that somehow or other we
create those metaphorical windows so that we can get better value for
money and far better outputs, to use a rather nasty word, from the
criminal justice system.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column298" />Column number: 298</div>
					<a name="07102557000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">At present, we are wasting money
and lives, and, in some respects, destroying lives. I want all of that
stopped. I want our streets and communities to be safer, and the
reoffending rate to come down sufficiently. We will never get down to
the ideal of zero, but the rate is far too high at present, and we
seriously need to do something about
it.</div>
					<a name="07102557000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would be
interested to learn more about the joint review. I had not heard of it.
That may be my fault, but I would be pleased if the Minister sent me
details about it or let me know if it is on some Ministry of Justice
website. I shall not detain the Committee further. I hope that the
proposals will shunt things on a bit in a sensible
way.</div>

							<a name="07102557000532"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I shall be brief. Years of experience have led me
to form the view that, if I wish to disconcert Ministers in charge of
criminal justice Bills, I should ask them either about courts martial,
Northern Ireland or British overseas territories. Northern Ireland
simply will not work in this respect, because two of the Ministers know
far more about it than I do, and courts martial have been covered, but
I have never before considered the possibilities of asking about the
Isles of Scilly, which form part of the English and Welsh
jurisdiction.</div>
					<a name="07102557000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
assume that the rest of the Bill applies, unamended, to the Isles of
Scilly and that the clause refers only to part 1. However, I am keen to
ensure that the orders, which it appears now can be evaded by going to
Thurso, cannot also be evaded by going to Tresco, because that may be a
temptation to young hooligans in Penzance and Newlyn, for whom that
would not be a huge journey. Can I just be assured that the principal
objectives of the rehabilitation orders will take effect in the Isles
of Scilly and that the Minister&#146;s intention in including a power
to exempt by order is not to remove any significant part of the orders
that we have
debated?</div>

hope that, as he said, I cannot be caught out by him on Northern
Ireland. Having had two years there as Minister of State, I feel as
though I can answer any questions relating to Northern Ireland. In
relation to our discussion earlier about Scotland, I have already
indicated that I will write to him to clarify that point and, although
I feel that it is covered, I will reflect on what he
said.</div>

know little about the Isles of Scilly except that the former Prime

And apparently he is buried there. Apart from that, I cannot string a
sentence together on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column303" />Column number: 303</div>the Isles of Scilly. However, I can tell the hon. Gentleman that the
youth rehabilitation order will have effect in the Isles of Scilly,
with such exceptions and adaptations as the Secretary of State may
specify. Unlike areas of England and Wales, the Isles of Scilly are not
a county or a district council, so the Secretary of State may need to
make some adaptations by order in order to reflect the curious nature
of the jurisdiction of the Isles of Scilly. It will not alter the fact
that the youth rehabilitation order will have effect in the Isles of
Scilly and will, I hope, prevent reoffending by whatever Isles of
Scilly residents are called these

							<a name="07102557000537"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> It is rather rare that one is
almost formally invited by the Attorney-General to table an amendment
in Committee, but in this instance we can properly say that we were.
Similar amendments with the same objective as those in this group were
proposed on 3 July in the House of Lords to clause 33 of the Bill that
became the Offender Management Act 2007 by my noble friends Lord
Wallace of Saltaire and Baroness Linklater. They were well supported,
and received support from Baroness Anelay of St. Johns, Lord
Ramsbotham, Lord Judd and Baroness Howe of Idlicote. In response, the
Attorney-General, Baroness Scotland,
said:</div>
					<a name="07102557000408"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
distinction between welfare and well-being is an interesting, important
and rather subtle one. The House will have extensive opportunities to
reflect on it during consideration of Clause 9 of the Criminal Justice
and Immigration Bill, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay,
referred, which was recently introduced in another place. I agree with
her that that is probably the better place for these issues to be more
fully debated.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i>
3 July 2007; Vol. 693, c. 999.]</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column305" />Column number: 305</div>
					<a name="07102557000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is very much an invitation from a
Minister to table these amendments, which is something that I have not
enjoyed before. The Minister may care to have words with the
Attorney-General later.</div>
					<a name="07102557000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments relate to
sentencing, which is a serious purpose to which we could devote a
considerable amount of time. I do not propose to do so, because we can
simply state the objectives of this group of amendments. Essentially,
they would introduce into the principles of sentencing in the criminal
court some of the underlying principles that apply in the family court
in terms of the welfare of the child and its paramountcy.</div>
					<a name="07102557000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the Minister will know, the
Children Act 1989 requires that the principle should apply to all
children involved in family court proceedings, and that there is a
welfare checklist that the court is required to consider when taking
forward any proceedings involving a child. The proposition before us
this afternoon is that a similar welfare checklist ought to apply when
dealing with the rehabilitation orders, which have at their core the
idea that one treats the individual as a whole. The circumstances that
might promote criminality and offending behaviour in that child, and
all those influences that are pooled together by those agencies that
have dealings with the young offender and that are invited to give
their views and advice to the court, ought to be taken into account
during the sentencing procedure.</div>
					<a name="07102557000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Children Act 2004 framework
document&#151;the five outcomes document&#151; examines the factors
that ought to be taken into account when considering whether a relevant
authority or institution has improved a child&#146;s well-being. Some
of those factors are entirely relevant to the actions of a court when
considering the disposals available to it in dealing with a young
offender. There are particular factors that are relevant to the points
made earlier by the hon. Members for Northampton, North and for Leyton
and Wanstead and by the hon. and learned Member for
Harborough.</div>
					<a name="07102557000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">What are
the provisions available, in the context of sentencing procedure, to
deal with education, for instance? Is there a special needs requirement
that is not currently being met? What are the welfare implications? Is
the child a child in need, as identified under section 17 of the
Children Act 1989? Those are material issues, as are mental health
assessment, consideration of housing and living conditions, and
consideration of physical health. All these factors, if they are taken
in the round, provide the substance that ought to underlay the
principles of sentencing.</div>
					<a name="07102557000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">What is being proposed is to
draw together the various strands of Government policy in this area.
The Government have been very clear in stating their intentions in
respect of how best to deal with children who suffer various
disadvantages and to ensure that they have access to the type of
support that they need. All those factors are relevant to a person who
has found themselves in trouble with the courts, where there are
underlying issues that go beyond the offending behaviour, which must
properly be brought into account when considering the measures
contained in the Bill. By extending the principles of sentencing to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column306" />Column number: 306</div>encompass those factors, I believe that the courts would take an even
wider view than they currently do of their responsibilities to the
child as well as to society, in trying to protect society against the
offending behaviour, in dealing properly with the prospects of
recidivism and in ensuring that there is less prospect of
reoffending.</div>
					<a name="07102557000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without
extending the debate&#151;I think that my intentions are very clear
already, and I have no doubt that other Members will support my
views&#151;I believe that the amendments would reconcile the
provisions of this Bill with the Children Act 2004 and other
legislation. They would reconcile the systems that are already in place
in the family court to those in the criminal court, which would produce
more integration in what we do with these young people to ensure that
they have access to the support that they
need.</div>

						</b> In this cluster of amendments&#151;Nos. 193 to
198&#151;are amendments that I tabled, which would all do the same
thing, which is alter the age below which the youth justice system is
involved from 18 to 19. That arises very much from the evidence that we
were given in our fourth sitting by Les Lawrence of the Local

said:</div>
					<a name="07102557000409"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;My final
point&#151;and it is a strange conundrum&#151;is that the Children

18.&#148;</div>

					<a name="07102557000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr.
Lawrence was referring to the gap of a year. My amendment aims to put
some coherence into the system. I would not mind if the local
authorities were to start at 18, but it is probably better that the
youth justice system includes those aged 18 and finishes at 19, so that
there is not that gap. I have tabled these probing amendments to get
the Minister&#146;s opinion on that and to hear what he thinks about
the gap that was identified by Mr.
Lawrence.</div>
					<a name="07102557000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">While we are
talking about ages, I will take the opportunity to discuss a matter
that is not specifically about 18 to 19-year-olds, but still relevant.
On Second Reading, I quoted from the newsletter from the youth
offending teams&#146; managers at their annual general meeting. It
states:</div>
					<a name="07102557000411"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
crucial that there is a distinct and separate youth criminal justice
system, where 17-year olds are afforded the same rights as 16-year olds
on arrest and within the court system. This would mean access to an
appropriate adult at the police station as well as the remand criteria
equating to that of 16-year
olds.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07102557000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">They go on to say
that the review of Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and this Bill
are opportunities to forward that ambition. Clearly, there is a gap
from 16 to 17-year-olds that needs to be addressed as well. At least
the local authorities and the youth justice system recognise that the
matter in respect of 17 and 18-year-olds needs to be addressed. My
amendment aims to get some coherence into the system and address that
gap.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column307" />Column number: 307</div>
					<a name="07102557000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will say a few words about the
amendment and the new clause tabled by the hon. Member for Somerton and
Frome. I will not make a big speech now, but in the initial stages, I
said that I felt that the welfare and development of the child have to
have a more paramount position in the criminal justice system. I hold
that as my view and that is very much what his amendments are about. I
like the look of his amendments in lots of ways and will be interested
to hear what the Minister has to say.</div>
					<a name="07102557000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">While I accept that there needs
to be some blurring in legislation, we also need some clarity. We
should be clear in our own mind of the three elements that we want in
the system. First, we need punishment and retribution, but the truth is
that the UN conventions on the rights of the child and others and
Government legislation do not talk about punishment and retribution.
They may be a factor in the criminal justice system, and if they are,
we need to be honest and say that they are necessary for horrendous
crimes, but we need to set out their limitations. The system should not
be solely about punishment and retribution. That is why I think that we
need some clarity, including in the legislation.</div>
					<a name="07102557000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other element is the
welfare and well-being of the child, and that is in all the documents
that we have signed up to, including the convention on the rights of
the child. The reason that we have come so far down that chart on
looking after children has a lot to do with how we treat child
offenders. We have not given that element the priority that it should
have had. We must revisit that point and be clear that whatever happens
on the other factors, the welfare and well-being of the child will
always be present in how we expect children to be dealt with. That
point is very
important.</div>
					<a name="07102557000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, my
right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth, a former
Home Office Minister, made the point on Tuesday that, since it has been
in power, Labour has seen the prevention of reoffending as a priority.
That is the other factor that is involved in this issue. Often, those
elements can work together. For instance, the welfare of the child, in
terms of education and the development of skills for when they come out
of custody, can work towards the prevention of
reoffending.</div>
					<a name="07102557000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need
to be clear in our minds about the three factors: punishment,
preventing reoffending, and welfare and well-being. We must be clear
about what priority we give them, how we spell that out in the
legislation and how we expect it to be implemented. I come back to the
point that the amendments are about the welfare and well-being of the
child. That must always be present in conjunction with the other two
factors. We must say to administrators and judges that the welfare and
well-being of the child is an important factor, which we expect them to
take account
of.</div>

							<a name="07102557000539"></a>Ms
Keeble:
						</b> I am pleased to take part in this debate because
it gets to the heart of what the youth criminal justice system is all
about. Personally, I oppose the amendment, although I have enormous
sympathy will all the sentiments that gave rise to it. I agree
completely with the approach of many of the outside organisations that
have promoted this measure, but I do not agree with the amendment. I
thought that it might be helpful to set out why that is.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column308" />Column number: 308</div>
					<a name="07102557000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">The state
obviously has to think about a number of issues. One is the protection
of the wider public, which is what the criminal justice system is all
about, to a great extent. There are also issues about the welfare of
the child, which is also the state&#146;s responsibility. That is the
responsibility of different Departments under different bits of
legislation; for instance, the Department for Children, Schools and
Families is involved. The amendments confuse or give the wrong priority
to some of the roles and responsibilities. However much we do not like
what has happened to these children in their lives and however much we
might sympathise, once they are in front of the court, being sentenced,
they have stepped over the
boundary.</div>
					<a name="07102557000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">The job of
the courts must be to deal with the crime, as well as to deal with the
young offender. The sequencing for that in the legislation seems to be
the right way round. When the courts come to sentencing, they have to
deal with the offending behaviour, and in the process of dealing with
that, must look at the welfare of the
child.</div>
					<a name="07102557000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
discussed the enormous sympathy with which the young people must be
treated in different instances, for example, with regard to the
religious views of the family. Those things are absolutely right.
However, once the child is in the criminal justice system, it is right
that the offending behaviour has to be the first concern. Part of this
issue is about sequencing. In other areas of our legislation, courts
and others have to sequence different roles and responsibilities of the
state in making their decisions. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome
mentioned the family courts, but they are different. I am not involved
in the legal profession, but I understand that, in many instances, in
the family courts, the welfare of the child is protected against the
war that goes on between the parents. It is absolutely right to say
that the paramount concern in all this must be the welfare of the
child, not the right to access of either parent.</div>
					<a name="07102557000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am much more familiar with
housing legislation, where the importance is placed on the local
authority&#146;s ability to allocate housing, rather than a
child&#146;s need for a home. A family can be made homeless despite
the fact that people will say that the child has a right to a home and
the welfare of the child has to be considered. The issue is therefore
one of sequencing and of what comes first, whether that concerns how
the parents became homeless or the need of the child for a house. These
are difficult issues, and there are competing rights and
responsibilities. However, different priorities have to be set in
different areas, and it is right that the priorities and sequence with
which the courts should consider the different factors are set down in
the
legislation.</div>
					<a name="07102557000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">Underlying
a lot of this, as the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome and the hon.
and learned Member for Harborough commented, are qualms about what
actually happens to young people in the criminal justice system. I not
only share their concerns, but probably take a more oppositionist
stance than either of them, because I have profound concerns about how
some young people are treated and think that wholesale changes are
needed. Those failings are failings of administration, procedure and
systems and are not so much the result of the legislation.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column309" />Column number: 309</div>
					<a name="07102557000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example, there were profound
failings in the work of the Home Office monitor in the case of Gareth
Myatt, the case that I am most aware of. The Home Office monitor said
that he found it very hard to challenge the decisions that were taken
by the management of the secure training centre. What is the point of
having a Home Office monitor if they cannot challenge the decisions
that are being taken? That, at least, is supposed to be one of their
functions. There are supposed to be reports on each incident of
restraint. I find it hard to believe that all those reports were
done&#151;if they were, there might be between 3,000 and 4,000
reports every year, which I defy anyone to deal
with.</div>
					<a name="07102557000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have much more
profound concerns about the whole regime of restraint, which is
horrific and under-reported with regard to injuries. I know a young
man, a constituent, who was repeatedly subjected to the nose
distraction technique in one of the secure training centres. He only
went to hospital when he went to the next institution because of the
damage that had been done to his nose. That is an ongoing case that I
have just written to the Department about. There are major issues that
are not the result of the welfare considerations taken at sentencing,
but concern the failures of the system once the young people get into
the institutions.</div>
					<a name="07102557000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
level of scrutiny that applies to the approval of restraint regimes is
also partly our job. It is in our own gift, as a Parliament, to take
the Government to task over the statutory instruments that provide for
the current system of restraint. The Liberal Democrats, in fact, were
responsible for getting the debate in another place. The Government
could have been overturned on that, but were not. One could say that
that was partly a failure of parliamentary scrutiny. There are issues
about how all the restraint techniques were put together and approved.
The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome would
not change one whit of that.</div>
					<a name="07102557000427"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.15 pm</div>
					<a name="07102557000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we talk about how we will
make things better for these young people and deal with the appalling
record of recidivism, we also need to consider carefully what happens
in some of these institutions. The Government and others who support
them say in their defence that the children and young people are well
looked after and that their welfare is being protected, just as the
hon. Gentleman would want.</div>
					<a name="07102557000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have not
been to as many secure training centres or seen as many institutions as
some Opposition members of the Committee, but a young person came with
me when I went to Rainsbrook and, interestingly, her response was very
different from mine. The young people in Rainsbrook looked better than
they did outside. I met one of my constituents there and, knowing where
that young man came from, I am not surprised that he looked better
because it was probably the first time in his life that he had had
three meals a day and got to bed on time. However, what he learnt about
behaviour in an institution where restraint was used with the frequency
that it was in Rainsbrook was probably negative. He would have learnt
that ultimately the sanction is force, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column310" />Column number: 310</div>which he probably knew before he went in and on which basis he would
continue to operate after he left. We need to do some profound thinking
about the regimes, but the amendment will not alter
that.</div>
					<a name="07102557000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">To make the
provisions of the amendment a primary concern in the criminal justice
system would be to let the social welfare system off the hook
completely and the prime responsibility for the tragedy of these young
people&#146;s lives is that intervention is much too late. It should
happen much earlier. All of us know that most of the young people who
end up in these institutions are a slow-motion disaster that we can all
see coming, as we have all tracked them through the system. For
example, a young girl at a special needs school was picked up for
shoplifting, kept in a police station overnight and progressed from one
thing to another until she ended up in Holloway. I have a sneaking
suspicion that if there had been a more substantial, thought-through,
considered intervention very much earlier, that disaster might not have
happened. There are hundreds of kids like
that.</div>
					<a name="07102557000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us get the
child services in place to intervene early on, quite toughly if needs
be. Once children have committed crimes and go to court, it is right to
reassure wider society that the offending behaviour will be the
courts&#146; prime concern, but we must look after the welfare of the
child. I hope that my right hon. Friend the Minister will not now jump
up and say he will accept the wording in the amendment.</div>
					<a name="07102557000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that the general public
understand that the lives of most of these kids are a disaster and a
tragedy and they would not want them to be treated badly. I had nothing
but supportive comments from my constituents after I dealt with the
Gareth Myatt case, as they understood that what had happened to that
young person was wrong. Equally, they would want the kind of behaviour
that leads a young person to be given an ASBO to be dealt
with.</div>
					<a name="07102557000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I have
enormous regard for the points being made and for the organisation
behind the amendments, we need to ensure that we deal with the
offending behaviour as well as dealing with the welfare of the young
person while they are in the court system. We must try to ensure that
we break the appalling cycle of repeat offending and disadvantage,
which is what takes these children round and round the revolving doors
of the criminal justice system, until they do something really horrible
and end up with a long sentence in an adult prison. On that basis, I
oppose the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07102557000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07102557000540"></a>David
Howarth:
						</b> There are two main differences
between the amendment and the clause as it stands. One is the matter
that the hon. Member for Northampton, North just referred to, which is
the primary regard of the system. The other is the purposes of
sentencing. I want to mention a couple of points on each
issue.</div>
					<a name="07102557000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the first issue, perhaps the difference between the two versions of the
clause is not as great as the hon. Lady suggested. It is not in the
interests of a young person, in terms of their welfare and well-being,
to be an offender. The amendment would introduce broader considerations
alongside that fundamental consideration. I do not think that anybody
believes that allowing a young person to remain in a state where they
repeatedly offend can possibly be in their interests.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column311" />Column number: 311</div>
					<a name="07102557000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second point concerns the
purpose of sentencing. The difference between the amendment and the
existing clause is that the amendment would miss out the punishment of
offenders as the first mention of the purpose of sentencing, but it
would leave in the other three purposes: the protection of the public,
the reform and rehabilitation of offenders and the making of reparation
by
offenders.</div>
					<a name="07102557000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07102557000541"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> This goes to the nub of the
differences between us. Does the hon. Gentleman feel that the 64 young
people who are currently in offender institutions because of the crime
of murder should not be
punished?</div>
					<a name="07102557000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07102557000542"></a>David
Howarth:
						</b> The question is whether there
is any point to punishment that is not protecting the public, reforming
or rehabilitating, or making reparation. In the cases referred to by
the hon. Gentleman, presumably the public are being protected. That is
presumably why the young people have been sentenced in the way that
they have. No one is arguing that the protection of the public aspect
of sentencing should be removed, and it would be wrong for the Minister
to suggest that that is part of what we are saying. The protection of
the public is in the amendment. What is not in the amendment is
punishment that does none of those other three things. What is the
point of punishment that does not protect the public, that does not
rehabilitate and that does not repair the
damage?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07102557000543"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> The amendment tabled by the hon. Gentleman would
remove clause 9(4)(a). I take the view, as I think my hon. Friends
would, that whatever the circumstances regarding reoffending, the need
to protect the public and reparations required of offenders, there has
to be an element of punishment for those individuals who have committed
crimes&#151;in some cases horrendous crimes of murder. If the hon.
Gentleman takes his case to the general public and argues that the
murderers of Jamie Bulger should not be punished as well as
rehabilitated, he will find himself on the wrong side of the argument
with the public at large.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07102557000544"></a>David
Howarth:
						</b> The question is what the purpose is of
punishment. The purpose of punishment in those cases is the protection
of the public. For the Minister to suggest that Opposition Members
favour murder, which is what he seems to think, is absurd. All we are
saying is that it is for the Government to say what the point of a
punishment is, not to refer to what other people might think, but what
the Government and Labour Members themselves believe to be the purpose
of punishments that do not fulfil any of the other three
functions.</div>

Michael</b> (Cardiff, South and Penarth) (Lab/Co-op):
During the course of sentencing I was always
primarily focused on the three elements that the hon. Gentleman
mentioned; in other words, on having a constructive purpose to the
decision that is taken. However, if he takes the trouble to ask young
offenders, including some of the most difficult and prolific offenders
in the land, whether they think that there should be punishment when
something wrong is done, he will discover that he is in a very small
minority in suggesting that punishment should be cast to one side as
not relevant. He is making a

Michael:
						</b> I was making the point that those who commit
offences understand full well that there will be, and expect there to
be, a punishment. Young offenders can be among those who are the most
critical of their friends if they commit offences. In the wider scheme
of things, to follow what the hon. Gentleman is saying, it would have
to be shown that a specific decision leads to prevention, whereas, the
general fact that there is punishment is important in creating an
environment in which it is understood that there is cause and
consequence, and that a punishment follows
offending.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07102557000551"></a>David
Howarth:
						</b> The purpose, ultimately, is to protect the
public. The hon. Gentleman is reading more into the clause than is
there; it is still part of the purpose of the sentence to protect the
public in those circumstances. The fundamental point is that one of the
things that stands out about British society compared with almost all
of the rest of the world, except, perhaps, the United States, is the
profound degree of punitiveness that characterises our society, as we
have heard today. What do we make of that? What do we do about that as
policy makers?</div>
					<a name="07102557000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
irony is that one of the clearest causes of crime in a young
offender&#146;s background is having been subject to a punitive
parenting style. The same characteristic that makes our society
punitive is the one that generates, in large measure, the crime that we
are trying to
prevent.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07102557000552"></a>Ms
Keeble:
						</b> Will not the hon. Gentleman accept that he is
confusing punishment with some kind of physical chastisement or more
severe sanction? It seems perfectly logical that if society sets
boundaries beyond which people are not supposed to go, the most obvious
one being murdering people, someone who breaches those must receive a
sanction. Wider society expects that in order for it to be confident in
the criminal justice system. A young person will only learn how to
behave if they understand that if they go beyond that boundary, there
will be a sanction of some sort. We are not a particularly punitive
society. Our penalties are probably less severe than in the majority of
other
countries.</div>

							<a name="07102557000553"></a>David
Howarth:
						</b> I am afraid that research is
against the hon. Lady. We do not have a clause saying that the purpose
of sentencing is sentencing. The courts impose sanctions on people; the
question is what the purpose of that activity is. Our clause meets the
requirements of putting forward purposes for sanction. It makes no
sense to say that the purpose of punishment is punishment. That is
ultimately what our amendment alters in the

could debate the purpose and principles of sentencing at length. But it
is also important to look at the practical reality of the impact on the
courts. The statutory duties to prevent offending were explicit in the
Crime and Disorder Act 1998. For the first time, a duty to prevent
offending was imposed not just on the courts but on all those involved
in the criminal justice system, which included practitioners and
solicitors. It meant that those solicitors who were defending their
clients and acting in their best interests also had a primary duty to
prevent them offending. That was a good duty and it is repeated in
clause 9. The clause also repeats the purpose of sentencing, which is
aligned to those purposes relating to over-18s. That is quite proper.
The principle that justice should be the same and should be seen to be
achieved both in relation to the victim and the offender, regardless of
age, is
right.</div>

						<i class="I">Interruption.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i>
If I can complete my reply, it depends on the context in which we look
at the purposes and whether the purposes need to have a focus and need
to underlie the sentencing regime. The implicit point of any sanction
is punishment. The point of prisons is punishment. If the argument put
forward to rebut the amendment is that removing punishment as a purpose
of sentencing inevitably mean removing prisons, that is obviously not
so&#151;prisons are there to punish as much as any other sanctions in
the court system. The important point when one looks at punishment is
to look at what it achieves and at what sentencing, which in its very
nature is punishment,
achieves.</div>

							<a name="07102557000557"></a>Ms

						</b> We can get very involved in semantics here. How
would the hon. Gentleman explain to one of his constituents that
punishment pure and simple is not required to ensure that people have
confidence in the criminal justice system? There are all the other
worthy things too. But when he is dealing with a constituent who is a
victim of crime how will he explain away the idea that punishment means
punishment?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07102557000558"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> The way to answer that is very
simple. Punishment obviously forms an inherent part of the criminal
justice system. The purpose of this amendment was to probe whether we
are achieving the purposes of sentencing on the ground. We need to
focus on those areas of reform and rehabilitation of offenders and the
protection of the public. We also need to look at the context in which
offenders come to court and how they are dealt with in family courts.
There is reference to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column314" />Column number: 314</div>acting in the children&#146;s best interests. Many clients come
through to the youth courts. Are the social welfare gaps that the hon.
Lady described being plugged by the youth courts? Unless such children
come within the statutory definition of a child in need, there are
often gaps in that system which are not dealt with properly.</div>
					<a name="07102557000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">Often a case will involve a
young person with special educational needs or family issues such as
abuse in the home or housing needs. If they come before the court for,
perhaps, a more serious offence but the courts are keen to deal with
matters speedily, particularly given the present guidelines for speedy
justice, the reality is often that the background of the offending is
not properly considered in depth. Often, all the needs of a child
attending court for the first time are not taken into account and
properly considered, and the effect is
limited.</div>
					<a name="07102557000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
discussing sentencing and justice, we need to take account of
reparation. That is the purpose of amendment No. 9. The courts often
give limited attention to reparation. On earlier clauses, we had
debates about restorative justice and the progress and improvements
that have been made, but unless restorative justice involves not just
conferencing and challenging offenders&#146; behaviour and their
relationship to victims, and unless that is seen in relation to proper
restitution and making of amends, its effects will be limited. That is
why the amendment seeks to include in proposed new subsection (1)(4)(d)
the words</div>
					<a name="07102557000412"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;financial
compensation or other
appropriate&#148;</div>
					<a name="07102557000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">before the
words</div>
					<a name="07102557000413"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;reparation by
offenders to persons affected by their
offences.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07102557000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reality is that the number of financial compensation orders made in
youth courts is limited. The latest figures, which are for 2005,
suggest that 22,511 orders were imposed, but there are no centrally
collected figures to indicate how many were enforced and
collected.</div>
					<a name="07102557000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many people
consider that basic justice should involve people paying for their
crime and properly making amends, but they do not see that as the
reality. For example, offenders who commit property or shoplifting
crime do not accept that there are any victims. The horrible expression
&#147;victimless crime&#148; has come into common parlance but it
is something that one should treat with great caution. The concern is
that offenders who commit such offences do not understand that they
properly need to make amends for
their crime.</div>
					<a name="07102557000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
us take the example of a prolific burglar who committed robberies in
the Enfield area. When he got into robbing local petrol stations, he
did not see a victim. As far as he was concerned, petrol stations were
fair game. He considered them to be part of an institution and not
bodies with which the concept of victim could be associated. He
certainly did not think that he should make any amends. The sentences
that he received during the years of his criminal life did not truly
require him to pay back the victims of his criminal
behaviour.</div>
					<a name="07102557000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have all spoken about reparation. The purpose of amendment No. 9 is to
make the point explicitly that it must include financial compensation
or other appropriate reparation. That crucial element must become a
reality.  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column315" />Column number: 315</div>I ask the Minister to explain how the justice system will ensure that
reparation means what it says and involves the financial compensation
that many victims often
want.</div>
					<a name="07102557000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
discussed welfare issues, which are already a statutory duty, and the
suggestion that we should extend the duty to well-being, and broaden
the issues of which the court needs to take account with regard to
children. But the general concern of the public in respect of the
justice system is that victims are not included in discussions on
sentencing. The public want people to pay for their crime, and they
often want financial payment. It is important for there to be reality
in the purpose of sentencing, which is why we tabled the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="07102557000559"></a>Mr.
Walker:
						</b> I have been in this place for two and a half years
and I still do not have a clue how to navigate my way around a Bill.
Proposed new subsection (1)(4)(d) refers
to</div>
					<a name="07102557000414"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the making of
reparation by offenders to persons affected by their
offences.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07102557000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important that people in our communities see that those young people
responsible for making their lives miserable and for destroying the
environment in which they live are making financial reparation for the
harm and offence that they have caused. Like many hon. Members, I
attend public meetings at churches and community halls in which we
discuss antisocial behaviour. There is a strong desire among the public
for financial
reparation.</div>
					<a name="07102557000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said
on Second Reading, when a group of youngsters are caught smashing up a
bus shelter for the first time, they must pay for the repair of that
bus shelter. I note that the provision refers to the making of
reparation by offenders</div>
					<a name="07102557000415"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to persons affected by their
offence.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07102557000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">It should refer
to persons and organisations. The bus shelter would be owned by an
organisation. If the youngsters smashed up the bus shelter a second
time, they should pay for the repair&#151;although it would probably
be their parents who pay&#151;and receive a fine. In the case
of it being smashed up a third time, the youngsters and their parents
should appear together at the magistrates court. It is not on for young
people to be recidivist offenders without their parents taking an
interest in them and the reason behind their
actions.</div>

							<a name="07102557000560"></a>Ms
Keeble:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman has particularly strong views
about violence against women with which I agree absolutely. I also
agree with him about reparation for minor crimes, but is that
acceptable for major crimes such as violence against women? If people
say that they are sorry for their actions, does he believe that they
should be allowed to go unpunished? Does he accept punitive
sentencing?</div>
					<a name="07102557000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07102557000561"></a>Mr.
Walker:
						</b> The hon. Lady draws me into a completely different
area. People who commit violence against others should be incarcerated,
so that they do not continue to pose a risk to law-abiding
members of society. While they are incarcerated, the underlying
cause of their violent behaviour should be addressed, be it their
addictions, their mental illness or whatever.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column316" />Column number: 316</div>
					<a name="07102557000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for youth offending, it is
important that, when culprits are identified, they are not just given a
warning and told not to do it again. They must be made responsible for
their actions. Parents must also be made responsible for the actions of
their children. If my children were caught smashing up the local bus
shelter&#151;and I hope to God that they would never do such a
thing&#151;and I was told that it would cost me &#163;500 to repair
it, I would make damn sure that they did not do it a second time. The
Bill must allow for that to happen and place responsibility on parents
for the actions of young children. Until they take an interest, we will
not get to the bottom of the
problem.</div>

						</b> I want to intervene briefly because the sedentary
chatter that has been going on might have disturbed the general
direction of the debate. I do not want to appear more pompous than I am
usually. Many hon. Members will find that impossible.</div>
					<a name="07102557000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I wanted to try to
draw us back to the purpose of the Bill and the purpose of this
particular debate. I do not think that we need to get over-excited
about the points that have been made by people from sedentary
positions, when they say, &#147;Oo-er, you have removed the word
&#145;punishment&#146;&#148;; that is a given. It seems to me
that the purpose of tabling this amendment and having this debate is to
ensure that we realise that the system is not just about punishment but
about disposing of young offenders&#146; crimes with greater purpose.
I do not think that that can be controversial; I am sure that the new
Labour party is very keen on punishment nowadays. I am also sure that
we all agree that punishment is a necessary part of the criminal
justice system.</div>
					<a name="07102557000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, we need to stress that
punishment by itself is not enough. The Minister and I have had debates
about this issue, in relation to custody. Sending somebody to prison
and doing nothing more is not enough; giving someone a young offenders
institution sentence and doing nothing more is not enough; sending
someone to a secure training centre and doing nothing more is not
enough. I suspect that the purpose of the amendment is to get us to
engage our thoughts about the whole breadth of purpose of the
sentencing system.</div>
					<a name="07102557000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would have thought that those views are utterly uncontroversial. We all
know that, even if this matter were pressed to a Division, the
Government would have their day. So what? I think that we can be a bit
more grown-up about what we are discussing. Let us enjoy the fun of the
late Thursday afternoon and tease each other about whether the word
&#147;punishment&#148; is in or out, but let us also be serious
about what we are trying to achieve and let us hope that no Government
Minister will concentrate too much on what he thinks is a good debating
point and instead concentrates on the substance of the
issue.</div>

						</b> The hon. and learned Member for Harborough has
tried to row back from some of the discussion that has been going on in
this debate today. However, it is very important indeed that we
recollect something that has been referred to in this debate; that it
is the purpose of the criminal justice system, particularly in relation
to young offenders, to prevent reoffending. If a youngster offends,
there is damage to the victim, whoever that is, to the wider community,
very often to the offender&#146;s parents and family, and certainly
to the offender themselves, in terms of their future prospects. So it
is in nobody&#146;s interests that there should be
reoffending.</div>
					<a name="07102557000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
in seeking to discourage offending and reoffending, it is very
important indeed that the message gets across that if someone offends
they will get punished.

themselves; they may not have intended to do that. However, that is
what they did.</div>
					<a name="07102557000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
also important, when deciding on the individual sentence and how a
youngster is punished, that other decisions are taken that will help to
get the youngster out of a pattern of offending and that they are taken
constructively. That is why the provision in the Crime and Disorder Act
1988 was put in place, and a very wise one it was, if I may say
so.</div>
					<a name="07102557000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">Opposition Members
need to recognise that it is important, from the point of view of
offenders or possible offenders, and also from the point of view of the
public, in terms of their confidence in the criminal justice system,
that we do not put the line through the word
&#147;punishment&#148;. It is not the same as the word
&#147;punitive&#148;. The word &#147;punitive&#148; means
punishment that is excessive in relation to the offence, and punitive
measures are not terribly constructive in helping to prevent
reoffending. I think that Opposition Members, in instigating this
debate, have simply demonstrated that they are a bit muddled about the
English language.

these important issues. I heard the right hon. Gentleman say that he
was concerned that the criminal justice system should prevent
reoffending. The amendment seeks to include reoffending, but no one is
suggesting that anyone, in any part of the House, wants to put in place
measures that will make it easier to reoffend. We are almost getting
into a debate over whether to include a phrase saying that we are
against that certain principle. He seems to want to make it clear in

reoffending.</div>

						</b> I am grateful to have had this debate. I fear that
I will disappoint the hon. and learned Member for Harborough in my
response. The issue is not about having a childish debate. These are
very serious issues. I have looked at the amendment and at the clause.
I am a simple man and have been here for only 15 years. I still
occasionally look at Bills and decide how we can amend them, just as
the hon. Member for Broxbourne has done after two and a half years in
this House.</div>
					<a name="07102557000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
clear to me that under the clause, the words &#147;the punishment of
offenders&#148; are there as the first purpose of sentencing. That is
associated with the issues on which we all have some agreement, such as
that we must reform and rehabilitate offenders, protect the public and
seek reparation. Simple man though I am, I look at the amendment and
see that the first purpose of sentencing is</div>
					<a name="07102557000416"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the reform and rehabilitation of

has just come in and has missed a very interesting debate. I

an element of boundary also, but there must be some consideration that
there will be punishment. Whatever well-meaning words the Committee has

							<a name="07102557000580"></a>Mr.
Hanson:
						</b> All aspects of clause 9(4) are important, but I
emphasise that the punishment of offenders is equally important. If the
amendment is passed, that will not be in the Bill. I want to see the
prevention of reoffending, the protection for the public and
reparations. However, I also want individuals to know that they will be
punished for the crimes that they undertake, particularly serious
crimes. I can concur no more than with the
statement:</div>
					<a name="07102557000417"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
purpose of punishing criminals is to deter crime and to send a clear
signal that it is
wrong.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07102557000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is from the
Conservative party&#146;s 2005 manifesto. The signal that the
amendment would send on the purpose of sentencing would be entirely the
wrong signal.</div>
					<a name="07102557000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
couple of other points were made during the debate. My hon. Friend the
Member for Leyton and Wanstead suggested raising the age to 19. I think
that that would confuse matters and respectfully tell him that I cannot
concur with it. Doing so would confuse the courts by crossing the
established boundary between youths and adults in youth
offending.</div>
					<a name="07102557000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some hon.
Members have also mentioned the question of reparation. I do not
consider that financial or other compensation needs to be directly
referenced in the Bill. If hon. Members look at section 1(30) of the
Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000, they will see that
courts already have a separate power to order any offender to pay
compensation.</div>

it might be worth while including the words &#147;including

							<a name="07102557000583"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> We have had a debate that was in part constructive
and sensible and in part deeply depressing for its unoriginality and
preoccupation. I had hoped that we might have had a sensible
debate about the purposes of sentencing and a proper consideration of
the attitudes that the Government have clearly expressed many times on
how to deal with the child. The hon. Members for Leyton and
Wanstead and for Northampton, North certainly touched on
that.</div>
					<a name="07102557000372"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Northampton, North did not agree with the terms of my amendment,
and I accept that. She said, quite rightly, that the matters that I
wanted to ensure were taken into account before the point of going to
court and that there is a much greater duty on the agencies
that deal with the child before they come into the criminal justice
system and on the penal system after sentence than we sometimes
understand or recognise. I do not disagree with her at all. I simply
say that the court is a convenient point at which stock take can be
taken of all the things that should have been done by those agencies.
Using the sentencing procedure and bringing it into the same context as
the process that occurs in the family courts is an opportunity to see
whether the right support is being given to that individual for
the purposes of preventing reoffending and protecting the
public. That is what the penal system is
all about.</div>
					<a name="07102557000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">After
what was quite a sensible debate on that, we had this absurdity of
deciding whether the purpose of punishment had to be punishment. What a
nonsense of a debate. Labour Members were saying that they wanted the
first principle of punishment to be punishment. It was as if the
purpose of the Bill was to make a Bill. If that was the way that the
short title started I would be right to say that those words should be
deleted. The purpose of sentencing is punishment because sentencing is
punishment. As we say in amendment No. 135, sentencing is to ensure a
proportionate response to offending behaviour. A sentence is not
exerted unless it is punishment, but that punishment must have purpose.
The present Prime Minister used to say when he was Chancellor,
&#147;prudence with a purpose.&#148; Everything must have a
purpose. What we are trying to establish is the purpose of punishment
and sentencing. That is why I so deplore the way in which we have
descended into such a futile debate, simply because some thought that
they might be able to secure some petty political advantage. I
have  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column321" />Column number: 321</div>not got the slightest intention of prolonging this debate any further. I
find it very sad that we cannot have a serious debate about the
purposes of sentencing in this Committee without people making utterly
futile points. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
