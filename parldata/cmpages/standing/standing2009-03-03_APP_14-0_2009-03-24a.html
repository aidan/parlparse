Ennis</b> (Barnsley, East and Mexborough) (Lab): On behalf of
the Committee, Mrs. Humble, I would like to welcome you back
to the Chair for this afternoon&#146;s interesting sitting.</div>
<a name="09032472000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">As members of
the Committee will recall, we had just started examining schedule 7,
and I was referring to the fact that members of staff who are likely to
transfer away from the Learning and Skills Council were a bit anxious
about the security of their follow-on employment. I was about to quote
from an e-mail that I had received from one of my constituents, which
sums up very eloquently the position that the staff find themselves in.
I will read out the salient parts of the
e-mail:</div><a name="09032472000609"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Dear
Mr. Ennis...As a member of staff currently employed by
the LSC, I can expect to transfer to the YPLA, the SFA or a local
authority... The bill will not result in a straightforward case of
abolishing one organisation and transferring staff to two or three new
bodies&#151;some 3,300 LSC staff will be affected, and up to 1,000
may transfer to 150 local authorities. Given the complexity of these
arrangements it is imperative that the terms of the transfer and their
likely impact upon staff terms and conditions are placed beyond
doubt.&#148;</div><a name="09032472000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no doubt in my mind, Mrs. Humble, that staff, when they
are affected by a change and have to move on from one organisation to
another, are faced with quite a challenge at a worrying time. That is
why I have tabled amendment 423, which seeks reassurance from Ministers
that all the staff involved will be treated very sensitively regarding
the transfer of undertakings for public employees and so on. I will
leave it at that for now.</div>
<a name="09032472000018"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09032472000757"></a><b class="B">Annette
Brooke</b> (Mid-Dorset and North Poole) (LD): Good afternoon,
Mrs.
Humble.</div><a name="09032472000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">I,
too, have received representations from a constituent and at this stage
I would just like to make some points on their behalf. I am equally
concerned about what is not in schedule 7 and I hope that the Minister
will be able to throw some light on matters.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column538" />Column number: 538</div><a name="09032472000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
obviously deep concern that all TUPE arrangements will remain in place,
which is what one would normally expect in situations such as this one.
Employees of the Learning and Skills Council, and others who are
affected, need some reassurances from this afternoon&#146;s debate.
Apart from obvious concerns about continuity of service, pay and
conditions, there are additional concerns about pensions and how they
will be affected. I support this probing amendment, because what we
need are full assurances that what might be expected to be in place,
with this very large transfer of staff, truly is in
place.</div>
<a name="09032472000021"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000758"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and
Skills (Mr. Si&#244;n Simon):</b> A very good
afternoon to you, Mrs. Humble, and to everybody
else.</div>
<a name="09032472000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the
hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke) for her
contribution; she is as assiduous as ever on behalf of her
constituents. I particularly thank my hon. Friend the Member for
Barnsley, East and Mexborough (Jeff Ennis) for his contribution. He is
famous in this place for the energy and assiduity with which he works
on behalf of his constituents; he is their champion. It therefore comes
as no surprise that he has taken this opportunity in an otherwise
rather mundane afternoon in Committee to bring these matters to our
attention.</div><a name="09032472000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
sympathise with the intention behind my hon. Friend&#146;s amendment
and with the comments by the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North
Poole, and I am grateful to them for raising this issue. I know that it
is one that the Public and Commercial Services Union is anxious about.
My ministerial colleagues, including my right hon. Friend the Minister
for Schools and Learners, and I have had several conversations with the
PCS directly about this issue. One of the principles guiding the two
Departments in the transfer of responsibilities is the retention of the
expertise that the new bodies will require to deliver outcomes for
young people and adults. To that end, we have made a commitment in
writing that the Cabinet Office statement of
practice&#151;COSOP&#151;and a fair deal for pensions will inform
and guide our approach to a complex TUPE-like transfer. I am pleased to
have had the opportunity to restate that on the record. Nevertheless,
the amendment would be technically difficult to implement. Who would
judge detriment, for example? What does &#147;substantial&#148;
mean? What would happen if it were after the transfer and so on? While
I am sure that we could debate those elusive finer points for hours,
the best thing to say is to note the strength of feeling shown by
Members today and in representations from
outside.</div>
<a name="09032472000024"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000759"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I think that I heard what the Minister said, but I
wish to be doubly sure that the staff transfer orders will fully comply
with the Cabinet Office statement of practice on staff transfers. I am
not sure whether the Minister said that
fully.</div><a name="09032472000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000760"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I did say that, but I had not gone on to make my
main point, which is that the strength of representations, particularly
from my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough but
also from the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole and others,
has given me cause to think again. Although I will ask my hon. Friend
to withdraw his 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column539" />Column number: 539</div>amendment, I intend to return on Report with another view, having taken
the advice of our departmental lawyers and counsel. I hope that the
hon. Lady is satisfied with my hon. Friend&#146;s successful
afternoon, and I hope that he will withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09032472000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000761"></a>Jeff
Ennis:</b> As ever, I am really pleased with the
Minister&#146;s response, and I thank him for his patience and
indulgence. I am glad that the issue has been placed on the record and
that we will look at it again on Report. Thanks to the
Minister&#146;s encouraging remarks, I have pleasure in saying that I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09032472000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

8 and clause 122 establish sixth-form colleges as a distinct legal
category. The rationale, from the policy set out in the impact
assessment, is as follows:</div>
<a name="09032472000610"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Ministers
want to recognise the strength of SFCs and their contribution to the
education of young people by identifying the SFC sector as a distinct
legal
category.&#148;</div><a name="09032472000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
means enabling the sixth-form college sector of 94 colleges to
be split off from other further education colleges and be divided up
between the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills and the
Department for Children, Schools and Families. That is all very
important and bureaucratic, which is the view of the Association of
School and College
Leaders:</div><a name="09032472000611"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
are concerned...that the changes for sixth form colleges will
bring about a significant increase in bureaucracy for both colleges and
local
authorities.&#148;</div><a name="09032472000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Association of Colleges, too, is mildly
anxious:</div><a name="09032472000612"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Sixth
Form Colleges will be small in number...within a Department which
includes approximately 25,000 schools and nurseries but we hope
Ministers and officials in DCSF are able to devote sufficient attention
to their work and ensure they
flourish.&#148;</div><a name="09032472000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
28 would amend the definition of a sixth-form college. At present,
proposed new section 33B of the Further and Higher Education
Act 1992, which would be inserted under schedule 8, defines a
sixth-form college as a college
where</div><a name="09032472000613"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;at
least 80 per cent. of its total enrolment number will be persons over
compulsory school age but under
19&#148;.</div><a name="09032472000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
means that a college where, for example, 75 per cent. of students are
within the age range would no longer qualify, which seems unnecessarily
heavy-handed. Our amendment would change the definition to one in
which</div>
<a name="09032472000614"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it is
reasonable to classify the institution as a sixth form
college.&#148;</div><a name="09032472000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure that the figure of 80 per cent. was just plucked out of the
air, so I urge Ministers to consider our more reasonable amendment to
define a sixth-form college and how it should be distinguished from a
regular further education college.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000763"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and
Families (Sarah McCarthy-Fry):</b> I am pleased to welcome you
back to the Chair this afternoon, Mrs. Humble, on my first
opportunity to do so in Committee this
week.</div><a name="09032472000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
answer to the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, the
threshold for the designation of new sixth-form colleges is based on
the age range of those colleges that currently identify themselves as
sixth-form colleges. It certainly has not been plucked out of thin air.
Of all the sixth-form colleges, only three have less than 80 per cent.
of full-time equivalent students aged over 16 years and under 19. It
was in fact a threshold that came out of existing colleges that
identify themselves as sixth-form colleges and provide predominantly
for young people over 16 but under 19. The majority of those colleges
have at least 80 per cent. of their full-time equivalent students
within that age
range.</div><a name="09032472000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
our view, the threshold protects the essential nature of the sixth-form
college sector providing mainly for those over 16 and under 19. It also
gives a clear steer about eligibility to further education colleges
that might consider applying for sixth-form college status in the
future. The threshold is generally supported by representatives of the
sixth-form college sector as a firm indicator of the main criterion for
sixth-form college status. I am worried that, if accepted, the
amendment would introduce doubt and confusion into the
system.</div><a name="09032472000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Colleges
in the FE sector have become more diverse since they were first
incorporated as FE colleges under the Further and Higher Education Act
1992. They admit a wider range of students and serve broader
communities than may have been the case in the past. Many colleges
would therefore be unclear about when they have grounds for applying to
become sixth-form colleges and what might be considered
&#147;reasonable&#148;. I am concerned that that uncertainty might
destabilise the FE system generally, and that would not be in the
interests of all colleges and
learners.</div><a name="09032472000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
the record, I should point out that the Sixth Form Colleges Forum is
broadly supportive of the new arrangements, because it thinks that
there is more coherence in having local authorities, which are
primarily responsible for the strategic direction of schools, having
responsibility for the major direction of sixth-form colleges. On that
basis, I ask the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09032472000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000764"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> The sixth-form colleges have expressed concern to me
through their briefing that, because the mere 94 sixth-form colleges
are among 25,000 schools and nurseries, they may not receive the
attention that their importance requires. Moreover, the Minister said
that three of those 94 sixth-form colleges will not constitute
sixth-form colleges according to the definition. Will she therefore say
what will happen to the three sixth-form colleges where it is not the
case that 80 per cent. of students are over 16 and under 19 years? What
would happen if a sixth-form college had applied to be a sixth-form
college and had more than 80 per cent. of students in that bracket once
it had applied, but then it dipped below the 80 per cent. requirement
the following year? Would that lead to its being disqualified? If there
is to be a de minimis period during which the colleges can drop below
80 per cent., how long would it be and what would be the consequences
if, at the end of that time, the sixth-form college was still at, say,
79 per cent.?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000765"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> The reason for the inclusion of the three
colleges that are below 80 per cent. is that they designate themselves
as sixth-form colleges. They are part of the Sixth Form Colleges Forum,
so they are very much part of the family of sixth-form colleges. That
is why they will be included in the first tranche, in the one-off
order, when they will be invited to take sixth-form college
status.</div><a name="09032472000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other question was about whether sixth-form colleges feel that they
would be swamped with all the other responsibilities of the Department
for Children, Schools and Families. I would strongly refute that. The
separate designation for sixth-form colleges means that they will get
the attention that they need, while remaining independent
corporations.</div><a name="09032472000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once
colleges are designated as sixth-form colleges, they remain with that
designation. We are looking to the future, when FE colleges want to
move into the sixth-form college sector. There is a review period of
five years&#151;we shall come to that when we debate another
amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton&#151;during which changes can be made, and that is
designed to retain stability in the
sector.</div><a name="09032472000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000766"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I am encouraged that the three colleges identified
by the Minister as not falling within the definition have been invited
to join the sixth-form college sector. It is probably entirely
reasonable for those colleges to be included in the sixth-form college
sector, since they do not paint themselves as sixth-form colleges.
However, that falls within the definition in the amendment, that it
should be reasonable in all circumstances to judge that a college is a
sixth-form college. However, having made the argument, which the
Minister has in some ways vindicated, I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the
amendment.</div><a name="09032472000047"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="09032472000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000767"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I beg to move amendment 29, in
schedule 8, page 176, line 43, leave
out subsection
(3).</div><a name="09032472000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
drafted, proposed new section 33D of the Further and Higher Education
Act 1992, which schedule 8 inserts, prevents sixth-form colleges from
applying to the Secretary of State for redesignation as FE colleges for
five years following classification as a sixth-form college. We touched
on that issue in a previous debate, but that period seems to be
unnecessarily arbitrary and restrictive. I doubt that colleges will
swing back and forth between sectors every other year or month, so I
cannot see the need for the provision, which may well present a barrier
in some circumstances. Amendment 29 simply removes
subsection (3) of proposed new section 33D. If the Minister
cannot accept the amendment, would she explain why the period of five
years has been
selected?</div><a name="09032472000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000768"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> As I touched on in my response to the
previous amendment, the restriction on the application to redesignate
is designed to ensure the stability of the sector. It does not prevent
applications for a change of status if a college considers itself
better placed in the other sector, but it controls the timing, so that
multiple applications to change status do not interfere 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column542" />Column number: 542</div>with the good governance of both sectors. Local authorities and the
Skills Funding Agency need some assurance about the institutions that
they would be performance managing. The sectors themselves would want a
clear view of which colleges are in membership. Our view is that a
five-year gap between applications allows colleges time to focus on
their core
business.</div><a name="09032472000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
there was no restriction on the change of status, there would be a
danger that that would encourage short-term vision and erode
distinctions between the sectors. The worst-case scenario&#151;I do
not believe it would happen but it is a possibility&#151;is that a
college might attempt to move between sectors in pursuit of perceived
short-term gain rather than long-term strategy. That would confuse
other colleges, employers and those parents and students who wanted to
make use of the
college.</div><a name="09032472000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
discussed our proposals for the designation of sixth-form colleges with
representatives from the college sector. We are clear that they want
stability and clear and defined processes for designation, to be able
to plan their business. A period of stability, which does not prevent a
college from changing its status at some future point if it feels that
its core mission has changed, is essential to making a success of the
changes that the Bill is introducing. For those reasons, I would ask
the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="09032472000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000769"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> There would not have been instability if there had
not been a split into two Departments&#151;DIUS and DCSF. This
anti-instability measure has become necessary because of the
bureaucratic decision to split the Government&#146;s role between two
Departments. However, I am reassured by the Minister&#146;s response
and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09032472000054"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000770"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I beg to move amendment 76, in
schedule 8, page 177, line 16, after
&#145;of&#146;, insert &#145;and available
for&#146;.</div><a name="09032472000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a probing amendment to determine whether sixth-form colleges can
recruit pupils from the age of 14. Able youngsters take
their GCSEs ever earlier and may wish to proceed to A-levels when they
are younger than 15. Proposed new section 33E(1), which will be
inserted into the Higher Education Act 1992 by the schedule, states
that a sixth-form college may do a number of things. Paragraph (b)
states that it
may</div><a name="09032472000615"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;provide
secondary education suitable to the requirements of persons who have
attained the age of
14&#148;.</div><a name="09032472000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a little ambiguous. On first reading, it implies that the college
can provide GCSE
courses.</div><a name="09032472000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
question, which was prompted by the Association of School and College
Leaders, is whether sixth-form colleges can enrol students from the age
of 14. The amendment would insert the words &#147;and available
for&#148; so that the paragraph states that sixth-form colleges may
&#147;provide secondary education suitable to the requirements of and
available for persons who have attained the age of 14&#148;.
Clarification from the Minister on this point would be very
helpful.</div><a name="09032472000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000771"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I am happy to clarify this matter for the
hon. Gentleman. Proposed new section 33E will re-enact for
sixth-form colleges the existing powers 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column543" />Column number: 543</div>of FE colleges; these are not new powers. Colleges can accept pupils
from the age of 14. We are concerned that accepting the amendment would
imply that colleges should routinely accept pupils aged 14 to 16. We do
not believe that they should. However, we think that they should have
that flexibility. The schedule gives sixth-form colleges the
flexibility to offer additional provision at the margins, while
allowing them to focus on the core provision for 16 to 19-year-olds
that so many students and their parents want. I hope that I have given
sufficient comfort to the hon. Gentleman and that he will withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09032472000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000772"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that helpful
clarification, which I am sure will be heard outside the House. I am
sure that the ASCL will find it helpful. I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the
amendment.</div><a name="09032472000061"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,

John Hayes</b> (South Holland and The Deepings) (Con): I beg
to move amendment 363, in schedule 8, page 185, leave out
lines 16 to
31.</div><a name="09032472000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would remove the ability of local education authorities to
appoint members to the governing body of a sixth-form college.
Sixth-form colleges, like FE colleges, are at the centre of their
communities, and it is important that, like FE colleges, they are
allowed to respond to the needs of those communities. It is imperative
that that responsiveness is based on independence and
flexibility.</div><a name="09032472000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">FE
colleges have independent governing bodies, which they are extremely
keen to keep. However, as the 157 Group and the Association
of Colleges pointed out in their evidence, the new chief executive of
Skills Funding will have the power to appoint governors to FE governing
bodies. The responsiveness of FE colleges means that they are in tune
with economic demand and the choices and aptitudes of learners. We are
not keen that they should be beholden to the needs of
LEAs.</div><a name="09032472000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
feel the same about sixth-form colleges. They require the same kind of
flexibility and responsiveness. There may be a misunderstanding about
sixth-form colleges, although not on your part, Mrs. Humble,
or on the part of well-informed Committee members. More widely, people
might assume that sixth-form colleges are more like school sixth forms
than they are. Many sixth-form colleges teach a variety of things to a
variety of learners. Their work is much more varied and is
characterised by the flexibility that I have
described.</div><a name="09032472000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is designed to ensure that while LEAs keep their
commissioning role and powers of intervention, the governors of
sixth-form colleges remain independent. Is there not already sufficient
oversight in these institutions without a member of the LEA sitting on
their boards? The amendment is supported by the Sixth Form
Colleges&#146; Forum, which argued in written evidence that</div>
<a name="09032472000616"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Sixth Form Colleges&#146; Forum is concerned that Sixth Form Colleges
retain their current independence and ability to provide education
appropriate to the needs of their communities on the same basis as
their FE
colleagues.&#148;</div><a name="09032472000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister will know that sixth-form colleges are in the same
network as FE colleges&#151;they are members of the Association of
Colleges and so on.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column544" />Column number: 544</div><a name="09032472000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
also allays the worries of the AOC that</div>
<a name="09032472000617"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;local
authorities will limit student choice by seeing sixth-form colleges as
very much more local than they currently are in their recruitment. We
hope that local authorities will in no way become proprietorial about
their sixth-form colleges and try to limit their places to students
within their
boundaries.&#148;</div><a name="09032472000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
reinforces my point about sixth-form colleges being more wide ranging
in the diet that they offer&#151;both in content and in the kind of
students that they typically teach. We must ensure that sixth-form
colleges can retain this independent spirit, for the welfare of the
students and the interest of the communities that they serve. To place
two LEA members on a small governing body seems an excessive
involvement of local authorities and it does not appear to be supported
on any evidential basis. I have heard nothing to suggest that
sixth-form colleges are typically badly governed. Perhaps the Minister
knows otherwise and will make the Committee aware of any evidence she
has.</div>
<a name="09032472000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sixth-form
colleges are already providing an excellent education for a wide range
of students with a wide range of subjects. We cannot and should not
restrict their ability to perform this vital function in the way that
they wish in the future. The amendment is therefore tabled in that
spirit and we anticipate the Minister&#146;s response with
interest.</div>
<a name="09032472000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000774"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I want to make a few comments. It is a matter of
getting the right balance. Things are going to change, and funding
arrangements have been going through local authorities. However, I
appreciate the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments about independence,
which is very much valued. However, it is important that new
relationships are forged in the new situation. At this stage, I am not
against the proposal that a local authority &#147;may&#148; perform
a duty. It is critical that whatever happens should come out of a true
partnership. I await the Minister&#146;s
comments.</div>
<a name="09032472000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000775"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> There is a bit of a misunderstanding. The
power that &#147;may&#148; enable an LEA to appoint two governors
is nothing knew. It is replicating an existing power under section 11
of the Learning and Skills Act 2000, which gave the Learning and Skills
Council the power to appoint up to two persons to be members of the
governing body of a further education sector institution in England.
Schedule 6 of this Bill gives that power to the SFA to appoint to
governing bodies of FE colleges.</div>
<a name="09032472000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are not
singling out sixth-form colleges and it is for the local authority to
decide how it should use the powers. It does not require the local
education authority to appoint a governor to the governing body of a
sixth form. It could be used, if it were used at all, in a number of
circumstances. It could build and bring additional capacity to a
governing body if the local authority identified the need for
particular expertise&#151;say in finance or building. However, as the
hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole said, it is important that
it is done in the spirit of partnership and that the power provides the
means for that partnership to exist.</div>
<a name="09032472000708"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000776"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b><b class="B"> </b>Does the LSC routinely appoint two
governors, and does the Minister expect LEAs to do
so?</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column545" />Column number: 545</div><a name="09032472000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000777"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b><b class="B"> </b>The LSC&#146;s power has never been
used in respect of sixth-form colleges, although I understand that
there have been instances where such colleges have requested support.
None the less, that power is there, and we have replicated that power,
as the hon. Gentleman said, with the
SFA.</div><a name="09032472000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000778"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> My amendment was meant to be a probing one, but I
am becoming increasingly concerned. We are saying that the power has
never been used, that we are building into a new law a power that was
passed previously but never acted on, and now we are building into the
changed structure. That is a bit curious, is it
not?</div><a name="09032472000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000779"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I disagree. We are looking at local
authorities taking a strategic role, and looking across all the
provision, be it in a school sixth form or a sixth-form college. I do
not think that it is unreasonable for either the sixth-form sector or
the FE sector to do that. We are talking about two governors, which
will have a minor impact on the membership of a governing body. It is
certainly not the intention for a local authority to take control of a
sixth-form college that is an independent institution; it would not be
able to do so. The measure is not related to the intervention process
that is set out in section 56E in any way. We should also remember that
any governor appointed has a collective responsibility and owes a duty
to the governing body, not to the local authority. As I said, they are
not new powers, but elements of existing relationships that sixth-form
colleges have with the LSC. On that basis, I ask the hon. Gentleman to
withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="09032472000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000780"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> That was an odd response. We are discussing powers
that have never been used and a power that the Minister does not expect
to be used, yet we are putting it into law. My instinct about such laws
is that they should probably be struck from the statute book. Do we not
have all kinds of laws that are never implemented? One wonders why the
Government want to perpetuate that kind of legal inactivity.
Legislative inaction is not a good basis on which to frame what we do.
I am doubtful about all that; clearly, the sixth-form college sector
itself&#151;from the representations that we have received, which I
amplified in my few brief words&#151;is doubtful about it. But as I
do not want to delay the Committee further, even though I am not
entirely satisfied with what we have heard, I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09032472000079"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000782"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b><b class="B"> </b>The purpose of the new clause is to try to
keep tabs on and minimise the quantity of material, guidance, circulars
and lever-arch files that are sent by the Department for Children,
Schools and Families to sixth-form colleges. The wording mirrors an
amendment tabled by my late noble Friend Baroness Blatch in another
place during the passage of the Education Act
2002.</div><a name="09032472000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
the Secretary of State is considering issuing guidance or any other
circular, he or she should have regard, first, to the desirability of
providing information about good educational practice, while taking
into account the professional expertise of college staff. He or she
should take into account the benefits that are expected to result from
issuing the guidance, the undesirability of sending excessive material
to colleges and the imposition of excessive administrative burdens. The
problem with all the material that is sent is that it may or may not be
useful, but to determine whether it is, the principal must read it all.
As I tour schools&#151;the same amendment could be applied to
schools, frankly&#151;I see the insecurity of many teachers when they
glance at their supply cupboard and see an unopened lever-arched file
that was sent six months earlier by the DCSF. It can undermine the
confidence of teachers if too much material is sent. It is far better
to keep the material succinct, short and infrequent, just conveying the
key imperatives of Government policy for raising standards. We
researched the quantity of information sent to schools and it amounted
to as much text as the complete works of Shakespeare&#151;sent every
year to schools in this country.</div>
<a name="09032472000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000783"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> My hon. Friend is saying that schools receive a
volume of instruction or diktat that is equivalent to the works of
Shakespeare, when students do not get a chance to learn Shakespeare. Is
that the gist of it?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column547" />Column number: 547</div><a name="09032472000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000784"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> My hon. Friend makes a valid point. Too often in
English literature lessons students do not devour the whole play but
only excerpts from it and worksheets are used. It is a pity that in too
many schools that is how Shakespeare is
taught.</div>
<a name="09032472000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a
serious new clause because the bureaucratic burden imposed on schools
and colleges is a major issue raised with hon. Members&#151;it
certainly is with me when I visit schools around the country. It would
be good to hear the Minister&#146;s reaction to this new clause and
what she intends to do as a Minister in the Department for Children,
Schools and Families about trying to reduce this
burden.</div><a name="09032472000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000785"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I agree with the sentiments behind the new clause;
I do not think anybody could fail to, certainly not when we hear
reports from schools about the excessive burden on them. I have a faint
concern that we will just be generating more paperwork and more
reports, and perhaps losing focus on what we are all trying to do, by
the time we get a full report of that in Parliament.</div>
<a name="09032472000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Apart from
growing like Topsy, it is important to think how to cut bureaucracy and
the administrative burden so that all our educational establishments
can concentrate on those things on which they are meant to focus. I am
also concerned that the excessive amount of paperwork means that
important messages can be missed. It is the classic communication
problem that when a lot of information is buzzing around, something
important can be overlooked. I have great sympathy with everything in
the new clause, but I am not sure about its practical
implications.</div>
<a name="09032472000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The schedule
clearly makes the point that the Secretary of State will give authority
for new sixth-form provision. Backtracking to clause 122, as I
understand it that authority is taken away from local authorities. I
seek clarification from the Minister on that. Let us suppose that a
reorganisation of schools leads an authority to move to 11-to-16
schools and sixth-form colleges, having previously had all-through
schools. As I understand it, the local authority would put its plan
together and submit it to the Secretary of State. How would that be
different from the way in which an authority tackles that situation
now?</div><a name="09032472000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000786"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> As we are having a general debate about the
schedule, I want to add amplification on the status of sixth-form
colleges. They are anxious that they will be treated in their
governance more like schools than colleges. Their existing relationship
with the FE college sector is significant and valuable, leading to an
exchange of ideas and expertise across FE and sixth-form colleges; it
reflects what they do. As I said, many sixth-form colleges have a wide
brief, dealing with a range of learners. There is a concern, which has
been expressed to the Committee&#151;certainly to its Opposition
members&#151;that the Bill changes some of that. It is important that
the Minister puts on the record that the Government remain committed to
sixth-form colleges&#146; independence and ability to respond to
their local communities in a creative, innovative way that is free from
unnecessary diktat. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I see that the
Minister for Schools and Learners has
arrived.</div><a name="09032472000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">Reducing
the bureaucratic burden on schools, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Bognor Regis and Littlehampton so eloquently argued, is essential if we

<div class="Column"><a name="Column548" />Column number: 548</div>are to free teachers to devote their time, energy and efforts to the
interests of learners, rather than dancing to the tune of politicians
and bureaucrats.</div>
<a name="09032472000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000787"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b><b class="B"> </b>I, too, am in favour of any action
that reduces bureaucracy in the FE system and allows sixth-form
colleges and local authorities to get on with the important business of
meeting the country&#146;s challenges for learning. Therefore, I am
sympathetic to the intention behind new clause 6. However, we are
making significant headway in reducing bureaucracy without needing
further legislation. Significantly, most publications are no longer
sent to principals and chairs of governing bodies, but are available
online. We use our electronic FE newsletter and many representative
bodies to alert college staff to key documents. Of course, effective
communication is dependent on the quality and presentation of the
content.</div><a name="09032472000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
sector-led FE communications gateway panel has developed clear
guidelines on producing effective publications, and it acknowledges the
improvement in the drafts that it now receives from DCSF and the
Learning and Skills Council. The bureaucracy reduction group has the
key strategic role to scrutinise and challenge any aspects of policy
implementation that result in excessive material or administrative
burdens. For example, it has successfully challenged the Government on
the burdens of Train to Gain documentation. It will challenge DIUS and
DCSF on the implications for colleges&#146; day-to-day work of
establishing the Skills Funding Agency and the Young People&#146;s
Learning Agency, but we know that we can do
more.</div><a name="09032472000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
the establishment of the YPLA and the transfer of responsibility for
16-to-19 provision to local authorities, we have an opportunity to
streamline communications further while encouraging the sector to
challenge where necessary. Both DIUS and the DCSF will
ensure that the SFA and the YPLA submit their draft publications, such
as funding guidance, to the panel. In addition, the establishment of
the YPLA will draw on the work of the information authority, which was
established to set and regulate standards. Using IT and sharing
data effectively will be central to the core functions of
the YPLA and its work with partners in the 16-to-19 system.</div>
<a name="09032472000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Merits
Committee has reviewed the cumulative impact of statutory instruments
on schools. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Schools and Learners
has made commitments to work towards a school commencement
date of 1 September to review lead times, with a view to ensuring that
there is a one-term lead time for statutory instruments that directly
affect schools in 2010, and to continue improving the accessibility of
communications to schools, website rationalisation and the clarity of
bi-weekly e-mail and, possibly, to provide a single web portal for
schools.</div>
<a name="09032472000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000788"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I am most interested. The &#147;bureaucracy
reduction group&#148; has an Orwellian ring; it is like the ministry
of truth. But the Government would not need a ministry of
truth if they mainly told it, would they? Who is on this bureaucracy
reduction group? What is its budget? How many staff does it

take up the designation. They can remain as they are if they wish. The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000794"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Thank you, Mrs. Humble. We come to one of
the more interesting parts of the Bill. Some people outside this place
have suggested that the Bill has been pulled together by the Government
from a rag-bag of policy odds and ends that have been hanging around
for some time, to create a sense that the Government have some momentum
in education, rather a sense of a Government in their last year who are
perhaps running out of momentum and direction in education. However, I
think that that is not entirely fair, because two important parts to
the Bill&#151;parts 7 and 8&#151;are both important and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column551" />Column number: 551</div>controversial. Those parts have attracted a large number of
amendments&#151;some 200&#151;about half of which were tabled by
the two Opposition parties, with the Government tabling about 100,
which may be a comment on something. We will reflect on what that
something is
later.</div><a name="09032472000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000795"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Is the hon. Gentleman not being unfair in
criticising the Government for being at the end of their period in
office and running out of steam when they have created, according to
the Minister, a single portal for schools, website clarification and,
of course, the bureaucracy reduction
group?</div><a name="09032472000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000796"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Yes, perhaps I am, or perhaps those outside this
place are being unfair and not giving the bureaucracy taskforce the
credit that it deserves. We look forward to receiving the
Minister&#146;s letter to find out how much credit it
deserves.</div><a name="09032472000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule
9 introduces the Ofqual part of the debate. With your tolerance and
willingness, Mrs. Humble, you will understand that it will
be sensible for me to make some opening comments on why this part of
the Bill and amendments 50, 51 and so on are so important. They touch
on the schedule that makes provision for the constitution and
governance of Ofqual, which are matters of fundamental importance. It
is necessary to reflect on the reasons why Ofqual has come into
existence, why it is so important that that body is seen to be properly
independent of Ministers, and whether the terms in which that
independence is framed are adequate for the job that Ministers require
Ofqual to do. I assume that you will want us, Mrs. Humble,
to have a schedule 9 stand part debate as part of the debate on the
amendments, though obviously you will indicate if you are not happy
with
that.</div><a name="09032472000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
emphasise the importance of schedule 9. I have been responsible for my
party&#146;s education portfolio for the past couple of years, and it
has become obvious to me that one of the problems in discussing
education policy is that it is very difficult to get any sense of
agreement among the individuals and groups that have an interest in
education policy, even on what has happened to standards in the past 10
or 20 years. The Government are entitled to point to statistics
indicating that there has been some improvement in
examination results, particularly in the past decade, but others,
including academic researchers, suggest that, if anything, standards
have declined, and that young people, including those who go on to
universities, are not as well educated as in the
past. There are a great many anecdotal reports of universities and
other bodies instituting additional catch-up courses for new students
to compensate for the educational standards that, according to those
institutions, prevail
today.</div><a name="09032472000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have responded in some ways to such concerns by introducing
schedule 9, which is so important in determining the governance and
independence of Ofqual. When the Secretary of State for Children,
Schools and Families announced the establishment of Ofqual at the
Labour party conference in September 2007, he acknowledged
the scale of the problem with which the Government, through this
schedule, are trying to deal. He
said:</div><a name="09032472000618"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
have not managed to persuade the public, parents and employers about
the standards of exams. The more I&#146;ve looked at this the more
I&#146;ve concluded that there are...problems that require
reform.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column552" />Column number: 552</div><a name="09032472000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">He then announced that a
new body would be responsible for the oversight of standards and that
it would be properly independent from the Government and seek to end
the annual debate and uncertainty about exam standards, which usually
occurs around August and September, when many of the most important
exam results are
announced.</div><a name="09032472000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is a great pity that in pulling those proposals and measures together,
the Government have ignored some of the advice from the relevant Select
Committee and elsewhere that reflects the debate on educational
standards, as well as what has happened to those standards and the need
for more objective reporting of them. We will obviously discuss that
issue when we debate clause 125, but it is worth reflecting upon
present concerns, both in and outside Parliament, about the degree of
autonomy that Ofqual will have, which relates directly to
schedule 9.</div>
<a name="09032472000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Secretary
of State gave a number of undertakings on Second Reading. He suggested
initially that Ofqual would be an independent regulator of standards;
we will return to the meaning of that later. He sounded some alarm
bells, however, when he spoke of the Government&#146;s view of the
nature of Ofqual&#146;s independence and of their expectations of the
new body. He
said:</div><a name="09032472000619"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
have to get away from this ridiculous, damaging and draining debate
about dumbing down, when, whenever standards go up and teachers and
young people have worked hard, some politicians and commentators jump
up and say, &#145;This must be because standards have been dumbed
down.&#146; That is not fair, and it is not right. Rather than my
making such assurances about standards, it will be much better when
Ofqual, the independent regulator, makes such assurances to the public
and to families.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 23 February
2009; Vol. 488, c.
27.]</div><a name="09032472000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Secretary of State did not say that Ofqual was going to be an
independent commentator that would often criticise the Government and
comment upon standards that might have declined. Whether he meant to
say it or not, what he actually said was that it would be Ofqual that
would give assurances about standards each year. That betrays the
Government&#146;s intentions in setting up the new body. Ofqual has
not been made as independent as it should be, as we will show in our
amendments. There is still a great deal of potential for the Secretary
of State to influence it and there are concerns about how it will carry
out its responsibilities. We will come on to that, too,
later.</div>
<a name="09032472000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000797"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I am listening very carefully to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s excellent introduction to the amendments. I do not
believe that the cause of concern is just that one-off statement in the
House by the Secretary of State. All the subsequent letters we have
received from Ministers confirm my view that establishing Ofqual is
actually about public relations and telling the public that standards
are high, rather than ensuring that standards are high. That is our
principal concern about the way Ofqual has been
established.</div><a name="09032472000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000798"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman. It is interesting
to note that in the September 2007 interview with the Secretary of
State in <i class="I">The Daily Telegraph</i><i class="I"> </i>in which the announcement
was trailed, the right hon. Gentleman was very explicit about a loss of
confidence among the public regarding standards. However, I noticed
that when the Minister for Schools and Learners gave his evidence to
the Committee a couple of weeks ago, he was very clear that there had
been no dumbing-down at all and that standards were as high as they had
ever been.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column553" />Column number: 553</div><a name="09032472000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
dangerous for Ministers to set up a body that is charged with ensuring
confidence in standards and to then pre-empt the conclusions of that
body. To be fair to the Secretary of State, on Second Reading, after he
made those comments about Ofqual giving assurances about standards each
year, he said that he was</div>
<a name="09032472000620"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;not going to
second-guess its work. That is Ofqual&#146;s remit and
responsibility, and it should get on with that
work.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 23 February 2009; Vol.
488, c.
27.]</div><a name="09032472000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">unhindered&#151;my
word, not the Secretary of State&#146;s. We will reflect on that as
we discuss the amendments to schedule 9.</div>
<a name="09032472000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s attitude to Ofqual is important; the way that
Ofqual discharges its responsibilities is also important. Early
indications of how it has operated since it was established in shadow
mode are not entirely reassuring. When we took evidence from Kathleen
Tattersall a few weeks ago, we encountered great reticence about
commenting on the standards debate over examination results in the last
10 or 20 years. That does not indicate that Ofqual will build the
reputation for impartiality that is necessary to its gaining the
confidence of the public and education professionals.</div>
<a name="09032472000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee
should consider also the comments that Ofqual made during and just
after the utter shambles of marking key stage 2 and key stage 3 tests
last year. It was very quick to say that, on the basis of the evidence
it had seen, the quality of marking was at least as good as in previous
years. That comment was made before the recent report on the number of
reviews of key stage 2 and key stage 3 test results, which
showed not only an explosion in the number of appeals against the
marking of those tests, but a very high level of the appeals being
upheld. The combination of a quadrupling of appeals with a very high
rate of upholding those appeals indicates to me that there were
question marks about the quality of marking last year. It makes me
nervous that Ofqual should be so quick to jump to conclusions before
even seeing the results of the appeals process.</div>
<a name="09032472000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
arguing for a far more independent educational standards
authority&#151;one that is not only capable of regulating the
existing approved qualifications, but able and empowered to make
judgments about standards that do not rely only on looking at the
existing qualifications themselves. We know that that is an important
ongoing debate because we have the comments of Mike Cresswell and
others from the Assessment and Qualifications Alliance about the risk
there will be to the credibility of standards when the new modular
GCSEs come in. He suggests that results are likely to improve because
of the introduction of modular GCSEs in a way that is not related to
the underlying standards. If we do not get Ofqual and the basis for its
independence correct now, we will have problems in the
future.</div>
<a name="09032472000710"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div><a name="09032472000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I mentioned, schedule 9 deals with the constitution of Ofqual and
touches on its independence. We are disappointed that the opportunity
has not been taken to give more independence to Ofqual in the way that
key staff members are selected, in how it operates, and in questions of
accountability. There has been an increasing amount of debate in this
place over the past five or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column554" />Column number: 554</div>10 years about the important role that Select Committees
should play in holding bodies such as Ofqual to account. However,
schedule 9 and part 7 miss a number of opportunities to introduce that
accountability, not only to the Secretary of State, but to a
cross-party Select Committee that might help to preserve a greater
element of independence in the way that Ofqual discharges its
responsibilities.</div>
<a name="09032472000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">As briefly as
possible, I would like to go through some of the amendments to schedule
9 tabled in my name and those of my hon. Friends the Members for
Bristol, West and for Mid-Dorset and North Poole. If the hon. Member
for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton will allow me, to save time I would
also like to indicate those amendments tabled by him that we
particularly support, as well as a couple that appear to cut against
our argument in favour of a greater degree of independence.</div>
<a name="09032472000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 50
would remove the power of the Secretary of State directly to appoint
the seven to 12 ordinary members of the Ofqual board. There must be a
serious concern about how independent we can expect the board of Ofqual
to be if it is appointed entirely, or almost entirely, by the Secretary
of State. There is a strong argument for Crown appointments to the
Ofqual board, in order to try and institutionalise a greater degree of
independence in the way that members of the body are chosen. The
individuals on the board, the chief executive and the way that Ofqual
discharges its responsibilities will make all the difference to whether
the body is an effective monitor of standards or a lapdog of the
Secretary of State on a tight leash. It is vital to ensure that we have
a process that properly selects members to be on the board of
Ofqual.</div>
<a name="09032472000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 51
would remove the power of the Secretary of State directly to appoint
the deputy chair of Ofqual; instead, it would place that power with the
ordinary members of the Ofqual board. It is not obvious why the
Secretary of State should take it upon himself not only to have powers
in relation to the chair, the chief executive and the ordinary members
of Ofqual, but to dictate and determine who is the deputy chair. Those
are important appointments and we think that a greater degree of
independence should prevail.</div>
<a name="09032472000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 52
would remove the power of the Secretary of State to dismiss the deputy
chair of Ofqual; it would instead place that power with the ordinary
members of the Ofqual board. At the moment, schedule 9 gives the
Secretary of State power to remove the deputy chair of Ofqual if he
thinks that that is appropriate. That seems an extraordinarily
far-ranging power to give the Secretary of State. The power is poorly
defined and surely unnecessary if Ofqual is to be genuinely independent
of the Government in the way that the Secretary of State indicated when
he first made the announcement in September 2007 and when he repeated
his undertakings about independence in the House of Commons on Second
Reading.</div>
<a name="09032472000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 53
would remove the power of the Secretary of State to dismiss the
ordinary members of the Ofqual board and place that power with the
fellow members of the Ofqual board. The Bill as drafted gives powers to
the Secretary of State to remove members of the Ofqual board if they
are unfit to carry out their responsibilities or if they are absent. It
seems very odd indeed that the Secretary of State should have to get
involved in circumstances where a board member is absent for a
prolonged period. It seems entirely sensible that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column555" />Column number: 555</div>Ofqual board itself should deal with that. There also seems to be no
reason why the Ofqual board cannot carry out a policing responsibility
in relation to the fitness of members of the board to discharge their
responsibilities.</div>
<a name="09032472000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 54
would allow Ofqual the power to appoint its own chief executive, rather
than have that individual chosen by the Secretary of State. Clearly, if
Ofqual is to be regarded as an independent body, that is a
fundamentally important power. At the moment, the fear is
that the Secretary of State will use many of the powers set out in
schedule 9 to select people who are likely to have a particular view in
the standards debate and who are likely to echo the type of complacency
about standards that we have heard from Ministers in general over the
past few
years.</div><a name="09032472000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
our view, it is vital that the individuals who are on the Ofqual board
and the key officers of Ofqual, including the chief executive, should
be as independent and as independent-minded as possible. Even if the
individuals who are selected are independent-minded, there is a serious
concern that if the Secretary of State takes to himself these powers,
which we have discussed in relation to earlier amendments, to dismiss
individuals in the rather cavalier and light-touch way that is allowed
for in schedule 9, it might restrict the willingness of the individuals
on the board and the senior officers to act in a way that is as
independent and as impartial as we would
want.</div><a name="09032472000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
55 would allow Ofqual the power to set conditions of service for its
own first chief executive, rather than have them dictated by the
Secretary of State. Again, if the Secretary of State really wants
Ofqual to be seen to be an independent body and to manage its own
affairs, as he indicated on Second Reading, it is astonishing that he
should take to himself powers in these
areas.</div><a name="09032472000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
57 would remove the power to approve the appointment and conditions of
Ofqual chief executives from the Secretary of State and give it to the
Children, Schools and Families Committee. That comes back to the point
I made earlier about the importance of having mechanisms of
accountability in this place that do not simply rely on the political
leadership of the Department, which potentially has incentives to put
pressure on Ofqual to say the right things and be consistent
with what the Government are saying about the standards
debate.</div><a name="09032472000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that amendment 58 has not only our support, but potentially that
of the interim chair of Ofqual herself. It would take the power to
approve the number of staff members at Ofqual, their conditions of
service and their remuneration away from the Secretary of State and
give that line of accountability to the Children, Schools and Families
Committee. If Ofqual is to be as independent as the Secretary of State
suggested only a few weeks ago in the House, it is extraordinary that
paragraph 6(5) of schedule 9 gives the Secretary of State the power to
approve</div><a name="09032472000621"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
number of members of staff of Ofqual...their conditions of
service&#148;</div>
<a name="09032472000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">and</div>
<a name="09032472000622"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the amount of
remuneration, allowances and expenses paid to
them.&#148;</div><a name="09032472000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the note that was sent to the Committee before the evidence session
with Kathleen Tattersall, Ofqual
said:</div><a name="09032472000623"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Bill sets out a role for the Secretary of State in the set up and
appointment processes for Ofqual, for example in relation to the
appointment of the ordinary members... I understand that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column556" />Column number: 556</div>the proposed Ministerial involvement in appointments is in line with
arrangements for many other regulators, although I would expect the
Chair of Ofqual to be fully consulted. In my view the requirement for
Ministerial approval of such matters as numbers of staff and terms and
conditions (Schedule 9, paragraph 6(5)) is more
questionable.&#148;</div><a name="09032472000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ofqual
is clearly concerned about the powers in the schedule that insist on
the Secretary of State&#146;s approval even for matters such as the
number of staff and their terms and conditions. That suggests a degree
of micro-management that is surely not
necessary.</div><a name="09032472000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
59 would remove the duty on Ofqual to review its committees every five
years. It would be sensible of Ofqual to review its committees and to
do other things relatively regularly, but it is beyond me why the
Secretary of State should use the Bill to direct and micro-manage
Ofqual in quite that way. That suggests an unwillingness on the part of
the Secretary of State to accept that this body will be properly
independent.</div><a name="09032472000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will touch on a couple of the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for
Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. We support amendments 385 and 420,
which would make more explicit the duty to maintain the standard of
regulated qualification. We will come back to that issue under clause
125. We also support amendments 416 and 417, which deal with openness
on pay and pensions. Although we want Ofqual to have the flexibility
and freedom to determine its own priorities, it should be held publicly
accountable on some of these key issues and it must be transparent.
Recently, there has been evidence of great profligacy in the public
sector over the levels of pay and pensions. I am not talking only about
this
place.</div><a name="09032472000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton might expect from my
earlier comments, we have less sympathy with amendments 418 and 415.
Amendment 418 would give the Secretary of State the power to appoint
the head of Ofqual and amendment 415 would allow the
Secretary of State to sack the chief executive of Ofqual on the basis
that it is appropriate to do so. Just as it is wrong that the deputy at
Ofqual can be dismissed in such a cavalier way, it would be dangerous
to accept amendment 415. It would be dangerous to give the Secretary of
State the power to get rid of the chief executive of Ofqual when the
chief executive might say things that are not in favour of the
Secretary of State or criticise the Government&#146;s activities in
relation to standards and the dumbing-down
debate.</div><a name="09032472000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have serious concerns about whether the Government are delivering on
their promise that Ofqual will have genuine independence and be
accountable to Parliament rather than just to the Secretary of State.
We fear that unless some changes are made, there is a serious risk that
from day one Ofqual will be seen to be not fully independent and
autonomous. It will therefore not secure the reputation that it needs
for the debate on standards to be resolved in the way that we all
want.</div><a name="09032472000711"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000799"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> It is a pleasure to follow the clear exposition by
the hon. Member for Yeovil of the Liberal Democrat position regarding
Ofqual in general and schedule 9 in particular. I agreed with some of
his comments and I am pleased he agreed with some, although not all, of
our amendments.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column557" />Column number: 557</div><a name="09032472000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 124 and
schedule 9 would establish the Office of Qualifications and
Examinations Regulation. We have long advocated making the regulatory
side of the QCA independent. My right hon. Friend the Member for Witney
(Mr. Cameron) said when he was shadow Education
Secretary:</div>
<a name="09032472000624"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Reform
of the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority is one such positive
step. It is not acceptable that the QCA, the guardian of our exams, is
not independent of the Government.&#148;</div>
<a name="09032472000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
&#147;Government&#148;, we mean not just Ministers but all those
who are paid directly or indirectly by the taxpayer to produce and
administer exams or who are paid by the taxpayer to train our teachers
to teach pupils and students to pass exams. Essentially,
&#147;Government&#148; means all those who have control or strong
influence over the direction of education policy and who receive their
income from the state. In other words, Ofqual needs to be independent,
not just of the Department for Children, Schools and Families but the
education establishment, which by definition is as important in
determining the direction of education policy, the structure of our
assessment system and the variation in standards over the years as any
Government Minister.</div>
<a name="09032472000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sir Michael
Barber points out in his seminal book, &#147;Instruction to
Deliver&#148;:</div><a name="09032472000625"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Officials
in the Department tried desperately to
block&#148;</div><a name="09032472000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">the
announcement of a national literacy
strategy.</div><a name="09032472000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
went on to
say:</div><a name="09032472000626"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;While
the civil service was not party political, it was heavily influenced by
the various lobby groups who competed for influence in the Department
which thus tended to see issues from the producer
angle...Moreover, the lack of ambition which characterised the
education service as a whole inevitably affected the Department
too.&#148;</div><a name="09032472000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
that lack of ambition is combined with an ideological approach to
education that is Rousseauian in nature, child-centred in ideology,
equivocal about the acquisition of knowledge, hostile to rote learning
and testing&#151;all of which have increasingly dominated thinking in
the education establishment over the past half century&#151;one sees
the importance of ensuring the independence of Ofqual from that
education establishment. Leaving aside the ideology, it is clearly in
the interests of everyone in the education establishment for Ofqual to
pronounce that standards in exams are as high today as they were 10 or
20 years ago and to pronounce that exam standards in any given year are
as high as they were the previous year. They have a vested interest in
Ofqual asserting that view. All their work, their approach, and their
philosophy would be undermined if Ofqual were to say otherwise.
Ensuring that Ofqual is completely independent of the education
establishment and the producer interest is even more important than its
independence from the Minister for Schools and Learners, the
Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, and the
Secretary of State. There is no understanding of that point in the
drafting of the Bill.</div>
<a name="09032472000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">Over the past
few years a huge amount of independent academic research has
demonstrated that exam standards have fallen. Over the same period, the
regulatory wing of the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority has
consistently claimed that there has been no such decline, even while
others in the QCA have acknowledged widening access to those same
exams. Peter Tymms at CEM&#151;the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column558" />Column number: 558</div>centre for evaluation and monitoring&#151;at the University of Durham
has demonstrated that a student who obtained an E in A-level maths in
1998 would have been awarded a B in 2004. Duncan Lawson of the
University of Coventry tested students&#146; mathematical competence
on entry to university and found that those entering with a grade B in
2001 established a slightly lower level of competency in basic skills
than those entering with a grade N 10 years earlier. Professor Peter
Williams said in the <i class="I">Observer </i>in July
2007:</div><a name="09032472000627"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Over
20 or 30 years, I do not think there is any doubt whatsoever that
absolute A-level standards have fallen. They have edged south
continuously over a long period of time. I think all university
academics and a good proportion of sixth-form teachers would agree with
my
assertion.&#148;</div><a name="09032472000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
same <i class="I">Observer </i>article also cited a wider study carried out at
the centre for evaluation and monitoring in Durham. The article
said:</div><a name="09032472000628"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For
nearly two decades up to 50,000 pupils a year have taken the same
ability test before facing A-levels. Researchers found that, in most
subjects, pupils of the same ability achieved two grades higher in
their A-levels in 2006 than in 1988, jumping to three grades in
maths.&#148;</div><a name="09032472000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is the A-level information system, or ALIS, test, which CEM introduced
in 1983.</div>
<a name="09032472000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I could go on
and cite much more evidence, Mrs. Humble, but I will not try
your patience or that of the Committee. Although my hon. Friend the
Member for South Holland and The Deepings has departed from the
Committee for a short while, I do not wish to replace him in that
regard.</div><a name="09032472000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000800"></a>Jeff
Ennis:</b><b class="B"> </b>I know that this is one of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s main campaign themes, as it were, which he pursues
in the House on a regular basis. If we have had this grade inflation
over the years, can he explain to me why we have not had a similar
grade inflation for the degrees that are awarded at university? I ask
the question because it appears to me that, if the students are getting
worse by achieving lower A-levels or they are not rising to the same
academic standard at A-level, there would be a consequential knock-on
effect in the degrees that are awarded by our universities. I think
that the reverse has happened. We have also seen a certain amount of
inflation with degrees awarded by our universities, which seems to
underline the fact that students are getting better rather than
worse.</div><a name="09032472000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000801"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> A book that I regard as the set text on this subject
is &#147;The Schools We Need and Why We Don&#146;t Have
Them&#148; by E.D. Hirsch, who is an American academic and has a
chapter dealing with precisely that argument.</div>
<a name="09032472000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
the answer to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question is twofold. First, a
lot of universities are now implementing remedial classes for students,
even high-calibre students coming with very high grades and A-levels,
to bring them up to the level that they need to start their university
course. Secondly, I am afraid to say&#151;this is an issue that
really concerns Conservative members of the Committee&#151;that the
proportion of students from the independent sector taking places at
some of the top universities is increasing and that concerns us more
than anything else in this whole debate about education. It is not that
we have anything against the independent sector&#151;quite the
contrary&#151;but it is alarming that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column559" />Column number: 559</div>state sector is declining in the proportion of students from that sector
going to Oxford and Cambridge, despite huge efforts to counter any
possible prejudice that there might be in either of those
universities.</div><a name="09032472000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
concerns me is the response by Ofqual to the evidence that I was just
citing. Evidence has been around for a long time about a concern that
has been prevalent and, indeed, growing for many years. Ofqual was
informally established in early 2008, following an announcement by the
Secretary of State in September 2007. Before that, the regulatory
division of the QCA was responsible for regulating qualifications and
maintaining standards, ever since the QCA was established in 1997.
However, when the chairman of interim Ofqual, Kathleen Tattersall, was
questioned in an evidence session by my hon. Friend the Member for
Broxbourne, the following exchange took place. My hon. Friend
asked:</div><a name="09032472000629"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Does
Ofqual believe that there is grade inflation in A-levels and
GCSEs?&#148;</div><a name="09032472000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Kathleen
Tattersall
replied:</div><a name="09032472000630"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Ofqual
will take the evidence that it has and that comes to its attention to
make any pronouncement, one way or the other, on issues of that kind.
That is something that we have not particularly explored and I do not
think that it would be appropriate for me to come to a view without
full consideration of the
evidence.&#148;</div><a name="09032472000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why
is that something that Ofqual has &#147;not particularly
explored&#148;? When my hon. Friend asked if, in future, Ofqual would
be exploring that issue, he received another evasive answer from
Kathleen Tattersall, who
said:</div><a name="09032472000631"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;What
we will be doing as a regulator is looking at the evidence,
particularly where there are any issues of public concern. If that
issue is a matter of public concern, clearly we will be seeking
evidence on it, but there are a range of other issues where our
starting point would always be to look at the evidence and to come to a
considered judgment on the
evidence.&#148;</div><a name="09032472000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why
have the QCA and Ofqual not been looking at the evidence, including
that of Peter Williams, the Durham evidence, and that of Duncan Lawson,
Jonathan Ramsey and John Corner? What did Kathleen Tattersall mean when
she said:</div>
<a name="09032472000632"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
that issue is a matter of public
concern&#148;?</div><a name="09032472000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
challenged by my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke, her response
was:</div><a name="09032472000633"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Ofqual
has been set up to regulate the system, to get better public
accountability for the system, to ensure that there is a better public
understanding of the issues and to assure public confidence. That is
what regulators do. I do not think that it has been set up to address
any specific concerns, such as the one that was just
mentioned.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,

Q182-184.]</div><a name="09032472000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is depressing that she should say that Ofqual was not set up to assess
standards over time or to address public concerns over grade
inflations, but to ensure better public understanding of the issues and
to assure public confidence&#151;in other words to proselytise and to
persuade the public that all is well with the system, but not to take
evidence or examine whether standards have been
maintained.</div><a name="09032472000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
answers by the chairman of Ofqual were not a slip of the tongue. The
exact same use of words and phrases appears throughout her evidence in
response to questions about standards. They are carefully crafted,
rehearsed and considered replies, but there is one
slip:</div><a name="09032472000634"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;When
you asked me about looking at grade inflation, I should have said that
several studies that have been conducted over the years involving
international experts looking at our system have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column560" />Column number: 560</div>concluded that there is grade
inflation.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,

is still as I quoted it on 10 March. I am concerned by the
&#147;we&#148; in the Minister&#146;s response. Surely Kathleen
Tattersall could ask for <i class="I">Hansard </i>to be corrected&#151;not the
Minister or the Minister&#146;s officials? I am afraid that it is all
too cosy. There is a desperation not to admit to a decline in
standards. The chair of Ofqual refuses point blank to admit that there
has been grade inflation, despite masses of evidence to the contrary,
and refuses to admit that there is even public concern about grade
inflation. Ofqual has been in place sufficiently long for it to have
taken the evidence and pursued the issue, but it has done no such
thing. It seems to see its role as assuring the public and telling them
what the issues are, rather than listening to the public and being told
by them what the issues are. I do not believe that Ofqual as currently
configured will deliver consistent standards in our qualifications
system, because I do not believe that it considers that to be its role.
However, it should be, and to ensure that Ofqual does see that as its
role we need to amend its objectives, which is a debate for the next
clause.</div><a name="09032472000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
also need to ensure that the right people are appointed to the
board&#151;people who are independent of, rather than cosy with,
Government, and people who are independent of the education
establishments. Amendment 197 requires the board to have one member who
is a member of another regulatory body. We need to be sure that Ofqual
uses the same principles and approaches as other regulatory bodies,
including the same rigorous approach to data collection and analysis.
Amendment 198 requires the chief regulator and the chief executive to
be full-time positions. That is an additional safeguard to avoid
conflict and it also ensures that Ofqual&#146;s role is taken
seriously. It is not just a PR role; it is a huge job that requires
application to reverse the trends in our exam
system.</div><a name="09032472000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">It

must be no conflicts of interest, which is why amendment 40 amends

said:</div><a name="09032472000637"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Yes,

am pleased that the hon. Member for Yeovil supports that amendment,
because we might well test the Committee&#146;s opinion. It is
important that the legislation is clear that a key role of the chief
regulator is to ensure the standards of regulated qualifications are
maintained. The same additional grounds for removal from office are
added by amendment
420.</div><a name="09032472000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
417 seeks to introduce transparency into the payment of public

details of expense

418 and 419 change schedule 9 so that the Secretary of State appoints
not just the first chief executive of Ofqual, but subsequent ones.
Amendment 415 gives the Secretary of State the power to fire
the chief executive. Schedule 9 already gives the Secretary of State
power to remove the chief regulator, but we believe that the power
should extend to the chief executive as well. It is important in a
democracy that those held accountable to the public for manifesto
promises and for the quality of public services have powers to remove
senior people responsible for the delivery of those public services, if
they are not delivering what they should be, which is higher
standards.</div><a name="09032472000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ministers
should also have the power to appoint people to those positions. That

the grade boundaries or getting more pupils to achieve a pass or A
grade, the chief regulator would be perfectly within his right to
refuse and could well go public with the fact if such an attempt had
been made. However, it is important that the Secretary of State has the
power to remove people who are clearly not delivering the key objective
of maintaining standards in our exam
system.</div><a name="09032472000195"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000802"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s views,
although I do not agree. If he is not going to go on to discuss this,
does he feel that the Government ought to be micro-managing other
areas, such as the regularity 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column562" />Column number: 562</div>with which the committees are reviewed, the number of staff or their
terms and conditions? Or does he share some of the views expressed not
only by me but by Kathleen Tattersall in her note to the
Committee?</div><a name="09032472000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000803"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I am sympathetic to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point about the micro-detail, such as how often to review the committee
structure of Ofqual. If it is being held to account for its
performance, it needs to be given as much leeway as possible to carry
out its role. Having said that, there is a role for Ministers in
ensuring that such non-departmental public bodies do not empire-build
and expand the number of employees within their remit without recourse
to the Secretary of State who is, after all, responsible to Parliament
and the public for how our taxes are spent. It is important that a firm
grip is kept on the number of people
employed.</div><a name="09032472000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000804"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Is not that necessary oversight exercised through
budget
control?</div><a name="09032472000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000805"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Yes, but unless we keep a grip on all aspects that
lead to high budgets, the result can often be regarded as the bleeding
stump policy: &#147;Oh, Minister, we have to have a 5 per cent.
increase otherwise we shall have to sack 53 people.&#148; Keeping the
expenditure of such bodies under control is difficult and, of course,
we must have control over the headline cash figure for them. However,
to make sure that those cash figures are delivered, there is a case for
ensuring that the body count is kept under control,
too.</div><a name="09032472000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000806"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Is the hon. Gentleman not concerned that, if this
body is to be the independent assessor of standards that we want it to
be, it might wish at some stage to take on more responsibility for the
oversight of qualifications than was given to it originally by the
Government? That might imply an increase in the number of staff, even
within the budget envelope. If such powers continue to be exercisable,
would there not be a risk that a Secretary of State might interfere in
the number of staff if he or she did not wish the powers of oversight
to be exercised in that
way?</div><a name="09032472000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000807"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> We have to trust Ministers in a democracy to carry
out their role with
integrity.</div><a name="09032472000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000808"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Blimey, the hon. Gentleman is
confident.</div><a name="09032472000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000809"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Well, if Ministers were appointed from the
Conservative Benches, I am sure that they would have integrity.
Ministers are accountable to Parliament and to the
public.</div>
<a name="09032472000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000810"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give
way?</div><a name="09032472000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000811"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Perhaps the hon. Lady is about to shatter my
illusion about
Ministers.</div><a name="09032472000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000812"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I merely wanted the hon. Gentleman to
clarify that he was not suggesting that it was only Conservative
Ministers who have integrity.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column563" />Column number: 563</div><a name="09032472000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000813"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Of course not. My jocular response to the
intervention was not intended to imply such matters. I was merely
saying that Ministers appointed from the Conservative Benches certainly
would have
integrity.</div><a name="09032472000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
believe in creating a regulatory body that is genuinely independent.
However, from observing the words of Ofqual since its establishment in
2008 and the activities of and views expressed by the quasi-independent
regulatory arm of the QCA since its establishment in 1997, it is clear
that more of the same approach will not serve to deliver higher or
consistent standards. We need a fresh approach that divorces the
regulator from those with vested producer interests so that we can all
be sure that a genuine, independent regulator will not allow standards
to continue a downward drift. The amendments would go some way to
helping change Ofqual into such a body and I hope that the Minister
will accept them.</div>
<a name="09032472000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000814"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> One thing on which we can all agree is the
importance of an independent regulator so, hopefully, we can start from
that premise. The difference of opinion is over how that independence
is demonstrated. I am a little concerned by some of the arguments from
the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, which seem to
suggest that, if the regulator does not say that standards have fallen,
she cannot possibly be
independent.</div><a name="09032472000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000815"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> It was not just that comment, but the fact that the
regulator has not seen it as her role yet to pursue any of the evidence
that has been around for many years and nor did the previous QCA
regulatory body. That is what worries me. I was also worried by the
fact that she said &#147;if this is a concern&#148;, when clearly
the newspapers report massive public concern about such matters
daily.</div>
<a name="09032472000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000816"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> If we promoted Government policy on the
basis of what we see in the newspaper each day, we would not be in a
very good
position.</div><a name="09032472000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important to point out that there is no conclusive evidence. I
accept that there have been reviews, such as those to which the hon.
Gentleman referred, but most subject reviews have found that standards
have been maintained. I wish to refer back to the report quoted by
Peter Tymms. It said:</div>
<a name="09032472000640"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;From
this perspective, it is either not really possible to say whether
standards have been maintained, or, so far as one can say, the evidence
suggests that they have
been.&#148;</div><a name="09032472000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
was probably the point that Kathleen Tattersall was trying to make. I
am not trying to speak on her behalf and I would not dream of doing so.
However, the inference that I took from the report was that much of the
evidence is conflicting and mostly inconclusive. One of Ofqual&#146;s
new roles will be to take on the rolling programme to which the hon.
Gentleman referred. It has a clear remit to ensure that standards are
maintained.</div>
<a name="09032472000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000817"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> The Minister spoke about maintenance of standards.
Will she clarify what she means by that? She will be aware that Mike
Creswell has already gone on the record saying that when the modular
GCSE is introduced, he expects there to be a consequential improvement
in GCSE results. In order to keep standards constant, does the Minister
expect there to be a change in the borderlining of grades so that the
percentage of students in each cohort getting A, B and C grades remains
roughly the same?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column564" />Column number: 564</div><a name="09032472000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000818"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> That is a matter for Ofqual. I accept Mike
Creswell&#146;s point, but we have to wait until we get the evidence
rather than acting on what people think might happen. It would be
unwise for us to go forward saying, &#147;Because he believes that
that could be a result of a new modular
GCSE&#148;.</div><a name="09032472000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000819"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Kathleen Tattersall&#146;s evidence made it clear
that she had an expectation that if a change in an exam improved
results, there should be change in the grade boundaries to ensure that
the same proportion of students were getting grades A, B and C as
before. That is a really important issue in the standards debate. Does
the Minister, therefore, agree with Ofqual on that
point?</div><a name="09032472000713"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.42
pm</div><a name="09032472000216"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Sitting

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000820"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> To repeat to the answer that I gave to the
previous question asked by the hon. Member for Yeovil, if his
hypothetical example comes to pass it will be for Ofqual to decide and
regulate. We have given Ofqual the powers to do that under the Bill,
and it would be within its remit to do
so.</div><a name="09032472000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000821"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> But the Minister must have a view about whether
Ofqual&#146;s duty to maintain standards means that, if a
qualification changes and there is an improvement in the results as a
consequence of that change, there should be an adjustment so that the
standards remain the same. She must have a view on whether there should
not be an adjustment and the results should be allowed to improve or
whether standards should be kept level by adjusting the grade
boundaries. Ofqual will not be able to do its job unless it knows what
Minister means by &#147;maintaining
standards&#148;.</div><a name="09032472000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000822"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> It is quite clear what that means. We are
looking at consistency over time. Ofqual&#146;s remit is to have
consistency over
time.</div><a name="09032472000221"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000823"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Of
what?</div><a name="09032472000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000824"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Of maintaining the standard that has been
reached. That is the purpose of Ofqual as the regulator. I am not
convinced that we are getting anywhere with this exchange, so I shall
move
on.</div><a name="09032472000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to pick up on the point about Ofqual only saying that standards
have been maintained. With interim Ofqual, most of the subject reviews
have found that standards have been maintained. In one or two cases
where there have been problems, interim Ofqual has not shirked from
coming out and saying so and I have no reason to believe that Ofqual,
as constituted, will shirk from doing that. It would be in
nobody&#146;s interests, least of all the Government&#146;s, for
Ofqual not to be independent and to demonstrate that it is independent;
if it were not independent it would lose all credibility. Ofqual will
have to report to Parliament and account for the reports that it
makes.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column565" />Column number: 565</div><a name="09032472000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will now
move on to a group of amendments&#151;all of which, unsurprisingly,
we will resist&#151;that relate to provisions in schedule 9 about the
organisation and structure of Ofqual and the appointment and conditions
of service of its members and staff. Amendments 50 to 53 relate to the
mechanisms for appointing members of Ofqual. The Secretary of
State&#146;s interest in appointing Ofqual members and the deputy
chair reflects the importance of those roles.</div>
<a name="09032472000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Secretary
of State will want to ensure that the best possible appointments are
made to lead an organisation that will play a key part in the education
sector. However, the public appointment process will be regulated by
the Commissioner for Public Appointments to ensure independence and
transparency. We are talking about getting the best people for the job
and, once they have been appointed, their reporting line being clearly
to Parliament, not to Ministers. Amendment 50 is not feasible, because
I do not think that the Crown can appoint lots of members to bodies
such as this&#151;apart from anything else, there is a problem of
volume. The Secretary of State is the most appropriate person to do the
appointing; it is neither realistic nor desirable for the Crown to do
it.</div><a name="09032472000715"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div><a name="09032472000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment 51, Ofqual&#146;s deputy chair will play a vital
role&#151;not least because if the chief regulator is absent for a
period, the deputy will assume those duties. Again, the Secretary of
State&#146;s interest in appointing the deputy reflects the
importance of the post. The amendment, which proposes that the ordinary
members of Ofqual should elect their deputy, would not be
appropriate.</div>
<a name="09032472000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendments
52 and 53, given that it is right for the Secretary of State to appoint
Ofqual&#146;s ordinary members and deputy chair, it should also be
for the Secretary of State to have the powers in the schedule that
relate to dismissal. There cannot be one person appointing and another
dismissing. We reject the proposals in amendments 52 and 53 that
ordinary members should be able to remove the deputy chair and ordinary
members.</div><a name="09032472000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
530 is intended to clarify that the Secretary of State&#146;s power
to remove a person under the clause refers to his power to remove them
from the office of deputy. The amendment is not necessary as that is
already the effect of the clause. The Secretary of State&#146;s power
to remove an ordinary member from office is found in subsection (5) of
the clause and subsection (4) relates only to the office of
deputy.</div><a name="09032472000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
529 would make the appointment of the chief regulator subject to the
approval of Parliament by requiring the appointment to be made by means
of a statutory instrument that either House could annul. The chief
regulator will be appointed by Her Majesty by Order in Council, which
reflects the independence and importance of the role.</div>
<a name="09032472000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">The chief
regulator will be the chair and public face of Ofqual. It is essential
that the operation of the qualifications system is effective and that
the chief regulator is credible and respected. A fair and transparent
appointment process is an important start if that is to be achieved.
Two things will help with that. First, the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column566" />Column number: 566</div>Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments recently extended its
remit to cover non-ministerial departments, which we intend will
include Ofqual. The OCPA monitors and reports on public appointments,
which enables people to have confidence in the appointments
process.</div>
<a name="09032472000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
last year, the Government introduced pre-appointment hearings by Select
Committees for key public appointments. That enables Select Committees
to take evidence from candidates for certain public appointments before
they are appointed. The Government have announced that, subject to the
passage of the Bill, the chief regulator is one of the key public
appointments that will be subject to pre-appointment hearings and
therefore to scrutiny by the relevant Select Committee. This will help
the Select Committee to gain confidence in what will be a key
appointment for
them.</div><a name="09032472000232"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09032472000825"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Charles Walker</b> (Broxbourne) (Con): Will a panel of
candidates be shown to the Select Committee or will it purely be the
candidate that the Secretary of State wishes to appoint who will appear
before the Select
Committee?</div><a name="09032472000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000826"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I cannot answer that question off the top of
my head, but I will endeavour to find out for the hon.
Gentleman.</div>
<a name="09032472000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any new
candidate for the role will in future face scrutiny under these
pre-appointment hearing arrangements. Those two factors&#151;the OCPA
regulation and the pre-appointment hearings&#151;should give everyone
confidence in the independence and transparency of the appointment of
the chief regulator. For that reason, the Government reject that
amendment.</div><a name="09032472000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000827"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I have may have missed the point, but will Kathleen
Tattersall go before the Select Committee for her appointment to be
confirmed, given that she is now chair of interim Ofqual and not of
Ofqual as set out in the
legislation?</div><a name="09032472000236"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000828"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> No, Kathleen Tattersall is in post. The
chief regulator to succeed her that will go through that
process.</div><a name="09032472000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
385 would add failure to ensure the standards of regulated
qualifications is maintained to the grounds for removal. That amendment
is not necessary because paragraph 3(7) already states that
the</div>
<a name="09032472000641"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;chief regulator
can be removed because of inability or unfitness to carry out the
duties of
office&#148;.</div><a name="09032472000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
Ofqual fails to maintain the standards of regulated qualifications
because of any inability or unfitness on behalf of the chief regulator,
the chief regulator can be
removed.</div><a name="09032472000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000829"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> The hon. Lady makes an important point. I am
interested in what she has to say, bearing in mind Pepper <i class="I">v.</i>
Hart. My interpretation of paragraph 3(7)(a) is that not performing the
job well would not be sufficient reason for the removal of the chief
regulator. To me, it suggests some other form of unfitness to do the
job. Will she confirm that if standards are perceived to decline or do
decline, that will be grounds for removal under that
paragraph?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000830"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> One of the main objectives of Ofqual is the
maintenance of standards. If it is felt that the chief regulator has
not fulfilled the objectives of Ofqual, that would be a consideration
in deciding whether they should be removed from
office.</div><a name="09032472000241"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000831"></a>Mr.

Opposition amendments&#151;perhaps understandably&#151;but does the
hon. Lady agree that the intention behind the words that the hon.

ambiguous?
An</div><a name="09032472000642"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;inability
or unfitness to carry out the duties of
office&#148;</div><a name="09032472000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">almost

quality of the job that is being done. Will she reflect on whether the

this paragraph clearer and
firmer?</div><a name="09032472000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000832"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000833"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I was not necessarily suggesting that medical
unfitness would be the only grounds, but the words
&#147;inability&#148; and &#147;unfitness&#148; suggest a basic
problem with an individual doing a job, rather than the quality of the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000834"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I disagree about the degree of ambiguity
because the duties of office are the duty objectives that have been set
out. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton raised the
example of the maintenance of standards. Meeting the standards
objective is one of the main duties of Ofqual and of the chief

approval.</div><a name="09032472000253"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000837"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> The Minister says that there is no need to put the
publication of remuneration in the legislation. Does that mean that she
intends that terms and conditions, annual salaries, expenses and
pension contributions will be published in the annual
report?</div><a name="09032472000254"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000838"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I am not sure whether it will go in the
annual report, but Ofqual will be subject to audit by the National
Audit Office. It will have to produce accounts, and my memory of most
organisation&#146;s accounts suggests that that has to be stated in
broad terms.</div>
<a name="09032472000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000839"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Is it not standard procedure that even if something
is within particular bands, the amounts of the salaries and pension
entitlements of senior individuals in organisations such as this would
be included in the annual report?</div>
<a name="09032472000256"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000840"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I am not saying that it will not be
included. My point is that I envisage other mechanisms being used to
ensure the accountability mentioned in the amendment, rather than it
being in the Bill.</div>
<a name="09032472000257"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000841"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I am still not clear about whether that information
will be included in the annual accounts. One of our prime roles in this
place is to maintain and look after tax revenues and ensure that they
are spent properly. Neither I nor the hon. Member for Yeovil have been
able to get the answer to a simple question: will the annual salary and
pension contributions of the chief regulator and the chief executive be
included in the annual report of
Ofqual?</div><a name="09032472000258"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000842"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I cannot answer that question at the moment,
but I will get back to the hon. Gentlemen on the matter. I intend
Ofqual to be as transparent, visible and accountable as we want it to
be. Certainly in respect of the annual accounts, National Audit Office
guidelines will be used as to what is published and
audited.</div>
<a name="09032472000259"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000843"></a>Bill
Wiggin:</b> My understanding is that if a Minister says in
Committee that something should be so, any judge who later looks at the
musings of the Committee will try to take the Minister&#146;s
decision as part of the judgment. Therefore, if she says that those
figures will be published, it is highly likely that that will happen.
Why will she not say that?</div>
<a name="09032472000260"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000844"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I said that we intend Ofqual to be as
visible, transparent and accountable as all of us wish it to be. I do
not intend to go into detail at this stage. We will look further into
what is in the annual report and refer back to the matter as we
progress further with the legislation.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column569" />Column number: 569</div><a name="09032472000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 420
is about the removal of ordinary members. It is similar to amendment
385 and seeks to state in the Bill that ordinary members can be removed
from office by the Secretary of State on the grounds of</div>
<a name="09032472000646"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;failure to
ensure the standard of regulated qualifications is

unfitness to carry out the duties of

same argument as the one I made earlier applies.</div>
<a name="09032472000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
40, 197 and 198 propose restrictions on the appointment of Ofqual
members. It goes without saying that we need Ofqual to have top-notch
people with a mix of the necessary skills and experience and the fibre
to act independently and take the flack that will no doubt come their
way. We must ensure that Ofqual membership attracts the best possible
candidates. Ofqual members will need a wide range of experience and
expertise to ensure and account to Parliament that Ofqual is a well-run
organisation that meets its objectives and responds well to all those,
including employers, higher education institutions, schools and
colleges, that rely on it to do its job thoroughly and
effectively.</div>
<a name="09032472000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can tell
the hon. Member for Leominster that salary and pensions contributions
will be included in the annual accounts. I do not know whether that
goes forward to the annual report, but annual accounts are a matter of
public record.</div>
<a name="09032472000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">Appointments
will be made by the Secretary of State to ensure that the best possible
candidates are chosen. As I said earlier, the public appointment
process will be regulated by the OCPA to ensure independence and
transparency. If we are to have the best possible candidates, I do not
want the Bill to narrow down the field. Amendment 197
proposes that one of the members of Ofqual should be a member of
another regulatory body. I do not think that we should go down that
route. Does Ofqual need to work closely with fellow regulators in the
UK and overseas&#151;with Ofsted and other regulators? Absolutely, of
course it does. Does that mean that we need to write something into the
membership provisions? No, I do not think that it
does.</div>
<a name="09032472000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000845"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000846"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Not to my knowledge, but I will find out.
Amendment 198 proposes that the chair and chief executive must be
full-time positions. Again, we do not need legislation on that. Will
the posts be demanding, high-profile, key leadership roles in the
education sector? Yes, of course they will. Will the posts be
full-time? The chief executive position is pretty much bound
to be and the post of chief regulator may well be too, but, again, I am
not sure that we need it in
legislation.</div><a name="09032472000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000847"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> The Minister says that the post of chief executive
is &#147;pretty much bound to be&#148;, which is not
quite a cast iron assurance. Will it be a full-time
position?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000848"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I certainly envisage it being a full-time
position, but I do not think that it is necessary to put that in the
Bill.</div>
<a name="09032472000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 40
proposes that ordinary Ofqual
members</div><a name="09032472000648"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;must
not have financial or other occupational interests that might be
regarded as constituting a conflict of interest with that of promoting
the objectives of
Ofqual.&#148;</div><a name="09032472000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not entirely clear what the amendment is intended to achieve. It
would clearly be inappropriate to appoint anyone directly connected to
an awarding body that Ofqual would be regulating, but I do not think
the amendment is about that. I cannot see who else would have a
conflict of interest serious enough to bar them from membership. Ofqual
will have procedures to manage conflicts of interest over specific
issues. I do not accept that there is any professional who would have
an interest that would conflict with maintaining standards or
confidence in exams and assessments. What matters most to head
teachers, like the rest of us, is that confidence in the system is high
because of robust regulation, so their students get the results and
credit they deserve for their achievements.</div>
<a name="09032472000273"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000849"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Can the hon. Lady not understand that if someone who
runs a school and is judged on the exam results of pupils were also a
member of Ofqual, it would theoretically be in their interest to allow
standards to decline, so the school&#146;s results would rise by more
than the standard of education provided there would normally
demonstrate? It is a clear and obvious conflict of
interest.</div>
<a name="09032472000274"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000850"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> It sounds a little convoluted to me. The
Bill provisions are consistent with provisions for the membership of
the Higher Education Funding Council for England and Ofsted. Indeed,
there are several vice-chancellors on the board of the HEFCE, which has
a role in funding teaching and research in universities and colleges.
The HEFCE has successfully managed any conflict of interest, but the
important thing is the essential expertise that those individuals
bring. We need Ofqual members who bring a range of experience and
expertise.</div>
<a name="09032472000275"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000851"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Does the hon. Lady think that it would be right for
a serving bank board member to be on the board of the Financial
Services Authority?</div>
<a name="09032472000276"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000852"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> We are talking about a different
issue.</div>
<a name="09032472000277"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000853"></a>Mr.

regulation.</div>
<a name="09032472000278"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000854"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I accept that it is regulation but, in this
instance, I think it important that Ofqual has the flexibility to have
a range of expertise. I do not want to impose restrictions and say that
it cannot bring people in because they were head
teachers.</div>
<a name="09032472000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000855"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> But does the FSA not need expertise as well? It has
to go out and employ somebody from the City of London, who has to
abandon all their interests in a bank or financial institution. Should
the hon. Lady not ensure that any board member of Ofqual is not a
serving professor of education in a teacher training college or a
serving head teacher?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column571" />Column number: 571</div><a name="09032472000280"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000856"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I think that this case is different. The two
cases cannot be compared. Ofqual&#146;s conflict of interest rules
will cover it. I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman and his FSA and
banking analogy.</div>
<a name="09032472000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments 54
and 55 propose that Ofqual rather than the Secretary of State should
appoint Ofqual&#146;s first chief executive and determine his or her
conditions of service. On the other hand, amendments 418 and 419
propose that the Secretary of State should appoint all future Ofqual
chief executives, not just the first. There is provision in the Bill
for the Secretary of State to appoint the first chief executive because
we have a chicken and egg situation. Ofqual will need a chief executive
on day one to lead on the set-up of the organisation and ensure that it
hits the ground running. Indeed, we will do our best to ensure that the
chief executive is in the post before day one as part of a shadow
arrangement, again so that Ofqual can get off to the best possible
start. However, Ofqual itself will not exist at that stage; there will
be no formally appointed Ofqual members, so they cannot appoint of the
first chief executive. What we will need is for the Secretary of State
to appoint on the first occasion, looking to Kathleen Tattersall, as
the chair of interim Ofqual, to play a leading role in the appointment.
Future chief executives should of course be appointed by Ofqual rather
than the Secretary of State, and their conditions of service will be
decided by
Ofqual.</div><a name="09032472000282"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000857"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Did the Government consider any other options for
the appointment of that individual the first time round? Did they
consider any role that Parliament, through the Select Committee, might
play?</div>
<a name="09032472000283"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000858"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> As I said, the important thing is that we
need to get the chief executive in as soon as possible, which is why we
have taken the route we have&#151;that the Secretary of State
appoints the first chief
executive.</div><a name="09032472000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
415 proposes that the Secretary of State should have the power to
remove the chief executive, but that is neither necessary nor
appropriate. Ofqual should have the power to both appoint and remove
the chief executive. The conditions of service are set by the Secretary
of State for the first chief executive, while Ofqual will be able to do
that for future chief
executives.</div><a name="09032472000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are two amendments that propose a role for the Select Committee on
Children, Schools and Families in the appointment of staff. They refer
specifically to that Committee, even though Ofqual&#146;s role is
also of interest to the Select Committee on Innovation, Universities,
Science and Skills. The Children, Schools and Families Committee is
appointed by the House of Commons to examine the administration,
expenditure and policy of the Department for Children, Schools and
Families, including the work of non-departmental public bodies and
Ofsted. Amendment 57 proposes that the appointment and conditions of
service of Ofqual chief executives after the first appointment should
be subject to the approval of the Select Committee rather than the
Secretary of State. Amendment 58 proposes that the number of Ofqual
staff, their conditions of service and the amount of remuneration
allowances and expenses of staff should be subject to the approval of
the Select
Committee.</div><a name="09032472000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is not in dispute that Ofqual needs to report to Parliament and that
the Select Committees will have a key role in holding Ofqual to
account. In relation to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column572" />Column number: 572</div>new appointments to the post of chief regulator, as we have already
said, the Select Committee will hold pre-appointment hearings, but
constitutionally, I do not think that we can have Select
Committees&#151;part of the legislature&#151;making appointments to
the staff and boards of parts of the
Executive.</div><a name="09032472000287"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000859"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I understand the Minister&#146;s concerns on the
last point, although I do not agree with them. In relation to clause
58, which she probably has just dealt with, will she comment on the
views and concerns expressed by Ofqual itself to the Committee?
Kathleen Tattersall said in her note to the Committee
that</div><a name="09032472000649"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
my view requirement for Ministerial approval of such matters as numbers
of staff and terms and conditions ... is ...
questionable.&#148;</div><a name="09032472000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">Have
the Government rejected those
concerns?</div><a name="09032472000289"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000860"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Of course we have listened to Kathleen
Tattersall&#146;s concerns, but it is standard practice for
non-ministerial Government departments to have the conditions of
service of its staff and their numbers and approved by a Minister.
Having reflected, we agreed that that should be the case
here.</div><a name="09032472000290"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000861"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Given that the Department is already exercising
budget control and oversight, what is the reason for not allowing
Ofqual to determine its own numbers of staff within that budget
constraint?</div><a name="09032472000291"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000862"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> It is because of the duty that we, as
Ministers, have, to ensure that we meet our budgetary constraints, and
our responsibility for overall numbers in the civil
service.</div><a name="09032472000292"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000863"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> The Minister said that part of the concern is in
discharging the budget constraint responsibilities, but that is already
in place. I am not suggesting that Ofqual should be allowed to set its
own budget, merely that once the budget is fixed, it should be for
Ofqual to determine the number of staff in the
budget.</div><a name="09032472000293"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000864"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> But we come back to the point about the
overall civil service numbers. I was interested in the remarks that the
hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton made and the interesting
exchange between him and the hon. Member for Yeovil on that
point.</div>
<a name="09032472000294"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000865"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> The Minister has been extremely patient with us, but
will she explain why, if the Government have overall budget control, it
is important for them to determine the number of staff employed with
the budget? Is it not a potential mechanism through which the present
or a future Government could seek to interfere in how Ofqual chooses to
discharge its oversight responsibilities on
standards?</div>
<a name="09032472000295"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000866"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> No, I disagree. It is an important
ministerial tool, and it is standard practice in relation to all
non-ministerial Government departments. We are not singling Ofqual out
for that treatment, and I do not see any reason to treat Ofqual any
differently from any non-ministerial Government department.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column573" />Column number: 573</div><a name="09032472000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 56
refers to line 24 and a &#147;sub-paragraph (5)&#148; of
schedule 9. I am confused, because line 24 corresponds with paragraph
7(5) of schedule 9. Since the hon. Gentleman and colleagues have tabled
a separate amendment, amendment 59, to remove
paragraph 7(6), I hope that I am correct in assuming that
the intention of amendment 56 is to remove paragraph 7(5). I
am sure that he will correct me if I am
wrong.</div>
<a name="09032472000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
7(5) allows Ofqual to arrange for the payment of remuneration,
allowances and expenses to any person who is a member of an Ofqual
committee but is not a member of Ofqual or Ofqual staff. That is a
standard activity for organisations such as Ofqual, and Ofqual requires
the power to remunerate or pay allowances or expenses to persons who
may serve on its committees but are not members of its staff. Under
paragraph 7(4), Ofqual&#146;s committees must include one member of
Ofqual or Ofqual staff, and they may also include external persons.
They may be necessary to provide expertise to the committee and so
improve its effectiveness. It is reasonable that Ofqual should have the
power to remunerate these persons and pay allowances and expenses when
it considers that appropriate.</div>
<a name="09032472000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 59
would remove the requirement for Ofqual to review at least once in any
five-year period the structure of its committees and the scope of each
committee&#146;s activities. The requirement will ensure that Ofqual
follows good practice in reviewing its committees, and paragraph 7(6)
does not compel Ofqual to change the structure, scope or activities of
its committees; it simply sets a maximum length of time that can pass
without reviewing those aspects. Ofqual remains entirely independent
regarding how it establishes its committees and their scope.</div>
<a name="09032472000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">In reality,
we believe that Ofqual, like any similar organisation, would wish to
review the structure and scope of its committees more frequently than
is envisaged in paragraph 7(6) and (7). Reviewing its committees is
clearly good practice for an organisation of Ofqual&#146;s nature,
but we have introduced the measure to ensure that Ofqual fulfils the
minimum expectation. We do not consider it burdensome or think that it
affects Ofqual&#146;s independence, and, with that, I invite the hon.
Gentleman to consider withdrawing the
amendment.</div>
<a name="09032472000300"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000867"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I was disappointed by the Minister&#146;s response
and, in particular, by her clear lack of understanding in what she
said. I was also disappointed by the Government&#146;s lack of
understanding about independence, given how the Bill is drafted. Ofqual
should be independent not just of exam boards but of anybody who has a
vested interest: for example, those preparing children to take the
tests, or the education faculties of the universities, which have a
vested interest in demonstrating that exam standards have not fallen in
circumstances in which they have, if the education system adopts
practices advocated by those faculties. If we are to trust the exam
system and it is to provide an objective assessment of the
effectiveness of the policies that those faculties advocate, we must
ensure that they are not represented on the board of Ofqual.</div>
<a name="09032472000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was also
disappointed by the Minister&#146;s response to the issue raised in
amendment 385 about dismissing the chief regulator in circumstances in
which standards in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column574" />Column number: 574</div>the exam system have not been maintained. I do not accept her argument
that paragraph 3(7)(a), which deals with</div>
<a name="09032472000650"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;inability or
unfitness to carry out the duties of
office&#148;,</div><a name="09032472000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">covers
it and can be used to dismiss a chief regulator in circumstances where
exam standards have clearly fallen. Under most ordinary interpretations
of that phrase, people would, as the hon. Member for Yeovil said,
regard it as being akin to a decision on the grounds of medical or
other reasons of unfitness to carry out a particular job, not one based
on how well that job has been carried out. There is no other method of
dismissal. Paragraph 3 (7)(b) deals
with</div><a name="09032472000651"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;absence
from Ofqual&#146;s meetings for a continuous period of more than 6
months&#148;.</div><a name="09032472000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
therefore seek permission to press for the Committee&#146;s opinion
on amendment 385, which will add to schedule 9 further
grounds for dismissal of the chief regulator in circumstances where the
standards of regulated qualifications have not been
maintained.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000868"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for responding in
detail to the amendments to schedule 9 and for her willingness to allow
us to cross-question her on some of those matters. She has shown
herself to be as patient as the Minister for Schools and Learners on
these occasions, which is very much appreciated.</div>
<a name="09032472000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like the hon.
Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, however, I was disappointed,
although not entirely surprised, by the fact that all the amendments
were rejected by the Minister. In particular, we are still concerned
about schedule 9 and the extent to which the Secretary of State is
exercising powers to appoint and sack key members of the regulator. We
are concerned about the lack of imagination in the accountability of
the body to Ministers, rather than to Parliament. We are also concerned
about the extraordinary powers to micro-manage in the Bill, even down
to the extent and regularity with which Ofqual must examine the
structure of its own committees and the number of staff that it is
allowed to employ.</div>
<a name="09032472000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
sympathetic to the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis
and Littlehampton, which proposes a more explicit duty to maintain
standards. Returning to the points that were made about
schedule 9(3)(7) on page 191 and the chief
regulator&#146;s removal from office. The grounds for such removal
are</div><a name="09032472000652"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;absence
from Ofqual&#146;s meetings for a continuous period of more than 6
months without Ofqual&#146;s
permission.&#148;</div><a name="09032472000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is an ambiguous phrase about &#147;inability or unfitness&#148; to
carry out the duties of office. Most people would take those words to
relate either to some core issue of competence or, more likely, to some
sort of judgment about the individual&#146;s medical or other
circumstances. There is not, as might be expected when legislating for
a new body, a clear insistence that success in upholding standards,
which is supposed to be the purpose of Ofqual, should be a key measure
in deciding whether or not the chief regulator should be removed from
office. I am happy to support the hon. Gentleman in his amendment if he
decides to press it to a Division.</div>
<a name="09032472000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate
that there are small, fundamental differences on the extent to which
accountability should be to the Secretary of State, rather than to some
other body, and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column575" />Column number: 575</div>the way in which individuals are selected for, and dismissed from, these
posts. It is clear that there are differences on that point, not only
with the Minister, but with the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton. I should like to reflect on what the Minister has said
on those points and consider whether we will raise our concerns on
those issues at a later stage in our proceedings.</div>
<a name="09032472000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like
highlight our concerns and disappointment, as expressed in two of our
the amendments which reflect the fact that there is an excessive desire
by the Government to micro-manage the new body. Amendment
58, which takes the power to approve the number of staff members and
their terms and conditions of service and so forth away from the
Secretary of State. We could argue about whether the Children, Schools
and Families Committee is the correct Committee to have oversight. The
Minister indicated that some of the responsibilities might be joint
departmental ones. However, I draw the Minister&#146;s attention to
the fact that even Kathleen Tattersall is concerned that the extent of
the powers is excessive. I repeat that, in her note to the Committee,
she
said:</div><a name="09032472000653"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
my view the requirement for Ministerial approval of such matters as
numbers of staff and terms and conditions... is more
questionable.&#148;</div><a name="09032472000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have had a number of exchanges on the issue, and I am grateful to the
Minister for her willingness to respond to so many interventions, but I
am not entirely convinced by the Government&#146;s
argument.</div><a name="09032472000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister began by saying that the budget was somehow a relevant factor
in causing the Government to want the powers, but nobody was suggesting
that budget control should be undermined in any way. The issue, having
set the budget, is whether it is reasonable for Ministers to interfere
in issues such as how many staff are employed. I am concerned, because
I hope&#151;we will look at this in detail in clause 125&#151;that,
in the future, Ofqual will be more independent from the Government than
it is at
present.</div><a name="09032472000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ofqual
may also decide to take on new responsibilities to discharge its
functions in relation to standards. I will not anticipate our arguments
on clause 125 but, in her evidence to the Committee, the Minister
herself said that such new responsibilities would be possible. If
future Governments have the power to cap staff numbers, they may well
seek greater oversight and use those powers to constrain the extent to
which Ofqual develops its functions. Future Governments could, for
example, employ more staff to carry out sample testing of particular
cohorts to make an assessment of changes in standards over time and the
relationship to changes in exam standards. Although that may seem to be
a narrow point, it is quite important, so we may return to it later and
frame the amendment more
carefully.</div><a name="09032472000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
I am concerned about micro-management, which is why we tabled amendment
59, which would remove the duty on Ofqual to review its committees
every five years. The fact Ministers believe it necessary to prescribe
in legislation the regularity with which Ofqual has to review its
committees suggests a very low level of confidence in the individuals
and chief executive who will oversee such reviews. If the Government
are going to be that detailed in micro-managing Ofqual, heaven knows
what other duties and regulations they might want to impose through the
Bill, even though such measures might seem like common sense to some 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column576" />Column number: 576</div>individuals. As a small indication of our desire to make Ofqual more
independent, it is my intention to press amendment 59 to a
Division.</div><a name="09032472000314"></a>

other than the chief executive (whose conditions of service are already
dealt with by paragraph 6(1) to
(3)).</i></div><a name="09032472000340"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000889"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
Government amendments 498 and 499, 437 to 439, 441, 451, 464, 467, 446,
452, 482, 486 to 489, 500, 495 and
509.</div><a name="09032472000341"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000890"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> You read out the amendments very eloquently,
Mrs. Humble. I appreciate that there is a lot to take in,
but most of the amendments are technical. They derive from our review
of the Bill to ensure that it delivers precisely and unambiguously what
we wanted and that its measures are fully consistent.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column577" />Column number: 577</div><a name="09032472000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendments 437 and 438 ensure that Ofqual must recognise an awarding
body or accredit its qualification when the relevant criteria are met,
but must not otherwise do so. As drafted at the moment, the wording
could imply that Ofqual has the power to recognise or accredit when the
relevant criteria are not met, which was never our intention.
Government amendments 439 and 441 make it clear that it is for Ofqual
to decide when its criteria for recognition and accreditation and its
general conditions come into force. That will allow Ofqual to manage
the introduction of new qualifications effectively and give awarding
bodies the time that they need to prepare for changes in
the requirements.</div>
<a name="09032472000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment 451 ensures that if Ofqual revises its accreditation
criteria, awarding bodies will have to comply with the new criteria. In
those circumstances, an accreditation will cease on a date specified by
Ofqual unless Ofqual says otherwise. That will mean that the awarding
body will have to go back to Ofqual to seek a new accreditation, which
will allow Ofqual to manage revisions to criteria in an orderly way. In
practice, that is how the arrangements work at the moment.
Additionally, Ofqual can make saving or transitional provisions to
prevent any harm to those studying for a qualification that ceases to
be
accredited.</div><a name="09032472000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendments 478 to 480 are technical amendments to ensure that Ofqual
must publish on its register details of each individual form
of a qualification that an awarding body awards, not just
the types of qualification that it awards. Government
amendments 464 and 467 ensure that Ofqual&#146;s criteria
in relation to guided learning hours need not come into force
immediately, mirroring the position for its other
criteria.</div><a name="09032472000345"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000891"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Will the Minister explain why it is necessary for
guided learning hours to be included in the Bill, and are therefore
necessary to amend the provisions relating to them? What is the purpose
of having guided hours in the
legislation?</div><a name="09032472000346"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000892"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Off the top of my head, it is because guided
learning hours are part of achieving the qualification.
However, if there is an additional answer, I will get back to the hon.
Gentleman.</div>
<a name="09032472000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendments 497 and 498 eliminate unnecessary duplication in the
provisions relating to the conditions of service of Ofqual&#146;s
chief executive and other members of staff,
thereby eliminating any possible ambiguity about how the conditions are
set. Government amendment 499 is one of a number of drafting
changes to ensure that the Bill is consistent in how it
refers to itself in conjunction with other 
Acts.</div><a name="09032472000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment 446 refers to clauses 132 and 134, which say that in certain
specific and limited circumstances, Ofqual can set a
condition on an awarding body allowing Ofqual to enter premises to
inspect or copy documents. Clause 134(3) confirms that inspecting
documents includes inspecting records kept on computers. The amendment
substitutes improved wording so that the meaning of the provision is
crystal clear.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column578" />Column number: 578</div><a name="09032472000718"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000893"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b><b class="B"> </b>On amendment 446, why does the Minister feel
it necessary for Ofqual to have the entry and inspection powers to
enter awarding bodies&#146; premises and look at their computer
records?</div>
<a name="09032472000350"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000894"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Because if Ofqual has a condition allowing
it to enter premises to inspect or copy documents, it must surely
include documents and records kept on a
computer.</div><a name="09032472000351"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000895"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> What level of notice will Ofqual be required to
provide to the agency whose premises it is inspecting or
entering?</div><a name="09032472000352"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000896"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> That relates to clause 134. We will get to
that when we get there.</div>
<a name="09032472000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment 452 deals purely with a drafting point and will allow us to
bring one bit of the Bill into line with another. Amendment 482 is a
technical amendment intended to ensure that the relevant provisions for
the withdrawal of recognition apply fully to the situation in which the
body is recognised to award or authenticate credits in respect of
components of qualifications, rather than full qualifications.
Similarly, Government amendments 486 to 489 are all technical.
Government amendments 486 and 489 clarify that where the Bill makes
provision about joint working with other public bodies for the
performance by Ofqual of its qualifications functions, the intention is
to catch the performance of any of those functions, and not necessarily
the performance of all of them. Government amendments 487
and 488 tighten up the drafting so as to be clear that Ofqual is not,
strictly speaking, a qualifications regulator, as defined in clause
149(2)(a).</div><a name="09032472000354"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000897"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> The fact that the Minister does not regard Ofqual as
a qualifications regulator was clear from the last debate. If it is not
a qualifications regulator, what is
it?</div><a name="09032472000355"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000898"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> We have to return to Ofqual&#146;s
objectives under clause 125, which sets out exactly what it is. The
amendments are technical. It is not as per the precise definition in
clause 125, but when we get to that clause, we can discuss
Ofqual&#146;s objectives. Then we can deal with the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s
point.</div>
<a name="09032472000356"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000899"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am rather baffled by this exchange about the
purpose of Ofqual. It is a rather basic point. Is this a qualifications
regulator, a standards regulator or something
else?</div><a name="09032472000357"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000900"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> This is a technical point about a precise
definition. Obviously, Ofqual is a regulator of our qualifications
system. As I understand it, the amendment will tighten up a technical
matter, and certainly does not mean that we do not think that Ofqual is
a regulator of our qualifications system&#151;the clue is in the
title really.</div>
<a name="09032472000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 495
will make the Bill easier to read and reproduces the definition of
&#147;public authority&#148; in full, rather than making the reader
cross-refer to the definition 10 pages away in clause 148. Amendment
500 addresses a minor issue over the drafting of schedule 11 dealing
with the QCDA and mirrors amendment 498 for Ofqual. Amendment 509, like
amendment 482, is a technical amendment intended to ensure that the
relevant provisions over the withdrawal of recognition apply fully to
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column579" />Column number: 579</div>situation where the body is recognised to award, or authenticate,
credits in respect of components of qualifications.</div>
<a name="09032472000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most of the
amendments are purely technical and, where there are material changes,
those changes are not great. I hope that, on the basis of that
explanation, hon. Members will agree that the 23 amendments be made to
the Bill.</div>
<a name="09032472000360"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000901"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I had not intended to rise, other than to ask the
questions I have already asked during my interventions. However, I am
afraid to say that the answers given by the Minister, and the
explanations given for the amendments, were wholly lacking on three of
the amendments. I am concerned about the tabling of 23 Government
amendments together in one huge debate. In particular, I was concerned
about the flippant response to the question from my hon. Friend the
Member for Broxbourne about the notice period given for inspections for
entry into companies&#146; premises. Those powers are important and
to not know the notice period, and then to flippantly say &#147;a
reasonable notice&#148;, is not acceptable. To quote from the
explanatory note:</div>
<a name="09032472000654"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
amendment clarifies that Ofqual may set an &#145;entry and inspection
condition&#146; that allows a person authorised by Ofqual to inspect
and copy electronic records in the same way as a person would be able
to do if authorised under section 58 of the Education Act
2005.&#148;</div>
<a name="09032472000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">I asked the
Minister what the purpose of that power was; why was it needed? I do
not just mean, why were new powers needed to examine electronic
records? The purpose of the question was to ask, why are those powers
to go into people&#146;s premises to inspect their records necessary
for Ofqual, when we are talking about it regulating
qualifications?</div>
<a name="09032472000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">We then come
to Government amendment 464, which talks about guiding learning hours.
The Minister was not able to explain why it was necessary to have them
in the Bill. I know that we will come to that in clause 139, but this
is an amendment to clause 139 and I expected the Minister to have a
clear understanding of why we should have guided learning hours in
legislation. Is she telling professionals how many hours are needed to
teach a particular qualification? Is it the intention of the Government
to say that, for example, 50 hours is needed for a particular module of
a particular GCSE? That is something that should be left to the
professionalism of teachers.</div>
<a name="09032472000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Government
amendment 487, we are told in the explanatory statement that it
clarifies that</div>
<a name="09032472000655"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Ofqual itself
is not a &#145;qualifications
regulator&#146;&#148;.</div><a name="09032472000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
has baffled members of the Committee, including the hon. Member for
Yeovil, because I thought that the precise purpose of this part of the
Bill was to establish a qualifications regulator. Again, I was not very
happy with the Minister&#146;s response. Will she have another
attempt at answering those questions? If not, then I do not feel
comfortable in allowing those three Government amendments to go through
untested.</div><a name="09032472000365"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000902"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> As regards to the guided learning hours,
that relates to raising the participation age, as agreed in the
Education and Skills Act 2008. That creates a duty on young people
above compulsory school age, but under-18, to participate in education
or training. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column580" />Column number: 580</div>When people who are under-18 are in full-time employment, the duty in
the Act requires them to undertake sufficient relevant education or
training, which is defined as the equivalent of 280 hours a year. To
facilitate that, the Act placed a duty on the QCA, as regulator, to
assign guided learning hours to qualifications. That is the
reason why those powers are being passed on to
Ofqual.</div>
<a name="09032472000366"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000903"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Will the Minister confirm that it does not apply to
qualifications applicable to those under the age of
16?</div><a name="09032472000367"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000904"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Regarding the powers to enter premises, they
are needed to allow Ofqual to investigate whether awarding bodies are
maintaining standards and whether fees should be capped. That is the
reason why the power to inspect documents is there. We will set out a
code of practice on how the powers should be used, which will define
what is a reasonable period of notice.</div>
<a name="09032472000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">The technical
point is that clause 149 sets out the power to provide information to
other qualifications regulators. Of course Ofqual is a qualifications
regulator, but the definition in the clause is for regulators elsewhere
in the UK. Subsection (2)(b) defines the term purely for the purpose of
the clause. I hope that that satisfies the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="09032472000369"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000905"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I am still not entirely satisfied by the
Minister&#146;s response on amendment 487, although I am
happy with her responses on the other two amendments. The explanatory
statement for amendment 487
states:</div><a name="09032472000656"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
amendment and amendment 488 are technically drafting
amendments, clarifying that Ofqual itself is not a
&#145;qualifications regulator&#146; within the meaning given to
that term by clause

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000925"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> For those who are keen to make rapid progress, that
list of amendments suggests that clause 125 is another part
of the Bill with which we have serious concerns that we want to raise
this evening. Indeed, it is arguably even more important in its impact
on Ofqual&#146;s role as well as its governance and independence than
schedule 9 and clause 124. Clause 125 addresses the crucial objectives
that it must meet as a regulator, and subsection (1) sets out those
objectives, which
are:</div><a name="09032472000658"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(a)
the qualifications standards
objective,</div><a name="09032472000659"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
the assessments standards
objective,</div><a name="09032472000660"></a><div class="hs_brev">(c)
the public confidence
objective,</div><a name="09032472000661"></a><div class="hs_brev">(d)
the awareness objective,
and</div><a name="09032472000662"></a><div class="hs_brev">(e) the
efficiency objective.&#148;</div>
<a name="09032472000429"></a><div class="hs_Para">With all
those objectives, one would have thought that the Government would have
covered the main concerns relating to the standards that could be
expected of a body such as Ofqual. Unfortunately, they have not set the
right objectives for Ofqual and, in particular, they have defined too
narrowly Ofqual&#146;s role in assessing standards. It is for that
reason that we do not believe that Ofqual, in its existing form, will
be successful in doing what the Secretary of State seems to want and
ending the annual debate about standards in British examinations and
dumbing down.</div>
<a name="09032472000430"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we have
said on other occasions, we are particularly disappointed that the
Government have not addressed many of the criticisms of standards set
out in the excellent report by the Select Committee on Children,
Schools and Families, entitled &#147;Testing and Assessment&#148;.
The Committee was clear about the potential variation between the
apparent education standards that are highlighted by the regulated
qualifications that we have in this country and the underlying measures
of educational performance, standards and effectiveness. In
paragraph 250, the Committee concluded
that</div><a name="09032472000663"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
Government has failed to address the issue of the standards themselves.
In the context of the current testing system, with its ever-changing
curriculum and endless test reforms, no regulator, however independent,
can assure assessment standards as they are not capable of accurate
measurement using the data available. Until the Government allows for
standardised sample testing for monitoring purposes, the regulator will
be left without the tools required to fulfil its primary
function.&#148;</div><a name="09032472000431"></a><div class="hs_Para">Essentially,
the Committee argued that because examination standards and the nature
of examinations had changed so much over time, and because of the
pressure of comparability brought about by test reform, the targets set
by the Government and the different assessment standards used at
different times, it was impossible to use one examination, or even a
number of examinations, to form an objective assessment of standards
over time or at any point in time. It is because of the fundamental
uncertainty in the public&#146;s mind, and in the debate on education
standards about whether the results of examinations tell us something
about educational standards per se, teaching to the test, the dumbing
down of qualifications and assessment, or some other change in the
mechanism that creates test results&#151;that includes the increased
focus because of Government strategies to force school
improvement&#151;that we have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column584" />Column number: 584</div>the debate about dumbing down each year. Because of all that, the public
have no confidence in results as a measure of educational
standards.</div><a name="09032472000432"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
their response to the Committee&#146;s report, the Government were
commendably honest. In paragraph 50, on page 12, they say
not only that they do not accept the Committee&#146;s recommendations
on sample testing but, in commendably clear terms, that</div>
<a name="09032472000664"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Ofqual&#146;s
role is not to monitor education standards as a whole; it is to
regulate the qualifications and assessments which are one of the means
by which those standards are
measured.&#148;</div><a name="09032472000433"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is extremely clear and one of the reasons why we are unhappy with these
measures. Essentially, we believe that there needs to be a body that is
able to monitor and track standards over time. That body should be able
to ensure that different qualifications are consistent between
themselves and over time through the way in which it measures standards
as well as measuring those standards separately from changes in the
qualifications.</div><a name="09032472000434"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of our concerns when we took evidence on this matter a couple of weeks
ago was whether Ofqual would be able&#151;even over time&#151;to
develop into a more independent body capable of the wider role that the
Government do not presently envisage in monitoring overall educational
standards. Our amendments seek to address the wider role that we think
Ofqual should have, giving it powers and duties to carry out the sample
cohort testing that we think will be necessary to create an assessment
of what is happening to underlying educational
standards.</div><a name="09032472000435"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
we took evidence on this issue we had ambiguous and arguably mutually
inconsistent statements from those who gave evidence. On 3 March we
heard from Kathleen Tattersall of Ofqual, who indicated that Ofqual
does not necessarily need an explicit power in this area. She
said:</div><a name="09032472000665"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;My
understanding of the legislation is that we are not precluded from such
thoughts down the line&#148;.<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official
Report, Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Public Bill
Committee, </i>3 March 2009; c. 66,
Q175.]</div><a name="09032472000436"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
she did not think it necessary to put those powers in this particular
Bill. I would hope that if Ofqual was determined to prove itself to be
a regulator and watchdog with teeth, it would want to take those powers
and would push to do so. I was reassured by Kathleen
Tattersall&#146;s view that the legislation did not preclude Ofqual
pursuing that type of strategy over a period of time. That was not what
we were told by the right hon. Member for South Dorset when we took
evidence from him on 10 March. When he was questioned about sample
testing, he
said:</div><a name="09032472000666"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As
Ministers, we want to decide whether it is appropriate to hold
standardised sampling tests whereby the same test is taken every year
by different cohorts of
children.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,
Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Public Bill Committee,
</i>10 March 2009; c. 163,
Q375.]</div><a name="09032472000437"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, the right hon. Gentleman did not think it appropriate that
Ofqual should simply take such powers of its own accord. Clearly the
Minister felt, for whatever reason, that it would be the duty and
responsibility of Ministers to be clear whether cohort testing was
used, as well as the existing qualifications testing, so that we could
figure out whether standards were improving or declining over
time.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column585" />Column number: 585</div><a name="09032472000438"></a><div class="hs_Para">Then, however,
a couple of questions later we heard from the Under-Secretary of State,
the hon. Member for Portsmouth, North, who was much more open to the
possibility of using the type of standardised sampling testing that her
colleague, the Minister for Schools and Learners, the right hon. Member
for South Dorset, appeared to have ruled out just a few questions
before. The hon. Lady had
said:</div><a name="09032472000667"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
is nothing in the Bill preventing Ofqual from doing standardised
sampling if that is the way that it wishes to fulfil its duties. It
will be up to Ofqual to decide whether that is the best
way.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,
Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Public Bill Committee,
</i>10 March 2009; c. 163,
Q378.]</div><a name="09032472000439"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Lady went on to make it clear that there is nothing to stop Ofqual
carrying out sample testing if it wishes to do so. I was encouraged by
the hon. Lady&#146;s openness to the possibility that Ofqual might
want to do that, because it indicates that she might have in the back
of her mind the possibility that Ofqual may over time develop into a
body that is able to take a wider view of its responsibilities in
relation to monitoring standards. Some amendments touch directly on
this. However, I would appreciate clarification from Ministers on what
the actual position is. Is it the Portsmouth, North position, which is
that&#151;though this is not embedded in the Bill&#151;it is
perfectly acceptable if Ofqual want to carry out this type of
standardised testing? Or is the position as described from Dorset
South, which is that it is appropriate only for Ministers to make such
decisions?</div><a name="09032472000440"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
I had a conversation with Ofqual some months ago, it seemed to me that
although it had not necessarily thought through this issue in detail it
was at least open to the possibility that, in time, it might use such
measures. At the very least, I want to ensure that the Government are
clear that if Ofqual wishes to do so then it should be allowed to do
so.</div><a name="09032472000441"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
issue that is crucial and ties together a number of these amendments is
what we mean by educational standards. We have heard from the
Government&#146;s response to the Select Committee report, that the
Bill and the establishment of Ofqual is designed to create a body not
to objectively look at educational standards as a whole, but to
regulate the existing qualifications framework. The potential for
differences between what is implied from changes in exam results in
terms of regulator&#146;s qualifications and what might be assumed
about underlying standards is very important and quite
topical.</div>
<a name="09032472000442"></a><div class="hs_Para">I noticed at
the end of last week that Mike Creswell, the director-general of the
Assessment and Qualifications Alliance, issued a number of public
comments and warnings about the introduction of the modular system for
GCSEs, which is being brought in from September. The modular system
will allow the GCSEs to be taken over a period of time, module by
module. Moreover, it will allow for quite a number of retakes. I cannot
remember exactly how many, but potentially quite a few. Dr. Creswell
said that pass rates rise when a modular system is introduced. He said
that such a rise would lead to direct concerns about standards. He
referred to the widespread view that standards are being
eroded.</div>
<a name="09032472000443"></a><div class="hs_Para">Dr. Creswell
pointed to international evidence that suggested that modular exams
increased the results. He said that everywhere in the world, pass rates
seem to rise when a modular system is introduced. Such a rise is not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column586" />Column number: 586</div>particular to GCSEs and A levels. He went on to mention how students can
achieve higher results, which creates the appearance of educational
standards improving, when modular qualifications are introduced. We
took evidence from Katherine Tattersall on that issue when she was in
front of the Committee. I asked her if she
would</div><a name="09032472000668"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;expect
a cohort with the same abilities that had previously gone through under
the old qualification to get the same broad distribution of grades in
the new examination, even if its composition, modules and coursework
has
changed?&#148;</div><a name="09032472000444"></a><div class="hs_Para">Kathleen
Tattersall&#146;s first answer was rather ambiguous. However, once I
said that she could assume that the abilities of the cohort were
identical to those of the previous cohort that had taken examinations
under a non-modular system, Kathleen Tattersall replied by
saying:</div><a name="09032472000669"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Assuming
that they are identical&#148;&#151;</div>
<a name="09032472000445"></a><div class="hs_Para">in other words, the
cohort&#151;</div><a name="09032472000670"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
a very large cohort, you would expect a broadly similar pattern, even
if there are some shifts because of the nature of the curriculum change
or the accessibility of the examination, modules or
whatever.&#148;<i class="I"> </i><i class="I">&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,
Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Public Bill Committee,
</i>3 March 2009; c. 78,
Q204.]</div><a name="09032472000446"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
was a relatively clear answer with studied ambiguity around the edges.
It was a lot clearer than the Minister&#146;s response to the same
question. This is not some sort of theoretical question that is not
going to emerge in the very near future. This is an issue that will
arise in the very near future when the modular qualifications come in.
If exam results rise, there is bound to be the suggestion that it is
due to a &#147;dumbing down&#148; and a change in the assessment
for these particular examinations. If we cannot get a clear view from
the Minister on whether or not the intention is, as Kathleen Tattersall
said, to keep the broad grade distribution similar after modular
examinations come in or on whether the Government will allow the
examination results to rise, as Mike Creswell suggested last week, we
really will be in a horrific muddle in terms of what we mean by
examination standards. Moreover, it may erode confidence in examination
standards and in the job that Ofqual does to maintain those standards
over a period of time. That challenge will arise very early in
Ofqual&#146;s period as an independent regulator, so meeting it will
be crucial in determining if there is going to be confidence in the job
that Ofqual does.</div>
<a name="09032472000721"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">8.15
pm</div><a name="09032472000447"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
that regard, I would like to draw attention to the explanatory notes to
the Bill and to some of the comments in them about the job that Ofqual
will be expected to do. In particular, I would like to draw attention
to paragraphs 342 and 343, where there are extensive comments on what
the duties of Ofqual will actually mean in relation to maintaining
standards.</div>
<a name="09032472000448"></a><div class="hs_Para">If you do not
mind, Mrs. Humble, I will just read briefly some of those
comments for the convenience of the Committee and for the record.
Paragraph 342 of the explanatory notes says:</div>
<a name="09032472000671"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Ofqual
must perform its functions with the aim of ensuring that comparable
qualifications and assessments &#151; whether they are
contemporaneous or delivered at different times &#151; indicate a
consistent level of attainment. If the requirements of a qualification
have changed over time, perhaps because the requirements of the
industry they relate to have evolved (this will be a particular issue
in the IT industry, for example), it may be that a modern qualification

<div class="Column"><a name="Column587" />Column number: 587</div>is not comparable with its predecessor and therefore that Ofqual does
not have to secure a consistent level of attainment. But if two
qualifications are comparable, Ofqual must act to ensure that they do
indicate a consistent level of
attainment.&#148;</div><a name="09032472000449"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
the Minister responds later, I would be particularly grateful to know
if this paragraph should be interpreted as meaning that, for example,
in the case of modular qualifications there would be a duty to act to
ensure a consistent level of attainment between the
modular qualification and the predecessor non-modular
qualification, or if the modular qualification in some way constitutes
a new qualification, where there might be a permanent ratcheting up in
the results that are accepted.</div>
<a name="09032472000450"></a><div class="hs_Para">In paragraph
343, there is a description of the job that Ofqual will have to do,
which is just as intriguing when it
says:</div><a name="09032472000672"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
standards of qualifications and assessments &#151; the benchmarks
against which learners are measured &#151; are not the same thing as
the standards of education more broadly. &#147;Standards&#148; in
this first sense are like the height of a hurdle, and Ofqual&#146;s
objective is to keep that height consistent between comparable
qualifications and assessments. Whilst it is generally a policy
objective of the Government to improve the quality of teaching and
learning such that the number of people able to jump the hurdle
increases (which is how the term &#147;standards&#148; is more
commonly used), that is not a concern of Ofqual&#146;s under its
standards
objectives.&#148;</div><a name="09032472000451"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
I would also like to be clear about precisely what that means and to
what extent Ofqual will concentrate on comparability between
qualifications that are available at any point in time, rather than
ensuring that there is confidence about the general level at which the
hurdle is being set and whether or not that hurdle is changing, in
terms of its height, over time.</div>
<a name="09032472000452"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are two
of our principal concerns. First, there is the fact that
Ofqual&#146;s role has been defined in such a narrow way, regulating
specific qualifications rather than standards as a whole. Secondly, I
would suggest that there is ambiguity and confusion in the Government
about what the maintenance of standards, even in regulated
qualifications, means over time.</div>
<a name="09032472000453"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, I
would like to address some of the specific amendments, taking into
account the fact that some of the comments I have already made really
explain why we have tabled some of them.</div>
<a name="09032472000454"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments 60
and 61 would add an overall responsibility for maintaining educational
standards to Ofqual&#146;s objectives. In other words, they would add
to the five objectives, which are currently set down in clause
125(1)(a) to (e), a clearer objective for maintaining educational
standards over time. We think that that is absolutely crucial if Ofqual
is to do the job that most people would expect it to do, rather than
this much narrower job that the Government have given it to
do.</div><a name="09032472000455"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
61 would not only make it clear that there had to be an educational
standards and performance objective, but would place a duty on Ofqual
to carry out sample testing annually in selected subjects and to report
on the changes in educational standards over time, comparing not only
the standards in any one year with those of previous years, but
standards in the United Kingdom with those in other OECD countries. We
know that the Government&#146;s line on that is that Ofsted is
supposed to be carrying out an evaluation of school standards, but if
the Minister is fair-minded and reasonable, she will not consider that
Ofsted is remotely carrying that out or trying to carry it out in the
way 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column588" />Column number: 588</div>envisaged in amendment 61, nor will she try to argue that the
international surveys of educational performance are carried out on a
reliable and consistent enough basis to serve as an excuse for Ofqual
not doing the work itself. Those two amendments are extremely important
to the wider role that we want Ofqual to
have.</div><a name="09032472000456"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
62 would add to Ofqual&#146;s objective for assessment standards a
duty to ensure that its regulated assessments allowed for the
monitoring of changing standards. In clause 125(3)(b), the objective
set down in relation to assessment standards is that there should
be</div><a name="09032472000673"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
consistent level of attainment (including over time) between comparable
assessments.&#148;</div><a name="09032472000457"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
point is that those assessments need to be not just about comparable
assessments and comparable qualifications; they also need to be
invariant to the changes in the composition or assessment standards for
particular
qualifications.</div><a name="09032472000458"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
63 would add the duty that Ofqual should review changes in assessment
standards to date as part of its objectives. That is a very important
point if Ofqual is to have any credibility in relation to the debate
about what has happened to educational standards in the last decade or
so. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton mentioned a
number of studies that have commented on the change in educational
standards in the last decade or so and he cited some quite important
and independent evidence from commentators who believe that grades in
GCSE, A-level and other qualifications today are not comparable to the
grades from five, 10 or 15 years ago. For Ofqual to do its job
effectively, there must be an expectation that it will not only try to
make sensible judgments going forward, but will be able to inform us
about what has been happening to standards in recent years, which is
bound to be of public interest for a long
time.</div><a name="09032472000459"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
64 would ensure that Ofqual had to demonstrate its independence and
objectivity as part of the public confidence objective. In clause
125(4), there is a
duty</div><a name="09032472000674"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
promote public confidence in regulated qualifications and regulated
assessment
arrangements.&#148;</div><a name="09032472000460"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is vital that Ofqual delivers confidence not only in regulated
qualifications, but in Ofqual as a body in terms of its independence,
the integrity of those who work for it and its ability to challenge the
Government, and in terms of the judgment that it makes about standards
being broad and meaningful, not narrow and restricted in the way that
the Government seem to
envisage.</div><a name="09032472000461"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
65 would place an additional duty on Ofqual to carry out cohort testing
to assess changes in standards over time. Depending on one&#146;s
point of view, it either complements or overlaps with amendment 61.
Amendment 219,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000926"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Unless there is any pressure from the Committee for
me to recap my speech, I will finish up on the amendments that we were
discussing. We were 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column589" />Column number: 589</div>up to amendment 219, which would add, to Ofqual&#146;s objective of
promoting public confidence in qualification, an assessment of
standards over time, so that we are not looking at just one particular
point. That would clarify clause 125 and the duties of Ofqual as they
stand.</div><a name="09032472000465"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
427 and 428 would add a duty on Ofqual to publish the criteria that it
may use for any attainment and achievement tables. That raises the
important issue of whether the existing tables, which are generally
produced by the Department, should be published with the scrutiny of
Ofqual, and indeed, by Ofqual. It also invites the Government to
consider the degree of openness about how those tables are pulled
together and how the assessments are achieved.</div>
<a name="09032472000466"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although some
of the existing league table information that is published is imperfect
in many respects, it is important, in terms of the public debate and
accountability to parents. It would be useful if the details of the
calculations involved were brought into the public domain. Proper
publication of the criteria, with the opportunity for general academic
and statistical debate, would potentially shine a light on the
extremely grey area, with its huge impact on schools and colleges. The
transfer of that function from the DCSF to the new regulator would also
remove yet another area of suspicion from the public debate about
standards, thereby increasing public confidence as well as meeting the
awareness objective that amendments 427 and 428 deal with. I hope,
therefore, that the Minister will see the benefit, not only of being
open about the existing tables that have been published, but in
considering and responding to the possibility, at some future stage, of
having the tables and the information published by Ofqual, rather than
by the Department for Children, Schools and
Families.</div><a name="09032472000467"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like&#151;to save time&#151;to comment briefly on the
amendments that have been tabled by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis
and Littlehampton. Amendments 334, 32 and 335 are about supporting the
crucial timeliness objective, which bears on the issue of ensuring that
Ofqual is not involved in rushing through qualifications that have not
been properly considered. We will strongly support those amendments if
the hon. Gentleman wishes to push them to a Division.
Amendments 36 and 37 touch on the issue of the maintenance
of standards, and we strongly support those amendments. They seek to
clarify what is meant by the existing provisions in clause 125, which
talk about standards between comparable regulated qualifications. We
support amendments 41 and 42, which are about international
comparisons, and amendment 38, which would require Ofqual to publish
the standards that it uses on methodology. We have signed the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendment 557 on the market for regulated
qualification to ensure that it has the characteristics of a market. We
also support amendments 43, 81 and 35, which would require Ofqual to
have measurable criteria to assess its success in meeting the various
standards.</div><a name="09032472000468"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that that has given some opportunity to raise what, we believe,
are serious concerns about the objectives of Ofqual, and about the way
in which it pursues those objectives. Without Government measures to
address the concerns that we have, the establishment of Ofqual will be
a failure and it will not bring about increased 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column590" />Column number: 590</div>confidence in educational standards among the public and others, which
should, after all, be the prime objective of this part of the
Bill.</div><a name="09032472000724"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">8.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000927"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Clause 125 sets out the objectives and duties of the
new Ofqual organisation. There has clearly been a change of policy
since the decision to establish Ofqual was announced in September 2007,
because in the initial impact assessment, published in December 2007,
the approach set out was that Ofqual would be a high-level regulator.
The impact assessment refers
to</div><a name="09032472000470"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;removing
the duty...to examine each qualification specified by an awarding
body&#148;</div>
<a name="09032472000471"></a><div class="hs_Para">before it is accredited
and placed on the national qualifications framework and the national
database of accredited qualifications. The approach was to be to
strengthen the focus on risk-based regulation, regulating at the
highest level of the system and trusting awarding bodies to develop
qualifications without micro-regulation but with robust monitoring
systems in place. That approach seems to have been changed to the one
in the DCSF letter of 10 October, which
states:</div><a name="09032472000675"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Ofqual
will be able to strike the right balance between regulating at the
level of awarding bodies...and at the level of an individual
qualification.&#148;</div>
<a name="09032472000472"></a><div class="hs_Para">A brief explanation of
the reasons for that change of policy would help the Committee in its
deliberations on the
clause.</div><a name="09032472000473"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
oddity in the arrangements is the contorted explanation that the
Government give for why the reforms are necessary. On the one hand,
they say that standards have been rigorously maintained over the years
and between exams, but on the other hand, they say that an independent
regulator needs to be created to boost public confidence. That
contortion ends up being a patronising view of public opinion and of
employers and universities.</div>
<a name="09032472000474"></a><div class="hs_Para">According to
the Minister, the decline in public confidence is misplaced and is
based on reading too many newspaper articles that are wrong. According
to such a view, employers are wrong to complain about school leavers
having lower levels of basic skills in literacy and maths; employers
must simply have become more demanding in the skills that they are
seeking. The independent schools are wrong to complain about GCSEs and
their move to the IGCSE is, in the words of the Secretary of State,
just a &#147;marketing tool&#148;. According to such a view,
universities are wrong to say that they need remedial classes to bring
new undergraduates up to minimum level of knowledge that they need to
start university courses, because that is a consequence of the success
of widening
access.</div><a name="09032472000475"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me give one example of the sort of doublethink that I am talking about.
Paragraph 4 of the DCSF September 2007 letter on a new model of
regulation of qualifications
states:</div><a name="09032472000676"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Over
the last ten years, the Qualifications and Curriculum
Authority...has shown robust independence in its work as a
regulator and has developed a system for assuring standards which is
recognised internationally for its quality and reliability...The
hard work of the QCA, and its fellow regulators, means that we can be
confident that standards have been
maintained.&#148;</div><a name="09032472000476"></a><div class="hs_Para">Considering
the QCA&#146;s robust independence and the Government&#146;s
confidence that standards have been maintained, one wonders what the
need for reform is. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column591" />Column number: 591</div>According to the Government, things are just dandy. However, that
document goes on to
state:</div><a name="09032472000677"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Yet
once again, this summer, we had a public debate about standards in
qualifications and tests &#151; even as the QCA provided reassurance
that standards had been
maintained&#148;.</div><a name="09032472000477"></a><div class="hs_Para">Well,
the pesky public and their debates&#151;how dare they have such
opinions when the QCA provided reassurance.</div>
<a name="09032472000478"></a><div class="hs_Para">The changes
are all about finding a way of telling the public that standards are
fine in a way that they will believe. That that is the prime object of
new Ofqual was clear in the evidence of Kathleen Tattersall who said
that</div>
<a name="09032472000678"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Ofqual
had been set up...to ensure that there is a better understanding
of the issue and to assure public
confidence&#148;.</div><a name="09032472000479"></a><div class="hs_Para">Later,
she
said</div><a name="09032472000679"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
have been set up to address issues of public confidence in the
qualifications system.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official
Report, Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Public Bill
Committee, </i>3 March 2009; c.70-71, Q184 and
185.]</div><a name="09032472000480"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
could spend the next 20 minutes listing report after report that
demonstrates that standards in the main public exams have consistently
been slipping over the years. Some examiners and educationalists even
admit to it on the grounds that it is in support of a wider objective
of widening access to qualifications and ensuring that pupils leave
school with some evidence of
achievement.</div><a name="09032472000481"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
2007 study by the centre for evaluation and monitoring at Durham
university is an important piece of work. It
concluded:</div><a name="09032472000680"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
seems clear from the data presented here that candidates of comparable
ability are being awarded higher grades each year, both at A level
where the trend has been consistent and substantial since 1988, and at
GCSE where the change seems smaller and more
intermittent.&#148;</div><a name="09032472000482"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
know that those studies show that sixth-formers with the same ability
awarded a C in the late 1980s would now be getting A. It is also clear
that there is no consistency of standard between grades in different
subjects. As Professor Tymms of the CEM at Durham said
recently,</div><a name="09032472000681"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
need to recognise that an A in physics may not be the same as an A in
theatre studies. These things are not equivalent and we need to take
that on
board&#148;.</div><a name="09032472000483"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
36 was therefore tabled to make Ofqual&#146;s qualification standard
explicit. It would add a duty to maintain standards. That is necessary
because there appears to be some uncertainty about whether Ofqual is
capable or even willing to fulfil the duty in clause
125(2)(b) which requires it to secure that
qualifications</div><a name="09032472000682"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;indicate
a consistent level of attainment (including over time) between
comparable regulated
qualifications.&#148;</div><a name="09032472000484"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
newspaper story headlined, &#147;Exam standards body unsure how to
prevent dumbing-down&#148;
states:</div><a name="09032472000683"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
minutes leaked to a Sunday newspaper, Ofqual chairwoman Kathleen
Tattersall said there was no clear picture of how to maintain standards
when new style exams are brought in this summer...According to the
Observer, when addressing Ofqual board members, Mrs Tattersall said the
body and exam boards &#145;need to arrive at a clearer picture of
what is meant by &#145;maintaining standards&#146; when the
structure of qualifications
changes&#146;.</div><a name="09032472000684"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;These
issues have implications for the revised A-levels, including the ASs in
2009, the new modular GCSEs and diplomas,&#146; she
added.&#148;</div><a name="09032472000485"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
chairman of Ofqual is saying that the new modular GCSEs, compared with
the GCSE before modularisation, will make it difficult to ensure that
standards are maintained. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column592" />Column number: 592</div>Even in the first few months of its existence, while still a part of the
QCA, Ofqual has been unable to prevent the QCA from pressing ahead with
modularisation of GCSEs, despite the fact that one consequence of doing
so was that Ofqual would not know how or whether it could establish
that standards were being
maintained.</div><a name="09032472000486"></a><div class="hs_Para">Dr.
Cresswell, whom the hon. Member for Yeovil also cited, is the director
general of the exam board AQA. He said recently that the new
modularised GCSE would be easier to pass because students can retake
sections many times. The question is why Ofqual did not stop the QCA

they have caused with A

37 would amend clause 125(3) by adding the requirement to maintain
standards in the assessment standard. Clause 125(3)(b) states that
assessment should indicate consistency between comparable assessments.
Consistency, like equality, can mean bringing everything down to the
lowest common denominator, or it can mean levelling up. It appears that
unless there is a statutory requirement to maintain standards, the
Ofqual approach will be to level
down.</div><a name="09032472000488"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
October last year, in response to reports that Edexcel was awarding C
grades in its new science GCSE to pupils achieving only 20 per cent.,
Ofqual was asked to adjudicate after the three exam boards failed to
reach agreement on the boundaries. According to <i class="I">The
Guardian,</i></div>
<a name="09032472000685"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;On
August 7, Ofqual&#146;s acting chief executive, Isabel Nisbet, wrote
to AQA&#146;s director general Dr Mike Cresswell to say: &#145;For
the sake of this year1&#146;s candidates, we consider it essential at
this point to ensure the comparability of grade standards across
awarding bodies...After considering various possibilities we have
reluctantly concluded that the least problematic solution for this
summer is for AQA to bring its grade C standards into line with the
others&#146;&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09032472000489"></a><div class="hs_Para">in
other words, lower them. The article
continues:</div><a name="09032472000686"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
a written reply, Cresswell said it would only do so &#145;on balance
and under
protest&#146;.</div><a name="09032472000687"></a><div class="hs_brev">He
wrote: &#145;AQA is extremely reluctant to adopt a standard for GCSE
science which is less comparable with the past than it needs to
be.&#146;&#148;</div><a name="09032472000490"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">The
</i><i class="I">Guardian </i>went on to
say,</div><a name="09032472000688"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;He
added that Ofqual had made the request of AQA &#145;rather than
requesting the other awarding bodies to adopt standards more clearly in
keeping with those of the
past&#146;.&#148;</div><a name="09032472000491"></a><div class="hs_Para">Dr.
Cresswell told the <i class="I">Times Educational Supplement</i>:</div>
<a name="09032472000689"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I&#146;m
absolutely certain that standards between 2007 and 2008 could have been
maintained more
effectively.&#148;</div><a name="09032472000492"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
a separate statement he said,</div>
<a name="09032472000690"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
standard set for a Grade C on this year&#146;s GCSE science
examinations was not as close to the past grade C standard in science
as we believe it could have
been.&#148;</div><a name="09032472000493"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
Ofqual failed its first test of maintaining standards.</div>
<a name="09032472000494"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments 41
and 42 require Ofqual to set out a range comparators with
qualifications in other countries. As my hon. Friend the Member for
Surrey Heath (Michael Gove) said in a recent speech at the
Haberdashers&#146; Aske&#146;s
school,</div><a name="09032472000691"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
have asked Sir Richard Sykes, the former rector of Imperial College and
one of our most successful scientists, to review our entire system of
assessment and qualifications in this country and we have made it clear
that his aim is to ensure once more that our exams are internationally
competitive...That is why we would legislate to make the fixing of
our exam standards to an international benchmark crucial to our
programme of radical reform.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column593" />Column number: 593</div><a name="09032472000495"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that
when the Minister replies she will trot out the TIMSS&#151;trends in
international mathematics and science study&#151;survey. That survey,
of course, did not include France, Finland, Belgium, Ireland, Portugal
or Spain&#151;except the Basque region. Denmark and Holland did not
take part in the year 1 study. Most importantly, of 137 secondary
schools, 11 refused to take part in this country&#146;s sample which
meant using substitute schools, thus undermining the theory of
sampling, since it is likely to be the weaker schools that refuse to
take part and not the proper average across all schools in this
country. Even so, this country was still outperformed by Russia,
Kazakhstan and Hungary as well as Singapore, Korea, Hong Kong and
Japan. It is also striking that the TIMSS 2007 survey contrasts so
starkly with the 2006 PISA&#151;programme for international student
assessment&#151;survey, in which the UK was ranked sixteenth, equal
with Poland.</div>
<a name="09032472000496"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 139
would amend clause 125(3)(a) so that the assessment standards objective
includes the requirement to promote the development of regulated
assessment arrangements to give a reliable indication of knowledge as
well as achievement. The explanatory note says that regulated
assessment arrangements means arrangements made for assessing the
progress of pupils at each key stage of the national curriculum and the
early years foundation stage. We agree with the importance of such
assessments giving a reliable indication of achievement, but it is
equally important that they measure the level of knowledge a pupil has
amassed.</div>
<a name="09032472000497"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
considerable pressure from some in the education establishment to move
towards a skills-based curriculum, where pupils focus on acquiring
relevant competencies rather than a store of knowledge. Indeed the new
key stage 3 curriculum has already taken significant steps in that
direction. The key stage 3 section of the national curriculum website
says,</div><a name="09032472000692"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
young people are to be prepared for the future they need to develop
essential skills and qualities for learning, life and employment. These
include skills that relate to learning in subjects as well as other
more generic, transferable skills. A dynamic, forward-looking
curriculum creates opportunities for learners to develop as
self-managers, creative thinkers, reflective learners, problem-solvers,
team workers, independent learners, and effective
communicators.&#148;</div><a name="09032472000498"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
the heart of the outcomes of that skills-based approach to the
curriculum is the belief that knowledge is less important because
students can always look up a particular fact. What is more important,
it is argued, is a focus on generic skills such as communication
ability or competency in research, which can be applied to each problem
in life that a person encounters. That is often called learning how to
learn.</div>
<a name="09032472000499"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course,
that analysis is only partly correct. School cannot equip a person with
the sum total of knowledge that they will ever need and people should
be ready to acquire more knowledge as they progress through life. The
point we disagree with is that abilities or skills can be taught in
disembodied form, rather than acquired as a product of gaining more
knowledge. The American academic, E.D. Hirsch, has looked at that issue
and, in an article in the <i class="I">American Educator</i>, wrote:</div>
<a name="09032472000693"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
progressive theory that students should gain knowledge through a
limited number of projects instead of by taking courses in separate
subjects is based on the following reasoning. If you learn a bunch of
facts in separate, academic courses you will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column594" />Column number: 594</div>passively acquire a lot of inert, fragmented knowledge. You will be the
victim of something called &#145;rote learning.&#146; But if you
engage in integrated, hands-on projects you will achieve integrated,
real-world knowledge. By this more natural approach you will
automatically absorb the relevant facts you need.&#148;</div>
<a name="09032472000500"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, one learns by
acquiring knowledge, which gives rise to learning how to learn. One
will learn to think scientifically, mathematically and historically.
One will learn, the progressives claim, all-purpose transferable skills
such as questioning, analysing, synthesising, interpreting and, of
course, problem solving. Indeed, a well-educated person will

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000928"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I was saying that we on the Opposition Benches
disagree that abilities or skills can be taught in disembodied form
rather than acquired as a product of gaining more knowledge. Hirsch
says that</div>
<a name="09032472000694"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the consensus
view in psychology is that those skills are gained mainly through broad
knowledge of a domain. Intellectual skills tend to be
domain-specific...the important question is: How do we best
prepare our students for lifelong learning? Is the in-depth study of a
few topics, practice with a variety of &#145;thinking skills,&#146;
and access to the Internet the best formula? Cognitive psychology
suggests it is not.</div>
<a name="09032472000695"></a><div class="hs_brev">There is a
consensus in cognitive psychology that it takes knowledge to gain
knowledge. Those who repudiate a fact-filled curriculum on the grounds
that kids can always look things up miss the paradox that
de-emphasizing factual knowledge actually disables children from
looking things up effectively. To stress process at the expense of
factual knowledge hinders children from learning to learn. Yes, the
internet has placed a wealth of information at our fingertips. But to
be able to use that information&#151;to absorb it, to add to our
knowledge&#151;we must already possess a storehouse of knowledge.
That is the paradox disclosed by the cognitive
research.&#148;</div>
<a name="09032472000504"></a><div class="hs_Para">The move to a
competence-based curriculum over the past five years under the aegis of
the QCA has been one of the principal causes of the downgrading of our
exam and education system in recent years. Ensuring that children leave
compulsory education with a minimum store of knowledge, concepts and
ideas is vital to enabling them to participate in and contribute to
modern culture and life.</div>
<a name="09032472000505"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 38
would add a new specification to the assessment standards objective. It
would require Ofqual to publish annually its methodology for
determining whether standards had been maintained on assessment and
qualifications over periods of 20, 10 and five years. The measure would
enhance the objectivity and transparency of Ofqual&#146;s work,
leading it to be a more effective and trusted regulator. I have already
cited the YELLIS and ALIS studies that provide evidence that grade
boundaries have been slipping. The evidence for that viewpoint is not
just academic; it is also powerfully reinforced by the experiences of
key groups with an insight and interest in this area of
policy.</div>
<a name="09032472000506"></a><div class="hs_Para">The CEM at
Durham university published a briefing book on the 2008 GCSEs and
A-levels, giving the results of a survey of members of the Institute of
Directors and university tutors. The 2008 survey discovered:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column595" />Column number: 595</div><a name="09032472000696"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Only
12 per cent. of IoD members feel the Government&#146;s performance on
education and skills has been favourable to business over the last 10
years. 55 per cent. believe it to have been unfavourable. IOD members
believe the quality of education provided by schools, colleges and
universities has declined over the last ten years. The deterioration is
perceived to be most acute at school level. 27 per cent. of directors
thought the quality of education in schools had improved, compared to
47 per cent. believing it had got worse.&#148;</div>
<a name="09032472000507"></a><div class="hs_Para">The survey also
discovered that</div>
<a name="09032472000697"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;employers
consider young people&#146;s proficiency in a range of skills has
weakened over the past decade, particularly in writing and
mathematics.&#148;</div><a name="09032472000508"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
report also included an investigation into the views of the university
sector. It stated:</div>
<a name="09032472000698"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In a
sample survey of 100 university admissions tutors, 72 per cent. thought
the quality of undergraduates beginning a course in their department
had either remained the same (32 per cent.) or deteriorated (41 per
cent.) over the course of their involvement with admissions. 28 per
cent. thought the quality of students had
risen.&#148;</div><a name="09032472000509"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
direct experience of the school system is the real reason why there is
concern about dumbing down.</div>
<a name="09032472000510"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ofqual cannot
succeed in its task of restoring trust to the qualifications system
simply by virtue of being independent; there is a much wider and deeper
malaise. The only way to address it is by directly assessing the issues
that matter to people and, in particular, by analysing standards over
the past 20 years and convincing the public that the methodology is
truly objective. That is why amendment 38 must be agreed to.</div>
<a name="09032472000511"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments 31
and 39 would ensure that Ofqual continues to conduct an important poll
that it has been conducting for the past few years. Ofqual has been
asking a sample of students whether they have to work harder to gain
specified qualifications than previous generations of students. In this
year&#146;s poll, 48 per cent. said that they work harder than ever
compared with 60 per cent. in 2007. A similar poll asked
teachers the same question about their students; almost two-thirds of
teachers said that students passed with less effort than previous
generations. It is a useful poll because, among other indicators, it
provides a useful tracking indicator of standards.</div>
<a name="09032472000512"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments 43
and 81 would ensure that Ofqual publishes the criteria that it uses to
make judgments on the efficiency of regulated
qualifications&#151;judgments that it is required to make under the
efficiency objective listed in clause 125(1)(e). The Association of
Colleges, which inspired amendment 81 said
that</div><a name="09032472000699"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
AOC particularly notes that Ofqual will be looking at the sums payable
to bodies awarding or authenticating qualifications, and whether they
represent value for money. Colleges, currently paying approximately
&#163;170 million a year in exam fees, welcome the assessment.
However, we would appreciate clarification on the criteria that will be
used to make judgments.&#148;</div>
<a name="09032472000513"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Minister could
provide that clarification, it would be helpful to the Committee and
the association.</div>
<a name="09032472000514"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
334 and 335 would insert a new timeliness objective into
Ofqual&#146;s list of objective under clause 125(1).
Amendment 32 would add to the efficiency objective the requirement to
ensure that qualifications are provided both efficiently and &#147;on
a timely basis&#148;. That amendment was inspired by Cambridge
Assessment, which
stated:</div><a name="09032472000700"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is crucial that teachers, colleges and schools are able to prepare
properly for new qualifications. The timeliness of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column596" />Column number: 596</div>delivery of a qualification, its accreditation and critical decisions,
is one of the most basic but important factors in the development
process.&#148;</div>
<a name="09032472000515"></a><div class="hs_Para">It went on to say
that</div><a name="09032472000701"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Nobody
wants to see a recurrence of the introduction of Curriculum 2000, which
due to compressed timetables, saw courses starting before textbooks
were printed. Indeed, the new A Level specifications containing the new
A* grade were delivered to schools before the actual mechanism for
grading had been settled. Delays experienced early in the development
process can cause significant problems later on when tasks have to be
inappropriately hurried.&#148;</div>
<a name="09032472000516"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
amendment 557 would broaden the scope of the efficiency objective to
include a market for regulated qualifications rather than regulated
qualifications alone. We agree that Ofqual should have an efficiency
objective and that it should include ensuring that payments made to
awarding bodies represent value for money. On 7 April last
year, <i class="I">The Times</i> reported that schools and colleges were spending
more on exams than on textbooks. The figures came to a total of about
&#163;700 million: &#163;400 million was spent on fees
to exam boards, and &#163;300 million was spent on invigilators. One
school head is cited as saying that over five years the school&#146;s
exam costs had risen from &#163;30,000 a year to &#163;100,000 a
year, despite the number of pupils remaining the same.</div>
<a name="09032472000517"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no
question but that it is a serious matter for schools, and that it is
likely to get worse as we move towards the modular system for GCSEs.
The amendment would require Ofqual to take a broader look at the market
for qualifications, which would give it greater scope to analyse such
matters. Edexel is strongly in favour of the change, and in its
briefing it stated that Ofqual will not be able to deliver on its aims
unless it is given the remit of regulating the qualifications system as
a whole, rather than a narrow remit of regulating qualifications
providers. In particular, Ofqual&#146;s value for money objective
requires that it looks at how qualifications are procured by schools
and colleges, requiring that broader
remit.</div><a name="09032472000518"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
view is that if Ofqual is to regulate the provision of qualifications,
and is to take into account the fees charged to schools, it makes sense
to expand the remit of the efficiency objective so that it includes a
market for qualifications. That would allow Ofqual to take proper
account of all the issues, which is likely to make it a more effective
regulator.</div>
<a name="09032472000519"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000929"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> We have heard two interesting contributions
from the hon. Members for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and for
Yeovil, to which I listened carefully. We went over the ground that we
covered in the previous debate, but the issue is obviously something
about which the two hon. Gentlemen feel strongly. I thought that under
the previous clause we had all agreed that there was a need for an
independent regulator, but that was not so clear as the discussion
progressed.</div><a name="09032472000520"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said that the measure
was a change of policy and that originally we were having a high-level
regulator. There has been no change of policy. We always intended that
Ofqual would be risk-based, and would intervene and accredit when it
needed to, but that it would no longer be required to. I could trade
statistics and reports with the hon. Gentleman in the same way as I did
when we discussed the previous clause, but I am sure that the Committee
will be relieved to know that I do not intend to do so.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column597" />Column number: 597</div><a name="09032472000521"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish to pick
up on a few issues. Both hon. Gentlemen spoke about the modular GCSEs.
Ofqual will have to ensure consistency between modular GCSEs and their
non-modular predecessors. It will be part of its
remit.</div><a name="09032472000522"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000930"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am perhaps intervening slightly rapidly on the
Minister, but the words that she uses are not informative. Will she
clarify the doubt in the debate? If we have two cohorts with identical
educational characteristics, one of whom is pre-modularisation and one
of whom is post-modularisation, would the hon. Lady expect them both to
have the same level of grades as part of Ofqual&#146;s duty to keep
standards steady over
time?</div><a name="09032472000523"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000931"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> In some ways, that will be a matter for
Ofqual to decide. Its remit is to maintain consistency of standards. It
may well be that when it has looked at all the evidence, and if it can
get to that mythical cohort of exactly the same children, which is not
an easy situation to reach, it might decide that that is the case. The
objective of Ofqual is to ensure consistency between the modular GCSEs
and their non-modular predecessors. How it does that will be up to
Ofqual. Only one resit of a module is allowed and all the modules are
at full GCSE
standard.</div><a name="09032472000524"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
question was asked about the Assessment and Qualifications Alliance,
Mike Cresswell, and the GCSE science last year. I wish to correct one
important point and emphasise what was said by Kathleen Tattersall in
the evidence session, which was
that</div><a name="09032472000702"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Ofqual
asked nobody to lower
standards.&#148;</div><a name="09032472000525"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
should pick that up. The most important matter that came out of the
session from Mike Cresswell, Greg Watson and Kathleen Tattersall was
that they all agreed that, when Ofqual was asked to look at the issue,
it was probably already too late. The important thing is that the
criteria are set at the beginning of a qualification, and that is the
time at which all of them agreed that the work should be
done.</div><a name="09032472000526"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000932"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Did Isabel Nesbit not write to the three exam boards
saying that they had to reach parity between them and that they had to
go to the lower level&#151; Edexcel level&#151;and not the level
set by AQA? Therefore, AQA had to lower its grading boundary to match
the other two
boards.</div><a name="09032472000527"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000933"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> As I understand it, the exam boards were
asked to be consistent. I am merely quoting Kathleen Tattersall when
she said
that</div><a name="09032472000703"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Ofqual
asked nobody to lower standards.&#148; &#151;&#151;[Official
Report, Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Public Bill
Committee, 3 March 2009; c. 78,
Q204.]</div><a name="09032472000528"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ofqual
asked the boards to reach a consistent standard. The three different
bodies had different views of what the standards were and they had to
arrive at a consistent view. It is clear that Ofqual was not asking AQA
to lower its standards, but to be consistent with the other two boards
because people have different views of what standards are, which is
probably what our debate has been
about.</div><a name="09032472000529"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000934"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> The three exam boards could not reach agreement.
They went to Ofqual, which reluctantly said that it was for AQA to
bring its grade C standards into line with the others and that it was
not for the other two 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column598" />Column number: 598</div>boards to raise their standards in line with AQA. In my view and, I
think, that of the public, that is a lowering of
standards.</div><a name="09032472000727"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30
pm</div><a name="09032472000530"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000935"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Or it is a consistency of standards. There
were three awarding bodies, all of which had robust processes, and one
was asked to come into line with the other two. However, the important
point is that we get it right at the beginning of the process and not
the end. That was the point made by both the awarding bodies and
Kathleen Tattersall.</div>
<a name="09032472000531"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000936"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> The reason why we are concerned is that at its first
opportunity to make a crucial high-level decision, Ofqual, instead of
making the decision in a direction that would cause standards to
rise&#151;that is, requesting two boards to raise their standards of
grading to match the other board&#151;decided that the board with the
higher standard should lower its grading. That is dumbing down. Our
concern is that Ofqual will do that in future, based on the one
precedent that we have of its experience so
far.</div><a name="09032472000532"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000937"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> It might be helpful if I asked Kathleen
Tattersall to write to the hon. Gentleman to explain what she meant in
her evidence. Obviously, I am quoting a third party. As I told him, my
view is that there were three awarding bodies, all of which had robust
processes, that could not come to an agreement, and one fitted in with
the other two because, as I understand it, they could not decide among
the three of them. However, it might be helpful if Kathy explains the
remarks that she made in her evidence and expands on them.</div>
<a name="09032472000533"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will not
list Ofqual&#146;s objectives, as I think that we are all clear on
them, but the five strategic objectives set out a clear role for Ofqual
to work in the public interest on matters relating to standards,
confidence and efficiency. I do not think that the legislation should
go into detail about how Ofqual could go about delivering on its remit;
it should make it clear what Ofqual must achieve and give it the powers
and freedom to get on with it. For that reason, I will resist the
amendments.</div><a name="09032472000534"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the specifics, I will first speak to the amendments that specify in too
much detail how Ofqual should perform its functions, then to those that
would give Ofqual too broad a remit. Finally, I will address the
amendments that, in my view, simply duplicate provisions that are in
the Bill and are, therefore,
unnecessary.</div><a name="09032472000535"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
31 and 39 would require Ofqual to carry out surveys. Ofqual may well
wish to do such surveys; it will certainly want to conduct research as
its predecessor bodies did and as interim Ofqual has continued to do.
The Bill gives Ofqual the power to do all those things. We should not
start choosing on its behalf the most appropriate way to achieve its
objectives. When Ofqual reports to Parliament, it will have to satisfy
Parliament that it has done what it should have done, using whatever
tools it feels is right for the
job.</div><a name="09032472000536"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000938"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> That is an important and helpful statement, I think.
However, is the Minister therefore contradicting the Minister for
Schools and Learners, who essentially 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column599" />Column number: 599</div>said in evidence that it was up to Ministers to decide whether to hold
standardised sampling tests in the way that she
described?</div><a name="09032472000537"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000939"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> If the hon. Gentleman will allow me, I will
come to sample testing later in my remarks, when I will explain why
there is no actual difference between what the Minister for Schools and
Learners and I
said.</div><a name="09032472000538"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendments 38, 41, 42, 63, 427 and 428, we would certainly expect
Ofqual to publish evidence underpinning its conclusions on the
maintenance of standards. Where appropriate, we would expect it to
consider lessons from other countries, but we do not want to pre-judge
the best way for it to gather or present that evidence. The public
confidence and awareness objectives imply that Ofqual must carry out
its work openly and credibly, or it will not be able to promote public
confidence and awareness as it must. It will have to operate in that
way anyway, so I do not think that we need to legislate for
it.</div>
<a name="09032472000539"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000940"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> The Minister went through the amendments rather
quickly, but I think that she touched on amendment 63, which invites
Ofqual to reconsider educational standards over the past 20 or so
years. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton tabled
amendment 38, which is similar. Is the Minister happy for Ofqual to do
the job described in amendments 63 and
38?</div><a name="09032472000540"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000941"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I would envisage Ofqual doing its job. We
are asking it to look at and measure standards over time, so it might
well wish to go back as well as
forwards.</div><a name="09032472000541"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both
hon. Gentlemen touched on the Government&#146;s achievement and
attainment tables. It is appropriate for Ofqual to have a role in
looking at how those qualifications are scored, because it would help
to develop confidence in the objectivity of the judgments. However, we
do not need to put those provisions in the Bill, mainly because
achievement and attainment tables are not statutory, and it would not
be appropriate to make them so. However, we are reviewing them in light
of the proposals to develop a school report card and the responses on
which we are consulting. We will discuss with the interim Ofqual what
its and, perhaps, the QCDA&#146;s role should be under the new
arrangements for the provision of information on school
performance.</div><a name="09032472000542"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
43 and 81 would require Ofqual to establish specific and measurable
success criteria in relation to some of its objectives. Amendment 43
would apply to three of the objectives&#151;qualifications standards,
assessment standards and public confidence&#151;and amendment 81
would apply to the efficiency objective. Amendment 35 would require
Ofqual to publish the outcome of the criteria in its annual report. The
interim Ofqual agrees that it will need to do that, and is planning to
identify measurable success criteria, and report on them, including in
its annual report. However, we do not need to include in the
legislation a detailed requirement that Ofqual should behave so. It
will be accountable to Parliament, and Select Committees in particular
are sure to make arrangements to scrutinise Ofqual&#146;s work and
assess what it must achieve. That means that Ofqual must ensure that it
can demonstrate what it has achieved.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column600" />Column number: 600</div><a name="09032472000543"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000942"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I am pleased to hear that Ofqual has agreed that
there will be specific and measurable success criteria, and that they
will be reported on. Will the hon. Lady say where that has been set out
in a public document, so that I can have a look at it? I might have
read it already and simply forgotten, but could I have the name of the
document, so that I can check that it is on the public
record?</div><a name="09032472000544"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000943"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I shall ensure that the hon. Gentleman has
that information. We will ask Ofqual to write to him with its
commitment. We will also ask Ofqual to consider commissioning, after
three years, an independent review of the reforms to assess what it has
achieved. If Ofqual agrees to that, it will need to decide what
performance measures it wants to set.</div>
<a name="09032472000545"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
60, 61, 62 and 65 would, in my view, create too wide a remit. They
would all change Ofqual&#146;s remit from that of a regulator of
qualifications and assessments, which is a challenging enough role, to
the impossible task of coming to a single view about standards of
performance across the system. We are dealing with two different senses
of the word &#147;standards&#148;: the standard of assessment,
which is the difficulty of a qualification, and the standard of
performance, which is the achievement of learners. Ofqual&#146;s role
will be to monitor the standards of qualifications and assessments, and
to ensure that they are consistent. We do not say that its role will be
to monitor standards of performance. The chair of interim Ofqual and
the director general of the AQA awarding body indicated in their
evidence to our Committee their view that such a remit would be too
wide and would give Ofqual an enormously difficult brief. We agree with
that, and we think that Ofqual&#146;s remit should remain focused on
regulation of qualifications and
assessments.</div><a name="09032472000546"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moving
on to sample testing, my right hon. Friend the Minister for Schools and
Learners
said:</div><a name="09032472000704"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
am not sure whether sufficient amount would be gained by doing the
standard sampling tests.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official
Report, Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Public Bill
Committee, </i>10 March 2009; c. 163,
Q376.]</div><a name="09032472000547"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ofqual
could certainly use sample testing if it wished, but only in pursuit of
the objectives that we have set out in the Bill. It might decide to do
that to validate its achievement of the objective to maintain standards
in comparable qualifications, for example, but it could not use sample
testing as a way of checking on standards of performance, because as I
explained that would go outside the remit that we believe Ofqual should
have.</div><a name="09032472000548"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000944"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I understand the Minister&#146;s point technically
speaking, but will she explain in more detail why Ofqual might want to
use sample testing to pursue the aims set down in the Bill rather than
those that I would like it to pursue? Under what circumstances would it
use sample testing to check the qualifications
criteria?</div><a name="09032472000549"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000945"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Ofqual might wish to use sample testing to
check the consistency of a qualification, going across. That would be
within Ofqual&#146;s remit, and it can use any method that it wishes
to maintain the qualification standard objective. What is not in its
remit are the wider standards of performance, which I know the hon.
Gentleman would like it to
have.</div><a name="09032472000550"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
a number of the amendments are superfluous, such as amendments 36 and
37. The Bill already creates an obligation for Ofqual to secure that
regulated 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column601" />Column number: 601</div>qualifications and assessments indicate a consistent level of attainment
over time. That catches the intention behind the
amendments&#151;namely, to maintain standards in qualifications and
assessment. Therefore, the two amendments are not
necessary.</div><a name="09032472000551"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
64 would give Ofqual the objective of promoting public confidence in
its own independence and objectivity. With a remit to secure confidence
in the qualifications and assessment system, Ofqual will obviously do
that and does not need to be told to, so the amendment is not
necessary.</div><a name="09032472000552"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
139 involves a change of wording, which is intended to ensure that
Ofqual would have to consider the level of knowledge indicated by
regulated assessment arrangements. As clause 125(3)(a) specifically
relates to regulated assessment arrangements, the word
&#147;achievement&#148; must mean the same as it does in the
legislation that governs regulated assessments&#151;namely, the
Education Act 2002 and the Childcare Act 2006. In both those Acts,
assessing the achievements of pupils and young children is defined as
assessing what they have achieved in terms of gaining the knowledge,
skills and understanding expected for the relevant stage of their
education. Again, that covers what is in the
amendment.</div><a name="09032472000553"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
219 would make it explicit that Ofqual&#146;s public confidence
objective refers to public confidence over time. However, the duty to
promote public confidence must mean that Ofqual has to take a long-term
view. Confidence cannot be created in a short period, and Ofqual would
not be fulfilling its objective if it secured public confidence one
year, but stopped worrying about it the next. In clause 125(2)(b), the
Bill states that there should
be</div><a name="09032472000705"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
consistent level of attainment (including over
time)&#148;.</div><a name="09032472000554"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
557 would make it explicit in the text of the Bill that qualifications
in England and Northern Ireland are delivered through a market system,
and would direct Ofqual to secure the efficient operation of that
market. That is an unnecessary narrowing of Ofqual&#146;s remit. We
want to ensure that all aspects of qualifications delivery are
efficient, not just the functioning of the
market.</div><a name="09032472000555"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally
on the superfluous amendments, amendments 334 and 335 would
create and define a timeliness objective, with Ofqual having to carry
out its functions in a timely manner that facilitates the delivery of
qualifications on time. Similarly, amendment 32 would change
Ofqual&#146;s efficiency objective, requiring Ofqual to secure the
provision of regulated qualifications on a timely basis. Clearly it
will have to do all it can to do that, but there are two reasons why it
should not be given it as a formal duty. First, inasmuch as it has
control over when qualifications are delivered, that is already covered
by its duty to perform its function efficiently and effectively.
Secondly, timeliness is not an objective in itself; it is a means by
which other objectives, such as public confidence, are achieved. For
those reasons, I request that the hon. Member for Yeovil withdraws his
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000946"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that full
response. I have some short comments to make. I thank the Minister for
agreeing to ask the chair of Ofqual to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column602" />Column number: 602</div>write to members of the Committee about Kathleen Tattersall&#146;s
comments in the evidence session, in which she said that it did not ask
for the standards of the science GCSE set by AQA to be lowered. I look
forward to receiving that
letter.</div><a name="09032472000557"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was encouraged when the Minister said that she would expect Ofqual to
conduct studies that make comparisons with other countries. I shall
look at her precise words when the record is published and come back to
that issue later in the proceedings, because it is important for Ofqual
to make those international comparisons.</div>
<a name="09032472000558"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000947"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I want to clarify for the hon. Gentleman
that I was talking about international comparisons of
qualifications.</div>
<a name="09032472000559"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000948"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> That is what I understood. We strongly believe that
comparing our qualifications with those of other countries is important
in a globalized world in which people are competing for the same jobs
and the same academics across the globe. We have to ensure that our
qualifications match the best in the
world.</div><a name="09032472000560"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was encouraged when the Minister said that Ofqual would publish
specific and measurable success criteria. Again, she said that she
would ask Ofqual to expressly set that out in writing to members of the
Committee or provide a reference to a published document in which we
can see that commitment made publicly.</div>
<a name="09032472000561"></a><div class="hs_Para">We still have
concerns about other issues dealt with by amendments in the group. In
particular, I intend to ask the Committee to divide on amendment 36,
which inserts the important and specific objective of maintaining
standards. With those few comments, I await hearing about what the hon.
Member for Yeovil is going to do with amendment
60.</div>
<a name="09032472000562"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032472000949"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> We have had a good debate and I am grateful to the
Minister for her patience in taking a large number of interventions,
which were helpful, in some respects, in clarifying one or two points
in the Bill. However, I am disappointed that she has rejected all of
the amendments that we have tabled. Her objections to some of the
amendments were based on the fact that they give Ofqual too big a task.
We believe that Ofqual should have that task and that armoury to do its
job, and, it appears, the Children, Schools and Families Committee
agrees.</div><a name="09032472000563"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister also indicated that she objected to some of the other
amendments because they were too prescriptive in telling Ofqual what it
should do. I gently remind the Minister of the debate on schedule 9, in
which the Government were willing to put the time during
which Ofqual would be obliged to review the composition of
its committees in the Bill. If the Government are
willing to be that prescriptive with Ofqual, the degree of
prescriptiveness in some of the amendments was reasonable and more
substantive than the detail put into schedule 9.</div>
<a name="09032472000564"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am left
with concerns, not only about the lack of robustness in Ofqual&#146;s
objectives in clause 125, which make us unable to support the whole
clause, but also about the two points from my earlier comments. We have
made progress with the Minister on sample testing and being able to
measure educational standards over 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column603" />Column number: 603</div>time. It is clear that the Minister does not want Ofqual to do that, but
we do, which is why I will press amendment 60 to the vote. The Minister
indicated that Ofqual would be allowed to commission sample testing
provided that it is in pursuance of the Bill&#146;s measures, rather
than the type of approach that we want. I am not sure who will
determine whether Ofqual&#146;s sampling complies with the
Bill&#146;s measures or whether it is in pursuit of wider objectives,
so it would be useful for that to be clarified. Given the length of the
debate that we have had, I understand if the Minister would rather
write to the Committee on
that.</div><a name="09032472000565"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
thrust of Government thinking in relation to modular GCSEs is also
unclear. The Minister has understandably indicated that that is an
issue for Kathleen Tattersall, but it is also an issue for the
Government. As it has been a key issue in this debate, will the
Minister consider asking Kathleen Tattersall to write to the Committee
with her view of the way in which Ofqual will seek to maintain
standards in relation to modular
GCSEs?</div><a name="09032472000566"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to press amendment 60 to a Division, and we also want a Division
on clause 125, which we are unable to support for the reasons that we
have
given.</div><a name="09032472000567"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
