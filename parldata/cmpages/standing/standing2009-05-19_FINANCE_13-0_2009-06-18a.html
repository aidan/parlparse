<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061850000184"></a>The

statement to
make.</div><a name="09061850000012"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061850000185"></a>The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen
Timms):</b> I bid you a warm welcome to the Chair,
Mr. Hood, on this beautiful morning. I have a couple of
points to make. First, I would like to correct a misleading impression
that I gave the Committee at the end of our previous sitting during the
debate on clause 70 relating to the costing of the &#163;45 million
expected to be yielded as a result of that clause, which dealt with
accommodation costs. I said, correctly, that the costing was based
on  47 cases of those arrangements being used by 19 employee
benefits trusts to gain a tax advantage, but it was not based on 47
individuals, because each case involved a number of different
individuals. Due to the way in which information about trusts using
lease premiums has been corrected, the number of employees benefiting
is not recorded, but it is certainly a good deal more  than 47,
which helps to explain the large yield score for that
measure.</div><a name="09061850000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
as the Committee will be aware, my hon. Friend the Member for Burnley
has stepped down from her role at the Treasury, and I would like to say
how much we will miss her. We had already been working with gusto on
the Bill in the short time she was back at the Treasury as a Minister.
We of course look forward to welcoming my hon. Friend the Member for
Portsmouth, North (Sarah McCarthy-Fry), when she joins us later and
congratulate her on her appointment. I think that the Committee will
understand what I mean when I say that I am sure she would have wished
her appointment to have been in circumstances other than those we find
ourselves in today. I express my thanks to my hon. Friend the Member
for Burnley for her help over the past
week.</div><a name="09061850000009"></a>

Bill.</div><a name="09061850000015"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061850000186"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): I, too, welcome you to the
Chair, Mr. Hood. I will take this opportunity to echo the
Financial Secretary&#146;s remarks about his colleague, the hon.
Member for Burnley. I know that she relished her return to the
Treasury, and we are all sorry that she has had to step down. I am
looking 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column442" />Column number: 442</div>forward to the hon. Member for Portsmouth, North, who is my neighbour,
joining the Treasury team, and I might say a little more when she
appears at our next sitting. I have grown used to seeing stories in our
local paper about the Department for Children, Schools and Families
being rebadged under her name, and I am looking forward to reading
articles in the local news about her welcoming the appointment of a new
member of the Monetary Policy Committee or discussing the level of
reserves held by the Bank of England in foreign currencies.</div>
<a name="09061850000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
take the debate on the clause as an opportunity to set out some of the
background to the changes we will discuss in more detail when we come
to schedule 35 and to lay the trail that might put in context the
amendments we have tabled to that schedule. When the Committee&#146;s
proceedings started four weeks ago, I said on a point of order that it
was the fourth Finance Bill Committee on which I have sat as a Front
Bencher, but it also happens to be the fourth Finance Bill in which the
A-day rules, which were established in the Finance Act 2004, have been
unpicked. We have seen changes twice to alternative secured pensions,
the removal of residential and other property from self-invested
pension plans, rules restricting recycling of cash lump sums and the
abolition of pension term assurance. That set of proposals on A-day had
been hard fought for, and it has caused a great deal of concern in the
industry that so many changes have been made. Of course, the changes
being made in schedule 35 are a precursor to wider changes planned for
2011-12.</div><a name="09061850000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem arises in the following way: there is logic behind some of the
individual measures and some of the changes may be justified, but they
send a message to potential savers that they cannot rely on a pensions
tax regime being in place for the long term. Indeed, during the 2004
Finance Bill debate, my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton
(Mr. Osborne) voiced concerns about the inclusion of
residential property in SIPPs. We encourage people to save for the long
term for their pensions through the personal accounts, which will be
introduced in 2012, but people have no certainty about the tax
treatment of their contributions or about how future contributions will
be dealt with. That is a disincentive; why would people want to lock up
their money for the long term if they are not entirely sure how the
Government will tax current and future
contributions?</div><a name="09061850000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
genesis of the anti-forestalling measures was the Government&#146;s
announcement in the pre-Budget report 2008 of the 40p tax rate from
2011-12. One of the concerns about the tax&#146;s revenue yield
expressed at the time was that people would use the generous reliefs
available for pensions to off-set their increased tax bill. That point
was widely flagged and the provisions under discussion, as well as the
other changes announced in Budget 2009 about pension contributions, are
a good example of &#147;be careful what you wish for&#148;, because
the concerns have now been picked up by the Treasury and translated
into the provisions under
discussion.</div><a name="09061850000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is worth noting the current position on the taxation of pensions before
turning to the precise details involved. An individual who contributes
to an approved pension scheme obtains tax relief at the marginal rate
on their contributions, so Members throughout the House currently gain
tax relief at 40 per cent. on the contributions that they make to
Parliament&#146;s occupational scheme. That 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column443" />Column number: 443</div>has been a feature of pension taxation for some time. As part of the
A-day regime, there was a shift from what was quite a restrictive
maximum contribution of 17.5 per cent. of net relevant earnings for
most taxpayers to a recognition that people may contribute to pension
schemes in a much more lumpy and less predictable way given the
changing nature of employment. The Government therefore introduced a
lifetime limit and an annual allowance. The lifetime limit of
contributions currently stands at &#163;1.75 million and the annual
allowance is the lower amount of either earned income or
&#163;245,000.</div><a name="09061850000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill offers an additional layer of complexity, because the clarity set
out in the A-day rules is now going to be replaced by a second test
relating to people who earn more than &#163;150,000. Their
contributions will receive a reduced tax relief of 20 per cent.
depending on&#151;we will come back to this on a later group 
of amendments&#151;the previous pattern of pension contributions,
which is not a straightforward issue. The contributions made by
individuals to their pension funds are not the only ones affected;
employer pension contributions are also affected, and contributions
based on relevant income will lose their exempt status and be
classified as a taxable
benefit.</div><a name="09061850000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
defined-contribution scheme is straightforward as it is easy to define
an employer&#146;s contribution. However, it is more difficult to
assess the value of an employer&#146;s contribution to a
defined-benefit scheme of the nature that we in the House are fortunate
enough to enjoy. The Treasury has set up a working party with the
industry to work out how to value the contributions that businesses
make, because, quite often, a global contribution, rather than an
amount per individual, is made to such schemes. Then we get into the
issue of how we apportion it and how we value the impact of the
increase in
contributions.</div><a name="09061850000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">People
may think that they can wait until 2011 to plan their futures so that
they can see what happens with the scheme that the Government intend to
introduce. However, the Government are concerned about people taking
advantage of the gap between now and 2011, so have introduced the
anti-forestalling measures in schedule 35 which cover the tax periods
between now and the introduction of the new
regime.</div><a name="09061850000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the number of representations that hon. Members from all parts of the
House have received, there have been some recurrent themes. Concerns
have been expressed not only by individuals who have written to us
about the particular impact on their circumstances, but by the pensions
sector. Some comments have been made about the feasibility of the
anti-forestalling
measures.</div><a name="09061850000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me turn now to the concerns about how the changes may affect savings,
particularly the issue around complexity leading to discouragement. The
A-day regime was a very serious piece of work, which involved
compromises on the part of both HMRC and the pensions industry to sweep
away the eight different tax regimes that then existed for pensions, to
move to a much more simple and straightforward system that people could
understand. It was hoped that the regime would lead to more people
increasing their contributions. However, now they see the
anti-forestalling measures, and they know about the changes that are
coming in 2011. We have a situation in which there are more complex
rules in place. As part of the anti-forestalling measures, which run to
some 18 pages, we have the prospect of future regulations. Clearly,
there are issues 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column444" />Column number: 444</div>around the valuation of employers&#146; contributions. The complexity
of the changes could act as a further disincentive to invest in
pensions. Tim Breedon, the chief executive officer of Legal &amp;
General,
said:</div><a name="09061850000133"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
planned cut to tax relief on pension contributions made by higher rate
taxpayers would deter saving and would also erode recent efforts to
simplify the system. To make savings attractive to people you want
simplicity not complexity. And you want stability, not
change.&#148;</div><a name="09061850000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nick
Prettlejohn, CEO of Prudential UK businesses,
said:</div><a name="09061850000134"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
proposed changes announced in the Budget will reintroduce complexity
and further confusion to the pensions landscape and erode consumer
confidence.&#148;</div>
<a name="09061850000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rachel Vahey, head of
pensions at Aegon&#151;it was the head of Aegon, Otto Thoreson, who
led the Government&#146;s review of financial advice to encourage
people to save more for their
future&#151;said:</div><a name="09061850000135"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
undermines the A-day agreement which was designed to promote long-term
pension saving, using the standard Lifetime Allowance to prevent abuse
of the system by the rich. That major overhaul of the pensions tax rule
was meant to last 30 years rather than three years. Pensions are for
the long term so consistency is essential to give people confidence to
plan for the
future.&#148;</div><a name="09061850000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
ever, the issue is not just the proposals themselves but the way in
which they are introduced. The proposals were sprung on the industry.
In the days before the Budget, one or two people suspected that there
might be some cap on the higher rate tax relief, but they did not
expect to see changes of such a
nature.</div><a name="09061850000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have broken a hard-earned concordat with the industry on the
A-day regime. They have moved away from the concept that underpins
those reforms of EET: exempt contributions; exempt investment income
and taxable benefits).</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061850000187"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I am following the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument
with interest. I think that he is slightly overstating his case. Does
he accept that 98.5 per cent. of taxpayers will not be affected by the
changes at
all?</div><a name="09061850000141"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div><a name="09061850000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061850000188"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Minister is getting into the numbers game that
the Treasury seems to like at the moment. I will come back to that
point a bit later. The Minister will say that the changes affect only
the highest earners, but I have some examples of how the rules work in
practice which show that they could affect people on relatively modest
incomes who may have received redundancy payments in the past or sold a
business. Such people will be affected by the changes. The Government
present the measure as a tax clampdown on the rich, but there are some
hard cases that will emerge from the crude way in which the Government
have introduced the anti-forestalling measures. We will discuss that in
more detail when we debate the amendments.</div>
<a name="09061850000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I was
saying, there is concern that principles have been undermined. It is
worth reflecting on the Minister&#146;s point that 98.5 per cent. of
people will not be affected by the changes. However, part of the
problem is that the measure sends a signal that will lead those people
to ask, &#147;Well, how can I be sure what will happen in the
future?&#148; What certainty can there be that the
Government&#146;s proposal will not be extended further down the
income chain in the future? That is the problem that the Government
have because, although they believe that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column445" />Column number: 445</div>the changes affect only a narrow group of people, the concern is what
will happen next. People will ask, &#147;Do I really want to lock up
my money for the long term in pensions or is there an alternative form
of saving on which I can rely instead, in relation to which there will
be less chance of Government interference and changes to the tax
rules?&#148; The measure will have a behavioural impact that spreads
beyond the narrow group that the Minister believes is affected by the
changes.</div>
<a name="09061850000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">The changes
are being made at a time when the pension system is not in great shape.
A large proportion of the population has not saved enough or does not
save at all. If the message that they receive from the press, the media
and the Chancellor is that the rules are up for debate or change, and
that nothing is certain, they will feel reluctant to lock their money
up for the long term. We cannot afford to apply any more disincentives
to saving. People&#146;s confidence in the pension regime has been
shaken by the financial crisis. Even in these troubled times, many
people will see housing as a more reliable asset for investment and as
being something that they control. If long-term savings through
pensions are undermined, the chances are that more and more people will
spend money on housing and might not save at all. That will be to the
long-term detriment of not only themselves and their families but the
stability of the economy as a
whole.</div><a name="09061850000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
talked about the impact on behaviour in response to the
Minister&#146;s comments. Trevor Matthews, chief executive office of
Friends Provident, has
said:</div><a name="09061850000136"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Tax
relief on contributions was a way of the Government saying to everyone
&#151; and I mean everyone, irrespective of earnings &#151; that
&#145;saving for your pension is a good thing and we will encourage
it.&#146; Now that contract has been broken &#151; and if it can be
broken for one segment of savers now, it can be broken for
others.&#148;</div><a name="09061850000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
it is not enough that the changes will be restricted to a narrow band
of earners. Unintended consequences could affect the culture of saving
in the UK. The National Association of Pension Funds has put forward an
argument that is difficult to accept, but that reflects reality. If the
managers and directors of business no longer have a stake in a pension
fund, how will that affect their view of that pension fund? Will they
continue to support an expensive defined benefit scheme, or will they
decide that they ought to reduce the financial risk to the company and
move to a defined contribution scheme? Will the changes accelerate the
shift away from DB to DC schemes? That is a difficult argument, but one
can see why people think that that will be the
case.</div><a name="09061850000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government say that the measure is about fairness, but it is actually
about how they will shore up their revenue projections from the 50p
rate. If this was about fairness, the Government would have come up
with a more imaginative scheme for how to use the &#163;3.1 billion
that the measure will raise to shore up savings and pensions elsewhere
in the system. Instead, the additional revenue is going into the
Treasury&#146;s coffers.</div>
<a name="09061850000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although we
have not tabled amendments to this effect, there are alternative
proposals that work with the system, rather than introducing additional
complexity, that some in the industry felt could have been used to
restrict the tax relief claimed by top earners. The Government could
have decided to reduce the lifetime 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column446" />Column number: 446</div>allowance or the annual allowance. That would have restricted the
contributions made and gone with the grain of the existing A-day
regime. Because this is an income-based system, there will be hard
cases at the margin. Someone earning slightly less than &#163;150,000
will enjoy full relief on their pension contributions, but someone
earning slightly more than &#163;150,000 will not enjoy that same
relief. The Government need to demonstrate that they have thought
through the suggested alternatives.</div>
<a name="09061850000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have set
out the background to clause 71 and schedule 35. I shall say a few
words about the anti-forestalling measures to set the amendments in
context. The measures will apply to anyone earning more than
&#163;150,000 who makes contributions between 22 April
2009&#151;the date of the Budget&#151;and 5 April 2011 that exceed
the contributions previously made on a quarterly or more regular basis.
The measures apply only to contributions of more than &#163;20,000.
Any contributions that breach the restrictions will be taxed at 20 per
cent. Therefore, the Government&#146;s anti-forestalling measure
works out the pattern of regular savings and takes it into account when
looking at the pension contributions. Where the contribution is
&#163;20,000 more than the previous pattern of savings, the 20 per
cent. tax charge will be applied. At that level, it sounds like a
fairly clear and straightforward system, because it assumes that
people&#146;s income and contribution pattern is fairly
settled.</div><a name="09061850000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
there are people who the regime may catch who do not have a settled
pattern of income. They may have an atypically high income one year and
if it arises in the two years prior to the year in which pension
contributions are made, they will be caught by the regime. It will
particularly affect the self-employed and partners in accountancy and
law firms, who have variable incomes and contribution patterns. Those
receiving generous redundancy packages and using it to top up their
pension contributions may also be caught by the measure, as may people
who have sold a business and made a one-off
gain.</div><a name="09061850000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is a crude anti-forestalling measure that does not necessarily take
account of how people run their lives and how their income flows from
year to year. Some will feel aggrieved by the way the rules have been
set out. Part of the problem is that there has been no consultation;
the measure was introduced in the  Budget 2009. The Government
are consulting on the implementation of the rules from 2011 but, as
yet, there has been no regulatory impact assessment on how it will work
in practice. The Government need to make clear why this
anti-forestalling measure is the right way to proceed and why it will
not have the negative impact that many believe it will have on the
saving culture in the UK. Not only those directly affected but the
wider population will see, yet again, that the message from Government
is that one cannot rely on consistency, stability and predictability
when it comes to the taxation of
pensions.</div><a name="09061850000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061850000189"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jeremy Browne</b> (Taunton) (LD): I start by saying it is a
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Hood, but
also apologising for coming to the debate a couple of minutes after it
started. I extend my apology to the two previous speakers for missing
their opening remarks.</div>
<a name="09061850000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
familiar with this important subject matter. The context is a budget
deficit of &#163;175 billion this year and, by the
Government&#146;s estimate, &#163;173 billion next 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column447" />Column number: 447</div>year. The amalgam of those deficits is more than the total Government
spending in the first Budget of the now Prime Minister back in 1997. We
are talking vast sums of money so the onus is on all of us to ensure
that the money is spent as efficiently and equitably as possible
because there is none spare to be used inefficiently. We also live in a
society with serious income inequalities. Therefore, as well as
ensuring that the money is spent as efficiently as possible, we have to
consider whether it has been spent as effectively as possible. Are the
people who benefit from the state&#146;s largesse, through money that
they receive or money not taken from them&#151;the effect may be the
same, but the approach somewhat different&#151;the right people?
Could the money be better targeted to achieve either economic or social
objectives, or both? The reason why I give that context is my
party&#146;s view that the current situation that we are 
seeking to amend&#151;though only in a modest
fashion&#151; is unreasonable. Somebody who earns
&#163;20,000 a year enjoys much less generous relief on their pension
contributions than somebody who earns &#163;120,000 a
year.</div>
<a name="09061850000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061850000190"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Field</b> (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con): The
reality of the relief is based on the highest rate of tax paid. That is
why the relief is notionally less generous for someone earning
&#163;20,000 than someone earning &#163;120,000. It is the nature
of that system. The system is not intrinsically wrong; the relief
focuses on tax that is already paid. It is relief on tax being
paid.</div><a name="09061850000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061850000191"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> The rationale given is that people will pay that
level of tax, but they may not. Somebody may earn a higher level of
income, but when they reach retirement age not actually be eligible to
pay the top rate. There are difficult choices to make. Everybody in the
Committee has to ask themselves whether, if we were starting from
scratch, the best way we could think of to spend billions of extra
pounds was to give additional relief on pension contributions to the
richest people in the country. Or, as my party is proposing&#151;I
will come to this, but not at great length as I do not wish to test
your patience, Mr. Hood&#151;whether that money could be
spent more efficiently and effectively on people with lower incomes.
That is the sort of radical thinking that I would hope at least some of
the parties represented in the Committee would be willing to
consider.</div><a name="09061850000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
the Minister intervened on the hon. Member for Fareham, he said to the
Committee that the measures being put forward by the Government
affected only 1.5 per cent. of the population. What we have to remember
is that people who donate large amounts of money to political parties
and people who edit national newspapers are rather heavily represented
in that 1.5 per cent. of the population. I would not say for one moment
that that would in any way weigh upon our deliberations. I only observe
that that is the case. Everybody in the Committee would do well to
acknowledge that, rather than to pretend that there is not a degree of
realpolitik affecting our
considerations.</div><a name="09061850000142"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061850000195"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> Thank you, Mr. Hood. I am too often
affected by my own modesty&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Laughter.</i><i class="I">]</i> My
party, as I should remind the Committee, finished second in the
national vote share in the local elections earlier this month. But in
terms of the numbers of Members of Parliament in this House, we are
third.</div>
<a name="09061850000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suppose
there is a reasonable case to be made that we are not sufficiently
considerate of the financial sensibilities of newspaper editors and
potential big donors to political parties when we make our
contributions to this Finance Bill Committee. A wiser way to order our
affairs would be to give greater incentives to people on low incomes to
work and have greater self-reliance; to allow them to keep a greater
proportion of their income and to finance that by ending pension relief
above the basic rate. That would be a better way to spend the money. It
would create a fairer society and at the same time a more economically
mobile and dynamic
society.</div><a name="09061850000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061850000196"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am not sure from whom the hon. Gentleman has been
receiving representations. If he has had letters from national
newspaper editors or the few wealthy donors to his party, perhaps he
should tell us. The people who have contacted me about this have been
pension advisers, self-employed people and people who pay contributions
on an annual basis who are in mainstream businesses. A large number of
people who are affected by this have made their concerns known. He
should be careful about whose motives he
impugns.</div><a name="09061850000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061850000197"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> A lot of people are choosing to make
representations. I acknowledge that not all of them edit national
newspapers. But I would be surprised if the hon. Gentleman had had
large numbers of representations from people with incomes of
&#163;10,000 or &#163;12,000 a year saying that the Government
should continue to give relief on pension contributions to people
earning &#163;200,000 a year as they would prefer that to raising the
starting threshold for income tax to &#163;10,000 as proposed by the
Liberal Democrats. I would be more than happy to give way to him if he
wishes to read out some of those representations, but I suspect he has
not had any. What he has had is representations&#151;they are
perfectly legitimate&#151;from interested parties such as those who
run pension funds and obviously want to see the maximum incentive for
people to contribute to those pension funds, including high
earners.</div>
<a name="09061850000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am trying
to step back and look at the scene as a whole. As I reminded the
Committee at the outset, we are running a massive public deficit. In
the United Kingdom people in the bottom decile pay a higher proportion
of their overall income in tax than those in the top decile. So we have
to ask whether we are spending money as effectively as we might by
giving very generous pension relief to relatively high earners and not
targeting those with much more modest
incomes.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column449" />Column number: 449</div><a name="09061850000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe we
could do much more for people on low incomes to give them incentives to
work. The tax burden on them, especially when they lose some benefits
as they earn money, is quite often a disincentive to work. Lots of
people on low incomes are, for my tastes, overly reliant on the
largesse of the state. I should like them to feel a greater sense of
self-reliance and to feel that their work and their endeavours helped
them to get on in life. That would be a better use of this money than
giving pension relief at a higher rate. My party&#146;s position is
that there should be some pension relief. We recognise that it is
valid, but we would restrict it to the basic
rate.</div><a name="09061850000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have made a modest step in that direction, which I fear
shows only their timidity at this stage of their life. Nothing has been
done for many years, and we now have this slightly messy and slightly
complicated proposal that will, as the Minister acknowledges, reach a
modest number of people. It will limit the relief to people with
earnings of more than &#163;180,000 a year. That could be seen as a
step in the right direction by someone who takes the view that I start
with, but the Government&#146;s timidity is unlikely to win them many
friends or bring in enough money to make a substantial difference.
There is a feeling that this is a gesture, rather than an attempt to
recast the tax system
meaningfully.</div><a name="09061850000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
only other matter that I want to touch on at this stage is one on which
I agree with the hon. Member for Fareham, as I often do. The Government
should re-examine the idea that people have normal patterns of pension
contributions, because it seems to be based on a mindset that everyone
has a monthly income&#151;a sort of pay-as-you-earn income. That is
often so, but may not be. People with different incomes and some who in
some years may not have any income, but in other years, quarters or
months earn a reasonable amount have contacted me saying that their
pension contributions are haphazard, and that they are not trying to
avoid taxation or behaving improperly, but that the nature of their
income is that the returns are not consistent over a year or a number
of
years.</div><a name="09061850000057"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061850000198"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> At the weekend, I received a representation from
someone who is not my constituent about exactly that point. He is a
free-lance contractor and had had no income for a couple of years, but
has landed a significant contract that will take him over the
&#163;150,000 threshold. He would be caught by the provision. If that
income had arisen in the first year and he was paying only modest
pension contributions this year, those contributions would be taxed at
20 per cent.</div>
<a name="09061850000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061850000199"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> That is precisely my point, and would have been
avoided if the Government had taken the route that I suggested of not
having the strange threshold kicking in at &#163;150,000 and having
basic rate relief for everyone. However, they have taken that route,
and the relief rate falls dramatically at that arbitrary figure. We
cannot describe it as a poverty trap, but it is an income trap for
people who may face a disincentive to go just over the threshold. They
may remain just under it, which would be a slightly perverse
consequence.</div><a name="09061850000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
nub of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point is that some
people&#151;those who run their own businesses are an obvious
example&#151;have big fluctuations in their income, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column450" />Column number: 450</div>depending on whether they secure a contract, or even on factors such as
the weather that may affect their business. Those people may lose out
in a way that the Government do not intend. I acknowledge that trying
to alter the legislation so that those people do not miss out could
provide greater scope for loopholes and may make it more complicated,
but I still think that there is an onus on the Government to
acknowledge the perfectly reasonable point made to the hon. Member for
Fareham over the weekend by a number of self-employed people. On that
note, we will have an opportunity to discuss the amendment in greater
depth, but that lays out my broad approach to the Government&#146;s
thinking in this
area.</div><a name="09061850000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061850000200"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> I agree with much of the thrust of the argument put
by the hon. Member for Taunton. Ultimately, this is quite a mess. We
are obviously in particularly difficult economic
times&#151;exceptionally difficult economic times. The cat was
slightly let out of the bag by the Minister when he pointed out that
98.5 per cent. of people would not be affected by the provisions. The
fear for many on our side is that much of this is driven less by
economic, financial, or any medium-term, let alone long-term fiscal
considerations, but much more by short-term political
considerations.</div>
<a name="09061850000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061850000201"></a>Mr.

symbolic.</div><a name="09061850000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061850000202"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> As the hon. Gentleman says, clamping down on higher
rate taxpayers in regard to pensions is a very symbolic move. As my
hon. Friend the Member for Fareham rightly says, we need to develop
much more certainty in the pensions system. Failure to provide that
certainty will be catastrophic for long-term saving. There have been
the mis-selling scandals, many of which were not anything like as
scandalous as the press would have us all believe. The pensions
industry caved in rather too quickly to a lot of the pressure in
relation to, for example, the sale of endowment mortgages and other
savings-type products, and the ongoing problems with Equitable Life. As
my hon. Friend rightly says, many people now think, &#147;Why on
earth put money into pensions?&#148;</div>
<a name="09061850000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Catastrophically,
in many ways, anybody under the age of 35 almost certainly will have
simply looked, insofar as they have any savings, to put them into the
property market, which has seen very good returns for most of the past
decade or so. We will see what happens to the property market in the
immediate term; it has had a more rocky time in the past 18 months.
That cannot be a very sensible situation. It begs the obvious question
about the in-built tax advantages of owning domestic property. If we
start to unravel that, certainty about long-term savings and
investments is undermined. My hon. Friend expresses a deep concern on
that point.</div>
<a name="09061850000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">One hears
various statistics bandied around&#151;the Minister will know them
better than me&#151;about the number of people who benefit from
higher rate tax pensions relief as a proportion of the overall money
that goes to pensions relief. The real issue is that we have got to
encourage people who earn rather less to save more, not the other way
round&#151;not try and equalise in this way. The practical reality,
and we should all be far more candid about this, is that the reason why
quite a lot of people in our society do not save for their pensions is
that they simply do not earn enough money to make any worthwhile
saving.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column451" />Column number: 451</div><a name="09061850000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061850000203"></a>Mr.
Jeremy Browne:</b> Next week, I think, the Saving Gateway
Accounts Bill comes back to the Commons. That is, in my view, a good
attempt by the Government to achieve precisely that objective, although
it is targeted at people with very low incomes. The hon. Gentleman is
probably talking about people who earn slightly more, but not enough to
necessarily be incentivised by these
measures.</div><a name="09061850000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061850000204"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right, but that
has always been the problem; there is that group in the middle, which
so often becomes larger and larger. Certainly in relation to house
prices, my constituency is massively polarised between people who are,
by any national standards, extremely wealthy and those who are so poor
that they qualify for social housing. That is increasingly becoming a
problem not just in the centre of our cities, but in many suburban
areas and is an issue that faces many of us as constituency MPs. Part
of the difficulty is that we need to try to encourage a saving culture.
We have to be realistic. A lot of people on relatively low wages with
relatively chaotic working patterns will never be able to save very
much. The welfare trap is also a pretty strong disincentive. People
take the view, &#147;Why save a relatively modest amount of money if
almost all of that is going to be taken away when it comes to
qualifying for pensions at a later stage in
life?&#148;</div><a name="09061850000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the Saving Gateway Accounts Bill, which was mentioned by the hon.
Member for Taunton, I cannot help thinking that if the Government
really wish to make a difference in this area they need to give the
green light to people trusting in our savings and pensions products,
not just for the next few years during the economic difficulties but
for decades to come. One of the most important elements of that has to
be certainty about treatment. My hon. Friend the Member for Fareham put
it extremely well when he said that this measure undermined that sense
of certainty about the pensions
treatment.</div><a name="09061850000143"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
am</div>
<a name="09061850000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">In many ways,
the real risk is that the overall pot that will be saved by everybody,
whether they are in the  98.5 per cent. or the 1.5 per cent. of
earners, is likely to diminish massively as confidence begins to drain
away that pensions can be a reliable way of looking after one&#146;s
future and a way of promoting self-reliance&#151;something that I
think all of us in the political classes would
support.</div><a name="09061850000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061850000205"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> We announced in the Budget that the Government
intended to restrict pension tax relief from April 2011 for people on
annual incomes of &#163;150,000  or more, as an important
contribution to the fiscal consolidation that is now required as a
result of the global crisis. The clause introduces schedule 35, which
protects the Exchequer from forestalling between now and April 2011.
That schedule comprises 13 pages.  I think that the hon. Member
for Fareham said 18, and I shall be vigilant for other arithmetical
errors that might arise during this debate. We will, of course, have a
number of debates about some of the detailed points that he has raised
in his
amendments.</div><a name="09061850000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall say a little about the background to the schedule. Restricting
pension tax relief for those on the highest incomes will be an
important part of consolidating the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column452" />Column number: 452</div>public finances in the medium term. To develop the perfectly fair
observation made by the hon. Member for Taunton, those with annual
incomes of &#163;150,000 or more represent, as I said in my
intervention, 1.5 per cent. of pension savers. Last year, that 1.5 per
cent. received a quarter of all pension tax relief received by pensions
savers. It is therefore right to address that disproportionate benefit
as part of fiscal consolidation. I go further, and say that it would
not be sustainable to allow that arrangement to continue, given the
scale of consolidation that is now required by the global
crisis.</div><a name="09061850000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061850000206"></a>Mr.
Jeremy Browne:</b> That is an interesting statistic. I wonder
whether the Minister knows what the proportion of total savings, or the
total percentage of revenue that is&#151;I am not putting this very
precisely am I, Mr. Hood? What proportion of the total
amount does upper rate relief, as opposed to basic rate relief,
constitute?</div>
<a name="09061850000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061850000207"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I am sure that I do, and I as soon as I remember I
will come back to the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="09061850000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061850000208"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> I shall do my best to forestall and filibuster
while that information comes
through.</div><a name="09061850000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
I tried to address in my brief contribution earlier was whether more
attention should not be paid by the Government to the 75 per cent.
rather than  the 25 per cent. of the pool, by trying to
encourage the  98.5 per cent. of people who will not be
affected by the measure to ensure that they invest rather more. We can
bandy around statistics that show a considerable skew in a particular
direction, but is not the risk that the lack of confidence and
certainty that is being brought in will have a detrimental effect on
many of the 98.5 per cent. who could be doing rather more to boost the
75 per cent. of relief that is passed on in their
name?</div><a name="09061850000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061850000209"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> The hon. Gentleman is, of course, right. We should
be attending to the incentives to saving in pensions for people on low
incomes, and we are doing that. The Saving Gateway Accounts Bill is a
good example of that, and the changes that we will introduce with
pension accounts in a couple of years are another. We have rightly been
very diligent in improving those incentives, but I disagree with the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s suggestion, which is a red herring, that
changing the arrangements for the highest-paid 1.5 per cent. will act
as a deterrent for people on lower incomes. There is no basis for that
suggestion. We need to be clear-sighted about the change that is being
made and the effect that it will
have.</div><a name="09061850000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">From
2011, tax relief on pension contributions or pension benefits accrued,
including contributions made by employers, which are currently an
untaxed benefit-in-kind, will be restricted to 20 per cent. for those
with incomes of &#163;150,000 and more. Of course, 20 per cent. is
the rate that people in the category that the hon. Gentleman referred
to receive
currently.</div><a name="09061850000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have already started to talk with the industry and pension savers about
how best to implement the change, and we will issue a formal
consultation in due course. To have introduced the changes ahead of
April 2011, before there had been time to consult properly, would have
risked disruption for savers, employers and pension schemes. I believe
everyone understands that this is a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column453" />Column number: 453</div>complex change. We need to get the details right, and that will take
some time. However, a gap between the announcement on Budget day and
implementation in April 2011, in the absence of the clause and
schedule, would have allowed those who will be affected to attempt to
forestall the new rules, and, in doing so, to obtain even more tax
relief for pension
saving.</div><a name="09061850000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
71 and schedule 35 protect the loss of at least &#163;2 billion over
the next two years which could arise from people on incomes of more
than &#163;150,000 who are affected by the restriction of higher rate
relief on pension contributions increasing their contributions or rate
of pension benefit accruals now, to get the benefit of the higher rate
tax relief that will not be available in the
future.</div><a name="09061850000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
legislation also looks to protect normal pension-saving behaviour and,
as far as possible, to allow for different types of pension
arrangements without putting tax revenues at risk. I do not agree with
the hon. Member for Taunton on this. The principle that regular pension
saving should continue to benefit from higher rate relief up until 2011
is right, but we need to ensure that there is not an invitation to
others to pile in and take advantage of relief which they would not
otherwise have taken advantage of and which they will not be able to
take advantage of from
2011.</div><a name="09061850000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061850000210"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I do not know whether the Minister can provide some
clarity on his estimates of the take from the measure. The Red Book
says that the take will be &#163;200 million for 2011-12, and in a
footnote states that the yield will be &#163;3.1 billion for 2012-13.
He said that the anti-forestalling measures could save about &#163;2
billion of revenue over the next two years. Could he be a bit more
transparent about the Government&#146;s estimates of revenue raised
from the measure? They are not particularly clear at the moment, and
that is not helped by the absence of an
RIA.</div><a name="09061850000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061850000211"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> The figures in the Red Book are correct:
&#163;200 million in 2011-12, and &#163;3.1 billion in 2012-13.
They represent in-year yields from restricting tax relief to people
with incomes of &#163;150,000 or more on individual contributions and
those made by their employers. The &#163;200 million yield scored in
the first year is due to restricting the relief for individuals with
personal pensions through
PAYE.</div><a name="09061850000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">These
are cautious estimates. We made reasonable adjustments for behaviour
and for flexibility around how the measure is implemented, on which we
said that we will consult. Of course, there is some uncertainty about
precisely what the response will
be.</div><a name="09061850000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061850000212"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Minister&#146;s case would be strengthened if
a bit more information were made available to members of the Committee
about the revenue raised by the measure. We suddenly go from
&#163;200 million to &#163;3.1 billion, and he refers to
&#163;2 billion. There needs to be a bit more clarity from the
Government about how they achieved those figures so that we can be
certain that they stand up to scrutiny. I would be happy if he wrote to
us on that.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column454" />Column number: 454</div><a name="09061850000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061850000213"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I do not think that I need to write to the hon.
Gentleman. The estimate that I gave of &#163;2 billion reflects a
behavioural assumption that about 70,000 people would have made
additional pension contributions in 2009-10 and 2010-11 in the absence
of the anti-forestalling measure announced at the Budget. That estimate
is based on some detailed modelling of taxpayer data on incomes and
pension contributions.</div>
<a name="09061850000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">To achieve
the effect that I have described, the schedule introduces a special
annual allowance. Those people with an annual income of &#163;150,000
or more are able to receive relief at the marginal rate on whichever
sum is higher of their normal regular pension savings or
&#163;20,000. The aim is to remove the advantage of increasing
pension savings above the normal pattern. That advantage is removed by
means of a special annual allowance charge, which will apply only if
three conditions are met. The first is that the person&#146;s income
is &#163;150,000 or more; the second is that they increase their
level of pension savings beyond their normal regular pension savings on
or after 22 April 2009; and the third is that they make total annual
pension contributions in excess of &#163;20,000. That arrangement
strikes a balance between protecting tax revenues, protecting normal
contribution patterns and minimising burdens on
industry.</div><a name="09061850000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
anti-forestalling legislation will affect only a very small proportion
of people. We think that it is right that it should apply to those
people with incomes of &#163;150,000 or more. To be robust against
avoidance, the definition captures those who have had incomes of more
than &#163;150,000 in this year or any of the previous two tax years.
Otherwise, we do not need to affect people on annual incomes that are
less than &#163;150,000 at all.</div>
<a name="09061850000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
said, the schedule includes provisions to protect normal regular
monthly or quarterly pension savings made under arrangements that were
in place on Budget day. That applies equally to contributions made to
money purchase schemes and defined-benefit schemes. Generally,
protection will also apply to changes in pension contributions or
benefits accruing that could occur due to events such as career
progression, change of employment or early retirement. The special
annual allowance has been set at &#163;20,000, which we will have a
debate about in a moment. That is to provide a reasonable balance for
the groups affected, while retaining the overall aim that the interim
regime should be cost-neutral. Setting the threshold for the special
annual allowance any higher than &#163;20,000 across the board would
significantly raise the costs of these
arrangements.</div>

Jeremy Browne:</b> I thought that the Minister was about to
come to an end. I just wanted to ask him one further question before he
sat down. Can he confirm that the Government&#146;s projected
borrowing assumptions take into account the revenue that will accrue
from this measure in future years?</div>
<a name="09061850000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061850000215"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> Yes I can. As I have said, the measure is part of
the fiscal consolidation that is required. Also, I have now remembered
the answer to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s earlier question. It is that
65 per cent. of tax relief on pensions goes to higher rate
taxpayers.</div><a name="09061850000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
recognise that for some people with less regular contribution
patterns&#151;they have been mentioned in the debate already and we
will come back to discuss 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column455" />Column number: 455</div>them later&#151;the &#163;20,000 special annual allowance represents
a lower pension contribution than they have typically made in the last
few years. That is why, in my written statement to the House on Budget
day and in subsequent discussions with representative bodies, we have
made it clear that we welcome views on whether there are ways of
ensuring that those people with less regular contribution patterns can
be protected in the interim regime while continuing to meet our
objectives. In particular, it is important that the arrangements remain
effective against the risk that forestalling behaviour will
significantly increase the cost of pensions tax relief for the
wealthiest people.</div>
<a name="09061850000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
continuing to talk to industry and gather information about those
people who are making non-regular contributions above &#163;20,000 a

return to this issue on Report if we conclude that action on it is
necessary.</div>
<a name="09061850000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
regulation-making power here, so that we can, if required, make
provisions for other forms of regular pension contributions to be
protected. The anti-forestalling legislation also includes specific
provisions to prevent avoidance. The regulation-making power means that
we can react quickly if it becomes clear that people are taking
advantage of the regime, but the power to tighten the rules can be used
only prospectively, not retrospectively. There is also a power to amend
the rate of tax, which we will use to amend the rate of the special
annual allowance charge, following the implementation of the new 50 per
cent. rate from 2011. The power is subject to the affirmative
procedure, so the regulations will be available for debate in the
House.</div>

back to the suggestion that we are discouraging pension savings, I do
not think that that applies at all to people on modest incomes. Even
those on high incomes who are affected will still benefit from higher
rate tax relief on &#163;20,000 of pension savings in a year, and
will receive basic rate tax relief on the rest, so there are still good
reasons for them to save in a pension. The hon. Member for Fareham read
out a couple of quotes, so let me read a few back to him from the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061850000219"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> As the Minister said in the debate on clause 71,
setting to one side the issue of regular contributions, someone earning
more than &#163;150,000 a year will get full tax relief on
contributions up to &#163;20,000. The purpose of my amendments is to
probe the Government&#146;s thinking about the level at which they
set that threshold. I argue that the threshold should be increased to
&#163;50,000.</div><a name="09061850000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I said in the previous debate, the A-day regime replaced a complex set
of rules, and was meant to simplify them and make it easier for people
to save in a more sensible way. One rule that was swept away was the
cap on pension contributions. Prior to the changes, people who were
under 50 could make pension contributions of 17.5 per cent. of their
net relevant earnings. On that basis, someone earning &#163;150,000
could make contributions of up to &#163;26,000. For people over 51,
the rate increased from 17.5 per cent. to 30 per cent., so that on an
income of &#163;150,000 they could make a maximum contribution of
&#163;45,000.</div><a name="09061850000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister could have drawn inspiration from the pre A-day legislation to
come up with a cap as a proportion of salary when that income exceeds
&#163;150,000 or a higher monetary cap to reflect those pre-existing
rules. The cap is an important issue, because it will particularly
affect those without the regular contribution pattern to which the
Minister referred. I know that we will talk about that in some length
in the debate on the group of amendments headed by amendment 228, but
it is important to point out that the measure creates a distortion in
the system, because if someone is earning &#163;140,000 at the
moment, they could make a contribution of, for example, &#163;90,000
and gain relief at 40 per cent. on that contribution. That would be a
generous relief, and is a consequence of how the measure is structured.
However, a person with an income of &#163;150,000 without a regular
contributions record could be limited to receiving relief at the higher
rate on &#163;20,000. A mismatch has arisen, as people earning below
the threshold will do quite nicely from the tax relief, but those above
the threshold without a regular pattern of contributions will be
limited to &#163;20,000. One way in which the Government could deal
with regular contributions and the application of the measure to people
with an irregular contribution pattern, is to increase the annual
allowance to create a much more flexible regime for those earning more
than &#163;150,000. With that in mind, I have tabled amendment 198
and the other amendments in the group.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column457" />Column number: 457</div><a name="09061850000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061850000220"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> We set the special annual allowance at
&#163;20,000, with very careful regard to typical levels of
contributions, to provide a reasonable balance for those affected while
retaining the overall aim, which is that the interim regime over a
couple years should be revenue neutral. The special annual allowance
introduced in the schedule strikes a balance between protecting tax
revenues and normal contribution patterns and minimising burdens on
pension providers. Individuals will receive relief at the marginal rate
up to the higher limit of their normal regular pension savings and the
special annual allowance of &#163;20,000. Amendments 198 and 199
would increase the allowance from &#163;20,000 to &#163;50,000
across the board. They would significantly increase the generosity of
the regime and would not be well targeted. The cost of providing relief
to those on the very highest incomes would be increased, costing around
&#163;750 million over the two
years.</div><a name="09061850000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061850000221"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am interested by the Minister&#146;s comment
about the cost of increasing the threshold from &#163;20,000 to
&#163;50,000 and the fact it is &#163;750 million out of a
&#163;2 billion estimate. There is a need for clarity
because, when looking at the cost, the Committee would be interested to
know what element of the revenue raised by the measure comes from
capping regular contributions and what element comes from the
&#163;20,000 cap. We do not have any clarity on how the measure will
bite in
practice.</div><a name="09061850000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061850000222"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b><b class="B"> </b>The &#163;750 million comes from the fact
that under the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment, many people earning
&#163;150,000 or more would be able to contribute substantially more
to their pensions over the next couple of years than they would have
expected. They will thereby benefit from full higher rate relief, which
will not be available from 2011. There are clearly some assumptions
there about how people will behave, but we are certainly talking about
a substantial increase in the cost of those arrangements if the cap was
lifted in that way. &#163;20,000 has been set, so that the
arrangements are pretty much revenue neutral, and there will be a small
cost of &#163;20 million over the two years from setting the cap at
that
level.</div><a name="09061850000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
200 and 201 would alter the amount of someone&#146;s pension
contribution that can be deducted in calculating whether their income
is above &#163;150,000, raising it from &#163;20,000 to
&#163;50,000. That would be very expensive and open further
opportunities for avoidance. Were the amendments to be made, anyone
with gross income of up to &#163;200,000 would be able to make
pension contributions of between &#163;50,000 and &#163;245,000,
because their taxable income would have been reduced to below
&#163;150,000. Amending the definition of income as proposed would be
costly. Adopting a more generous definition of taxable income allowing
for &#163;50,000 deductions in the form of contributions alongside a
special annual allowance of &#163;50,000 would have a total cost for
both measures, we estimate, of &#163;800 million. I do not see the
justification for increasing relief in that way for the best-off people
in the country by such a large
extent.</div><a name="09061850000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061850000223"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Does the Financial Secretary not accept my point
about the differential effect that that will have on people on either
side of the boundary line for income? Someone earning &#163;140,000
could make a &#163;90,000 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column458" />Column number: 458</div>contribution and receive 40 per cent. tax relief, but someone earning
more than &#163;150,000 who has not had a regular pattern of
contributions would only receive relief at 40 per cent. on
&#163;20,000 of contributions. There is a mismatch arising from the
way in which the &#163;150,000 limit has been
introduced.</div>
<a name="09061850000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061850000224"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I am not really sure that there is a mismatch,
because a person earning &#163;140,000 will continue to be able to
enjoy full higher-rate relief from 2011 onwards. We are trying to
ensure that those who will be affected by the arrangement from 2011 are
not in a position to be able to forestall, and that is what the
arrangements effectively address. Given that explanation, I hope that
the hon. Gentleman will be able to withdraw those costly
amendments.</div>
<a name="09061850000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061850000225"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The point that emerges from the Financial
Secretary&#146;s remarks is not so much the cost but the crude way in
which the measure will impact on people. Someone earning less than
&#163;150,000 could potentially enjoy more tax relief than someone
earning &#163;150,000 who does not have a regular pattern of
contributions. There is a clear dividing line&#151;I hate to use the
phrase&#151;between those just under the threshold and those just
over it, with regard to what they are able to claim in tax relief.
Someone who does not have a regular pattern of contributions will be
disadvantaged, but someone earning &#163;150,000 with regular
contributions of &#163;30,000 could enjoy the full relief. If they do
not have a regular pattern of contributions, full tax relief will be
limited to &#163;20,000. A problem is emerging, partly as a
consequence of the treatment of regular
contributions.</div>
<a name="09061850000115"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061850000226"></a><b class="B">Mr.
</b><b class="B">Jeremy </b><b class="B">Browne:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman
accept that he is making a compelling argument for the case that I
made? If everyone enjoyed pension relief at the basic rate, there would
be no threshold and no anomaly. Not only would lots of extra revenue be
available to have a more economically efficient and socially just
country, but we would get rid of all the anomalies he is so concerned
about.</div><a name="09061850000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061850000227"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am not sure that I am making a compelling
argument for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposals, but then I did not
think that he made a compelling argument himself in the stand part
debate. However, I will let that one pass by. Some people, because of
the hard threshold of &#163;150,000, will not enjoy the same pension
tax relief as people earning a slightly lower salary. That perhaps goes
back to the issue of a regular contribution pattern to which the
Financial Secretary has referred and which we might address later. My
amendment would soften the blow of regular contributions and the issues
surrounding them. It may not be the most effective way of doing so, but
it is a suggestion about how to tackle the matter. However, I am much
more interested in the Minister&#146;s response to tackling this
issue in the context of amendment 228, so I beg leave to withdraw
amendment

relevant income to determine how the 20 per cent. charge will be
levied. In essence, it is a very broadly based definition of income. In
paragraph 2(2), we learn that relevant income calculation
applies not only to the tax year in question but to the tax year before
that and the one before that. If someone was earning &#163;30,000 a
year, but had had a temporary boost in their earnings two years ago
from, say, the sale of a business, he would be subject to the
restrictions in these measures. This provision, therefore, captures
people whom the Government might not necessarily want to
catch.</div>
<a name="09061850000145"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am</div><a name="09061850000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me give some other examples. A businessman might have sold his business
and had a one-off boost to income. We know that as a consequence of the
recession a number of people have been made redundant. Someone could
have been made redundant in 2008-09 and received a very generous
package which could well have taken him into the &#163;150,000-plus
bracket. He may find another job in 2009-10 that pays &#163;40,000,
but decides that because he is now in employment he will use some of
that redundancy package to top up his pension. He might make a
&#163;40,000 contribution. Because he has earned more than
&#163;150,000 in the past, there will be a restriction on the tax
relief he earns, even though he may now be a basic rate taxpayer. He
could have earned a bit more&#151;say &#163;60,000 or
&#163;70,000&#151;and be a higher rate taxpayer, receiving relief
at 40 per cent.</div>
<a name="09061850000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a result
of a one-off change in his income a couple of years ago, that person
has to face a restriction on the tax relief that he will get from
topping up his pension fund. That is part of the pitfall that comes
from having a charge that is based on past earnings contributions
rather than something that looks forward. Again, this is where the
iniquity of the &#163;150,000 limit comes in. Someone whose earnings
have fallen from &#163;150,000 to &#163;80,000 would lose tax
relief, whereas someone whose earnings were &#163;149,000 and fell to
&#163;80,000 would not, and that does not seem right. We must think
very carefully about whether the scope for manipulation of income and
pension contributions is sufficient to justify punishing those people
who would be entitled to relief now but will not benefit from it
because of a fluctuation in their income several years ago. Amendments
202 and 203 will address that issue by removing all references to
previous tax years so that a person is only judged on their income for
this tax year and not for their income in previous tax
years.</div><a name="09061850000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
204 concerns the effects of these measures on people approaching
retirement. There is a tendency for people who are approaching
retirement to focus a bit more on their future pension provision, and
to think about making larger contributions. They have perhaps paid off
their mortgage and have some more spare 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column460" />Column number: 460</div>income. Their interests, and how they spend their money, might change,
and they might begin to focus more on their upcoming retirement. They
might therefore want to contribute more to their pension pot. They
might want to achieve a particular level of income, so the later they
start, the higher their contributions will have to be. The loss of the
higher rate relief might well restrict their ability to save adequately
for retirement. Furthermore, the sporadic nature of the income of
someone with a small business might make it difficult for them to save
earlier in their
lives.</div>
<a name="09061850000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 204
would assist people approaching retirement by enabling them to top up
their pension pot more flexibly. It is a fairly crude amendment, and
doubtless the Minister will tell me just how much it will cost, but it
raises a legitimate concern that we need to bear in mind. If he accepts
my argument, perhaps we can return to it on Report to find other ways
of providing for more flexibility in the system to help people
approaching retirement who feel the need to top up their pension pots
by significant amounts. That could ensure that they have a decent
income on which to live and prevent their having to fall back on the
state.</div><a name="09061850000126"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061850000231"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> People in the income bracket that we are talking
about are very often in a position to renegotiate their pay packages or
delay the taking of income into a later tax year. That is why the
schedule includes the three-year income rule. Otherwise, there would be
a fairly open invitation to people to change their income and so avoid
the
provisions.</div><a name="09061850000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the point about people receiving big redundancy payments, I should
point out that the first &#163;30,000 of any payment would not count
towards income as calculated in the schedule. Even if a payment is more
than &#163;30,000 and takes the person into the &#163;150,000-plus
bracket, they will be affected by the special annual allowance charge
if they make additional, non-regular pensions savings, and only then if
the total savings are more than &#163;20,000 in the year concerned.
However, average total pension contributions by people in that position
will be less than
&#163;20,000.</div><a name="09061850000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important to bear in mind that, for the majority of pension savers,
schedule 35 changes nothing. They will still benefit from generous tax
relief on their pension savings. Without the rules that we are putting
in place, forestalling is more likely to be undertaken by people over
50, because they are more likely to have access to the ready cash
required. They would not have to wait so long to retain the tax-free
lump sum. I therefore urge the hon. Gentleman not to press amendment
204, because it would be an invitation to avoidance. Of those with an
income of &#163;150,000 or more, it is likely that many are aged over
50 and will have access to the most spare
cash.</div><a name="09061850000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the point about people selling a business, I can reassure the hon.
Gentleman that capital gains are not included in the definition of
income in the schedule. I hope that that is reassuring. He also invited
me to tell him how much his amendment would cost. It would cost
&#163;300 million this year, &#163;700 million next year and
&#163;1 billion
altogether.</div><a name="09061850000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061850000232"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for providing the
costs at the tail end of his speech. I knew that they would come in due
course. The Minister made clear the Government&#146;s starting point,
which is to minimise any 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column461" />Column number: 461</div>tax leakage. That is the clear thrust of the measure. A balance needs to
be struck, but my concern is that, in the Government&#146;s desire to
minimise tax leakage, there is a risk that they will
overlook&#151;</div>
