<H3><center><a href="/pa/cm199798/cmbills/062/1997062.htm">Bank of England Bill</a></center></H3>
<H4><center>Clause 10</center></H4>
<H4><center>Operational responsibility</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury </B>(Mrs. Helen Liddell): I support clause 10, which is an integral part of the Bill. Although we have rehearsed a number of the arguments that relate to it on the Floor of the House, I want to give coherence to our discussions by putting on record that the clause gives the Bank operational responsibility for monetary policy decisions. It removes the Treasury's powers to direct the Bank with respect to monetary policy. That is a significant change in the role of the Bank of England because it gives the Bank the right to determine the rate of inflation in line with the targets set by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I am sure that we will have an interesting debate and, as we have already discussed the matter, I will not take up more of the Committee's time. I will be happy to answer hon. Members' questions.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Butterfill. Your post was more than adequately filled by Mrs. Dunwoody at our previous sitting, but we are very pleased to see you as the official alternate Chairman.
<P>
We now start to consider part II, which might be considered to be the main part of the Bill. I want to dwell a little on clauses 10 and 11, which effect the major transfer of policy from the Treasury to the Bank.
<P>
Clause 10 paves the way for later clauses, and makes it explicit that the Treasury will no longer give the Bank directions over monetary policy. It refers back to the Bank of England Act 1946, of which I have obtained a copy. It is a refreshingly brief document for such an important measure--I think that in some respects Governments legislated better in those days. The Act is remarkable for what it does not say, as well as for what it does say. With regard to clause 10, it maintains the Treasury's power of direction
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``except in relation to monetary policy.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I should like to explore with the Economic Secretary what is meant by monetary policy in the clause, because that phrase appears to go rather wider than the setting of interest rates. We know from Second Reading, and from elsewhere in the Bill, that the Bank is to take over the specific power to set interest rates to try to reach the Government's inflation target. Responsibility for monetary policy remains with the Treasury, but that for the setting of interest rates goes to the Monetary Policy Committee in the Bank of England. That is a much narrower concept than that of monetary policy generally. Will the Economic Secretary explain whether, and to what extent, other aspects of monetary policy will become the exclusive preserve of the Bank of England and free from Treasury direction?
<P>
The Bill envisages that the Bank's changed role will not simply consist of the Monetary Policy Committee setting monthly interest rates. The Bank will retain, and, in some respects, develop, a number of other policy areas, all of which relate to monetary policy. It will continue to be the banker of the last resort and so will have an important role in the banking system as a whole. Coinage will remain the responsibility of the Bank and it may have a decisive impact on exchange rate policy. I understand that the Bank will also retain some foreign exchange reserves in order to influence exchange rate policy when necessary, and we all know that exchange rate policy is a feature of monetary policy, which is not just setting interest rates. In its other activities, then, the Bank will have a great influence on the quantity of money in circulation.
<P>
Management of Government debt will now be taken away from the Bank of England and given to the Treasury, perhaps even hived off to some quango responsible to it. Banking supervisory functions will also be removed from the Bank. We will outline our major concerns about that later. The residue of duties heavily influences monetary policy in a number of important respects. In those other aspects will the Bank be free of direction from the Treasury?
<P>
Only today, an article in The Times reports the Governor's opinion on the adequacy of the interest rate target. He is reported as speculating that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the existing 2.5 per cent. rate may be too high for entry into a European single currency.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He was speaking quite properly in his capacity as Governor of the Bank of England, ranging more widely than the setting of interest rates, dealing with the inflation target itself. The clause may have been designed with remarks such as that in mind, allowing the Governor the freedom to range more widely over monetary matters. It requires a clear explanation of the scope of the Treasury's interference--or lack of it--in general monetary policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Butterfill, and I start by welcoming the clause. My party has long been in favour of the operational independence of the Bank of England and we are pleased that the Bill is progressing with this clause at its heart.
<P>
It is notable that the speech of the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) ignored the key issue of principle and failed to outline where his party stands on it. That is not surprising given the Conservative party's record on inflation and its lack of position on this key matter of economic policy.
<P>
I hope that I am not stealing the Minister's best lines when I say that the previous Government presided over two periods of high inflation. Conservative Members cannot claim that they have a strong record on inflation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): Would the hon. Gentleman not concede for the record that the previous Government achieved excellent rates of inflation under previous monetary arrangements? They were on target and the rates were the lowest for many years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> An inflation record should be judged over a longer period than a few years. Over 18 years, there were two major inflationary periods. Two out of the previous Government's five Chancellors--Lord Lawson and Norman Lamont--have expressed support for an independent central Bank. At least I share one policy view with my predecessor in Kingston.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells will not set out his party's position because it lacks clarity. Some members of the Conservative party strongly support the policy while others vehemently oppose it, especially the aspects that relate to Europe. The Conservative party is in a state of confusion and flux about the issue, and is, therefore, unable to challenge the policy effectively.
<P>
The hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) described the policy as a piffling measure when he compared it with the 1979 Conservative measure to abolish controls on foreign exchange movements. That shows where the hon. Gentleman's interests lie, but does not provide an analysis of the policy's impact.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): The hon. Gentleman talks about party divisions, but there is no divison on the Conservative Benches on the issue. We oppose the Bill. On Second Reading, there were several abstentions on the Government Benches and three Labour Back Benchers spoke against the Bill. Will the hon. Gentleman comment on that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I referred to the Conservative party's policy on an independent central bank. Conservative Members have not made it clear whether they would repeal the Bill were they to return to government in 20 or 30 years' time. Before they can justifiably make serious criticisms of the policy, they must explain whether they would take back power over monetary policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> As one of the few Members of Parliament who can claim with complete accuracy that my late father knew Lloyd George, I ask the hon. Gentleman whether a Liberal Democrat Government, if surprisingly elected, would return to the legislative position of 1922.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I assure the hon. Gentleman that we would not turn back the clock to 1922. However, the key point of my contribution is that we know where we want to be in 20 years' time. We have an agenda for the future. The Conservative Opposition cannot state their intentions. Their failure to unite after their election defeat is telling.
<P>
Before the Minister congratulates me on my support for her, I want to express a note of caution. Why is the Conservative party so befuddled by the Government's policies? Why is it unable to make a coherent attack? Perhaps because it believes in the Government's policies. It may support the policy we are considering, as well as measures to cut lone parent and disability benefits, and the public expenditure squeeze on hospitals and education. Perhaps the Conservative party finds it difficult to criticise the Government for such policies. The Liberal Democrats do not support all the Government's measures, even if we agree with the important policy that we are discussing.
<P>
I want to put on record the reasons for our support for both the theory and the practice of operational independence. I am a student of economics, and I enjoy the theory behind economic policies. When I was at university, I had to read for my sins some of the detailed mathematical works that provide a backbone for the policy.
<P>
One summer's afternoon, when I could have employed my time more usefully on the tennis court or on the cricket field, I remember being locked up in the library at Jesus college, Oxford. I was reading an interesting paper by Professor Kydland entitled ``Intertemporal inconsistency of monetary policy''. I was told by my tutor that that provided the academic underpinning for the modern economic school that stresses the importance of credibility in monetary policy. Economic agents in all spheres and sectors should have consistent inflation expectations over time, and that requires a more credible monetary policy.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Various suggestions have been made over the years to make monetary policy more credible. The previous Conservative Government, during their first term of office, chose money supply targets in which the private sector were supposed to believe. That was then supposed to influence inflationary expectations, and thus make the control of inflation much less costly. As we all know, those targets were a complete failure, partly because they targeted the wrong measures of money supply and partly because of the way that the private sector adjusted to the Government's running of economic policy.
<P>
The next experiment designed to create a framework of credibility for monetary policy was the entry into the exchange rate mechanism. At the time, that policy had all-party support. Indeed, for several years, it was effective in reducing inflationary expectations and played a major part in reducing the inflation caused by the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, Lord Lawson. It played an important role in reintroducing stability into the economy, although, admittedly, at the cost of a major recession. However, I believe that that recession can be blamed on Lord Lawson's original inflationary policies. Membership of the exchange rate mechanism gave credibility to the monetary policy that was applied to attacking the boom of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
<P>
The problem with an external exchange rate anchor for providing credibility is that other people can blow it apart. That happened on what may be called black or white Wednesday, depending on one's point of view. For a number of complex reasons, the foreign exchange markets decided that that external anchor was no longer credible.
<P>
The third option is an institutional change to provide the credibility that is important in providing consistent expectations of inflation. It involves the creation of an independent central bank. An independent central bank provides credibility because the incentives on central bankers are different from those on politicians. When facing an election or political crises prior to an election, politicians may be prepared to take short-term measures that take risks with the long-term future of the economy and the long-term performance of inflation.
<P>
We saw such pressures on politicians operate time and again under the previous Government. They caused the two major inflations we experienced during the past 18 years, and, in particular, they led to many ill-judged monetary policy moves. For example, interest rate cuts repeatedly took place before party conferences or during periods of great political instability in the Conservative Administration.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Gentleman's arguments have forced me to stand up when I do not really want to. His description of this country's economic history is a travesty of the truth. Is he not aware of the Bank of England's advice during that period, and, particularly, of the interest rate cuts that took place in March, April and May 1987?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The hon. Gentleman gives me an opportunity to develop my argument a little further. The case for an independent central bank is qualified by a paper written by Milton Friedman. He refers to the importance of the characters of the governor and the governing committee of any central bank. An independent central bank is not a fail-safe solution. It is the best of the potential options. At the time, although the Bank of England may have made mistakes, the Government, who were in charge of monetary policy, made even more; after all, they went along with that policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Murphy </B>(Eastwood): Like the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb), I had no intention of speaking at this time. However, I want to say that I agree with the hon. Gentleman that interest rates were manipulated by and for Conservative party conferences. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton suggests that that is historically inaccurate. Why, then, for three consecutive years in the 1980s, did interest rates fall in the same week of the year? Spectacularly, in those three years, the United Kingdom's long-term economic interests could have benefited as a consequence of interest rate cuts in that week, or it could simply have been that the Conservative Chancellor was addressing the Conservative party conference in that week, three years in a row.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interventions should be brief; they are not meant to be speeches.
<P>
<B>Mr. Murphy:</B> Thank you, Mr. Butterfill. I rose merely to echo the point made by the hon. Gentleman and to ask for his comments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> It was a most helpful intervention, as it gave some facts to back up my assertions. I completely agree with the hon. Gentleman. A graph showing the peaks and troughs of interest rates during the 18 years of the previous Conservative Administration would show clearly that the peaks tended to be mid-term and the troughs around the time of general elections. That is prima facie evidence that interest rates were manipulated for electoral purposes.
<P>
That is the key theoretical argument behind central bank independence. It weighs more heavily than arguments against it; for example, there is the argument that if fiscal and monetary policy are separated it prevents the fight against inflation being more effective. We have seen, internationally and in the United Kingdom, that if the objective that the Government set the Bank is low inflation they are likely to introduce a fiscal policy that backs up the monetary policy of the central bank. The argument that dividing responsibility will introduce incompatibility and confusion does not work in practice. The theoretical arguments seem clearly to support that assertion.
<P>
The empirical evidence suggests a strong correlation between central bank independence and lower inflation. Several studies reviewed by the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development clearly point to that conclusion. A broad sweep of history looking at the performance of the Federal Reserve bank in the United States and at the Bundesbank backs up that argument.
<P>
People who do not support the policy argue that there is no clear causation. It could be argued that because people in countries such as Germany and the United States dislike inflation more, perhaps, than our own people, they have been prepared to give the Bank greater independence. It is almost a self-perpetuating theory that countries with a loathing of inflation have low inflation and other countries, perhaps because of house prices, do not worry so much about it and have a poorer record on inflation. However, the causation argument does not stand up to analysis. It is argued that Germans hated inflation after their experience in the 1930s, but many other countries went through hyper-inflation and that has not convinced their people to accept low inflation policies.
<P>
The example of middle income countries in Latin America can be cited, but equally some developed countries in Europe that experienced dreadful inflation have not given their institutions the independence or strength to tackle it.
<P>
I am convinced that the empirical evidence backs up the case for central bank independence. The potential long-term gains for our economy, if lower inflation results from the policy, are huge. Not only will the price mechanism in our market economy operate more efficiently on resource allocation, but it will bring greater stability to our business. After short-termist policies have ended much lower interest rates--both short term and long term--will be likely. That effect will assist investment and employment. The gains to be made are huge, and theoretical and empirical evidence support the policies.
<P>
I am delighted to be able to support the Government unambiguously for once. However, I echo the question put by the right hon. Member for Wells about the definition of monetary policy in the clause. I hope that the relevant amendment tabled by me and my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) will provide an opportunity later for further probing of the government on that definition. In particular, I should like to know whether it is to include responsibility for the exchange rate. That is the crucial aspect of monetary policy that appears nowhere in the Bill. The Committee will need to establish the Government's intention in that respect.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will take the view that our support for the Government in the policy area that we are discussing strengthens our case when we oppose them on other aspects of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> That was as extraordinary a commentary on British economic history as I have ever heard. The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) spoke of two inflationary periods in the past 18 years. The first of those, as he well knows, was caused by the previous Labour Government and took place in the early 1980s. It was the Conservative Government's role to clear up the inflation left by them.
<P>
The second inflationary period, in late 1987 and early 1988, was due to the then Government's policy of shadowing the deutschmark. That policy was accepted by the Liberal Democrats, the Bank of England and the whole economic establishment; and that is the point. Giving the Bank of England independence will not change anything in such cases; the same theories that are current in academic circles and accepted by the general establishment in economic policy making will be pursued by the Bank of England. I do not believe that, had the Bank been independent in the mid-1980s, we would not have shadowed the deutschmark.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The hon. Gentleman puts the inflationary period of the mid-1980s down simply to the shadowing of the deutschmark. That is a complete misreading of history. Monetary policy was eased in 1985 before the deutschmark was shadowed. Fiscal policy was incredibly loose, with large tax cuts, and very bad misjudgments of fiscal policy were made--particularly with respect to the delay in the abolition of multiple mortgage tax relief, and its effect on the housing market in 1988. Those serious policy mistakes by the former right hon. Member for Blaby, Lord Lawson, directly caused inflation.
<P>
The shadowing of the deutschmark was not the optimal policy and we, as we said at the time, would have preferred early entry to the exchange rate mechanism, but the real cause of inflation was elsewhere.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The shadowing of the deutschmark was clearly a cause of inflation. The monetary policy of the time added something in the region of &#163;70 billion to &#163;80 billon excess demand to the economy; fiscal tax cuts in 1988 added between &#163;5 billion and &#163;6 billion. There is no comparison between the fiscal loosening in 1988 and the monetary loosening in the relevant period. The reason for the monetary loosening was the policy of shadowing the deutschmark. Interests rates were cut from 11 per cent. to 9 per cent. solely because the exchange rate was pushing beyond the limit of DM3 that the Government had set themselves. Most commentators accept the link between those events and inflation. To blame fiscal policy, which was, as a proportion of the problem, nothing in comparison with the monetary issue, is absurd. I am surprised that an Oxford economics graduate should be making such claims.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The hon. Gentleman misreads history again. He needs to look at the facts. In the summer of 1988, &#163;20 billion to &#163;30 billion was taken out on credit as an almost direct result of the Chancellor's failure to abolish multiple mortgage tax relief on the day of the Budget and the delay in his decision.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Those are precisely the consequences of a loose monetary policy. When interest rates are lowered, people take out more credit. Yes, one accepts that the decision to delay abolishing dual mortgage interest relief had a fiscal effect on demand in the economy, but that was small in relation to this loosening of monetary policy. The loosening of monetary policy was caused by the decision to shadow the deutschmark: the proportional difference between the two is colossal and it is clear that it is the monetary policy that caused the inflationary rise in late 1988.
<P>
The Treasury should have the power to give direction to monetary policy. Removing that direction removes from democratic control and accountability a principal lever of economic policy. In his paper for the Social Market Foundation, Robert Chote, the Economics Editor of the Financial Times wrote that an independent Bank of England would
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``weaken democratic control over a vital area of public policy.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Monetary policy and the conduct of monetary policy has such a fundamental effect on people's lives and is so fundamental a part of economic policy that it has to be in the hands of those who are elected to office. The notion that delivering the inflation target and using monetary policy is just a technical matter and that the targets should remain in the hands of elected politicians is pure nonsense.
<P>
Debates are going on the whole time between economists and politicians about how to translate an inflation target into monetary policy. There are the broad money economists who want to target M4; there are the narrow money economists who want to target M0; there are the Keynesians who do not target anything. A whole debate is going on and it is a political debate. It is not an exact science.
<P>
In paragraph 23 of the Treasury Committee report Mervyn King from the Bank of England is quoted as saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There is no single model, black box or otherwise, that enables you to simply project what will happen automatically irrespective of circumstances. Economics is not that precise.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Lord Eatwell when giving evidence said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There is a tendency in monetary policy matters to regard certain propositions as `obvious' and anyone who questions such propositions to be at best a nit-picking academic and at worst a crank. Yet the notion that the theory of monetary policy is `obvious' and `pragmatic' is belied by the fact that the theory and practice of monetary policy has undergone quite radical revisions over the past 20 years. If views held 10 or 15 years ago were so obviously right then, why are they so obviously wrong now? One has only to compare the copy of the Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin today, with a copy from, say 1981, to see what a dramatic change has taken place.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He then describes different types of economists with differing views of how monetary policy should be conducted. He says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``One group of theorists believes that there is no particular medium term relationship between a level of unemployment and the rate of inflation . . . Another group believes that the key relationship runs from the level of unemployment to the rate of inflation . . . For this group monetary policy is a means of controlling the level of output and so controlling inflation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He then describes a third group. Clearly there is a debate among economists about how to conduct monetary policy.
<P>
A supporter of an independent Bank of England, Samuel Brittan says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Both the Chancellor and the Governor of the Bank of England greatly overestimate the role of technical expertise.
<P>
</UL></FONT>	Politicians and `practical men' find it very difficult to understand that economics is a specialist subject, like philosophy, theology or art criticism, in which some people know more than others but there are nevertheless no right answers and no real authorities.
<P>
	Monetary economics is not a hard science.''
<P>
Tim Condon is also a supporter.

<P>

<B>Mr. Andy King </B>(Rugby and Kenilworth): How does the hon. Gentleman reconcile his position with that of Nigel Lawson, who made it clear in 1988 that the Bank's independence
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``would enhance the market credibility of our anti-inflationary stance both nationally and internationally . . . Above all there would be the longer-term advantage that we would be seen to be locking a permanent anti-inflationary force into the system?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This was backed by Norman Lamont, who said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I am delighted that Gordon Brown has decided to give the Bank of England full operational independence. This change is right, should have been done by Conservative Governments and Gordon Brown deserves full credit for a bold move.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
How can the hon. Gentleman reconcile his position today with that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on reading from his briefing paper. Clearly, opinions differ. I do not agree with Nigel Lawson that the Bank of England should be independent. We do not agree with the Bill, and will vote against it. Other Conservative politicians can be quoted. The late Lord Ridley had an opposing view. There is a debate in the country on the issues. We have decided that an independent Bank of England is not in the interests of the British economy.
<P>
Tim Condon, a supporter of the Bank of England, talks of there being at least
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``two main schools of thought''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
on monetary policy which can be identified. He spoke of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``economists (the National Institute, narrow-money monetarists such as Sir Alan Walters and Professor Patrick Minford) who believe that the rapid growth of the money supply since early 1995 is of no relevance to the economic situation, and that the over-valued pound and the recent rise in interest rates . . . may cause recession in late 1998 and 1999''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``other economists who believe that the rapid growth of the money supply, on the broad definitions, since early 1995 is not only the main reason for the current buoyancy of demand, but will cause continued above-trend growth in late 1997 and early 1998''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is a huge variety of opinions on how to conduct this country's monetary policy. It is absurd to say that the mere translation of an inflation target into monetary policy and decisions about interest rates is a technical matter. It is not.
<P>
<B>Jacqui Smith </B>(Redditch): The hon. Gentleman spent time pointing out something which all of us know, which is that economists differ among themselves on some of their assumptions and conclusions. Many hon. Members will be aware of the saying that if all the economists in the world were laid end to end they still would not reach a conclusion.
<P>
Does the hon. Gentleman agree that he has not yet addressed the fact that the underlying reason for this operational independence--so far, he has not denied it--is that taking away some of the political interference will reduce the political risk premium on long-term interest rates? That has been proved since the Chancellor took action after the election. Regardless of other disagreements among economists, there is evidence, and some agreement, that the policy is working.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> On the first of the hon. Lady's two points, it is necessary for a Government who are pursuing an anti-inflationary policy to have the people behind them. However dismissive one is of the democratic process, it is a fact that the people have to be behind the Government. Despite what the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton said, central banks around the world have one thing in common: they have the people's support. The Government must seek their support. It is up to them to explain to the people why anti-inflationary policies must be pursued, and they must win elections on that basis. If the Government do not have the people behind them, however much independence is given to the Bank of England, the policies will not work.
<P>
As regards short-term interest rates, I concede that the decision to announce independence for the Bank of England led to a fall in long-term yields, but at what cost?
<P>
The point about making the Bank of England independent is that it is a quick-fix panacea for dealing with the history of Britain--which is that Labour Governments, especially in the 1960s and 1970s, had a very high inflation record. The question is, do we overcome that pattern of history by adopting a quick-fix panacea--making the Bank of England independent--or by continuing the previous Conservative Government's low-inflation policies? During the 1980s the inflation rate was lower on average each year compared with previous years, and certainly compared with the 1970s. That is how to do it. The Conservative party's approach is better than making the Bank of England independent because of the cost of establishing the credibility of an independent Bank of England.
<P>
<B>Mr. Steve McCabe </B>(Birmingham, Hall Green): I want to ask two questions that relate to the hon. Member's remarks. First, he claims that the Conservative way is better, but are you not really saying that it gives you greater latitude? That is why the previous Chancellor dismissed all the comments made at the monthly monetary meetings published in the run-up to the previous election. Had he taken the Bank's advice and acted in the interest of the economy, he could not have kept interest rates at a level that you thought was politically advantageous. Is that not really what you are arguing?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is not me who thinks that.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCabe:</B> I apologise, Mr. Butterfill. Is that not really what the hon. Member is arguing?
<P>
Secondly, is the hon. Member utterly dismissive of the views of the CBI and the Institute of Management, which have broadly supported the Government's actions? They have argued in favour of them for a long time, and at one time tried to persuade the Conservative Government to take the same course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The setting of interest rates is not an exact science.
<P>
I want to continue from where I left off. I refer to paragraph 36 of the Treasury Committee report, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The crucial judgement we will be seeking to make during such a hearing will be whether, given available information, the Bank could reasonably have done better although we recognise that it may not be possible to reach an immediate decision on this issue.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, the Treasury Committee concluded that the Bank will try to do its best to meet the inflation target, but it may well fail. If it fails, it will have done its best and applied all the current economic theories to the issue. That is the difference between politicians and an unelected group of people. When such people are asked to deliver a target in an area of high political controversy, there is no great incentive for them to get it right. That is my crucial objection to giving independence to the Bank of England. Its officials and members of its committees can shrug their shoulders and say that they applied all the best economic theories, but that they were wrong and will try better next time. There is no imperative to get it right, whereas the prospects of politicans and political parties depend on getting it right, and they will debate such issues in public ad nauseam.
<P>
<B>Jacqui Smith:</B> The hon. Gentleman's comments denigrate those who work in the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England. Furthermore, he ignores the provision in the Bill that if the inflation target is missed by more than a percentage point in each direction, the Monetary Policy Committee is required to explain the reasons for that in an open letter to the Chancellor. Such a letter would obviously be open for scrutiny and would act as a control on the committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Is the hon. Lady saying, therefore, that when and if the Bank of England fails to achieve its policy target, it cannot be criticised, because to do so would be to criticise its officials, and civil servants and members of the hallowed Monetary Policy Committee? That is my point. The issues are crucial to people's everyday lives; they are crucial to businesses. Decisions on such issues are among the most important taken by Governments throughout the world. We have to debate such matters and to allow criticism of them. The people who take such decisions must be elected, because interest rates and economic success will depend on the policies that they adopt. I believe strongly that in a democracy elected politicians should make those decisions.
<P>
As for the letter to which the hon. Member for Redditch (Jacqui Smith) referred, what sanction would it have? It could be published and debated at the end of the month when the figures are wrong, and three months later another letter could be written. Will people lose their jobs as a result of such letters? If the Governor of the Bank were to lose his job, or if the members of the Monetary Policy Committee were to lose their positions because they were wrong, how would those positions be filled? Would a new Governor be chosen according to his economic views--according to whether he is a broad or a narrow monetarist, or a Keynesian? Such issues are crucial. The measure creates a new sort of politician, who, unlike other politicians, is not elected directly by the people.
<P>
Politicians should make the decisions because, if they get it wrong, at least the people's choice will have made the mistake, not an unaccountable official who can merely shrug his shoulders. In a free country, I can continue to criticise civil servants and Governors of the Bank of England if necessary. The Bank of England's record on giving the right advice is not good. ``The View from No. 11'' by Nigel Lawson is a great analysis of what went wrong in the 1980s.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
In late 1988, inflation rose to 10 per cent. or 11 per cent. On page 665 of the book, Nigel Lawson explains that in late 1986 M0 had been rising for some months and that that almost certainly reflected the strength of consumer spending. Therefore, as Chancellor, he wanted interest rates to rise. The book states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``On Thursday, 20 November . . . I warned the Bank that I would probably want to raise interest rates by one percentage point to 12 per cent. the following Monday (24 November). It was disappointingly resistant to the idea. Whereas I was now convinced by the evidence both of sterling and of M0 that monetary policy was in danger of becoming too lax and should be tightened forthwith, the Bank was above all concerned to avoid surprising the markets, which were not expecting an interest rate hike''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, the Bank's latest policy was not to surprise the markets.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jim Murphy:</B> I listened with interest to the hon. Gentleman's quote from Nigel Lawson's autobiography. However, the hon. Gentleman quotes selectively. The book also states that giving operational independence to the Bank of England would have enhanced the market credibility of the Government's anti-inflationary stance both nationally and internationally. Does the hon. Gentleman agree with that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> As I have already said, I disagree with that view. I quote from the book not simply to read out Nigel Lawson's opinions but to show that the Bank of England's advice on interest rates is not infallible. It will not become infallible in future. Turning an inflation target into monetary and interest rate policy is not an exact science; it is a political matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Kidney </B>(Stafford): In Mr. Lawson's autobiographical account, who had the final say on raising interest rates--the Bank of England Governor or the Chancellor of the Exchequer?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Chancellor of the Exchequer had the final say then, but that is not the point. I admit that mistakes were made in 1986. Inflation should not have risen to 10 per cent., and it would not have done so, had the Conservative Government not decided to shadow the deutschmark. That error was supported by all parties and most economists. The establishment believed that it was the right policy. The Bank of England also held that view and opposed the interest rate rise that the Chancellor proposed in late 1986.
<P>
In early 1987, it was decided to shadow the deutschmark at DM3. Interest rate cuts from 11 per cent. to 9 per cent. were made in March, April and May 1987 because the pound surged above the DM3 level. What was the Bank of England's advice? Did it oppose those cuts? Eddie George had the opportunity to do so, but he did not. He advised against interest rate cuts only in the autumn, not in the spring.
<P>
Page 639 of Nigel Lawson's book states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It is, I suppose, theoretically possible that the Bank from time to time believed that monetary policy should be tighter, but refrained from telling me--even at the markets meetings I regularly held with the Governor and his senior officials. But this would have amounted to a dereliction of duty so grave as to be unthinkable.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Bank of England is not infallible. It got things wrong, and there is no reason to suggest that it will not get things wrong again. 
<P>
Monetary policy is not an exact science. It is part of political debate, and politicians should lead the debate. They should make the decisions that arise out of the debate and take the consequences if wrong decisions are taken as a result.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Ainsworth </B>(Lord Commissioner to the Treasurey): On a point of order, Mr. Butterfill. I have some information for the Committee, members of the public following our proceedings and those serving the Committee in various capacities. Because of the business being dealt with on the Floor of the House this afternoon, and subject to sufficient progress being made, the intention is for the Committee not to sit this afternoon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I, too, had not intended to speak until I had heard the arguments of the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton.
<P>
I shall explain why I regard this as a piffling Bill, and this clause provides the best opportunity to do that. It is a piffling Bill despite its short-term effect and the dramatic announcements that were made. They have created an impact, but the Bill's effects in providing real control over monetary policy in the long term may be far more nebulous.
<P>
It is also a piffling Bill because it attacks a great British institution. The Bank of England is one of the finest financial institutions in the world. No other central bank in the world can claim the same track record in controlling inflation as the Bank of England. No country of similar size to ours can claim a superior credit standing in the debt markets of the world. It is a tragedy that the Bill will cause the Bank of England's functions to be split into three. The Bank will be left as a mere shadow of its former self.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCabe:</B> In view of that eulogy, to which Conservative Members should I listen? Should I accept the argument for giving greater independence to this great institution or the one that I listened to for the past 15 minutes? That argument denigrated the Bank and claimed that it got things wrong throughout the 1980s.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The hon. Gentleman will hear the answer in a moment. I entirely agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. The control and conquest of inflation is, above all, an act of political will: the searing memory of the Weimar Republic gave the German people the political will to control inflation after the war; the searing memory of the previous Labour Government gave this country the political will and determination to get on top of inflation.
<P>
It is a measure of the new Government's lack of confidence that, without consultation, they should announce this Bill to which this clause is the key. Equally, it is a measure of their lack of direction that what they appear to give with one hand in clause 10, they take away in other clauses and in their other political acts.
<P>
Last week, I asked the Chief Secretary to the Treasury about a report that appeared in The Guardian last Wednesday under the headline, ``Brown plots Bank clear-out''. That does not suggest much political independence for the Bank. Despite the Chief Secretary's denials on Thursday, that story was virtually repeated in the late edition of the Evening Standard. In an article, the newpaper's City editor, Mr. Hilton, explains some of the problems with the Government's proposed structure for the Bank's court. He writes that the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``will appoint recognisably pro-Labour people''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He points out that those up for reappointment
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``will not automatically be reappointed. That would give Brown six seats to play with.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Should we believe the Chief Secretary--or the spin doctors who plant these stories in the newspapers to mollify Labour Members--on account of the fact that, since the decision was made, interest rates have gone up again and again and are likely to continue to do so?
<P>
The issue comes back to confidence. There has been a concerted effort by Labour and Liberal Democrat Members to dent our confidence in the political will of a previous Conservative Government, who wished to bring down inflation, by attacking their record.
<P>
I support the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and should like to add three points. First, during the formation of monetary policy, the quality of information received by the Treasury--it emerges clearly in the book of the former Chancellor, Nigel Lawson--often poor. It is one of the previous Government's striking achievements that they sought to improve the quality and accuracy of information and thus gain a greater understanding of what was happening in the real world.
<P>
Secondly, the previous Government achieved major structural changes in our economy when it was not entirely clear just how effective the changes in the micro economy would be in improving the capacity for economic growth. I can well understand how policy makers, used to the sluggish performance of the sick man of Europe in the mid to late 1970s under the previous Labour Government, would not have believed that the monetary policy then pursued would lead, under the enterprising economy created by the Conservatives, to such an impressive--and in the end worrying--rate of growth.
<P>
Thirdly, we heard from Labour Members that the manipulation of interest rates was directed to political ends. However, they do not appreciate that the enterprise economy was then in its adolescence, which is why it behaved unpredictably and why political messages had to be given. The biggest political message of all was that, if we conquer inflation, we can deliver lower interest rates. That was absolutely right and I defend the changes in interest rates of the mid and late 1980s. They were necessary to reinforce the message that, after all the economic struggles and the pain of unemployment, the reward would be delivered: lower interest rates. It may have taken longer than we had hoped, but we did conquer inflation and we did deliver much lower interest rates.
<P>
We should bring the story up to date and reject the accusations made against the previous Conservative Chancellor. His experience with the Bank of England shows how important it is to understand that deciding monetary policy involves political and technical aspects. One of the worst results of the current Chancellor's decision to give operational independence over monetary policy to the Bank of England--at least in its early days, before he starts packing the court--is that he has passed on a key area of decision making, when difficult decisions must be made. It is one thing to make the Bank of England independent in monetary policy in a fallow, or stable, period. However, as we have seen only in the past few days, internationally as well as nationally, we live in a far from stable period, in which tactical decisions as well as those on long-term policy must be very brave. I have some sympathy with the school of thought that, far from a series of small interest rate increases since 1 May being the right policy, one or two larger interest rate increases would have been not just bolder and more decisive, but more effective. That would have administered the type of short-term shock that economies occasionally need. Under such a policy, the pound might never have reached the stratospheric heights of DM3.09 and might today be lower than it is, following the succession of decisions that have been made since 1 May in the new operating environment.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Jacqui Smith:</B> The hon. Gentleman's argument that the economy needed two or three large increases in interest rates since 1 May suggests that increases were also needed before that date. Does he agree that the crucial argument is that, if only a system had then existed that removed decisions on interest rates from political interference, the increases would have been made when inflationary pressures in the economy suggested that they were necessary? We would not then have needed the increases that the Government, through the independence that they have given the Bank, have been prepared to accept.

<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Very simply, the previous Government achieved their inflation target. The final announced inflation rate was 2.5 per cent. It would be extraordinary, in the month in which an inflation target was reached, to administer the punishment of a rise in interest rates. That is a political point, which I shall defend to the last. However, over and above that argument, in a world where currency rates can fluctuate dramatically, it is necessary to keep the markets guessing. That is done by using political initiative as well as technical monetary skills to keep the exchange rate lower than it otherwise would be. That interrelation between the exchange rate and the interest rate is better understood through the decision-making process that the previous Government so successfully developed than through the system proposed in clause 10 which, since it was, in effect, put into practice, has produced far from satisfactory results.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> First, I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Butterfill. This has been an extended debate and I do not intend to prolong it, but I have two points to make, given the importance of the Bill's central clause and the Government's intentions.
<P>
As to the Government's intentions and whether they are giving the Bank operational independence, I draw the Committee's attention to the parellelism, if not dualism, linking clause 10 and clause 19(1). The latter provision concerns the reserve powers under which, in some circumstances, the Treasury may claw back operational control. Clause 10 removes the Treasury's powers to give operational instructions to the Bank of England in the conduct of monetary policy. Clause 19, which we shall debate in due course, takes those powers back--but in defined circumstances, which are set out. Following consultation with the Governor of the Bank--I should hope that that would happen--the circumstances include that action is in the public interest, which I expect the Chancellor would want to justify to the House, and that there are extreme economic circumstances. That will all be set out in some kind of statutory instrument, I am sure that we shall return to the matter and discuss it at greater length in the House.
<P>
Those of us with long memories might regard the existence of extreme economic circumstances as more or less equivalent to and conterminous with the appointment of a Labour Government. On the first day that I came into politics I remember the late George Brown saying, when the national plan collapsed, ``We are now going to run this economy as no economy has ever been run before.'' How right he was!
<P>
I do not want to dwell on the point, but it is important to flag it up: we know that the Chancellor will give away his powers to the Bank and that the clause will provide the reserve possibility of those powers returning to the Chancellor, but we do not know in what circumstances. That is not a trivial matter; nor is it a purely trivial precaution. It is not something that the Chancellor would be able to do if we were to join European monetary union, because, with the euro, we would be in a one-way street. The Chancellor has left himself a way out this time and it has implications for his policy's credibility. As professor David Gowland stated in his pamphlet for Politeia:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It is easy to imagine circumstances in which it would become widely believed that Mr. Brown (or his successor) might revoke the Bank of England's operational independence.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Precisely so, because the Chancellor could do that with the present majority at any time. To judge by the tenor of comments made by Government members of the Committee, it seems that he has only to decide that he needs to do it, and he will.
<P>
I do not wish to be cynical, but is seems that the Chancellor's policy could be summed up as, ``When things go badly, it is the Bank's fault, and when they go well, it's down to me,'' or, to put it more simply, ``When interest rates are going up, it's all the fault of the Bank and when they are coming down, I'm going to take the credit.'' Although that may not be so, the structure for that to happen is in the Bill.
<P>
My second point relates to definition. I am no great military strategist or tactician--I once spent about 12 hours at Sandhurst; that is all--but one thing I picked up from military history is that the place to mount a successful attack is where two commands join, where there is an equivocation on who is in charge. Manifestly, that is in the Bill. The clause creates an extraordinary situation in which the Chancellor may still give the Bank directions, as prescribed in terse words in the Bank of England Act 1946, but he cannot do so in relation to monetary policy unless there are exceptional circumstances--in which case he can do so.
<P>
It is because of that equivocation, that there is a problem. As my right hon. Friend the member for Wells most eloquently said, the issue goes wider than simply setting interest rates. The euro will presumably have free circulation in this country, and the Chancellor has committed himself to enabling taxpayers to pay their tax in euros. Thus the Bank, in considering the level of the domestic money supply, is bound to take some account of the number of euros in circulation and in common use in the United Kingdom. I do not want to dilate on that, but in relation to the international economic situation and the avoidance of systemic risk, a variety of things spring from the monetary policy experience. The Bill takes them off, uncomfortably, and gives them to a different set of people; they are not stiched together or unified.
<P>
I am not a lawyer, but there is an important legal point on which I invite the Economic Secretary to comment: there is no definition of monetary policy in the Bill. If there is no such definition, someone, at some stage, may wish to give one. If it is not in the Bill, the definition will presumably ultimately be given by a judge. I happen to know that one of the deputy Governors shares with me a passionate support for Aston Villa. He might take the view that it would be entirely proper, in promoting monetary policy, to take action, perhaps by a differential interest rate deal, to get Aston Villa up the table--someone needs to do it. But I do not know, and I would not unless it was decided in court, whether, if the deputy Governor could persuade his colleagues of the wisdom of that course of action, it would be within the Bill's remit.
<P>
This is not a purely trivial point and I shall explain what worries me. It would not necessarily require a great political disagreement between the Bank or the members of the Monetary Policy Committee and the Chancellor, but a set of circumstances could arise in which there was a genuine difference of opinion about what to do. There might even be a difference of opinion about the ground on which it was being done; about whether it was a monetary policy matter.
<P>
Imagine the incoherence of the situation in which the Chancellor sought to give a direction on a matter which he regarded as not part of monetary policy and the MPC thought that it was acting within its rights. Indeed, slightly wider rights are specified for it in clause 11 than in this clause. There could be an argument about whether the Chancellor, because he has now created a distinction within his remit to control the powers of the Bank of England, was entitled to give that direction.
<P>
A situation could even arise on a very sensitive matter which could affect the banking system or be part of the world economy's response to the kinds of difficulty we are experiencing at the moment. The MPC could say to the Chancellor, ``That's what we're going to do and that's why we're going to do it, and it is our responsibility. You will not give us a direction unless you want to make a formal order in the form of a statutory instrument.'' In that case the matter could be resolved only by a judge.
<P>
I would not like to see the issue of what was or was not in the remit of the Monetary Policy Committee resolved by a judge, perhaps as the result of some process of judicial review. With great respect to the legal profession, I have a feeling that while all that was going on the world economy might have moved in directions which would not be wholly to its advantage. We could have a frightful mess. When we create this kind of distinction, for whatever motives and however well intentioned, we run the risk of finding that if things get difficult, those distinctions may live to haunt us.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Now that the Committee is a bit quieter, Mr. Butterfill, I can welcome you to the Chair. I am beginning to get a bit concerned that at our third sitting we are on to our third Chairman. I hope that it does not mean that we have been unruly. We will certainly seek to behave ourselves slightly better if we are to be allowed to welcome you back.
<P>
As I said at the outset, our consideration of the Bill now changes gear and we move on to the specific areas of monetary policy. We have had an interesting debate this morning. There was one point when I felt that it was turning into a university tutorial. When I become Economic Secretary to the Treasury my economics professor warned me to keep away from the econometricians because I was rotten at their subject. I have tried hard to take his advice.
<P>
Clause 10 gives operational responsibility for monetary policy decisions to the Bank of England--I stress the word ``operational'' and will enlarge on that in due course--but it is up to the Treasury to set the inflation target. That was not much debated this morning. It is not often that I find cause to congratulate the previous Government but whenever they got round to setting an inflation target it was a sound move in terms of economic policy. It gave a much clearer analysis of where the economy was going and what business and individuals could plan upon in assessing their future.
<P>
There is unlikely ever to be a discussion of M0 through to M4 in the quoiters club in Shotts, but I can say with absolute certainty that there will be discussion about the level of prices, to which the clause relates. It is about how the people outside this building are able to plan and lead their lives. That is why the Government are committed to stability to allow people to plan in an effective manner.

<P>

<B>Mr. David Ruffley (Bury St. Edmunds):</B> Why, if the Minister applauds the setting of an inflation target of 2.5 per cent. or less, did her party, when in opposition, say nothing about whether it supported that target, which was set by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)?
<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> One reason why the Labour party in opposition was concerned about the setting of interest rates was that the Conservative Government played political ducks and drakes with setting a target for inflation. It is interesting that there were a number of references to the previous Government having hit their target on one occasion: a Government is supposed to do that more than once.
<P>
Having been nice to the previous Government, may I say now that if they had taken action on inflation in 1996, the Monetary Policy Committee might not need to increase interest rates? I contend that the Government played politics with interest rates in the run-up to the general election, and we have seen the consequences. That, if nothing else, makes the case for the reform of monetary policy proposed in the Bill. Politics interfering with the setting of interest rates disadvantages innocent people, and businesses trying to plan.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> That seems like a bit of chutzpah on the part of the hon. Lady in that it was having a second Budget in one year, with the additional tax increases, and the consequent increases in inflation, which had a great deal to do with the subsequent rise in inflation. On the back of that, it was clear that the new independent Bank would have to prove its mettle by raising interest rates frequently. The Government have dug a hole for themselves in their conduct of both monetary and fiscal policy since 1 May.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman's interjection is baloney, but what else could we expect from someone who defined economic policy and his Government's problems with interest rates by saying that the enterprise economy was in an adolescent phase and that that was why it behaved unpredictably? That definition is so interesting that I shall probably have it made into a sampler to hang above my bed.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells raised interesting points, including one about precise definitions of monetary policy. I do not believe that we can give precise definitions. I speak as someone who for much of my life worked as a professional economist. I know the extent to which economists can disagree, but I also know that our experience and knowledge advances with time. The important element is not the debate about how the Chancellor of the Exchequer sets the inflation target, but the means whereby the target is delivered. It is clear in the clause that the MPC's intention is to formulate and implement all major monetary policy decisions. It goes much wider than simply setting interest rates, as is obvious from the MPC's minutes so far published.
<P>
I refer members of the Committee to the minutes of the MPC's August meeting. Matters considered by that Committee have so far included the interaction between interest rates and exchange rates, the possible role of direct interventions in the markets, and issues relating to quantities of credit controls. Clauses 14 and 15 make it clear that the MPC will also be able to carry out market intervention. One reason for building in that flexibility is that it is more than 50 years since the previous Bank of England Bill was introduced. We wished to ensure that this legislation could respond to changes over time.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells asked about coinage. I think that he meant note issue because coinage is the responsibility of the Royal Mint. The Bank will continue to have responsibility for note issue. He also asked about the exchange rate and foreign currency reserves. The exchange rate regime will remain the responsibility of the Government, but the Bank will be able to hold foreign exchange reserves and intervene in foreign currency in support of its monetary policy objectives.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman referred to comments made by the Governor of the Bank of England, and reported in today's press, that inflation at 2.5 per cent. might be too high. In the Chancellor's statement on the single currency a few weeks ago, he made it clear that the Government will
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``monitor our inflation target and inflation measures in the light of the European Central Bank.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Any Government who recognised the impact of other countries in or out of Europe adopting a single currency would have to bear that inflation target in mind. It was clear that UK inflation in September was in line with the EU average.
<P>
In the Mansion House speech of spring this year, the Chancellor also referred to his desire to take international conditions into account and his hope to lower the inflation target if possible. It is important to recognise that 2.5 per cent. is not the lowest level of inflation with which the Government are concerned. The option to lower the target is there, but 2.5 per cent. is right for the moment. The Bill requires the Government to make an annual statement of their objectives for inflation.
<P>
We must take into account the need for stability in the operation of the economy. I do not want to pre-empt our later discussion about debt management and the devolution of banking supervision to the Financial Services Authority. However, I should like to respond to the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) who asked about the powers retained by the Government under clause 19. Those powers would be used only in extreme circumstances and would be subject to parliamentary approval. That is a means of dealing with unusual circumstances. For example, the Government might have to deal with the economic consequences of a major international collapse or conflict. I repeat that such circumstances are likely to be rare and the powers may never be used, but it would be irresponsible not to include those powers in the Bill. Other countries, such as Canada and New Zealand, have adopted similar measures.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry also quoted David Gowland's pamphlet, ``Banking on Change: independence, regulation and the Bank of England'', but he was selective in his quotations. The Committee should understand that Politeia is hardly a politically neutral organisation, given that Lord Parkinson, Francis Maude and other luminaries of the Conservative party are on its board. If the hon. Member for Daventry re-read the pamphlet, he would find that the author is not entirely positive about the previous Conservative Government. Indeed, at one point he suggests that Mr. Major's Government not only lacked credibility but was implausible after 1992.
<P>
Interesting issues have been raised this morning, but everything comes down to the Government's responsibility for setting the inflation target and ensuring that the means for delivering that target are open and transparent. That will lead to accountability and to businesses and individuals becoming self-confident.
<P>
It was interesting to hear the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton quoting extensively from what must be an early Christmas present. When he referred to Nigel Lawson, I could keep out of my mind the problems that that distinguished former Chancellor of the Exchequer had with Sir Alan Walters.
<P>
The Government take decisions based on openness and accountability. We shall have the most open discussion of monetary policy and the setting of inflation targets that this country has ever had. Moreover, the Treasury Committee will be able to question the Monetary Policy Committee.
<P>
The hon. Member for Guildford obviously wants to replace mystic Meg in predicting the outcome of the national lottery. He tried to second guess the Chancellor's views on the composition of the Monetary Policy Committee and the board of governors of the Bank of England, which is a matter we discussed last week. The transparency that the Government are building into the system will be one of its greatest safeguards. People welcome that. Such transparency and the Chancellor's decision have been shown to be extremely positive by what has happended to long-term interest rates. Since my right hon. Friend made his announcement on 6 May, long-term interest rates have fallen by almost 1 per cent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> If the Government's economic and monetary policy is so open and transparent, why are none of the Labour Back Benchers who spoke against the Bill on Second Reading--they formed the majority of the Labour Members who spoke--members of the Committee? Why are no Labour members of the Treasury Committee represented on this Committee? Why do members of the Cabinet feel it necessary to brief the press about their unhappiness with the Government's conduct of monetary and interest rate policy since 1 May?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I could ask why the hon. Member for Leominster (Mr. Temple-Morris) is not on the Conservative Benches. The channels that decide membership of Committees are somewhat different from those made up by Ministers, and it is not appropriate for me to go into such matters in Committee. However, people in glass houses should not throw stones.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton made some points about the operation of the Bank of England. He should bear in mind that the Governor and the Monetary Policy Committee cannot get up one morning and decide to aim for a different inflation target. They are bound by the inflation target set by the Chancellor. That is a critical point, and the hon. Gentleman may have failed to take it into account. The setting of interest rates in the past 18 years--and, indeed, before that--has been a sorry saga. People and business suffered as a result.
<P>
Politicians rarely take the opportunity to open out decision making more widely and more coherently. We are a reforming Government. We are already introducing legislation on the constitution and on devolution, and we have sufficient trust in the mandate on which we were elected to say that things can sometimes be done better without interference by politicians.
<P>
Politicians, however, have a critical role in taking decisions on the overall management of the economy, the establishment of inflation targets and on fiscal policy. They are the key indicators and the means by which we shall drive this country forward. We seek to build a more modern economy and in seeking to do that the Chancellor has clearly seen it to be our advantage to have a different means of setting the inflation rate.
<P>
We have heard a lot from Conservative Members about the people having to be reassured about what is happening in relation to interest rates. As I said earlier, at the quoiters club or the marbles club in Shotts it is not the establishment and setting of monetary targets that people talk about, but inflation. But the Confederation of British Industry and the Institute of Management have recognised the soundness of the Chancellor's decision to give operational independence to the Bank of England. I recognise that the right hon. Member for Wells may not approve of that as it was he, after all, who said that the CBI was bad for business.
<P>
Clause 10 encapsulates a significant move forward for the British economy. The clauses that follow on are of equal significance, but in passing this clause, we are taking a move forward which modernises our economy and gives stability--something which has already been recognised in the fall in long-term interest rates--and which will allow us to grow in a stable and coherent manner in future.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 14, in page 5, line 3, leave out `support' and insert `pursue'.
<P>
This helpful little amendment would replace a rather important word in the Bill with one which will not weaken the policy but will bring some comfort to the Bank of England and its directors in the pursuit of their duty. It is not clear to us why the Bank of England and all its directors, the Governor, the deputy Governors and so on, should have as their objects the support of probably all of the Government's economic policies.
<P>
Those policies are to be set out periodically by the Government but it is reasonable to expect that the phrase ``economic policy'' is all encompassing. The Bank could therefore be required to support the Government's entire economic policy, including not just monetary policy, but taxation, public expenditure, financial regulations, policy towards economic and monetary union, privatisation, nationalisation and the policy towards public pay and salaries. Indeed, there are many possible economic policies such as training and investment which I have not mentioned. My list is far from exhaustive. Under the clause, the Bank will not only have to help to attain laudable objectives but support other policies.
<P>
This morning, the Governor commented on the Government's inflation target and speculated that it might have to be lower. The Governor is entitled to do that. As we move closer to the possibility of economic and monetary union, the Governor and members of the court may perceive a divergence between monetary and fiscal policy, or between the attainment of European monetary union and the necessary inflation target.
<P>
In such circumstances, the Governor and the court could become critical of the Government, and decide that the inflation target was too weak and one of the policies was unattainable. They would have a duty, to their consciences and to the British economy, to point out, perhaps in speeches, that several of the Government's other policies were mistaken and contradicted national policies, such as monetary union.
<P>
However, if the Bank did that, it could be in breach of statute law because the clause requires it to support the Government's other economic policies. Elsewhere, the Bill contains provisions to remove the Governor and members of the court if they become unfit for office. Therefore, I am worried that the clause constitutes a gagging provision. Such a provision is not included in the 1946 Act, which is a model of precision and brevity. It is only seven pages long. It does not provide that the Bank of England, its staff and Governor should support Government policy.
<P>
The amendment would replace ``support'' with the weaker word ``pursue''. That would allow the Government to expect the Bank of England to work for the attainment of their economic objectives, without requiring the Bank to support and, by implication, not criticise their economic policies. The amendment is intended to be helpful and to improve the Bill. I hope that the Government will accept it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I endorse all the comments of my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells.
<P>
I know that Labour Members, especially Front Benchers, like precision in drafting. Therefore, I draw the Committee's attention to the New Shorter Oxford English dictionary definition of ``support''. Page 3153 defines support as to 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``endure without opposition or resistance; bear with, put up with, tolerate . . . Undergo, endure, especially with courage or determination''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Any Bank of England official who has to put up with current Treasury Ministers will need courage and determination.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andy King:</B> It may help Members of the Committee if the hon. Gentleman gives us the definition of ``pursue''. That would be of enormous interest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I may have time to develop the argument. We are, to begin with, considering the word ``support''. The hon. Gentleman should be patient. If he is interested in precision he will be interested in the proper definition of the word.
<P>
Clearly, a statutory interpretation of the relevant words as indicating a less than independent relationship would be possible. We tabled amendment No. 14 to make the point that the word ``support'' in the clause could give rise to some ambiguity. We put the case no more strongly than that. That ambiguity leads, in our view, to a sense of the role of the Governor of the Bank of England as in some way subservient to the wishes of Treasury Ministers. That would fatally undermine the independence that the Bill is intended to establish.
<P>
Conservative Members have a clear view about the Bill and the independence that it is intended to establish. The Government have surprised us by saying that they do not understand our stance with respect to the Bill. Our view is crystal clear--that the Bill purports to establish independence but would not really do so. It would give the Chancellor of the Exchequer many powers over the Bank's actions. It would not do what is claimed. In addition, it would allow the Chancellor to abrogate all responsibility for monetary policy. It would enable him to escape responsibility at the same time as interfering with the purported independence of the Bank of England. It is for those reasons that we believe that the Bill is bad and in serious need of amendment. The definition that I have quoted emphasises the ambiguity in the arrangements that the Government want to establish.
<P>
I reiterate the comment of my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford about the way in which independence is being subverted. Labour Members were all too quick to deny and criticise as rubbish the headline, from The Guardian of 19 November, ``Brown plots Bank clear-out''. I hope that when, next year, the next six appointments fall to be decided by the Government, they will be widely welcomed, and not perceived as the appointment of six cronies by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
<P>
If we are to talk about independence, we should have a clear understanding of the term. We should also remove the ambiguity in the clause by replacing the word ``support'' with a word that is more neutral, clearer and less ambiguous.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I rise to resist the amendment. The right hon. Member for Wells said early in his remarks that the amendment was ``helpful'', and that immediately made me suspicious. When the right hon. Gentleman is being helpful I feel a great need to read carefully what is presented in writing.
<P>
I do not think that the purpose of the amendment is to give greater weight to the Government's economic policies, or to increase the emphasis on price stability. Like the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds, I had recourse to the dictionary, but, as a Scot who lives near the Collins printing plant, I chose the ``Collins Concise Dictionary''. It defines ``pursue'' as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to seek or strive to attain . . . to follow the precepts of (a plan, policy . . .)''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and ``support'' as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to give approval to (a cause, principle . . .); to subscribe to . . . maintain.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I think that ``maintain'' is the key element. My hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth (Mr. King) gave the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds a hard time over his use of the word ``support'' rather than ``pursue''. If my majority were 368 on a 9.6 per cent. swing from Conservative to Labour, I, too, would be obsessed with the word ``support''. We need to go further than The Guardian headlines in our discussions, however.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
There is a subtle distinction between the use of ``pursue'' and ``support''. To ``pursue'' implies a more active role for the participant. In general, the Government pursue their policies, and it is for the Bank and other agencies to support them in those policies.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells referred to the European angle. The use of the word ``support'' mirrors the wording of the treaty on the objective of the European system of central banks, in article 105(1):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The primary objective of the ESCB shall be to maintain price stability. Without prejudice to the objective of price stability, the ESCB shall support the general economic policies in the Community.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Chancellor also used the word ``support'' in his letter to the Governor of 6 May. He pointed out that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The monetary policy objective of the Bank of England will be to deliver price stability (as defined by the Government's inflation target) and, without prejudice to this objective, to support the Government's economic policy, including its objectives for growth and employment.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I ask my hon. Friends not to be taken in by the honeyed words of Opposition Members because if the amendment was accepted, that would imply a much wider role for the Bank than the Government envisage. The Bank has only narrowly defined responsibilities in the area of monetary policy. Its monetary policy objective is to maintain price stability, and, subject to that, to support the Government's objectives for growth and employment. That means that the Bank must consider how best to meet the Government's objectives of growth and employment in the context of its overall responsibility to maintain price stability. Any policy actions taken by the Bank must be in support of the Government's goals, which are clearly defined by the Treasury in accordance with clause 12.
<P>
The wording follows that of the treaty and of the Chancellor's letter of 6 May, so I ask the Committee to resist the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoate-Amory:</B> I very much regret that the hon. Lady will not accept our amendment. I also regret that, if the officers, directors, or Governor of the Bank fail to support all the Government's economic policies, they will be breaking the law. That is unnecessary. However, as this was a probing amendment, and Conservative Members want to move on to a clause stand part debate after my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry has introduced some further amendments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 12, in page 5, line 4, leave out from `Government' to end.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 15, in page 5, line 4, at end add `and a stable and competitive exchange rate over the medium term'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I share my right hon. Friend's distress at the failure of our modest amendment. I recall Lenin's remark--it may come back to haunt the Government--about the rope providing support to the hanged man. One hopes that the relationship between the Bank and the Government will not be as unpleasant as that.
<P>
The amendment is helpful and I should like to raise three points in rising order of generality. My first is a narrow legalistic concern. I have always understood that specifying too strictly in agreements or legislation can be dangerous--the Chief Secretary, as a lawyer, may be able to comment--because everything else not so specified can be excluded. Will the Government confirm that reference to growth and employment will not leave out other important matters?
<P>
My second concern is about the precision of the words ``growth'' and ``employment''. We all know what economic growth should be but the time scale is not clear from the context. That may be specified in the Treasury notices to the Bank, but there could be cases in which the short-term requirement for growth and the longer-term growth potential might diverge. In the words of the Prime Minister, Governments may have ``hard choices to make''.
<P>
The word ``employment'' is even less precise. It has an economic context and though we may know the number of jobs, it is not clear whether the Bill is confined to that. One could imagine a time scale, but again it could be short-term make-work--some of us have reservations about how the welfare-to-work scheme will be interpreted--or longer-term proposals. There could be a divergence between part-time and full-time employment.
<P>
An entire Department used to be devoted to employment, and now there is at least half a Department. They go beyond the purely economic to important matters of social policy such as the employment of ethnic minorities, women and so forth. I should like to hear the Economic Secretary's opinion on how the Bill as drafted will deal with those issues.
<P>
My third concern goes much wider. It is that the words,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``including its objectives for growth and employment''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
have been inserted for a specific and far from commendable reason--as a sop, not to define economic policy, but to console the left of the Labour party about the Government's decision to devolve the management of monetary policy to the Bank of England. That concern was ably expressed, in absentia--I see that, miraculously, the left is not well represented on the Government Benches in Committee--by the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) when she said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``First, we cannot decouple economic management from politics. Secondly, the academic arguments for an independent central bank are built on sand, intellectually. Thirdly, the idea is fundamentally undemocratic. Finally, it would mean taking risks with growth and jobs.''--[Official Report, 11 June 1997; Vol. 295, c. 1055.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is no accident that the words ``growth'' and ``employment'' appear in the clause. As I say, it is a sop to the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington. It is an important issue. I will not let the Minister caricature me into having said that we on the Conservative Benches are not interested in growth and employment. The historic record of the last two finite periods of Government--ours, for the past 18 years, and Labour's in the 1970s--shows that the annual growth rate, although not even, was, as the Economic Secretary said, higher during our term than previously. Clearly, the hon. Lady wishes to do better this time; for the country's sake, she should.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross Cranston </B>(Dudley, North): Is the hon. Gentleman aware that United States Federal Reserve legislation specifically mentions employment as one of the aims of the Federal Reserve system? Did not the right hon. Member for Wells say on Second Reading that he would like us to adopt a similar policy?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The point about the Federal Reserve bank is not only that its track record goes back to 1913 but that it is a truly independent central bank with powers that do not derive from the centre and which have been generally--although not always--exercised independently, and latterly exercised effectively under Alan Greenspan. I have no objection to the Chancellor and Treasury Ministers concerning themselves with growth and employment; indeed, I should be concerned if they did not.
<P>
My amendment relates simply to the specifying of items in the Bill to the exclusion of other aspects of economic policy. A few might be congenial to Labour Members. The Government could have included a reference to regional balances in the economy, as the court of auditors will be obliged to report on its deliberations under the new arrangement. Had they wanted to be really socialist, they could have mentioned distribution of incomes. We all feel that there should have been at least a rehearsal of the important aspects of international economic policy. It is interesting that on a day when the Governor was reported as saying, as he did yesterday, that he is not an inflation nutter--he is sensitive on the point although I agree with his analysis of his own position--and the Bank is not so disposed, he also said, again in a European context, that Britain was a ``pre-in'' to the process of European monetary union. It is interesting that, because of the arrangements being put in place, we now have, as almost the first move in this process of convergence, a further divergence of our interest rates from those that apply generally in continental Europe. Growth and employment are important, but to specify them in this manner when there are other objectives--including those reflected in the Liberal Democrats' amendment No. 15--is an odd way to proceed. It would be better if monetary policy were consistent with the Government's economic policy. I could have agreed with that; we never wanted to take that away, as we said this morning.
<P>
I regard the phrase as a sop to the Labour left, although I would not wish to imply that we are uninterested in growth and employment. My right hon. Friend the Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Sir E. Heath), criticising his own Government, memorably stated that he did not want a ``one-club golfer''. With the phrase in the Bill, the Economic Secretary has added to her bag of clubs a three-wood and a sand wedge to go with her putter, or whatever she had before, but she does not have a full set of clubs. We know that economic policy is complex and difficult, involving a variety of considerations that must be balanced. Giving prominence to those elements to the implied exclusion of others does not give the right signal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> May I request your permission, Mr. Butterfill, for a separate vote on amendment No. 15, as it raises a different issue from amendment No. 12? The eloquent speech of the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) convinced me of that because I disagreed with his arguments. I hope that my contribution will further convince you that it is a separate issue.
<P>
The amendment supports the Government's stated policy, set out in the Treasury Committee report by the Chancellor in May, from which it quotes more or less directly. The Chancellor said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We want a stable, competitive pound over the medium-term''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Bill should make it clear that the exchange rate regime is the Government's job. That harks back to an earlier debate on the precise definition of monetary policy. It is unclear from the Bill where responsibility for exchange rate policy lies; the amendment would clarify the matter and back up the Government's stated policy. Indeed, without such an amendment, there will be a gaping hole in the Bill, which will be especially relevant in the next few years as we debate economic policy.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In the run-up to a possible decision to enter the single currency, exchange rate policy will be at the forefront of the Government's decisions. Will the pound continue to float in the next few years? Will it shadow the single currency? Will it rejoin the exchange rate mechanism or will the Government find other guidelines and some other method of exchange rate management? The Maastricht criteria make it clear what the Government have to do in respect of the exchange rate if they want to be eligible to join the single currency, but we have heard relatively little from the Government since 1 May about how they intend to meet the exchange rate criteria in the Maastricht treaty. Other criteria that Britain needs to meet to join the single currency have been set out, but the Government have not stated clearly how they envisage the exchange rate regime developing in the next few years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> If the amendment were accepted and the Bank of England were required to pursue a stable and competitive exchange rate, what would happen if the monetary conditions required an interest rate higher, say, than that required to achieve a stable and competitive exchange rate? When one condition requires a lowering of exchange rates and another requires that they be raised, which should take priority?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> From the way in which the Bill is phrased, it is clear that price stability will take priority. That is the case in other countries that have an independent central bank. I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's question. We may need to clarify our position.
<P>
The amendment would clarify the fact that the Government are responsible for exchange rate policy. Liberal Democrat Members agree with the Chancellor's statement that a stable and competitive pound is needed. We have seen in the past few months how a high pound damages manufacturing industry. The Government are right to pursue their policy and there is no reason why they should not accept the amendment and incorporate that objective in the Bill. They might argue that it is implicit that a stable and competitive pound is necessary to meet the objectives of growth and employment, but it could equally be argued that a stable and competitive pound would produce the type of growth and employment, and structure in the economy, which the Liberal Democrats would support. The Government want improvement in industry and growth in the manufacturing sector, and we support that aim. Stating such an objective of economic policy would produce the type and structure of economy that we both want.
<P>
We tabled the amendment in a spirit of clarification, to try to produce a statement of objectives that would support the aim of creating certainty and stability in economic policy. It is important that we are clear whether the Government or the Bank of England will be responsible for exchange rate policy as we prepare for transition to the single currency. I hope that the Economic Secretary will shed some light on that point.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Is it in order for me to speak in favour of amendment No. 12?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is. We are debating amendment No. 12.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I shall be brief, by the amendment is important for one reason. The Governor's role as an independent operator appears to be prejudiced by the clause because the Governor will be under a statutory obligation to support the Government's employment strategy. If the clause remains unamended, will it be possible for the Governor to make any critical comments on what he and the Bank perceive to be labour market inflexibility caused by the operation of the social chapter or the statutory minimum wage?
<P>
I make that point because Bank of England reports in recent years have supported the former Government's policy on labour market flexibility and similar supply-side reforms. This Government's policies on the social chapter and the minimum wage are at variance with the stated views of current Bank of England officials, including those of the Governor.
<P>
I draw the Committee's attention to how the clause will affect the Governor's ability to speak out on issues such as the social chapter, the minimum wage and labour market flexibility in general. We may face the ridiculous position where the Governor will not be able to speak freely on issues about which he has spoken freely in the past. Such a gagging order would be undesirable not only in policy terms, but because it would lead to the Governor falling foul of a statutory obligation. I support the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am conscious of the fact that Conservative Members have made clear their wish to have a clause stand part debate. Therefore, my remarks will be brief.
<P>
I am glad that the hon. Member for Daventry clarified why the amendment was tabled. It had foxed me, and I did not want to caricature the hon. Gentleman as having no concern for growth or employment. I would say that about other Conservative Members, but not the hon. Member for Daventry. However, I must ask him what planet he has been on since 1 May. One of the Government's key themes is our determination to develop economic policy in such a way as to produce high and sustainable levels of growth and employment. That is one of the main reasons for the Bill. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has just returned from the Luxembourg summit, where much of the time was spent discussing initiatives taken by the new Labour Government that would be relevant to employment throughout the European Union.
<P>
I shall resist the amendment because it would have no effect. The Government's entire economic policy is aimed at reaching high and stable levels of growth and employment. It therefore makes sense to specify those objectives in the clause. The wording of the clause is not exclusive; it is purely designed to illustrate Government policy. Our policies include the objectives of growth and employment, but they are not aimed solely at growth and employment. The amendment would not change the way in which the Bank would conduct policy. Indeed, if it were accepted, it could potentially confuse the position by appearing to weaken the Bank's commitment to supporting the Government's growth and employment objectives because they would have been specifically removed from the clause. As my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary pointed out on Second Reading, low inflation is a precondition for high and sustainable levels of growth and employment. We have introduced the Bill because of our determination to secure that.
<P>
I think that I have answered point made by the hon. Member for Daventry. He argued that the reference to growth and employment was ``a sop'' to the left wing of the Labour party. That is a bizarre suggestion given that the people in greatest pursuit of those aims are my right hon. Friends the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, North (Mr. Cranston) pointed out that full employment is one of the objectives of the Federal Reserve bank. It might be useful to quote the words of the Federal's chairman, Mr. Alan Greenspan, in his recent Humphrey-Hawkins testimony. He succinctly said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Our objective has never been to contain inflation as an end in itself, but rather as a precondition for the highest possible long-run growth of output and income--the ultimate goal of macroeconomic policy.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I could not have put it better myself.
<P>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton spoke to amendment No. 15, but I shall not develop the debate on the single currency. There are other forums in the House for that. No doubt, hon. Members will seize the opportunity to debate that issue when they can.
<P>
I shall resist amendment No. 15. The longer the list the clause contains, the greater the risk of conflict. Recent experience has shown that exchange rates can move for reasons that appear unrelated to either monetary policy or to economic fundamentals. We agree that a stable and competitive exchange rate is important, and the Government have stated that the best way to achieve that goal in the medium term is to pursue macroeconomic stability. However, it would not be sensible to incorporate the amendment in the Bill, because that would be only a means to an end. The end is all important. If we widen the criteria too far, different aims may come into conflict. That would weaken the clause's message.
<P>
Adding the objective of exchange rate stability to part II of the Bill, which is on monetary policy, could be misleading. Monetary policy is an important driver of the nominal exchange rate. Ultimately, the exchange rate depends on the underlying productivity and performance of the economy. However, it also depends on other countries' monetary policies, and not exclusively on that adopted in the United Kingdom. Other factors, which are not in the Government's or Bank of England's direct control, are relevant. As some people have suffered the stress of experiencing recently, exchange rates can move in a way that cannot be related specifically to changes in monetary policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> Does the Economic Secretary believe that the Government or the Bank of England will be responsible for exchange rate policy?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I thought that I had pointed out in the previous debate that the exchange rate regime is the Government's responsibility. I thought I had been explicit, but I might not have been as clear as I should have been. The hon. Gentleman seeks to be helpful, but the amendment would not achieve his aim.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) says that the Governor would not be able to criticise the Government's economic policy. That is arrant nonsense. At present, the person appointed Governor of the Bank of England will be quite forthright in his views. The Government have no intention of limiting that in any way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> In that case, what construction does she put on the word ``support'' earlier in that subsection? It sets out the objectives as being
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to support the economic policy of her Majesty's Government, including its objectives for growth and employment.''<P>

</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I thought that I had explained that too in the previous debate. The word ``support'' is analogous to ``maintain''. I should like to make it absolutely and incontrovertibly clear that there is no intention of preventing the Governor of the Bank of England from speaking out on economic policy. I hope that that clarifies the position.
<P>
Several hon. Members rose--
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I recognise that hon. Members have points that they wish to make. We are up against a tight time constraint and I therefore have to resist both amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I would not advise my hon. Friends to press the amendment that stands in our name. We have secured an important concession from the hon. Lady in her closing remarks about the independence of the Governor to speak out. It is not consistent with the approach that I had adopted which was not to specify these matters on the face of the Bill--she did not make out a very convincing case for doing that, in my view--to follow the Liberal Democrat amendment and specify further matters. It would be better to be as terse as possible, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I shall not press amendment No. 15 to a vote, Mr. Butterfill.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I shall be brief. A number of the points relating to this have already been raised in the debate and I know that Opposition Members wish to speak in the clause stand part debate. The clause gives the Treasury the responsibility to define what the Government mean by price stability and their other economic policy objectives. It is a logical part of the Bill. Our discussion this morning points to the common sense of this.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> In the closing minutes of the debate I should like the hon. Lady to clear up the confusion that arose on Second Reading. The Chief Secretary is in his place and he will recall getting into a muddle almost at the start of his speech. I remind the Committee that the right hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley) intervened and said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Bill gives overriding priority to maintaining price stability. Growth and employment are subject to that . . . The Government should not make employment subsidiary to the control of inflation which appears to be the god on all occasions.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Chief Secretary replied:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The right hon. Gentleman is mistaken. Clause 11 shows that the Government's objectives are high levels of growth and employment.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The right hon. Member for Caernarfon replied:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Bill says, `subject to that'''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Chief Secretary said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The right hon. Gentleman is reading it the wrong way round. The Bank's objective is to maintain price stability, but that is in support of the Government's objectives of growth and employment--[Official Report, 11 November 1997; Vol. 300, c. 712.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I gave the Economic Secretary an opportunity to put the record straight when she replied to the debate, but she did not do so. We must be clear, and I should like to hear this from her, that the Bill as drafted shows that the right hon. Member for Caernarfon was right. The other objectives are to be subject to price stability and the Chief Secretary was wrong to say that the right hon. Member for Caernarfon's intervention was ``the wrong way round''. The matter is important because it was of such concern to the Economic Secretary's right hon. and hon. Friends, especially the right hon. Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies) and the hon. Members for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington and for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell). They were worried about the possibility of overkill in a single overriding end to which everything else was subsidiary, and the danger that interest rates could be used to kill off the economy.
<P>
The hon. Members who raised those issues are unrepresented on the Committee, and the hand-picked Labour members of the Committee do not raise the slightest objection to anything in the Bill. The nodding donkeys opposite are not representative of the concerns expressed on Second Reading, so it is up to Conservative Members to draw attention to such matters. The Economic Secretary's concluding remarks on Second Reading were dismissive of the three interventions. She mentioned them, and made one dismissive reference to an Adjournment debate that had taken place on the matter some months earlier. She considered none of the arguments made by her hon. Friends.
<P>
My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe managed to achieve his inflation objective, and, at the same time, address his growth and employment objectives. He met all his targets without setting up a hierarchy. Such a hierarchy is also absent in the United States where the Federal Reserve does not have overriding inflation objectives; it can balance the other economic objectives, unlike the Bank of England, which will be required by statute law to give overriding attention and priority to the maintenance of price stability.
<P>
The Government have started badly. They relaxed their inflation objective--instead of 2.5 per cent. or less, it is now 2.5 per cent. plus or minus 1 per cent.--and are above their inflation target. The Budget not only failed to address supposed inflationary pressures in the economy, but added to them by raising taxation. There is already a divergence between monetary policy and fiscal policy. The Government are putting the strain of the anti-inflation strategy on to the Bank of England. Conservative Members oppose the Bill for those reasons.
<P>
In her reply to our brief debate on clause 11 stand part, the Economic Secretary should clear up the confusion and muddle, and the mistake made by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury--which I am sure she will concede if she re-reads the first page of the Second Reading debate.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> When the Economic Secretary spoke against amendment No. 12, she called in aid the Federal Reserve and the Humphrey Hawkins Act. The difference was that the Humphrey Hawkins Act in the United States requires a dual target, with equality between full employment and price stability. The clause makes it clear that growth and employment are subject to, indeed are subsidiary to, the requirement to maintain price stability.
<P>
The Treasury Committee's report on the Accountability of the Bank of England refers to the Government's economic policy
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``including its objectives for growth and employment''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and uses the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``


`without prejudice' to its objective of price stability.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Chancellor used the same phrase in his letter to the Governor of the Bank of England of 6 May. He says in paragraph 4 that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``To that end, the monetary policy objective of the Bank of England will be to deliver price stability . . . without prejudice to this objective . . . for growth and employment.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Why have the Government changed the language, using a different spin?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I shall be brief. The Economic Secretary has let the cat out of the bag by saying that exchange rate policy will remain the Government's property. Conservative Members welcome the fact that interest rate decisions will not be made in isolation. Does that not mean, however, that if the Governor considers that for monetary reasons he must raise interest rates, and the Government do not want him to do that, they can call in aid their exchange rate objective?
<P>
If the Government wanted to know what effect the planned interest rate rise would have on exchange rates, they would no doubt be told that exchange rates would go up, to which the Government could respond, ``Sorry, we don't accept that. We have a very clear exchange-rate objective. In fact, today we have just decided to reduce our target exchange rate.'' In that way, pressure could be exerted on the Governor, whose freedom to raise interest rates would thus be as illusory, as we have maintained it would be.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am sorry that the right hon. Member for Wells did not find the Government's view of the matter sufficiently explicit on Second Reading, although the Chief Secretary and I read out the clause.
<P>
I have less than five mintues to respond to the debate. One of our difficulties on Second Reading debate was that the Opposition were all over the place. The right hon. Member for Wells ran out of steam during his winding-up remarks, and the cavalry had to come along, in the shape of the hon. Member for Daventry. To help the right hon. Gentleman, I shall make clear--as I have done at least three times this morning, as well as on Second Reading--that the monetary policy objective for the Bank will be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to maintain price stability, and subject to that, to support the economic policy for Her Majesty's Government, including its objectives for growth and employment.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>There was an exchange across the Committee about the definition of the word ``support''. If hon. Members want me to discuss the definitions of all the other words in the relevant sentence too, I shall happily do so, although I do not think that I can do it by 1 o'clock. It should be borne in mind that high levels of growth and employment will create the conditions for price stability on a sustainable basis. Price stability is also a necessary condition for ensuring sustainable growth and high employment. There is some evidence to suggest that high and variable inflation can damage growth and productivity. The framework that the Government envisage is designed to ensure price stability as the long-term objective of monetary policy. I thought that I had expressed that aim quite clearly earlier.
<P>
The target that was set by the Government in June involves explicit recognition that external events and temporary shocks can affect the economy. The Monetary Policy Committee will have to take such considerations into account in responding to those shocks. That is why the Bill makes explicit the commitment to maintaining price stability, and, subject to that, to supporting the Government's objectives for growth and employment.
<P>
I do not want to labour the point, given the time constraints, except to say that clause 11 is a recognition of what most people recognise: price stability is the most appropriate contribution in monetary policy to sustaining high growth and employment in the medium term. The Bill maintains that focus as the primary one of monetary policy. Subject to that goal, the Bank will also have to support the Government's other economic objectives. As I said earlier, they include growth and employment.
<P>
Clause 11 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
