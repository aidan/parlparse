<P>
I draw the Committee's attention to the addition of amendments Nos. 144 and 145 to the group that we are discussing. Those amendments had not been tabled when Mr. O'Brien announced the amendments to be debated with amendment No. 75. However, they fall under the matters that we are considering and, therefore, I have reluctantly, but in the spirit of expedition, decided to include them with this group. I will invite the Minister to comment on amendment Nos. 144 and 145 in her concluding remarks. Committee members who wish to comment specifically on these amendments should catch my eye.
<P>
I have studied carefully the previous debate on this group of amendments in Hansard. I notice that they have been copiously discussed under the chairmanship of Mr. O'Brien. The fact that I am in the Chair today does not mean that Committee members should take the opportunity to re-run the entire debate. That would not gain my favour.
<P>
Members who wish to remove their coats may do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Adrian Sanders (Torbay):</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. Is it not in order for those who tabled amendment Nos. 144 and 145 to move them before the Minister responds?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> No. The amendments can be debated, but not moved. Amendment No. 75 is the only amendment to have been moved. Should those who have tabled the amendments wish to move them at an appropriate stage in debate on the Bill, that would be a matter for discussion between them and the Chairman. However, that is not under consideration at the moment.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Local Government and Housing (Ms Hilary Armstrong):</B> I was speaking to amendment No. 90 when the Committee adjourned on Thursday, so I shall conclude my remarks.
<P>
We want local authorities to play an active role as leaders of their communities. Opposition Members asked about the new duty, which will cement the place of sustainable development at the centre of community planning. The principles of sustainable development will underpin authorities' policies on services that they deliver and activities that they undertake in partnership with others. Local authorities are already drawing up strategies under Local Agenda 21 that give effect to sustainable development principles. The new quality of life indicators that we have published can be fashioned for local government.
<P>
Our policies promote sustainable development. Authorities that ignore sustainable development cannot claim to meet the best value test of effectiveness. However, the prime focus of best value legislation is on securing real improvements to the services on which local people depend. We do not want to weaken that focus. However, under the best value provisions, we will issue guidance ensuring that local authorities link the implementation of best value with relevant issues such as sustainability.
<P>
Amendment No. 93 would require the Secretary of State always to consult best value authority representatives&#151;instead of the authorities themselves&#151;before issuing guidance on best value performance plans. The Bill provides a choice between the best value authority and its representative, which could include the Local Government Association, the Welsh Local Government Association, the police authorities, and so on. The amendment would restrict that choice and would allow consultation only with representative associations, which, in certain cases, may not be appropriate. New clause 7 will be introduced to set out what guidance can cover and how it should be consulted upon. Subsection (2)(c) of the new clause is drafted in the same terms as existing clause 6(5)(c).
<P>
I understand the Opposition's concerns about new powers being taken by the Secretary of State, but their amendment seeks to downgrade those powers by substituting guidance for orders in those very areas where the national interest and need for consistency are strongest. Best value needs to have teeth if it is to work properly although I can assure hon. Members that we have no intention of reproducing the sort of detailed prescription and over-complexity which was such an unpopular feature of compulsory competitive tendering.
<P>
Typically, the official Opposition want all matters specified in the Bill, which is too inflexible. The Liberal Democrats want everything in guidance, which also lacks real rigour. We therefore seek a sensible middle course, taking advantage of the flexibility that orders can bring. The exercise of this power is subject to the negative procedure and there would be parliamentary scrutiny of any order we bring forward. For those reasons the amendment should not be accepted and I hope it will be withdrawn.
<P>
In relation to the two amendments tabled since our last sitting, I understand the Opposition's concern about new powers being taken by the Secretary of State, but amendment No. 144 would remove the provision in the Bill that best value authorities must include a number of key elements specified by the Secretary of State by order within a best value performance plan. Instead, the amendment provides only that the Secretary of State should issue guidance specifying the elements authorities should include in their performance plan.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 144 and 145 substitute guidance for orders in connection with setting out the key elements for inclusion in the best value performance plan. An order would list specific matters which authorities need to include. Guidance would offer flexibility but would not have quite the same force. It is essential that all authorities include certain key elements in producing performance plans in order to provide a base line. Only in that way can we properly judge the improvements that are being made by local government in the delivery of services.
<P>
Comparison is a key element in the best value regime. People must be able to compare their authority's performance with that of other authorities, and authorities will need to look at other authorities' performances when reviewing their own services. If the key elements that authorities are required to include in their performance plan are not prescribed through statutory instrument on a consistent basis, the whole best value performance management system will be undermined. Guidance is not strong enough in this case to achieve our goal of best value. I therefore hope that hon. Members will not press the amendment or those many others grouped with it.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the hon. Member for Torbay (Mr. Sanders), I again make it plain that amendments Nos. 144 and 145 are specific, and I do not expect a detailed debate on them, particularly as the Minister has clearly covered the matters contained in them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> It has been useful to have time to reflect since our last sitting and to read the Minister's comments. The only amendment in the group that we shall press to a vote is amendment No. 75 because the Minister has not persuaded us of this need for uniformity.
<P>
This part of the Bill is unnecessarily prescriptive, authoritarian and centralist&#151;in the image of the ``we know best'' attitude from central to local government. That must be opposed and I hope that the official Opposition will join us in the Division for the same reasons. The Conservatives have consistently complained about the extension of powers to the Secretary of State. Now there is an opportunity to register disquiet and discomfort about the number of additional powers being conferred by the Bill on the Secretary of State.
<P>
Despite some common ground, the Minister was right to point to differences of view within the Opposition. There is a philosophical basis for our opposition which is rooted firmly in a belief in local freedom, in people having the freedom to decide for themselves. That comes back to the priority of competence argument, which will doubtless be repeated throughout our sittings and on the Floor of the House when the Bill returns there.
<P>
Question put, That the amendment be made:&#151;

</FONT>Question accordingly negatived.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bernard Jenkin </B>(North Essex): I beg to move amendment No. 118, in page 3, line 34, after `measured', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`including, where appropriate, a range of performances expected to be attained by the best value authorities'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a simple amendment, which is designed to explore and probe what the performance indicators are intended to achieve. The clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Secretary of State may by order specify&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) factors (``performance indicators'') by reference to which a best value authority's performance in exercising functions can be measured''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>The key question is what those factors are and whether it is possible to measure all local authorities according to absolute performance criteria. If we are dealing only with indicators, we should be dealing with a range of them, not just with a collection of absolute ones.
<P>
The amendment would therefore add to the end of the subsection:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``including, where appropriate, a range of performances expected to be attained by best value authorities''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is in keeping with the spirit of the Bill, which emphasises comparing like with like rather than fixing in our minds absolute performance indicators. They may be appropriate for some authorities, but not for others.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I appreciate that subsection (2) would grant the Secretary of State the flexibility to set different performance indicators for different local authorities and different functions. However, it would be preferable to give local authorities a range of performance indicators instead of an absolute measure. Perhaps the Under-Secretary of State for Wales, who will reply to the debate, can explain the performance indicators and their application in more detail. What measurements will be used for which services? Will the measurements be similar to those that the Audit Commission already publish? If so, will local authorities have to work according to the Audit Commission's range of indicators, or will the performance indicators be different?
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I support my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin). I appreciate that one problem with providing for ``a range'' is that that automatically inhibits excellence. Therefore, I approach the matter with caution.
<P>
I assume that best value indicators will apply to every local authority service. How will the services of, for example, an inner London local authority be divided up? How will the indicators be applied? Who advises the Government? I expect that the Audit Commission has provided advice, but, presumably, the police and the social services inspectorate will also be involved and give extra advice.
<P>
Are the performance indicators targets or minimum standards? Should more note be taken of clause 4(1)(b) or of clause 5(4)(d)? The latter provision is a little softer. Will deviations be allowed? Will the indicators be established after close consultation with local authorities, including those indicators to which specific changes will apply? Will the Government allow pleas before the indicators are set in stone? If some local authorities then fail to meet the standards, do the Government anticipate local authorities trooping in to claim, ``I was robbed'', or that standards are too high? That already happens with standard spending assessments.
<P>
An increase in staff is anticipated: in those that monitor at local government level, in the Audit Commission&#151;and any other group that assists&#151;and in the Government Departments that are responsible for monitoring standards, ascertaining whether local authorities achieve them, and listening to the range of excuses. I warn Ministers that that range will be spectacular. Some excuses will be relevant, others, pie in the sky, yet others ludicrous. However, the percentage of authorities that present such excuses will be low because most are sufficiently competent to handle performance indicators.
<P>
Presumably there will be an annual review of standards. Will there be a procedure for consultation, discussion, pleas and so on? Will that procedure be based on recent data or, as the Bill suggests, on data that is 18 months to two years out of date?
<P>
The Bill states that the Secretary of State will have the opportunity to set different standards for different services at different times for different local authorities. That gives rise to questions about subjective opinion at all levels. It will be interesting to known how fine the division will be. Will that occasionally involve a specific authority, or will it generally involve classes of authorities? Have the Government estimated the additional cost at all levels? Has there been an assessment of this monitoring, reconsidering and examining standards and their results? Perhaps the Under-Secretary will write to me if he cannot answer now. The whole thinking behind the method and consultation has led me to realise that CCT looked simple and was economic, efficient and effective.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales </B>(Mr. Jon Owen Jones): We are in danger of going over arguments from earlier debates. In particular, the hon. Member for Mole Valley (Sir P. Beresford), always harks back at the alleged deficiencies of compulsory competitive tendering. Perhaps that is understandable, given his responsibility for introducing CCT. 
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> The Government recognise that CCT introduced mechanisms of management in local government that were in many instances beneficial. However, it should be generally recognised&#151;I thought that it had been&#151;that there are huge limitations to CCT both in the areas in which it applied and, in particular, in the many areas in which it did not.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I was not going to bite on CCT; instead I was about to say that although I feel aged, and may look aged, I did not introduce CCT.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> But the hon. Gentleman had responsibility for implementing the procedure. I admire his perseverance with a procedure which, if not entirely dead, soon will be.
<P>
To return to amendment No. 118, I understand that hon. Members wish the Secretary of State to be given power to specify levels of performance that authorities should be expected to attain. Clause 5(5) allows the Secretary of State, or the Assembly, to issue guidance on reviews of functions. Clause 5(7) provides that such guidance may state the matters that authorities should take into account when setting performance targets, including the range of performances that they may be expected to attain.
<P>
Furthermore, auditors who consider authorities' best value performance plans will assess whether the targets included therein are realistic and whether they take into account the relevant standards that do, or will, apply. So the Bill already contains a power to state in guidance the matters set out in amendment No. 118. The amendment would allow a provision in clause 4(1)(a) to duplicate a provision in clause 5 (7), thereby anticipating a procedure already in the Bill. I ask that amendment No. 118 be withdrawn.
<P>
Let me explain in more detail the way in which performance indicators would operate in, for example, social services. The Government will shortly be consulting on proposals for the performance assessment framework for social services in 1999-2000. These proposals include 48 performance indicators, among them indicators on the following: educational achievements for children being looked after, unit costs of foster care, help for adults with physical disabilities to live at home, day care for older people and spending on children in need. This national suite of best value performance indicators will probably include a selection of indicators for social services drawn from this list and chosen to reflect key national priorities for the services.
<P>
In Wales&#151;
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I am intrigued, having heard about inputs and outputs, and wondering how many out-takes will be needed&#151;[Interruption.]

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Whose pager is that? Please turn it off. Will right hon. and hon. Members please make sure that all pagers are set on silent.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> The difficulty that arises from adopting as a standard something like expenditure on children in need is that that amounts to a tendency to judge the quality of the service by the amount of other people's money put into it. That is not a standard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> No, it is not a standard; it is an indicator. We are consulting in this respect, and I agree with the hon. Gentleman that we should not predominantly take into account expenditure levels when setting indicators.
<P>
I was about to discuss how the relevant arrangements would be different in Wales. The Welsh Assembly will be responsible for setting performance indicators and standards for Welsh councils. For services whose key objectives and deliverable outcomes were very much the same across England and Wales, I should expect the Assembly to set indicators and standards that would enable comparisons to be made across both countries. Where service objectives were different, to reflect Welsh circumstances, the Assembly will want to set performance indicators and standards accordingly. Some performance indicators might be unique to Wales, such as in the use of the Welsh language in the provision of services.
<P>
I do not believe that the Welsh Assembly will represent a soft option. It will be in its interest to set challenging standards in the same way as in England, and it will not be immune from the criticism of local people if it fails to achieve best value.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> The Minister has differentiated between indicators and standards. Are we to take it that standards are a minimum that must be achieved and indicators are a guideline or target?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> We have discussed that at length and I admire the hon. Gentleman's perseverance. The Government intend to set no more than a few national standards. Reaching those will be very much in the national interest&#151;and I mean national interest to apply to both Wales and England. Performance indicators will be a wider measure.
<P>
Amendment No. 118 is unnecessary. Its objectives are covered elsewhere in the Bill and I ask that it be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for his explanation. We are still some way from understanding how the arrangements will work, although I appreciate that the pilot arrangements are operating already. The power to set indicators is a broad one and some authorities may find that indicators that are applied to them are inappropriate, because of their specificity.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard </B>(Taunton): I beg to move amendment No. 79, in page 4, line 1, after `the' insert

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 27, in page 4, line 2, after `Commission' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and representatives of best value authorities; and<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> The amendments relate to clause 4(3)(b), which deals with what views the Secretary of State should take into account when specifying performance indicators and standards. It brings us up against the narrow definition of the three Es that we have debated previously. To show how important they consider the three Es, the Government have specified in the Bill the intention to attend to the recommendations of the Audit Commission.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 79 would add the Local Government Association as a body to whose recommendations the Government should attend in deciding performance indicators and standards. However, the more substantial of the two amendments is amendment No. 27. Local performance indicators and standards have a vital role and the Secretary of State should be forced to have regard to local factors in drawing up what should be guidance rather than orders.
<P>
The Minister said earlier in our debates that best value was about putting the public at the centre of local authorities' consideration. We have already discussed prescriptiveness regarding the powers of central government over local government. The level of prescription makes it vital for the Secretary of State to have regard to the outcomes of local consultation. The Secretary of State is seeking to prescribe how, when and what type of local consultation should take place; and to decide what performance indicators and standards should be set for authorities. Yet there is no provision for saying that the Secretary of State ``must listen'' to the result of local consultation in deciding those indicators and standards.
<P>
Anxiety over that is not confined to local government. Police authorities are also concerned. They pointed out that they were already subject to national objectives set by the Home Secretary; but they must also set local objectives, performance indicators and targets which reflect local need and the result of local consultation. Authorities should not be so overburdened by national performance indicators and standards that there is no scope left to reflect the needs and wishes of local people. If the Secretary of State feels that he must set those standards, we strongly disagree, but at least he should take into account the views of local people established through local consultation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jon Owen Jones:</B> I am more sympathetic to the points made by the hon. Member for Taunton (Jackie Ballard) and I found little to disagree with in her argument.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> But&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> But&#151;[Interruption.] The hon. Lady's wish for the Government to consult before specifying performance indicators under clause 4(1) is understandable, but we have already stated in the local government White Paper that national performance indicators will be developed in consultation with the Audit Commission, with local government and others. That is another example of the broad consensus that we are trying&#151;successfully&#151;to achieve in developing best value. Consultation with local government and other bodies is integral to the development of an effective and coherent suite of best value performance indicators.
<P>
This spring in England, we are holding a series of seminars with interested bodies to discuss performance indicators for best value. In summer, we will issue a formal consultation document on performance indicators. We will thus be consulting a wide range of bodies. The Welsh Office is working in close association with the Welsh Local Government Association and the Audit Commission to develop a similar range of national and local performance indicators. We will consult on that in due course.
<P>
Last summer, the Audit Commission consulted local government, police and fire authorities, trade unions, private sector representatives, voluntary organisations, consumer associations and others on new performance indicator proposals. We will do likewise to achieve as wide a consensus as possible. Hon. Members can rest assured that we are already committed to wide-ranging and inclusive consultation. Performance indicators will not be produced in the dark. They cannot and they will not be developed without the input of those in the field, especially those with some experience of pilot authorities.
<P>
Although we support the broad principles underpinning the amendments, we cannot support them in their current form. Amendment No. 27 is too widely drawn, which would make for an over-complex consultation process and an added level of bureaucracy. Amendment No. 79 is too narrow. However, the Government will table a suitable amendment in due course to complement the current requirement set out in clause 4(3) to have regard to the recommendations of the Audit Commission when specifying performance indicators. That amendment will deal with the concerns about the need to consult local authorities and others on the changes to the suite of national performance indicators for best value. I therefore urge the hon. Lady to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> The Under-Secretary's response was helpful at least in part and I am pleased that the Government agree with the thrust of our amendments, but obviously we are disappointed that they have not accepted that on this occasion the Opposition may have some good ideas that are worth supporting. That is not very constructive.
<P>
We will not push amendment No. 79 to a vote, but I was not convinced by the Minister's argument that amendment No. 27 was over-complicated. It is central to the debate about where the Government's relationship with local government is going. It should be not just about consulting best value authorities but about taking into account the results of the consultation that the best value authorities have carried out themselves with their local systems.
<P>
At an earlier sitting, I talked about the cynicism among people who, having been consulted, feel that they have not been listened to. If people in local systems have to be consulted by local authorities, which I certainly welcome, and the local authority is willing to listen but the Government are not willing to take into account, the cynicism will grow. It will become increasingly difficult to carry out consultation.
<P>
The extra powers that the Bill gives the Secretary of State do not give local government confidence that it will be listened to. We will push your patience, Mr. Gale, by pressing amendment No. 27 to a vote. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 121, in page 4, line 3, leave out subsection (4). We are not in the business of talking up divisions for the sake of it, but this is one amendment on which we wish to divide the Committee. It goes to the heart of the operation of the Bill. As we have said before, the Bill gives substantial discretion and powers to the Secretary of State. Subsection (4), which the amendment seeks to leave out, provides that a best value authority, in exercising a function, must meet the performance standard set by the Secretary of State. In earlier debates we found it singularly difficult to ascertain what the standards will be. The Minister, when pressed, seemed reluctant to tell us what standards will be laid down.
<P>
We support the principle adumbrated by the hon. Lady at our previous sitting. She said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Best value is about delivering quality services at acceptable costs to those who use and pay for them. It is essential that authorities focus principally on service outputs and service outcomes to enable local people and those responsible for audit and inspection to assess real performance and achievement.&#151;[Official Report, Standing Committee B, 28 January 1999; c. 68.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We support wholeheartedly that objective and working process.
<P>
The hon. Lady was right to say that compulsory competitive tendering was, in a sense, only half the job because, although it focused on costs, many authorities, in applying CCT, neglected the output part of the equation. It focused on process, but not so much on outcomes. If the Bill is to work more effectively than CCT, it is outcomes upon which we must concentrate.
<P>
Later that day, after our discussion of performance indicators, the Minister explained:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In some service areas, the Government will set standards, which authorities will be required to meet. Some of them may have statutory basis already. An example is food standards, where standards are set nationally and authorities are aware that they must meet them. An authority that fails to meet a standard will be judged to have failed the test of best value for that service.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I pressed the Minister further&#151;food has already many statutory controls and standards, which made it seem a rather odd example for the Minister to give. She replied:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We propose to set a standard by which authorities should ensure that, for five, six and seven-year-olds, class sizes do not exceed thirty.''&#151;[Official Report, Standing Committee b, 28 1 1999; c. 114.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That left me scratching my head at the close of last Thursday's sitting. I had always thought that class size was not an educational output, but an educational input. The reason parents are attracted to the idea of maximum class sizes is that they think that if teaching is less widely spread over the number in the class, their children will receive a more concentrated&#151;therefore improved&#151;education. It is definitely input, not output. We find the Government intending to abuse the spirit of best value at the outset.
<P>
Another aspect of the Bill that the Government have completely neglected is that of dual supervision. The Office for Standards in Education&#151;OFSTED&#151;supervises the outputs of the education service. The question of best value might be connected with local education authorities' purchase of ancillary services, buildings insurance, grounds maintenance, or some such aspect, but it is a mistake to describe the size of classes as an indication of the value of the education. We know that the Government have been trapped by this mistake. The target is a product of focus groups. Class size is something on which parents focus easily, when, in fact, the director of OFSTED correctly said, before, during and after the general election, that there is little correlation between class size and educational achievement.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> OFSTED is never consistent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The Minister says that OFSTED is never consistent. She is the one who is on the rack now. She said that we should focus on outputs and gave, as an example, an educational input. Does she disagree? I shall give way if she wants to suggest that class size is an educational output, not an input.
<P>
Before we go further, we must ask what other legal, obligatory standards the Government have in mind to impose on local authorities. The input target that we are discussing has already caused chaos in some constituencies.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I have a letter from a constituent who is trying to get a child into a primary school for which 30 children&#151;the maximum allowed&#151;are already listed for entry in September 1999. The letter states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The 30 names on the list include siblings of out of catchment children already attending''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the school. That means that if any more children from the catchment area apply, they will displace the brothers and sisters of current pupils. The letter continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The obvious consequence of this will be that families will be split up and parents/carers will have to be in two places at once, or that parents will have no choice but to withdraw children from the school at a crucial stage in their social and educational development.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the problem with applying standards to inputs rather than outputs.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is entitled to use examples to illustrate his argument. However, I remind him that we are debating the amendment, not education.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful for that guidance, Mr. Gale.
<P>
The example shows that making performance standards obligatory opens the door to allowing the Government to impose on local authorities the standards that they regard as denoting performance outputs. Their focus group research may show the Government that those standards are important to their voting public, but they may not be the outputs that are necessary for an efficient, economic and effective local authority service.
<P>
We question whether such standards should have the force of law. The Minister has worked on the project for a long time. What other performance standards do the Government intend to set? The Committee should know that before granting the Secretary of State the power that we are discussing. Are we, once again, legislating blind and thus allowing the Government to impose whatever they like later?
<P>
It surprises me that a local government Bill could allow the Secretary of State to set mandatory class sizes. However, that is the position. What other standards will the Secretary of State set? They will have the force of law. We do not believe that the Secretary of State should have that power, and I trust that the Liberal Democrats will support us in trying to restrain the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Hayes </B>(South Holland and the Deepings): I rise merely to amplify some of the points that my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex made. I shall make only three points. I am a generous chap, and, therefore, I like to believe that some Labour Members still believe in the rights and freedom of local government to develop and implement distinctive policies.
<P>
First, the clause, like the Bill, is about central control, and the Secretary of State taking more and more power to oblige local authorities to conform to a standard. That ethos permeates the Bill, and is a significant shift from local democracy to central control. That would be bad enough if we knew the form that the control might take, but, as my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex said, we have heard scant detail about the nature of the criteria on which local authorities will be judged, the nature of the performance indicators or any of the matters about which local government and the public would rightly want to draw conclusions during the passage of the Bill.
<P>
Of course, the excuse is ``We are consulting and it will all be very difficult''. We have heard the Minister wax&#151;I was going to say wax lyrical, but that would be an overstatement so I shall just say that we have heard him wax&#151;about the balance between efficiency and local distinctiveness. However, we have had no firm detail or precision, only woolliness from the Minister on the subject.
<P>
Secondly, the question of input and output is a major one, but my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex has made that point and I do not want to repeat it at length, except to say that the one example given by the Minister was not even a measure of input. It was the class size point&#151;a policy&#151;which you made clear you would not allow us to debate at any length, Mr. Gale. However, it is enough to say that it was an example given by the Minister and it was not even a legitimate measure by her own criteria laid down in Committee.
<P>
Thirdly, the Minister spoke constantly in the previous sitting of the Committee about the need for consistency. The question that needs to be asked is why we must have that. That is a debate in itself. I do not believe that it is necesary for all local authorities to offer consistent services. The local authority in my area, which is controlled not by the Conservatives but by independents, does not&#151;I am alluding to this by way of example, Mr. Gale&#151;run a concessionary fares scheme for pensioners. I oppose that bitterly and am campaiging to encourage the local authority to do so. However, it has every right to take that decision. It is different from the policy of the surrounding authorities, but the elected people, answerable and accountable to the electorate, have made that judgment. That is the sort of diversity that one would expect in a free and open system.
<P>
We do not want the Secretary of State telling local authorities what they must do, what standards they must meet, what services they must provide and how they must provide them. No one who really cares about local democracy could want that. I believe in the time-honoured traditions that I have described and, therefore, I support the amendment and oppose the thrust of the clause.

<P>

<B>Mr. Owen Paterson </B>(North Shropshire): In following my hon. Friend's the Members for North Essex and for South Holland and the Deepings (Mr. Hayes) I want to put the view that amendment No. 121 would marginally improve clause 4, which lays down similar centralising powers to those dedicated to central planners under Gosplan in the Soviet Union. I do not see how the Government can claim to believe in local democracy and decision making while trying to impose targets in the way set out in clause 4.
<P>
I throw back in the Minister's teeth her statement that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Opposition Members do not wish us to concentrate on early-years education.''&#151;[Official Report, Standing Committee B, 28 January 1999; c.118.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall give a specific example in which the strong generalisations coming from the Government will not work. The Minister made a mistake in making a specific promise about class sizes. She said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We propose to set a date by which authorities should ensure that, for five, six and seven-year-olds, class sizes do not exceed thirty.''&#151;[Official Report, Standing Committee B, 28 January 1999; c.114.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We know that that idea came from focus groups before the general election. It attracted wide support.
<P>
I visited a primary school in Whitchurch not long ago which has been thrown into total confusion because in one year group there are 63 children. One does not need to be Pythagoras to realise that that means one class of 31 and one of 32. [Interruption.] The Minister, chuntering away from a sedentary position, speaks of a pledge. What is that school to do? The Minister has effectively pledged to cause monstrous disruption to that school. [Interruption.] Hon. Members laugh at that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> If a national standard were applied in that way it would force the expulsion of three children. The effect of that would be to reduce resources in the school. A school in my constituency will have to get rid of classroom helpers so the pupil-teacher ratio will worsen as the result of the imposition of a standard in this way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> My hon. Friend makes my next point. It is not just the disruption, but the impact on the families. The Minister shakes her head. I would like a specific answer for the parents in my constituency about what will happen in that school. At least if amendment No. 121 were accepted, there would be room for some flexibility, but there is none at present. Will there be any flexibility for local decisions to be made by local people who understand the local issues?
<P>
Will there be any compensation? It must not be forgotten that the Minister talked about a firm date. Someone will have to find some money to build a new classroom, to take on an extra teacher and to lay on a bus for the three difficult children who spoil the Government's national target.&#151;[Interruption.] I should like to know whether the Minister is listening to me.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If hon. Members wish to have private conversations, they should do so in the Corridor. Ministers are required to reply to the debate and it behoves them to listen to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. I really would like specific answers to those questions which are of interest to hon. Members representing rural constituencies where the distance between competing primary schools may be as much as five or 10 miles. My final point is that this could lead to Government by slogan and focus group. It was a clever slogan and it may have helped the Government to win the election, but there is a danger that it will be made into an unenforceable national target. If amendment No. 121 is accepted we marginally avoid that. I would like specific answers to my questions on compensations and costs.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> On Second Reading and at our first sitting the official Opposition, supported by the Liberal Democrats, requested more details so that we could get to grips with the Bill and its intention. The only detail we have is about education which is why we are harping on it a little. I am sure, Mr. Gale, that you will indulge us a little here. Regrettably, when I asked questions such as I did on amendment No. 118, the only answer was an interjection. Perhaps rather than just reading out his brief the Under-Secretary of State for Wales will respond to that.
<P>
On that specific point, the Minister said something about our having run services. For a while, I was education chairman of an inner city authority. That authority took over education from the Inner London Education Authority, a Labour-run authority which consistently had the worst outputs imaginable in the country on any standard and by any measure. When it was removed there was a sigh of relief in inner London. Interestingly, education is not re-absorbed into the proposed new London assembly. At least the Government have recognised that.
<P>
In attempting to raise the standards and looking at outputs of local authorities, in the early days I raised the question of class sizes with individual primary school heads. Some of them wanted smaller class sizes. That was particularly so for those closer to the centre of London, such as Battersea, which had a large number of children from ethnic minorities who spoke different languages. Those in Putney&#151;the other end of the authority&#151;wanted larger classes with the same amount of money. They wished to use that money for extra equipment for different approaches. That was allowed by the education authority and the positive results were clearly visible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jon Owen Jones:</B> The debate has ranged around our policy on class sizes rather than the amendment before us. It must have been in order, Mr. Gale as you allowed the debate, although you asked one hon. Member to return to the subject of the amendment. I will address the issue of class size briefly before I talk about the amendment itself.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will the Under-Secretary give way on that point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> I have not said anything yet.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> So that the Minister does not stray as I did, what we really want to know is what other standards the Government intend to set for local authorities. We mentioned education as an example of a standard that it may be inappropriate for the Secretary of State to set, yet there is no control over what standards he can set. Will the Minister now inform the Committee what standards the Secretary of State intends to set?
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> I will tell the Committee about appropriate standards after I have answered other questions about class sizes. I want to be helpful. I am concerned&#151;I have a three-way seat&#151;and hope that the Tory party will get its act together. It does the Tories no good to keep harping on about policy issues on which they have lost so much ground.
<P>
The difficulties of prescribing a standard set class size have to be balanced against those that will arise from not setting a standard. As a local Member of Parliament and a local parent, I know that the nearest primary school to my home had an average class size of 37 during the early 1990s. It is a popular school, but I have heard parents complaining hundreds of times that their children do not receive enough attention in classes with as many as 35, 36 or 37 pupils.
<P>
My 8-year-old child and my 5-year-old child have had to attend large classes. My 8-year-old&#151;a rather precocious child, though I do not know where he gets it from&#151;was born in September and coped reasonably well. My middle child, however, was July-born and very shy. I felt bitter about his having to attend a very large class. It happened because we had not managed to impose a better standard, so I make no apology for the Government introducing standards. One can argue whether it was more input than output, but the standard was worth having and was overwhelmingly supported by the British public.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> I have no wish to argue with the Minister's view of why that standard was good: the Government were honest and it was popular. However, how can that be described as a measure of performance? It may contribute to performance and we could debate that all day&#151;though you would not let us, Mr. Gale.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Correct.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> We are talking not about standards but about measurable output and measurable performance criteria. How can the Minister's example be, in simple term, a measurable performance criterion?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> As I said, there is a legitimate debate about how much is input or output. However, that is the position that we are incorporating&#151;it was originally separate&#151;into best value. I was going to move on to output measures, of which there can be many in education such as examination results, the number of pupils reaching certain standards and so forth. I would rather talk about other matters.
<P>
<B>Mr Jenkin:</B> Before the Under-Secretary goes on&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr Jones:</B> I am trying to provide the examples that the hon. Gentleman requested.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Has the Under-Secretary discussed with the headteacher how those standards will be achieved? I suspect that the headteacher would say, ``It is all very well having class sizes of 30, but where is the money going to come from?''. That problem arises from setting an obligatory standard that relates to inputs rather than outputs.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have permitted debate around this example because it was chosen for discussion by the Opposition and it is appropriate for the Minister to respond. However, I remind the Committee that we are debating clause 4(4), not education.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> I have discussed the issue with the headmaster. I have also discussed resourcing with him and he is pleased with the new regime, although there are difficulties.
<P>
I was about to give another example. Among the many hats that I wear in the Welsh Office is that of Minister with responsibility for social services. One of the most difficult issues that I must address&#151;I admit that sometimes I find it emotionally difficult&#151;is caring for children in need who have been taken into care. [Interruption.] My hon. Friend the Minister reminds me that the correct phrase is ``looked-after'' children. We know what we are talking about, whichever words we use.
<P>
The history of local government provision for such children in England and Wales&#151;but especially in Wales as a result of some celebrated cases&#151;is not one of which we can be proud. This is an ideal example of something for which national standards should be set, and of local government having to work towards them. There should be standards for the outputs of looked-after children. For example, it would be reasonable to set a standard whereby a child in care, being looked after, is not given to four, five or six different sets of individuals or organisations in one year. The standard should be much more exacting than that. I am merely giving an example of what currently happens. [Interruption.] It is not an input, it is an output&#151;that we say that a child should be looked after by no more than a set number of carers in one year. That is an output that local authorities measure. [Hon. Members: ``It is not.''] That is a semantic argument.

<P>

<B>Mr. David Curry (Skipton and Ripon):</B> I am slightly confused and a little worried. Much of what the Minister says seems to be about architecture&#151;how many people do this, how many are here, or there. I thought that we were debating quality of service. I remain to be convinced of an exponential link between, for example, a child being dealt with by one, two or three carers, depending on need, and the benefit derived from it. Can we be sure that we do not get involved in a series of mechanical measurements which in the end may have little to do with whether someone benefits from the service?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman thinks that we are having a sterile debate about architecture. It was not meant to be. I assure him that I am thinking about the people involved, not the architecture. The evidence that I have shows a clear link. Common sense tells us that if a young person is passed from one hand to another, with no stability in his or her life, there is a clear link between that instability and the resulting outcomes. I feel strongly that national standards should apply and that we should ensure that they are met. Because young people need care for some reason&#151;perhaps parents are not there, or have let them down&#151;the state effectively becomes the parent, and should ensure that the organisation or local authority that has direct responsibility maintains a particular standard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> Will the Under-Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> I should like to make progress, and will give way later.
<P>
The Government are committed to improving local services and ensuring that all people, no matter where they live, have access to quality services. Standards and targets will be the key to achieving continuing improvements in service delivery. They will drive up local authorities' performances, and put pressure on those authorities that are performing poorly. The Government will set standards for authorities to meet in some service areas. An authority that fails to meet a standard will be judged to have failed the best value test for that service.
<P>
Standards will be set for only a small proportion of services. The Government do not plan to impose a large number of new standards on local authorities. However, in cases in which there is a clear national requirement, such as standards of educational attainment for children of different age groups or for children in care, the Secretary of State or the National Assembly will specify performance standards that authorities must meet.
<P>
The Bill makes provision for the Government to take a clear lead, as set out in the local Government White Paper. Setting and changing standards over time will be a key driver of improvement. Such power will be used when there is a clear national interest in setting standards.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for giving way: he has done so a number of times.
<P>
I was interested to hear about the Under-Secretary's experiences and his charming, if precocious, children. However, will the standards set by the Government be measures of effect? The Under-Secretary has described only measures of cause. He may be right to say that instability and involving a number of carers in a child's education may damage that child's chances. However, we should not be counting numbers, but assessing how those chances are damaged. We must address effect, not cause. The Under-Secretary&#151;to use the commercial terms that he favours&#151;has described features, not benefits or costs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> An outcome measurement might mean setting a standard that required children in local authority care to achieve, on average, a certain number of general national vocational qualifications.
<P>
Standards will be relevant, necessary and appropriate for best value. Amendment No. 121 is therefore undesirable and we will oppose it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I wonder&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Jones:</B> I am not giving way. I have finished my speech.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Mr Curry, do you wish to make a speech?
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> No, I was about to ask the Under Secretary a question. I thought that he was displaying his usual courtesy in giving way.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. the Under-Secretary has said that he is not giving way. However, the hon. Gentleman may speak briefly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I just want to address one remark to the Under-Secretary. I am concerned that standards will drive local authorities to spend at SSA on every service. The non-hypothecation of funding in local government has been eroded by the present and&#151;to be fair&#151;the previous Government. That has been done through the passporting of education and the Secretary of State's insistence that the education SSA is necessary at the expence of education. As a result, in many shire counties, the SSA is commonly overspent on education and underspent on roads.
<P>
Under the process of examination and scrutiny, local authorities risk being pushed to spend at SSA in every service, so that the flexibility of non-hypothecation is eroded in practice, even if not in principle.
<P>
Will the Under-Secretary confirm that local authorities should be able to assess priorities in particular areas? Best value should take account of prioritisation made at local level, otherwise there is a danger of grisly uniformity. The Government will suffer as a result of that because people will criticise the whole SSA principle on the grounds that it does not reflect the necessary elements for achieving best value, which the Government are imposing.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jon Owen Jones:</B> I had finished my speech but, out of courtesy, I shall reply to the right hon. Gentleman.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman's fears would be reasonable if the Government intended to establish comprehensive standards. I have said clearly that we do not intend to do that. The standards that we are considering would be limited, and would apply only to services in which the achievement of particular standards was clearly in the national interest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> We have had an interesting debate, and the Under-Secretary provided an interesting example. We are considering a sensitive area&#151;the Committee sympathises with the Under-Secretary on that. In abstract terms, it is better for a child in local authority care to be transferred between foster parents or carers as little as possible. However, I have a naive faith, even in local authority services, and believe that they would try to avoid moving a child in care often.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Read the Utting report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I would have thought that every local authority should try to achieve the target of moving a child as little as possible. I have not read the Utting report in detail. However, if such a crude standard is set, it is not difficult to envisage a failing social services department making matters even worse by trying to achieve the standard. Let us imagine that a child has been moved between carers or foster parents the maximum number of times, and that something else is going wrong in that child's life&#151;[Interruption.] This is not sad, I am asking a genuine question.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I had occasion last week to stress the difficulty that sedentary interventions pose Hansard staff. The Chair is always willing to facilitate debate, and if hon. Members who are on their feet wish to give way to another hon. Member, the Chair will try to accommodate that. However, sedentary interventions make Hansard reporting difficult. I should be grateful if all members of the Committee refrained from making them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> All hon. Members have experienced cases that have gone wrong in their constituencies. If a crude new target is imposed, failing social services departments may meet the standard but fail to provide a happier environment for the children.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> Other tactics that failing local authorities may use include the excuse of SSAs, which my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) described, but they may also try to move the child from fostering into a home simply to meet the standards. That could deprive the child of an opportunity of a better life.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The real problem is the length of time that it takes to arrange permanent fostering or permanent adoption. The relevant legislation contains problems that should be tackled. The Government should do that instead of setting blanket mandatory standards that could worsen matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> The one new factor that we gleaned from the Under-Secretary was that there will not be many new standards. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon implied, there will be a conflict. We need to know not only the new standards but the priority, because there will be conflicts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Inevitably there will be conflicts. To return to the key point concerning the amendment, we are giving the Secretary of State a new power to set standards about we know not what. We have now been given three examples. One was food, which the Minister admitted was a pretty redundant standard, since there is already plenty of food legislation. Another was class sizes. On that subject, when the Minister was asked by the hon. Member for Torbay why the limit had to be imposed from the top, she replied:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It was a manifesto commitment. I remind the Committee that 14.5 million people voted for it.''&#151;[Official Report, Standing Committee B, 28 January 1999; c. 117.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is rather a novel notion of rejuvenating local government to seek, at every general election, a national mandate to clobber local authorities with the Government's standards, regardless of what is an output, what is an input, or whether anything will be achieved. The hon. Member for Torbay made the telling point that the people's Government sees their role as testing public opinion through its focus groups, obtaining a mandate for particular voter-friendly targets and then stuffing those targets on to local authorities whether or not they are practical or likely to achieve what people think they will.
<P>
We now have a new kind of contracting. As both the main Opposition parties said on Second Reading, the Bill amounts to the nationalisation of local government. In addition to the abolition of compulsory competititve tendering, there will be a new contractual relationship between central and local government. Whereas national Government used to provide grants and revenue-raising powers to local authorities so that they could decide on their priorities and standards, now the Secretary of State will be able to lay down fixed terms thought likely by the Government to be popular with focus groups, but which may have no relation to what local authorities need to achieve for local people.

<P>

<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I consult only one focus group&#151;my wife. I usually find her a decisive influence.
<P>
Does my hon. Friend think that there is a danger that something may be judged as a standard when the issue is really one of policy? For example, often the parents of a severely handicapped child would prefer him or her to enter an institutional environment&#151;a special home. Following a policy change the social services department might take the view that it would be better for the child to remain in the local community&#151;within a framework, obviously. Thus, two sets of people, both wanting the best for the child, would have different aspirations with a view to achieving it. That is an argument about policy. We must be careful not to judge as a factor of performance something that amounts to a genuine conflict of policy. The guidelines to be imposed must be extremely flexible and sensitive to that possibility. Otherwise, they will be really peremptory and harmful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I agree entirely with my right hon. Friend, who always makes valid points. The issue of class sizes is a case in point. It is clearly a political policy issue, not a matter of educational achievement, and it is being imposed because the Government consider that they have a mandate to do so. We have been told about only three standards. We are told that there will not be many, but the Government are reluctant to tell the Committee what others they have in mind. I am not surprised by that reluctance, because many Labour Members were elected on the basis that the Government would not start imposing new obligations on, or interfering with, local authorities. Therefore, the more standards Ministers come out with, the more trouble they are in. My right hon. and hon. Friends and I are enjoying that, but I invite the Minister to turn and look at her hon. Friends' faces. I do not think that they are enjoying this as much as she is.
<P>
The Ministers will not tell us what standards are contemplated, either because they do not know&#151;are we to believe that?&#151;or because they do not want the Committee to know. That is the truth of it. Should we believe that they will set only three standards? They have said that they will not. They will set many more standards than that, but will not specify them. That is an insult to the Committee.
<P>
Let us consider the example of the two children running away from school or being abducted&#151;we do not know which, it is sub judice. The Government are under pressure to set a national standard for dealing with children who are absent when the register is taken. It is easy, as I said, for the Government to feel pressured into doing something and now, as a result of the Bill, the power to set a national standard lies at the feet of the Secretary of State. However, I am not sure that it is right to set such a standard. Every school in the land has probably learnt the lesson and will want to deal with the problem in different ways.
<P>
A culture has developed over recent years whereby everything that goes wrong in local authorities is blamed on the Government. That puts pressure on the Government to act and the centralisation of power from local authorities to central government will continue and accelerate it. That should not be the objective of the Bill, so the Committee should reject subsection (4) in order to protect local authorities from unwarranted interference, which the Government have been completely unwilling to specify&#151;an insult to the intelligence of the Committee.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> Clause 5 is about the manner in which best value authorities conduct reviews of their functions&#151;reviews being one of the key procedural components of best value. The clause provides the Secretary of State yet again with a power to issue guidance to best value authorities on the form, content and timing of reviews and he may include specific guidance on the way in which performance indicators and targets should be used in attaining best value.
<P>
As we debate the Bill clause by clause, it becomes clearer that the answer to the question posed by the hon. Member for North Essex&#151;as to whose value is best value&#151;is neither local residents nor local electors but the Secretary of State. The amendments are intended to clarify how best value reviews will operate.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Bill will leave huge amounts of power in the Secretary of State's hands and we want to ensure that three things happen. First, we want to ensure that reviews are a permanent but not an overbearing process&#151;hence the need for regularity. Secondly, we want to ensure that reviews are not rushed. The Local Government Association supports the flexibility that comes from not including a time scale in legislation. Given the experience of the best value pilot schemes so far, the association agrees with the Government that something like five years would be much more practical than a shorter period in which to review all a local authority's activities.
<P>
Thirdly&#151;this runs counter to the second point&#151;there is a need to tie in the reviewing process with accountability to the electorate. The current framework is a recipe for hand washing whenever an authority changes control. I am sure that hon. Members can envisage new administrations either claiming the credit for a good best value report or blaming their opponents for a bad one. That does not help increase accountability; nor residents' and electors' understanding of where blame should lie or where praise is due.
<P>
Under amendment No. 141, we would guide local authorities towards the electoral cycle when selecting the timetable for reviews without tying their hands, as Conservative Members would do under amendments Nos. 6 and 8. The duration of reviews is widely expected to be five years. If that is so&#151;it would be helpful if the Minister were to tell us today&#151;the amendment would help to clarify whether it would be wholly up to local authorities to set their timetables and would deal with the possibility of an authority failing to hold a potentially embarrassing review for the duration of the electoral cycle.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Committee will notice a typographical error in the amendment paper. Amendment No. 140 should read ``a proportion of''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> As with much of the Bill, clause 5 is an archetype of other clauses; it is impossible to find out what will happen from reading the Bill. Unless the White Paper and the other writings and discussions have been studied, it is impossible to divine what the Bill is intended to do.
<P>
The time period to which the hon. Member for Torbay referred is specified in the White Paper; it says ``five years''. The Government's reluctance to specify a period in the Bill underlines their love of flexibility. Lest we be under any illusion, that flexibility is designed for the convenience of the Government, not necessarily for that of local authorities.
<P>
The three amendments that we have tabled are designed to make the Minister tell us why, for example, best value reviews of all functions should not be conducted annually. Indeed, in any business, assessing best value is a continuous process; it happens each hour of every person's working day. People try to extract best value to maximise profit, efficiency, the return to shareholders and the benefits to customers. We want to local authorities to emulate that business process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian White </B>(Milton Keynes, North-East): Is the hon. Gentleman seriously suggesting that, when reviewing their business plans, large companies do an in-depth study of each of their sections every year? The companies that I have done consultancy work for take a longer view than that&#151;one of about five years. I should have thought that the fact that they examine a particular part of their business each year and then move on to other parts would be commended as good business practice. That is what most large, efficient companies do in this country.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I have worked in the private sector for both large and small companies and, in most businesses, the budget-setting procedure is certainly a best value process. Sections of the business are considered in different detail and depth, but best value should be a continuous and seamless process. If the period is meant to be five years, perhaps the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East (Mr. White) will vote for one of our amendments. He will then have an opportunity to put what he believes into practice rather than doing the bidding of his Whip, who sits patiently in the Room doing various bits and pieces.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that most local authorities assess many of their services, especially those under CCT, every six months to a certain degree and at least every year as part of the CCT process? Therefore, many authorities can carry out a decent review of the services within 12 months, particularly of those that are subject to CCT.
<P>
Mr. Jenkin
<P>
: We tabled three amendments for different periods because we wanted to be open minded about the matter. The Government should explain what they consider practical and why they have not specified a period, although there is a danger in doing so. If a period of one year is specified, for example, local authorities will get away with not carrying out a sufficient in-depth study of any of their services. A five-year period causes me anxiety because, frankly, it is too long. Many local authorities are small businesses and they should be able to review their functions more often than that. However, some of the larger authorities do need to review their functions more often.
<P>
Amendment No. 127 suggests that 20 per cent. of the functions of a local authority should be reviewed each financial year, which reflects the five-year idea and which brings me to ask again for a definition from the Government. The Bill's shortcoming is that a local authority that wants to go through the motions of a best value review without achieving very much will be able to do so. That happens in the private sector, too, otherwise consultants would not exist&#151;I submit to the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East. The Bill does not provide us with clarification, so we look forward to receiving it from the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The clause reminds me of what may have been the first book by John Fowles entitled ``The Collector'', in which a person took prisoner a young lady and did not know what to do with her when he had imprisoned her. John Fowles also wrote ``The French Lieutenant's Woman'', which was much better known than that book and which was better than the film.
<P>
The clause is immensely prescriptive in all the powers with which it endows the Secretary of State. It states that he may issue guidance on everything under the sun including, it seems, the front cover of the final report. It covers an enormous list of activities, such as the timetable for a review, the procedure, the form of a review, the contents of a review, the indicators, the targets and so on. The crucial question to which I keep returning is, who will do what at 9 o'clock on Monday morning?
<P>
Clearly, the Government will require local authorities to do something otherwise they would have not have taken on such a gargantuan amount of enabling power. The relationship between local authorities and the Government is not intended to be platonic, but interventionist. They will tell local authorities how to organise themselves. Let us consider a children's puzzle with a few numbers that can be joined up to form a picture. We just want a few fleeting hints of what might happen, so that we can put them together and make a good guess at the result.
<P>
I am sure that local authorities would like to receive similar hints. Will local authorities have to approach the Government with a proposition? Must they show what they intend to do over the time scale, which might not be the same? Or must they set out a five-year programme, for example? Must local authorities deliver a pick and mix of different services, some large and some on a much smaller scale? Do they start with a small one, to learn how to do it, or do they start with a difficult one, to get it out of the way? Do the Government recommend that local authorities set up a best value committee to supervise and under-internalise the results of the required methodology? Do the Government intend some authorities to do it on a different scale, so that results become more generally known, and so that people do not spend their lives reinventing the wheel in every local authority?
<P>
Those are important questions. What do the Government recommend? When I return to north Yorkshire, people will tell me that they have a new chief executive. They will ask what they are going to do at 9 o'clock on Monday morning. Who does what at 9 o'clock on Monday morning? If they decide to start with education, for example, what form should that take? Should they consider the number of people employed in county hall, Northallerton? What is the relationship between that and the Ofsted report? Where does performance-related pay fit between best value and Ofsted? It now appears that a third set of criteria will be applied to schools; performance-related pay in education was announced yesterday. Should they consider providing fewer schools? The clause suggests that they consider services that they should not provide. I should like an illustration of services that local authorities might decide that they should not provide, having examined in order to eliminate. That would be interesting. They might include, for example, certain special educational needs, which are shared between local authorities, or some of the more specialist educational requirements in the cultural field, for which local authorities can barely pay because of financial stringencies placed on them.
<P>
When local authorities consider how services should be judged, should they examine small rural schools? Will small rural schools be judged unnecessary? Is part of best value the recommendation for fewer small rural schools? After all, they will cost much more now that headteachers will be given so much more money. Should such schools be eliminated? Is it a legitimate part of best value that local authorities should examine whether they should maintain their present infrastructure of schools? If so, is the value to be based on how much they cost, on salary bills, or on the school's social value or broader value to the community? That is a crucial question in my constituency and that of the Minister, which are extensive northern constituencies that cover large upland areas. Those are essential questions in considering the constituency fabric. Which services might not be delivered? Against what will they be judged? Will it be other local authorities? Criteria exist for that. No private sector providers in the conventional sense exist against which they can be judged. They cannot be judged against possible delivery by the private or voluntary sectors, which would be an interesting indicator.
<P>
I should like a few hints about what will happen. Let us start with a typical Trollopian shire, such as Barsetshire. Let us suppose representatives from Barsetshire come to visit the Minister, and, once they have finished their moan about its standard spending assessments, ask for a hint about best value and where they should begin, because the idea is new to them, they are not quite sure and the chief executive has not done such a thing before. They want to get it right, but do not want to put a foot wrong, and want to know how to begin. They ask for a few hints, and say that they will not quote the Minister. The Committee promises to be extremely discreet so that she is not embarrassed, but it would be enormously helpful to have just one or two little, speculative hints to be going on with.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I welcome you back to the Chair, Mr. Gale.
<P>
The general thrust of the entire group of amendments is to make the approach to reviews under best value much more tightly constrained than it is under the Bill as drafted. The amendments do that through a variety of means, including setting in the Bill specific time periods for completing review programmes. and seeking to require authorities to carry out tightly defined amounts of review activity every year, making the list that appears in the Bill exhaustive&#151;a list that must be addressed in every review&#151;rather than indicative, as it is at present, which could provide the basis for a variety of approaches.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Opposition Members have shown a rather schizophrenic attitude this morning. They seem unsure whether they want central prescription or local decision-making. I say again what I have said at the previous sittings: we seek a balance. There has always been a balance between national and local determination, but that balance has become over-centralised. That is why, although the national interest is important, we believe that decisions on delivery and priorities should be determined locally.
<P>
I understand the Opposition's wish to be assured of the robustness of the review process. I share that aim and I am confident that the Bill provides for it. To secure the improvements in the delivery of services that we seek, best value reviews will need to be rigorous and robust. They will challenge how, and at what level, a function is being exercised. They will compare one authority's performance with another, consult local communities and assess competitiveness. It would be unrealistic to expect all authorities to complete that sort of demanding review of all their functions within one year or even three years.
<P>
Several authorities have already embarked on a review of their services as part of the best value pilot programme. I must encourage Opposition Members, particularly the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon, to read some of the recent documents from the pilot authorities. We are working extensively with local government, the Audit Commission and other bodies to develop the framework of best value. We want to ensure that, far from needing to ask the Secretary of State or the Minister what to do at 9 o'clock on a Monday morning, authorities are confident in how to approach their responsibilities on best value, are learning from the pilot authorities and are getting on with the job. As I said at the start of the Committee's consideration of the Bill, more than 200 authorities are already engaged in working out what best value means for them, and how to start implementing it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> No. I am still dealing with the points already raised.
<P>
One of the working papers distributed to hon. Members, entitled ``Achieving Best Value through Performance Review'', makes clear that, far from waiting for the Secretary of State to prescribe every dot and comma, authorities are, as we say in the north-east, using their nous; they are using their intelligence and common sense to work out what is necessary to prepare for the introduction of best value.
<P>
Several authorities have already embarked on a review. Experience shows that even when working to a five year timetable, the sort of exacting review that is necessary is a demanding challenge. I must resist the notion of authorities having to review everything every year&#151;or even every three years. As the hon. Member for North Essex said, we make it clear in the White Paper that we envisage a five-year period is about right. Some authorities are saying that they want to try to do it in less than five years and I do not want to prevent them doing so by adding to the Bill. However, I must also resist the notion of authorities reviewing fixed quotas of their functions every year. That represents prescription of the worst kind. It takes no account of the fact that authorities will often wish to tackle reviews on the basis of particular functions or themes&#151;for example, to review housing and related functions or tackle a range of services provided to a section of the community, such as young people. Some of our pilot authorities, such as Oldham and Sunderland, are using just such an approach. The argument for fixed quotas also ignores the fact that different bodies, with different priorities and different ideas about how they should deliver improvements, are involved&#151;they need a framework, not a straitjacket.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The hon. Lady mentioned a number of services, which obviously are not all provided by the same local authorities. Would she or the Secretary of State consider requiring that the review of, for example, social services by a shire authority be undertaken simultaneously with a review of housing services by a district authority, given that there is such a close relatonship between the client groups subscribing to those two services? Would it not make sense to make sure that there is co-ordination in situations where services depend on each other? Would the Secretary of State recommend that?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> We are to seek guidance as to how we can ensure co-operation between bodies in the way that the right hon. Gentleman suggests&#151;that may not be by insisting that reviews are undertaken at the same time, but by close liaison between authorities.
<P>
Work by the Audit Commission on housing for vulnerable people where social services have an input shows that there is great dissatisfaction about the way in which that service is currently carried out, particularly in two-tier areas, but also in some single-tier areas. The Audit Commission has already said that it wants authorities to examine that. We want flexibility and that is why we do not want the level of prescription that hon. Members seek to push on to us and into the Bill. We need to be sure that the most serious problems are addressed first and that there is proper co-operation. The hon. Gentleman will know that the Government are working on providing other solutions to the problem. We expect a White Paper on what we are calling better government to be issued later this year. That White Paper poses the question of how we ensure that government for the citizen is more seamless and is not confined within the boundaries of an authority or an agency.
<P>
The review process should focus on service delivery to local people rather than on fulfilling specific quotas, as the amendment would require. The Bill also allows authorities to review their functions more quickly than the minimum period set down in law. We think that five years offers a reasonable challenge but, as I said, some authorities seek to move more quickly than that. Hon. Members will know, if they have had a chance to look at the documents, that Newham, for example, seeks to carry out its review of all of its functions within three years. We commend that ambition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> If subsection 5(2) stated that the Secretary of State may by order specify a period of, say, three or five years within which an authority is to review all its functions, how would that prevent an authority reviewing its functions in a shorter period? The operative word is ``within''.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am making a general argument against specific figures being set out in the Bill. The hon. Gentleman will disagree with that&#151;that is his right. We are in a democracy and I should never want the hon. Gentleman not to have that right to disagree.
<P>
I must resist the notion that reviews, of themselves, should deliver improvements. They are a means by which authorities can identify areas for improvement and set demanding future targets for themselves. Best value authorities should be judged on the outcomes of the reviews, not by the reviews themselves. That is what our inspection and audit team are designed to test&#151;as we shall debate later.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon asked for examples of authorities considering functions and deciding that they should not carry them out. As a pilot authority, Newham carried out only about nine adoptions last year. It is deciding not to carry out that function itself in the future, but will consider another means of fulfilling its statutory responsibility. The authority will not manage and supervise the adoption process because having a team to deal with such a small number will not offer best value for money. It is just such examinations that we expect authorities to carry out that will give the public a much better service.
<P>
We should not underestimate the resource implications of these reviews, both for best value authorities themselves, as well as audit and inspection regimes. A permissive framework that requires all functions to be reviewed over a reasonable period is therefore necessary to strike a balance between the other work necessary to achieve best value and the day-to-day delivery of council services.
<P>
Good authorities will get the balance between all their responsibilities right. If they concentrated simply on reviews, they would not be making sure that they were delivering their services more effectively or taking account of such reviews and changing their practice.
<P>
I believe that the Bill, as drafted, provides a framework that will deliver services and force authorities to think strategically about the way in which they perform their functions. Their assumptions and methods should be regularly exposed to fresh challenge. At the same time, the Bill will allow them to innovate, develop new approaches and learn from their own experiences and those of others. I ask the Opposition to withdraw their amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> I shall be brief because I know that other members of the Committee want to speak, but I have two specific points to ask the Minister. First, there is no clarity about the nature of collaborative arrangements between authorities. The arrangements that take place between, say district and county councils, would necessitate the review taking place coterminously, or at least with some degree of co-ordination. Secondly, to develop the argument of my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon, it is not simply a matter of local authorities reviewing and deciding what they will not do, as the Minister suggested in her reference to one of the pilot authorities. It is a matter of an authority using discretion in choosing to do something, which because it is perhaps unique and innovative, cannot conform to a national standard and cannot be thus assessed
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``by reference to the exercise of the same function, or similar functions, by other best value authorities and by commercial and other businesses''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It will be impossible to review in a consistent way&#151;to use one of the Minister's terms&#151;an authority that chooses to be innovative and uses its discretion accordingly.
<P>
I hope that there will be some further discussion to clarify those issues.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am so used to the Minister's responses being comprehensive that I thought that she would address amendments Nos. 128 and 129, even though I did not refer to them. Amendment No. 128 deals with the wording of subsection (3)(a). It is a matter of whether the objective of an authority's review should be to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``aim to improve the way in which its functions are exercised'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or whether it should be simply to improve them. Perhaps that is a sematic point, but good intentions are not enough; we want to see results.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> If my hon. Friend were to refer back to clause 3, he would see that it begins:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A best value authority must make arrangements to secure continuous improvements in the way in which its functions are exercised.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The phrase ``aim to'' is not used there.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Yes. I think that the parliamentary draftsmen&#151;
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Perhaps I can help. I addressed that point during my speech, and the hon. Gentleman must have missed it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg the Committee's pardon, but I must have missed that part of the Minister's speech; I did not hear her explain why we should remove the obligation to improve. She certainly did not explain why the Secretary of State should have all the discretion at his disposal under subsection (4).
<P>
The best value review process has the potential to be the most exciting proposal in the Bill; it will make local authorities look at themselves as others see them. That is bound to have a positive effect. Local authorities should be under an obligation to improve. The Secretary of State should not be able to pick on some local authorities and not others.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The hon. Member for North Essex wants to include something that, as the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon says, is in the Bill elsewhere. It is not the review that brings the improvement; it is the action that follows the review. Therefore, authorities should be judged not on the review but on the outcome of the review. They should be judged on how they change and on how they ensure that they improve their practices following the review.
<P>
Some people might say that this is a matter of semantics, but the Bill must enable continuous improvement. We are simply saying that the review, of itself, should not be the measure; the measure should be whether it has produced improvements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that clarification. I should be even more grateful if she would address herself to amendment No. 129 and say why, under subsection (5), a straightforward obligation should not be placed on all local authorities to review all their functions? Why should the Secretary of State have discretion about which functions or which authorities to pick on?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Again, I addressed that matter during my speech. I said that we do not want an exhausive list; we want an indicative framwork. That is the difference between the Government and the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The problem is that the Minister has not answered the question. The way to create a framework would be to place a simple legal obligation on authorities to undertake reviews. We are not setting performance standards for services. We simply think that local authorities should undertake a process. Indeed, it would be a far gentler obligation to place on local authorities than that of competitive tendering.
<P>
The Minister has not explained why we should not include in the Bill a five-year period as a framework. If we did so, there would be an obligation not to exceed the five-year period, but that would not prevent local authorities from acting more quickly if they so desired.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> I am disappointed that the Minister has not responded to the point that I made about the danger of new administrations hand washing when they receive a poor best value report. It may be to do with the fact that she comes from an area where there is a culture of a one-party state in which administrations tend not to change hands, but in other parts of the country that danger is an important factor. The Minister will be glad to know that we do not intend to press the amendment to a Division, but I hope that she can address the point that we have raised. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 31, in page 4, line 31, after `authorities', insert `, by the voluntary sector,'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 32, in page 4, line 33, after `authorities', insert `, the voluntary sector,'.
<P>
This group of amendments will enable us to have a debate about the role of the voluntary sector. It is backed by the Local Government Association, which would expect the Government to state that the term ``other businesses'' in the Bill covers voluntary organisations. We may clarify that matter fairly early in our discussions. The Bill states that the best value review should, if the Secretary of State thinks fit, use commercial and other businesses as a comparator. That is typical of one of the underlying trends of the Government's view of local democracy and it is worrying that the voluntary sector will not be included.
<P>
The voluntary sector has a wide role to play, both in supporting local services, and in contracting out and running them. It has had to address such matters greatly over the past few years after moving over to the contract culture. In many cases, voluntary organisations have moved away from the things that their members previously did to meet the criteria laid down by the contracts on offer. That has enabled them to gain access to funds and to deliver services, perhaps in areas that are a little removed from the origins of the services in which they used to be involved.
<P>
There is certainly a role for voluntary sector organisations within any community and the number of voluntary organisations and volunteers differs greatly in different communities. We fear that, under the Bill, that role and contribution may not be fully taken into account within the best value process. Voluntary organisations in one community could be delivering outputs that the Secretary of State prescribes should be delivered through local government. In that sense, the voluntary sector has a role to play in reducing costs in local government, although that is not its purpose in life; nor should it be.
<P>
We want a statement from the Minister about how the Government regard the voluntary sector's role and whether organisations that can be consulted and involved in producing best value within a community should be a key component.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the matter is particularly important because many local authorities fund voluntary organisations? Therefore, it is inevitable that in their best value analyses the Government must examine whether that funding should continue. Voluntary organisations should be involved in the review much more in their own right, as the hon. Gentleman argued.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> The right hon. Gentleman makes a pertinent point, which is not surprising given that he is a former local government Minister. The voluntary sector should be part of the whole best value process and local authorities will have to be judged on their grant-making decisions in relation to voluntary groups and how those groups can contribute within the community to achieving best value objectives. I hope that the Minister will give me an interesting response.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Caroline Spelman </B>(Meriden): rose&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Lady has sought to catch my eye. I must make it plain that, ordinarily, debate ends when the Chairman calls the hon. Member moving the motion to wind up debate. The hon. Lady has not spoken today, so I will call her. However, as a general rule, it would be helpful for Ministers and for the Chairman if Committee members gave an early indication of their wish to speak.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I apologise for the inexperience that led me to catch your eye at the wrong moment, Mr. Gale.
<P>
One of the jobs of an Opposition party is, perhaps, to listen to other Opposition parties, before coming to its own view. Having listened to the hon. Member for Torbay, I would like to give support to his amendment. He demonstrated how variable is the role of the voluntary sector in aiding the delivery of services. However, there is a danger that the imposition of standards will mean that voluntary sectors providing an excellent, good value service&#151;in the old-fashioned sense of good value for public money&#151;will lose their valuable role. On the other hand, services undertaken by the voluntary sector in some areas are sometimes equivalent to those provided by local authorities in other areas. It is right that such services should be reviewed when they are found to be unsatisfactory to service users in a correctly conducted performance assessment.
<P>
Charities such as Help the Aged provide daily help for carers, and support social services by visiting the elderly at home. The users of that service would certainly have a view about voluntary sector service and whether such service could easily be provided by alternative methods.
<P>
Therefore, I support amendment No. 31 and urge the Under-Secretary to examine the twin dangers that arise from the inextricably linked roles of the voluntary sector and local government in the provision of services to vulnerable groups in society.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I apologise to the hon. Lady and the Committee. Chairmen never make mistakes, but occasionally they omit things. I should have proposed the amendment from the Chair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Amendment Nos. 31 and 32 are an extremely good pair of amendments, and have provoked a useful discussion.
<P>
The Bill is not specific about the inclusion of the voluntary sector in the best value review process. Voluntary organisations play a large role in the provision of many vital services. Moreover, we know from constituency experience how vulnerable is the funding of voluntary organisations in the provisions of services. Whenever the budget comes under pressure, such services are always the first to be cut. An example in my constituency is Colchester Crossroads, which provides vital caring services for large numbers of housebound elderly and disabled people, expecially in rural areas.
<P>
When social services expenditure comes under pressure, such services are cut because the local authority does not have to sack anybody to reduce the budget, and seeks to protect the less efficient in-house services, which are more expensive to provide.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
That even happens as a matter of policy. The Royal National Institute for Deaf People has an extremely good facility in the centre of Colchester which my constituency surrounds. It was substantially funded by the social services to provide education facilities for deaf people and for families of deaf people to enable them to communicate with each other, which is a vital service. The local authority decided to take that educative role in house which necessarily means that it can deliver less because it does not have the good will of volunteers and people prepared to do things for nothing in their spare time.
<P>
This is a specific area of discussion which requires amplification by the Minister, whether or not the amendments are accepted. This is an important topic to have raised. If comparison with the voluntary sector is not specified, the fear is that the local authorities will let the voluntary sector go by the board when the pressure is on. That would not be in the interests of the public whom the services seek to serve.

<P>

<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> Perhaps I can share with the Committee a classic example of a voluntary organisation, namely a life education centre. Best value may well stipulate reducing drug use as a target, but a voluntary organisation will deliver the service and educate young people about drugs, thereby reducing drug use. It should therefore be involved in the plans in local areas for producing best value as it is involved with the outputs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Gentleman gives an extremely good example. I do not need to add to it. I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I want to speak in support of the amendment as I was involved in the voluntary sector in Shropshire. Following a programme of closing cottage hospitals local volunteers piled in and set up voluntary trusts. On the basis of those trusts, some of the institutions have started again in a slightly different form working very closely with the local authority and with the health service delivering care at a local level. That takes us back to one of my earlier points: the danger of this is that it is very prescriptive. In certain parts of the country the voluntary sector is fundamental: it collaborates with the local authorities and delivers services which otherwise would have disappeared.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions </B>(Mr. Alan Meale): This is quite remarkable. It is the first time speakers have been unanimous. We also understand the force and sense behind the amendment. However, as the hon. Member for Torbay pointed out, under the section headed ``other businesses'' the Bill already provides enough qualification for me to safely say that the voluntary sector will be covered. We would also be willing to consider elaborating on the guidance in the Bill, or to be more specific, on the order that sets out the elements of the review. That should more than satisfy the hon. Gentleman and I hope he will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> I thank the Minister for that welcome concession. We look forward to that happening. We may well return to this on the Floor of the House. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 130, in page 5, line 8, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and publish a timetable for its completion'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a relatively simple and brief amendment. We are seeking to ensure that, throughout the Bill, the best value process is as open and accountable as possible. According to subsection (6), the guidance may state that an authority should specify performance indicators and set targets and a plan of action. The purpose of our amendment is to give the plan of action a timetable and provide for it to be published. We still have the vaguely idealistic notion that local authorities should be accountable to voters rather than to the Secretary of State. Therefore, if voters are to have some idea of what is happening, a timetable should be provided and publicised so that ultimately they can hold local authorities to account if they fail to achieve a best value plan. Is there a reason for a plan not being publicised and not having a timetable?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> We understand hon. Members' desire to ensure that best value authorities set out clearly their plans for improving performance, and that they include a timetable. We share their views. Nevertheless, amendment No. 130 is unnecessary. It is difficult to imagine a plan that failed to include consideration of what is to be achieved, and when. Our guidance powers on the range of factors to be taken into account in setting targets under reviews set out in clause 5(7) will allow us to address this point. With this sort of issue, guidance allowing for flexibility is, we believe, infinitely preferable to prescription in the Bill.
<P>
In any case, hon. Members may have forgotten that key information arising from performance reviews will be reflected in the publication of local performance plans, on an annual cycle. Those plans will, among other things, require best value authorities to summarise both their assessment of progress in other things, require best value authorities to summarise both their assessment of progress in meeting performance targets and any plans that they have for action in the financial year for the target in question. This dual requirement will allow auditors and inspectors to assess both the timeliness and effectiveness with which authorities go about meeting performance targets. They will, of course, have an over-arching requirement, over any five-year period, to bring the level of performance up to that which the top 25 per cent. of authorities were achieving at the beginning of the period in question. We are grateful to Opposition Members for this constructive suggestion, but we believe that the same practical effect will be achieved by a combination of other means. I therefore urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful for the Under-Secretary's considered reply and for his acknowledgment of the constructive nature of the amendment. We shall return later in the Bill to the matter of openness and accountability in the best value process. We believe that that is an important part of the best value process. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 52, in page 5, leave out lines 12 to 18.&#151;[Ms Armstrong.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 87, in page 5, line 18, at end add&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(9) The Secretary of State must have regard in exercising his functions under this section, to the outcomes of consultation carried out by authorities under section 3(2).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have always thought it peculiar that, because Committee sittings have a timetable and must end at one o'clock, hon. Members must finish speaking halfway through a speech. I assure the Committee that there will be no chance of that now because I shall be extremely brief.
<P>
The amendment is another chance to try to connect the duty to consult with the setting of best value reviews. We believe that there could well be variations between what local consultees say and what is prescribed nationally. The amendment would write into the Bill the Secretary of State's duty to consult. It would show that local opinion is inextricably linked with the outputs of local government, regardless of what a Government say at any one time. There are diverse areas, different demographies and characteristics&#151;and different contributions to be made to best value. The amendment's purpose is to ensure that the widest number of opinions is considered during the process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The wording of the amendment is becoming something of a Liberal Democrat refrain. In many respects, that is laudable, as it reminds us that consultation is found in a rather peculiar place. It is mentioned in clause 3, which is about duties, when it would be more usefully mentioned in the review process. That, surely, is when local authorities should ask those involved in the provision of services&#151;and, indeed, the voters and those who depend on the services&#151;how well they are doing. They should be able to ask, ``We are reviewing our services; what do you think of them?''
<P>
I have much sympathy with the amendment. The Bill should include a provision to consult on the best value plan, if not, as we have suggested, an obligation on the Secretary of State to consult on how he has exercised his powers. If we are not to have consultation on the best value review, what is the consultation mentioned earlier in the Bill? It is all very well to consult in abstract about general duties, but it is the point at which matters are failing&#151;at the coal face, as it were&#151;when people are most likely to be motivated to take part in consultation, to turn up at public meetings or to take part in surveys.
<P>
Ministers have yet to justify confining consultation to clause 3, when it should be spread further through the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> Amendment No. 87 would add a requirement for the Secretary of State, in exercising his powers in relation to best value reviews, to have regard to the outcomes of consultation carried out by best value authorities under the general duty of best value.
<P>
The best value framework attempts to balance national and local needs. It sets out a requirement that best value authorities should provide continuous improvement in the quality and cost of services and the means by which progress can be assessed and measured. Central Government represent the broader national interest, and, as has been pointed out, we are also directly accountable to local people.
<P>
Local consultation will be concerned primarily with local matters, and there will be many variations. Policy set by central Government cannot seriously be expected to cover all those variations. For example, we could not consider issuing separate guidance to individual authorities that reflected local circumstances.
<P>
Our aim is to set out a framework of broad principles and duties that allows for local variations. Local matters are best considered locally by individual best value authorities, which is what our framework does. Best value authorities can react to the views that they hear during consultation, and take direct and meaningful account of them in their local performance plans. My hon. Friend the Minister gave the example of foster care in Newham. Investigations and consultations were carried out there and certainly action is being taken locally. At page 6, the explanatory note gives some guidance as to what an education authority might do in respect of excluded children, or its education formula for meeting the national needs of such children. I therefore invite the hon. Member for Torbay to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> I shall withdraw the amendment, but I am not entirely satisfied with the Minister's response. We shall have to return to the subject, because the national plans are prescriptive and seem to seek a uniformity that should not be there. The input of local people in diverse communities should be respected. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
