<H3><center><A href="/pa/cm199899/cmbills/044/1999044.htm">Welfare Reform and
Pensions Bill</a></center></H3>
<H4><center>Clause 6</center></H4>
<H4><center>Reduced rates of contributions etc: power to specify different percentages</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed [this day], That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It may be convenient for the Committee to know that, subject to progress, I propose to suspend the Committee for dinner for one and a half hours at 7 o'clock.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies </B>(Grantham and Stamford): I hope that you had a good lunch, Mr. Malins.
<P>
Over the lunch hour, I met representatives of the National Council of Women of Great Britain, who were complaining vituperatively and vociferously that the Government had defaulted on their consultation promise. The council had been hoping to be consulted on the Bill, but was denied that opportunity. That is one more organisation with which the Minister will have to make his peace in due course.
<P>
Earlier, I said that there were at least three aspects of the clause that we should consider carefully before deciding whether it merits inclusion in the Bill. The first was the considerable complexity that appears to be involved for employers who, in some circumstances, will have to calculate four different types of class 1 contributions. I hope that the Minister will respond to that point when he seeks to catch your eye later in the debate, Mr. Malins, as I am sure he will.
<P>
The second aspect was that the Government's record on rebates is utterly deplorable. We cannot have a repetition of the experience of the past two years when national insurance rebates have been used blatantly for political and Treasury purposes. There were differential changes in the SERPS rebates for contracted-out salary-related schemes, for approved money purchase schemes and for personal pensions. Logically, all those schemes should have received the same degree of compensation for the impact of the Government's pension tax. Will the Minister assure us that that will not be repeated and that the clause will not provide the basis, as it appears to do, for an entirely arbitrary set of decisions about what the level of rebates should be?
<P>
Clause 6(1) says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``An order . . . may specify different percentages in respect of earners.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That statement must be treated warily in the light of experience, as what happened before was wrong. Those who are unlucky enough to have their pension invested in an approved money purchase scheme, as opposed to a salary-related scheme or personal pension, will pay twice. First, there is the impact of the pension tax, which is the part of their contributions that is over and above any SERPS rebate and is not protected by the change in those arrangements. They have suffered from that because of the reduction in the return on the investments in their scheme and therefore the reduction in what they can expect to receive as a pension income when they retire. Secondly, SERPS rebates have been cut to compensate the Government for the need to increase personal pension rebates to stop people contracting back into the SERPS system.
<P>
The Government have cynically treated members of approved money purchase schemes as a kind of milch cow. As I was explaining before lunch, they have compounded that cynicism by giving an entirely bogus explanation for the different rebates. If the original allowance for administration costs was too high for those schemes, that matter should have been considered independently. Presumably, it would have formed the subject of a separate report by the Government Actuary's Department. We must not have a repetition of that.
<P>
The third unsatisfactory aspect of the clause is that it refers to rebates, but does not say what they will be. A major part of the Opposition's critique is that the stakeholder pension scheme is a thoroughly bogus proposal. It purports to be something that it is not. We discovered that it is certainly not good news for most of the pensioners who are not members of a salary-related occupational pension scheme, and that the Government think that the scheme will be appropriate only for people who earn between &#163;9,000 and &#163;18,500 a year. One cannot tell whether the scheme will be appropriate for those at the top and bottom margins unless one knows what the level of rebates will be. That is the essence of the calculation that people will have to make.
<P>
Such concerns arise over and again. We had a long argument in a previous sitting about the need for advice. It is absurd that someone who earns &#163;9,000 a year will need actuarial advice to decide whether he should contract out of SERPS, or the Government's new second state pension, and go into a stakeholder scheme. An important element of that calculation is the rebate that he would receive if he contracted out. There will be a dividing line beyond which it is sensible to contract out from SERPS, or the second state pension when that comes on stream. One of the most important variables in the calculation of that dividing line will be the rebate that people earning more than &#163;9,000 a year will receive.
<P>
We do not know what the rebate will be; it is referred to in the Green Paper. The clause will provide for the Government to do what they like&#151;to produce differential rebates and so on. That is not good enough: we cannot proceed on that basis. We need to know what the rebates will be, or at least, the basis on which they will be calculated.
<P>
Will there be a bonus for people who earn more than &#163;9,000 and choose to contract out? Will the Government use the rebate powers that they are trying to obtain through the clause to determine that choice? That would allow them to validate, retrospectively, the otherwise completely unfounded statement that the Minister made in a previous sitting. He said that people with earnings of more than &#163;9,000 would have an interest in contracting out of the state second pension and into a stakeholder pension.
<P>
If the Government has those powers, they could produce rebates that would make that true. We need clarification. Will the Minister say that he will use his powers to fix the rebate to ensure that, for people on salaries of at least &#163;9,001, it will always be worth contracting out?
<P>
Two things would be gained if we heard that assurance from Ministers this afternoon. We would have greater clarity, which is important from a Government with arbitrary tendencies. Their enormous majority means that they can get away with things that a proper democratic and accountable Government should not be allowed to get away with. In addition, that assurance might reduce people's need for advice, which would also be important.
<P>
It is grotesque that someone on a salary of &#163;9,000 a year might be told, ``To make an intelligent assessment of where your interests lie, you should go to Watson's. Get advice from a leading actuarial firm.'' That is absurd; a poor person on such a salary cannot afford that help. Instead, he will be told, ``Too bad&#151;you'll probably make the wrong decision.'' People will no doubt say, ``At that level, the loss comes to only a few hundred pounds a year, which does not matter.'' For those on an income of &#163;9,000 a year, a few hundred pounds is a significant sum. It might be far less than the cost of advice, so there would be nothing that they could do about it under the Government's proposed regime, but that situation is thoroughly undesirable.
<P>
The Government could change things by guaranteeing always to produce a rebate that would make it worthwhile for people who earn more than &#163;9,000 to contract out of the state second pension and into a stakeholder pension. That was what the Minister bravely, but with no justification, said would be the case. That does not reduce the force of my argument when we discussed advice. Help may be available in only one of the eight cases in which people who need advice will not receive it under the Bill.
<P>
Those earning &#163;9,000 will have two difficult problems. They will have to decide, first, whether to opt out of or into an occupational pension scheme and, secondly, whether it is worth making any provision at all and whether it might be better to rely on means-tested benefits. The Government have promised, although they do not always keep their promises, that income support for pensioners, which they have repackaged under the new Labour term, ``minimum income guarantee'', will be indexed to earnings and not prices.
<P>
That brings me to the other aspect of the differential rebate. The situation is grotesque. The Green Paper provides at lease a few figures, but the Bill provides none and the Minister has not added any or filled in any gaps. It is clear that the intention is that someone who makes a full contribution over a full working life to the state second pension will receive some 40 per cent of his income between the lower earnings limit of approximately &#163;4,500 a year and &#163;9,000 a year. That is my understanding of the Government's proposals, and the Minister will correct me if I am wrong. The pensioner will be credited with that, irrespective of his earnings between the lower income limit and &#163;9,000.
<P>
In broad brush terms, 40 per cent. of &#163;4,500 is around &#163;1,800 a year. Someone who adopts the Government's strategy of a state second pension and works for the whole of his adult life and, with his employer, contributes class 1 contributions will be entitled to a state retirement pension of &#163;66 a week, plus &#163;1,800 a year, which is around &#163;35 a week, making a total of just over &#163;100 a week. That compares with a minimum income guarantee or income support, which now provides &#163;75 a week, but will rise with earnings. Early in the next century there will be a cross-over point when the minimum income will be worth more than &#163;100 a week. It will not then be worth anyone taking part in the state second pension. All the money that people pay in national insurance will be completely pointless because it will be taxed and they will have to pay for what they could receive for nothing by way of the minimum income guarantee if they were not working or contributing to the national insurance scheme.
<P>
After that cross-over period, the minimum income guarantee will be worth more than the combination of the state second pension and the state retirement pension. That will apply even if the Government do not do what we fear they will do&#151;they have not promised not to do so beyond this Parliament&#151;and means test the state retirement pension, in which case the arithmetic will be even more forceful in the direction that I am describing. After the cross-over period, someone in that position will be forced on to means-tested benefits and out of the scheme altogether. The whole structure of state second pension is bogus. It is a way of cheating working people on low incomes of up to &#163;9,000 a year.
<P>
No doubt the Minister will be upset at the way in which I am describing his proposals, but he has at least one remedy open to him. He can fill in the blanks and explain to us what the rebates will be for those who decide to contract out. We can then see how someone who earns more than &#163;9,000 a year will be placed in the new regime.
<P>
The unavoidable conclusion is that the Government's proposals are far from good news for people who earn less than &#163;9,000 a year. In fact, they are extremely bad news for such people, who are being forced to contribute through the national insurance system to a level of benefit that, after a decade or two, will be less than the value of means-tested benefits. The Government are making fools of those people for their part in the system. That is not good enough.
<P>
I suppose that we do not have the voting strength to change matters in Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Eric Pickles </B>(Brentwood and Ongar): It is very disappointing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I hear what my hon. Friend says. I am very disappointed that we have not persuaded Labour Members by the strength of our arguments, but that has nothing to do with the weakness of our arguments; it is simply because Labour Members are not interested in the subject. Throughout the proceedings, they have maintained an embarrassed silence. They do not even have any positive remarks to make, and I assume that they are inhibited, through party loyalty or fear of the Whip, from intervening to say anything negative.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): My hon. Friend makes a worthwhile point. Does he think that the reason for the embarrassed silence among Labour Members is that they are unwilling to acknowledge that the Government are going down the route of compulsion? All the complex procedures to which my hon. Friend alluded&#151;second pension, basic pension, stakeholder pension&#151;are a device used by the Government as a smokescreen to hide from British people the fact that, increasingly, they are being compelled to take out a second pension. That might or might not be a good thing&#151;in my view, it might be a very good thing&#151;but the Government should at least be honest about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am grateful for my hon. Friend's intervention. It is interesting and ironic that the Government were considering compulsory second pension provision for those earning more than &#163;9,000 a year. I have drawn attention several times to the documentary evidence&#151;forensic evidence&#151;that proves that: the reference on page 105 of the Green Paper to compulsory pensions for those earning more than &#163;9,000 a year. I see that even the, usually stony-faced, Minister for Employment, Welfare to Work and Equal Opportunities cannot suppress a smile when I say that.
<P>
The Government were contemplating that idea and then, in the general shambles with which they threw together the Green Paper in December, they changed their mind. However, they have come up with a very nasty form of compulsion for those most vulnerable members of society who earn less than &#163;9,000 a year and who are being forced to contribute, through the national insurance system, to a pension that I have just demonstrated, mathematically, is a less good deal&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is in danger of repeating himself. [Hon. Members: ``No!''] I put that very mildly, but he must bear that in mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> You were nice enough to say not that I was repeating myself, Mr. Malins, but that I was in danger of doing so. However, it is true that, the longer we study the Bill, the more we see the same shortcomings and fundamental flaws reappearing in different guises. It is important to draw attention to those same fundamental flaws from different angles as we work through the clauses. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) made a very good point.
<P>
You will be pleased to know, Mr. Malins, that I have set out the points that I wanted to raise in relation to the clause. I hope that the Minister will respond to all of them, and that, whatever the Committee's decision on the clause, we shall at least have more clarity in an area where that is desperately needed.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Stephen Timms):</B> The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) has treated us to a lengthy perambulation around a variety of subjects. Many of his remarks were inaccurate, but I shall not attempt to correct all of them because that would take us beyond the clause's scope.
<P>
Our proposals are extremely good news for everyone who earns up to &#163;18,500 a year. The hon. Gentleman's comments in that regard are mistaken.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Of course I hope that the Minister is right&#151;we all want good news for the people whom we represent. However, he should make it clear beyond peradventure that the Government's proposals are good news for those who earn between &#163;9,000 and &#163;18,500 by answering my question. He should quantify the clause and say what level of rebate he has in mind.
<P>
<B>Mr Timms:</B> I am right. I may be able to give the hon. Gentleman further information by answering the three points that he raised.
<P>
It is not the case that employers will have to operate four national insurance rebate regimes. Employers who operate an occupational pension scheme will not also be required to operate a stakeholder scheme, and employers who have to operate a stakeholder scheme will not, in many cases, operate an occupational scheme as well. In many cases, employers will not have to operate occupational and stakeholder schemes. There are certain instances, but not many, in which they may have to do so. For most employers, two out of the four options that the hon. Gentleman described collapse into one.
<P>
It may be helpful if I discuss the last of the four options. Employers will not have to tangle with the national insurance rebate regime for personal pensions. In that case, employers pay their employees' national insurance contributions in the ordinary way to the Contributions Agency, which arranges&#151;through our good friend, NIRS 2&#151;for the rebates to be paid to the personal pension provider at the end of the year. The third option, therefore, also vanishes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The Minister has made a great mistake by mentioning NIRS 2. The Select Committee on Social Security spent some time considering the shortcomings of that scheme. Is he convinced that the Government computer systems are up and running and able to cope with the extra load that will be placed on them when the Bill is enacted?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> One of the reasons for having a new national insurance system was to implement the requirements of the Pensions Act 1995. That is largely why the previous Government entered into the contract that they did.
<P>
<B>Mr Leigh:</B> That is not an answer to my question. The previous Government realised that there was a problem and entered into a contract. There is talk of the Government's consultants falling way behind in their duties, and we know that the scheme is in severe difficulties. Will the Government computer systems be able to cope with the extra burden that will be placed on them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman well knows that there have been serious delays in the system's implementation. However, the aid-related rebates for personal pension providers are being paid, although somewhat later than would normally be the case. Interest at the rate of 0.5 per cent. a month is therefore being added to the outstanding sums. Payments are being made, and I am confident that the process will soon be concluded. The hon. Gentleman need not feel concerned on that score.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I was interested by the question of my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough, but I am more interested by the fact that the Minister has not answered that question, which was very simple. Will the computer system be able to cope with the proposed changes? Yes or no?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> It is coping and payments are being made. There is not a problem. The Opposition are unnecessarily exercising themselves on this point.
<P>
Our intention is that the rebate regime for stakeholder pensions will be the same as for personal pensions, although it will not be finalised until the consultation period if over. Employers will pay their employees' national insurance contributions in the ordinary way and at the end of the year the Contributions Agency will hand over the appropriate sum to the stakeholder pension providers. Therefore, the fourth option also vanishes. I hope that I have made it clear that the complexity that the hon. Gentleman fears will not arise in practice.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's second point related to the abolition of the advance corporation tax credit for pension funds. Rebates were adjusted after that measure was introduced and, at the same time, the opportunity was taken to adjust the rebates for contracted-out money purchase schemes. That followed warnings given by the present Government and the previous Government. Lord MacKay of Ardbrecknish frequently drew attention in another place to the potential abuse in the national insurance fund if people used the rebate system inappropriately. We took the opportunity to adjust the rebates for contracted-out money purchase schemes when the changes were made following the abolition of the ACT tax credit. There was no great surprise about that, as it had been well heralded by previous Ministers as well as by Ministers in this Government.
<P>
Thirdly, the hon. Gentleman wanted more detail about the level of rebate. In introducing the debate, I said that the rebates would be set by April 2000. That will give people ample time to decide whether they wish to join stakeholder schemes, which will become available in April 2001. The hon. Gentleman then went into a lengthy discourse on the state second pension, which is not mentioned in the clause. The state second pension is being set up so that those with a lifetime of work and contributions behind them will, when they retire, have a pension from it above the level of the minimum income guarantee. That remains the case, although we envisage the minimum income guarantee being uprated in line with earnings. That will be built into the construction of the state second pension, which will be the subject of a forthcoming Bill&#151;not the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> This is a matter of elementary logic. Does the Minister agree that, on the assumption that earnings rise faster than prices&#151;I am sure he agrees that that is a pretty robust assumption in view of historical experience&#151;and if the state retirement pension and the new state second pension are linked to prices and not earnings, but the minimum income guarantee is linked to earnings, logically it is inevitable that the mimimum income guarantee will at some point overtake the value of the state retirement pension and the state second pension that one receives? That is a mathematical certainty. The only uncertainty is the timescale within which it will happen.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The starting point for each person's state second pension will be uprated so that those who have contributed throughout their working lives will, on retirement, have a pension from the state second pension above the minimum income guarantee.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is right that, subsequently, the state second pension plus basic state pension will be uprated in line with prices. The minimum income guarantee may then catch up, depending on where people start and so on. However, the starting point for the state second pension will be uprated in such a way that people will have retirement income above the level of the minimum income guarantee.
<P>
<B>Mr Davies:</B> I entirely appreciate that point. Nevertheless, people in retirement who think that they have provided, through the national insurance system, for a state retirement pension and a state second pension will be cruelly forced, later in life, on to the means-tested system. That is my complaint. The Minister has accepted that that is the fundamental mechanism of the system that he has designed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman is wrong. There is nothing inevitable about that. If people's retirement income falls below the minimum income guarantee, the Government are committed to protecting their interests by making that guarantee available to them. A couple who have both worked and contributed throughout their lives and who both retire on state second pensions will have a joint income that is much higher than the minimum income guarantee and, in all likelihood, their income will never fall below that level.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I will, but then I must press on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The Minister is generous in giving way, as it will allow some light to be shed on this matter. The Minister has said many times that he will ensure that those who take out a second pension will be better off than they would with the minimum income guarantee. I accept that. He is less forthcoming, however, on how much better off. Will it be a significant amount, or such a small amount that little difference will be made to people's quality of life?
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> That depends on the number of years of contributions. If people contribute for their whole working lives, their income will be significantly above the minimum income guarantee. If, for various reasons, their working lives have been curtailed, and they were neither carers nor out of work because of disability, their income might be close&#151;or even below&#151;the minimum income level.
<P>
In this financial year, the lower earnings limit is not &#163;4,500 a year but &#163;3,328. The calculation of the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford was therefore inaccurate for an additional reason.
<P>
I should make it clear that the power under the clause is limited. It enables rebates to be set for people joining stakeholder schemes and for those rebates to be adjusted as appropriate within the current rebate framework. Further legislation on the state second pension will be introduced, and it will need to address the rebate arrangements associated with the state second pension. The clause before us deals with rebates under the current stage earnings-related pension scheme and not those under the state second pension.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford has caught my eye. If he wishes to speak again, I hope that his remarks will be brief and not repetitious.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I will not be repetitious, as I will restrict myself to the new points made by the Minister. He is in such a jam that he is being drawn&#151;uncharacteristically&#151;into making cheap points. He criticised me for getting the lower earnings limit wrong, but I was merely taking the Government's promises at face value. When the new regime is enacted in two years' time, the lower earnings limit will&#151;according to the Chancellor's promise in last year's Budget&#151;be raised to the level of the income tax threshold, which is currently &#163;83 a week. If a few pounds are added to that figure, my figure of &#163;4,500 a year is reached. The Minister knows that that was my calculation.
<P>
I asked whether it was a mathematical certainty that people who rely simply on the national insurance system&#151;the state retirement pension and state second pension&#151;will find, unless they die prematurely, that their income is overtaken by the means-tested minimum income guarantee and that they are forced into the means-tested system later in their lives. Clearly, that will be the case&#151;that was emphasised when the Minister responded to the point by citing special cases. Of course it is true that that will no longer apply to someone whose spouse has money, or to someone who wins the pools or the national lottery. However, in the light of the premises to my argument, the conclusion is inescapable: the Government have designed a pensions system for people on lower earnings that is fundamentally fraudulent, and reflects the Government's decision to treat the national insurance system with derision.
<P>
As far as those on lower pay are concerned, the provision is simply a tax. They are being made to pay throughout their lives for a sum of money that, on retirement, will be less than the means-tested benefits on which they will inevitably be forced. The Government are creating a means-tested society and, as I have said in many other contexts, running down the national insurance system.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 6 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 7</center></H4>
<H4><center>Interpretation and application of Part I</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The clause defines a number of terms used in part I of the Bill, gives the full titles of certain Acts to which the Bill refers, defines types of pension schemes and clarifies the application of part I to the Crown. The Crown provisions make it clear that part I will apply to pension schemes run by or on behalf of the Crown, to employees of the Crown and to the Crown as an employer. By convention, the clause will also protect the Crown from prosecution and will not apply the provisons to Her Majesty in her private capacity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Given that the clause is essentially a defining clause, I do not want to delay the Committee for too long. We do not object to its reference to the Crown, but at a later point we shall draw the Committee's attention to a clear inequity in the treatment of unfunded public sector pension schemes compared with other schemes, for the purposes of pension sharing.
<P>
The Minister clearly enjoys definitional, semantic points. This morning, we discussed briefly the distinction between ``provisions'' and ``requirements''. In the light of that discussion, I was intrigued to discover that the clause states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>```occupational pension scheme' and `personal pension scheme' have the meanings given by section 1 of the 1993 Act'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
but elsewhere states that a
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>```stakeholder pension scheme' shall be construed in accordance with section 1.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My point is not entirely pedantic. I pay tribute to members of the legal profession, one of whom is sitting behind me, so I must choose my words carefully. Many of them make a good living by playing on, and drawing the courts' attention to, the different meanings of words. We are all familiar with arguments such as that of the lawyer who says, ``Well, my Lord, if Parliament had meant to use the word, `the', it would have done so. In fact, it uses the word, `a' in this clause and the word, `the' in another clause. Therefore, the meaning of the first clause must differ from the second clause, and my client should win his case.''
<P>
The Minister said this morning that he is in the business of using one word to convey a single meaning, rather than using two words with the same meaning. Therefore, why does the clause contain the similar phrases, ``have the meanings given'' and ``be construed''? Is the use of those two phrases intended to draw a distinction? It not, the Minister should implement the principle that he set out this morning, with which I thoroughly agree, that, where the meaning is the same, the same words should be used.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I shall not detain the Committee for too long, but a number of questions came to mind in the light of my membership of the civil service. I benefited for seven years from its pension scheme, although my pension has now been transferred to the House of Commons scheme. As a member of the civil service, I was aware of the existence of different classes of civil servant. Will the Minister confirm whether every Crown employee will be covered by the civil service occupational pension scheme? If there are exceptions, such as part-timers or people in a nook and cranny somewhere&#151;the reach of the civil service is amazing&#151;who are not contributing to the pension scheme, will the Crown provide them with a stakeholder pension? It is a different concept for the crown to offer stakeholder pensions than it is for an employer in the private sector or the public sector who uses the private sector to manage his fund. I am sure that civil servants will be interested to know how that will be organised.
<P>
The Government say that they are committed&#151;although there is little evidence of it&#151;to the Domesday book sales of parts of the public sector. The Opposition do not object to that. We realise that the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 will apply to the sale, but will someone who transfers out of the civil service into a next-steps agency or the private sector have access to a stakeholder pension, should that prove to be a better option than the civil service scheme?
<P>
I was going to ask about unfunded pensions but, as we will debate that later, I shall conclude by asking the Minster to assure me that the civil service, in all its manifest variety, will be properly covered and have access to stakeholder pensions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford asked about the difference between the definitions in subsection (1), in particular, what was meant by the phrase.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``shall be construed in accordance with section 1.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The difference is that earlier legislation contains formal definitions of the terms, ``occupational pension scheme'' and ``personal pension scheme.'' This Bill does not have a formal definition of a stakeholder pension. That is the reason for the slight difference in wording. The hon. Gentleman can rest assured that there is no hidden meaning or sleight of hand.
<P>
As for the points raised by the hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait), subsection (3) makes it clear that there is no exemption for the Crown as an employer. People are employed by the civil service who are not in the civil service occupational pension scheme, but Departments will be required to comply with the rules on stakeholder pensions, including those on access.

<P>

<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> How many Crown employees are not covered by an occupational pension scheme? My impression is that the majority are covered. They will need to have access to a stakeholder scheme and the agencies employing them will need to set up a stakeholder facility. I assume that the Department of Social Security has an estimate of how many Crown employees will be affected.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman's intervention is too long. Interventions are meant to be brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I do not have the figures, but I shall dig them out and write to the hon. Gentleman. Casual workers who are employed in the civil service but who do not have access to the civil service occupational pension scheme will be covered by the rules governing access to a stakeholder pension.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am spoilt for choice, but it is time that the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) had a chance to speak.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I cannot tell the Minister how touching that is.
<P>
With regard to the civil service offering a stakeholder pension scheme, the Minister made it clear that the provision of a stakeholder pension scheme will not place a burden on small employers because they will direct their employees towards suitable schemes. Will people from the private sector be able to enter the civil service stakeholder pension scheme?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The civil service and each Government Department and agency will have to offer access to one of the stakeholder pension schemes listed in the OPRA register. That agency or Department will be in exactly the same position as any other employer. I do not expect that stakeholder schemes will be needed specifically for the civil service. An agency might choose to use a private sector scheme&#151;it can choose any scheme that it wishes from the register.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I thank the Minister for his kind offer to write to me about the number of civil servants&#151;or Crown employees, to use the strictly correct term&#151;wo are not covered by current occupational pension schemes, and in respect of whom the Crown employers will have to set up a stakeholder facility. That will save me from having to table a parliamentary question. It is important for that information to be in the public domain&#151;it will help the industry and others. He might want to put a copy of the letter that he will send me in the Library, or I could publicise it. One way or another, the information should be publicly available.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I had not realised what was involved when I asked my question&#151;it has opened up a subject that we were not expecting to discuss. Does the Minister expect the Crown to set up a stakeholder pension, in its infinite variety? Will the civil service offer 100 different stakeholder pension schemes? Will they be provided by an insurance company or by a company that is listed on the London international financial futures exchange? How will a civil servant have access to trustees? We are returning to questions that we previously explored, but we have not considered the matter from the point of view of civil servants. Will they be offered one pension scheme? Will the process be fragmented and what will the consequences be? Presumably, many people will be needed to administer the pension scheme, which means that taxes will rise&#151;again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Opposition Members may be creating some misapprehensions on this matter. As I said earlier, I do not expect separate machinery for civil service stakeholder pensions to be established. The requirement on each agency or Department will be to give its employees who cannot gain access to an occupational scheme access to a stakeholder scheme that is on the register. That scheme need not have special characteristics&#151;any scheme on the register will do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> rose&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Is the hon. Gentleman intervening?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am happy to make a short speech. The Minister said that agencies and Departments can pick any stakeholder scheme that is on the register. Will not that place an enormous responsibility on the Crown? Those who provide the schemes will say, ``The Crown designated a particular stakeholder scheme,'' which will put that scheme in a much stronger position in the marketplace compared with schemes that have not been designated by the Crown. How will the Government use their considerable powers to designate stakeholder schemes?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> That is not a matter for me to determine.

<P>
The clause will add new section 111A to the Pension Schemes Act 1993. Among other things, it will require employers to ensure that contributions to a personal pension scheme are paid within specified time limits. If they are not, the trustees or managers of a scheme must report late payments to OPRA and scheme members, also within specified time limits. It is an important measure that is designed to ensure that employees get the maximum benefit from the personal pension contributions made from their salaries.
<P>
Amendment No. 43 adds new section 111B to support that measure. The proposal enables OPRA to require those involved in the administration of personal pension schemes, including employers, to co-operate with its investigations or inquiries for the purpose of checking compliance with section 111A. These powers are an essential part of the regulatory process and closely mirror those that OPRA already has in respect of occupational pensions
<P>
The provision will allow OPRA to require documents to be produced which contain information relevant to an inquiry. It also provides for OPRA's inspectors to enter prescribed premises to examine, or require the production of, documents and to ask questions. OPRA will also be able to apply to a justice of the peace for a warrant to search premises. Failure to provide the relevant documents or obstruction of an inspector will be an offence.
<P>
The topics raised in the amendment will come before us again under clause 9.

<P>

<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> It always becomes complicated when we have, as here, an amendment that amends a clause, which itself attempts to insert a passage into another Act. It is difficult to follow what is going on. Moreover, as it is an amendment tabled by the Government, we do not have any explanatory notes on it. That is not a complaint; it is inevitable following the Government's second thoughts on this matter, which is presumably why the amendment was not included in the original clause.
<P>
I want to ask the Minister one or two questions, so that we fully understand what is going on. I shall be strict, Mr. Malins, as I know that, if I am not careful, you will say that we cannot have a clause stand part debate, which I am keen to have on this clause. Therefore, I shall focus on the amendment.
<P>
The amendment is yet another raft of intimidating and horrific provisions providing for inspections and all kinds of intervention by OPRA, with little limit. We went over some of it this morning. As it is an amendment to a provision in a 1993 Act covering personal pensions, will it provide powers and sanctions in respect not merely of personal pensions but of the stakeholder pension, which we are now debating, and the lifelong individual savings account, if that becomes available? Or, instead of the anomaly that has existed until now, with one set of provisions for occupational pension schemes, which OPRA has been responsible for regulating since it was set up, and another set for personal and other pensions, will the barrier now be put between occupational and personal pensions on one side and stakeholder pensions, LISAs and other forms of pension on the other, which would be curious? Does the amendment apply simply to personal pensions or also to LISAs and stakeholder pensions? Presumably, the stakeholder pension is most germane to our debate this afternoon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> As the Minister said, the clause amends section 111A of the Pension Schemes Act 1993. My question relates to subsections (8) and (10) to (12) of that section and to subsection (9). The explanatory notes state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Subsections (8) and (10) to (12) relate to provision for civil or criminal sanctions against employers''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
it would be useful if the Minister gave some reassurance on burdens on employers&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``for late payment or non-payment of amounts payable to personal pension schemes. OPRA will have power to impose a civil penalty where there has been a breach of the requirement to make timely payment of contributions''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I understand that if an employer acts fraudulently, he will be liable to criminal prosecution. Indeed, the Act makes that clear, but what civil penalties does the Minister have in mind? One can imagine a situation in which there was no fraudulent intent or incompetence but, for one reason or another, an employer has failed to comply with the requiremens of the Act. It would be interesting to know what sort of civil penalties would apply in such a case. The explanatory note states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Subsection (9) provides that OPRA may impose civil penalties on trustees and managers if they fail to carry out their monitoring role.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
How burdensome will the monitoring role of trustees be?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I should like to follow on from the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough because similar thoughts crossed my mind. Will the Minister tell the Committee how many late payments of personal pensions have caused concern, or whether the provision is to neaten OPRA's responsibilities without there being any proven need for it to have such powers? Are people who already have personal pensions relaxed about the current system, and do they feel that they need such a heavy-handed approach in their relationships with employers? Personal pensions are part of a much more personal relationship because they take the form of an agreement between an employee and an employer. Do personal pensions, in their current form, have sufficient legal weight and authority for OPRA not to need to be involved? In addition to answering my question about the need for these powers, other than neatness and tidiness, will the Minister say what is the thinking behind making that a civil or criminal offence, which cannot be dealt with as part of the agreement between employee and employer?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The points made by the hon. Lady and the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford relate to the clause, not to the amendment. I shall first respond to the point raised by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford about the amendment and then return to the other points when we come to the clause stand part debate.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked whether the provisions would apply to stakeholder pensions, which, in many cases, and in legal terms, will be personal pensions. The answer is yes they will. No distinction will be made.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also asked a question about LISAs. May I remind him that the new portable pensions investment vehicle, which he referred to as a LISA, is not a pension but a vehicle. It will be used by stakeholder pensions, personal pensions and, no doubt, on occasions, by occupational pensions as well.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> We cannot let the Minister get away with that. It is no use saying that the LISA is a vehicle in which any pension can invest. Any pension can invest at the moment in a unit trust, investment trust or open-ended investment company. As I said to the Minister the other day, most personal pensions are already invested in unit trusts. If the LISA were just a vehicle&#151;a financial asset into which pension funds can invest&#151;the whole of the Treasury's exercise would be entirely hollow because it would have achieved nothing at all by saying that pensions can invest in vehicles into which they can already invest.
<P>
We understand the Minister's embarrassment and discomfort that his rivals at the Treasury have produced a proposal that many of us believe has more merit that his own&#151;or, at least, more merit that the one his predecessor produced. However, despite his embarrassment, if the LISA means anything at all, it must be a separate pension option. It is important that it is subject to an acceptable amount of regulation, as with other pension schemes and options.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I simply make the point that paragraph 8 of the excellent Treasury-DSS document to which the hon. Gentleman referred&#151;I know that he does not always read such documents before commenting on them, but I commend this one to him&#151;states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it is a way in which a stakeholder or any other kind of pension scheme may invest savings in order to build up a fund to deliver a pension when someone retires.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The clause introduces a set of rules for monitoring the timely payment of contributions by employers to personal pension schemes. The measure will apply when an employer makes deductions from an employee's salary to pass to the employee's personal pension scheme. It will also apply when employers make payments on their own account to an employee's personal pension scheme.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beckenham asked about the scale of the problem. Figures are not available to show the number of late payments to personal pension schemes, but OPRA's experience suggests that there is a problem. There is certainly a problem with late payments to occupational pension schemes, which OPRA is dealing with&#151;OPRA receives more reports about late payments than anything else. There were more than 11,000 between April 1997 and January 1999, 7,000 of which arose between April 1998 and January 1999. Those are large numbers and there is every reason to believe that payments by employers to personal pension schemes are as liable to delay as are payments to occupational pension schemes. The problem is substantial.
<P>
Hon. Members will agree that the direct payment facility offered by employers is useful. It ensures that regular payments are made to personal pension schemes, thus helping them to build up their pension funds, but we must ensure that payments are made and that they are made on time. That is important because members have a right to expect that payments deducted from salary are handed over promptly to their personal pension scheme. Delays in making payments will have a cumulative effect on loss of investment return.
<P>
Rules exist governing the timeliness of payments by employers to occupational pension schemes. They were introduced in the Pensions 1995, which enables OPRA to impose penalties for non-compliance. However, there are no equivalent rules for personal pensions.
<P>
The hon. Member for Gainsborough asked about the penalties evisaged. Under section 10 of the 1995 Act, OPRA can impose civil penalties directly without the need for a court hearing. The maximum penalty for an individual is &#163;5,000 and in any other case, such a personal pension provider is &#163;50,000. Civil sanctions apply in a number of prescribed circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The Minister has repeated what I had already told him, although he added a figure, which was of some use. Can he now give the Committee some idea of the range of sanctions that have been imposed historically under the 1995 Act? If small employers do something wrong and do not carry out their obligations, what sort of financial penalty might be imposed? The Minister also referred to other penalties, but quickly skated over that and said no more. What are those other penalties?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I have no data on the scale of the penalties that have been imposed. However, civil sanctions can be applied under section 10 of the 1995 Act if an employer fails to make payment by the appropriate date, to set out the payment arrangement in writing or to send the payment arrangement to the personal pension provider. Sanctions can be applied to the personal pension provider if it fails to tell OPRA about late payments or to issue a statement to a member that sets out details of payments received.
<P>
Clause 8 provides that employers must maintain a record of direct payment arrangements, in particular to show the due date and the rate of the payments to be made. Time limits by which payments must be made will be set out in regulations and we intend to mirror the arrangements that apply to occupational schemes. Deductions from earnings must be received by the personal pension provider&#151;usually an insurance company&#151;by the 19th day of the month following the month in which the deduction is made. Where an employer makes a contribution to his own account, he will be able to fix the due date for that contribution, but the date will have to be recorded as part of the arrangements, so that employees know where they stand.
<P>
Employers will have to pass the record of payment arrangements to the personal pension provider and the provider will be required to monitor payments received against the record of the payment arrangements. If payments are late, the provider will be required to report to OPRA. Reports will also have to be sent to members, telling them what has been paid and when. Time limits for the reports will be set out in regulations, but we intend to build on existing arrangements for notifications to members who will be sent an annual statement that sets out the information. Where payment has not been made for 60 days, notification will be sent to the member. Notification should already have been sent to OPRA, which should be taking action.
<P>
The clause will give OPRA new powers. The key points are that if an employer pays late or, what is worse, does not pay at all, he will be subject to a civil sanction under section 10 of the Pensions Act 1995. If, however, late payment involves fraud or fraudulent evasion, that will be a criminal offence, for which the penalty on conviction will be a fine, prison sentence or both. The structure of the penalties are in line with the new structure of penalties for occupational schemes that is contained in the next clause.
<P>
The clause will provide greater security for people with personal pensions. I am sure that Committee members will agree that its requirements are necessary because deductions are being made from people's salaries. It is commensurate with the protection that applies to people in occupational schemes.

<P>

<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> It is fatuous for the Government to continue to argue that a LISA is simply a vehicle into which pension funds can invest, if they want. If that were the case, there would be no substance to the Treasury's proposal. Perhaps the Minister intends us to believe that it has no substance because he does not like it.
<P>
I will make three points: one of form; one of form and substance; and one of substance. The clause illustrates well the Government's unduly convoluted method of legislation. We have detected the Minister's taste for complexity for its own sake, which I deprecate. Let us consider new section 111A(15) on the top of page 8. The Bill is being used to change the Pension Schemes Act 1993. As new subsection (15) makes clear, the Bill will also make retrospective amendments to the altered sections of the 1993 Act. The whole thing is completely barmy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Is it fair to say that this is a consolidation measure, in that it is not three Bills in one, but four? Is not that unprecedented?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> It is not a consolidation measure&#151;I wish that it were. Given that our legal system is based on the premise that the citizen is deemed to know the law, there is a good case for consolidating the 1993 Act, the Pensions Act 1995 and the Bill into a single Act that the public could read&#151;and understand&#151;at libraries or through the internet. In the future people who want to find out about pension law will have to get hold of a copy of the 1993 Act, only to find that, in its current form, whole sections of it are contained in the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999. Having read the relevant sections of the 1999 Act into the relevant part of the 1993 Act, they will have to refer again to the 1999 Act because it alters sections inserted in the 1993 Act. That is an extraordinary way of legislating.
<P>
Clearly, the Government have no sense of the value of simple, comprehensible legislation. If they had, they would instruct the parliamentary draftsmen not to draft such legislation. I agree with the implicit thought in the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough that we should consider consolidation of pension legislation. That would greatly assist anyone who wants even to begin to understand our extremely complex pension laws.
<P>
I said that my second point was a mixture of form and substance. I was intrigued by new subsection (15), given that the object of clause 8 is to apply to personal pensions some of the sanctions and arrangements that currently apply to occupational pensions. That is a further example of the convoluted way in which the Government are proceeding. New subsection (15)(a) will enable those arrangements to apply to stakeholder pensions, and new subsection (15)(b) will enable them to apply to an intriguing animal that is not named, but is described in vague terms. Subsection (15)(b) states that the arrangement may apply in a case where the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``requirement is for the employer to pay contributions to a person prescribed by such regulations (instead of to the trustees or managers of the scheme).''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Provision is made for the arrangements to apply to a pension vehicle that has no trustees or managers. Although trustees are legally required for occupational pensions schemes and will be legally required for stakeholder pension schemes, the pension vehicle described in subsection (15)(b) will not have trustees. Nor will it have managers, which is how pensions legislation&#151;including, I suspect, the 1995 Act or the 1993 Act&#151;normally defines those who run personal pensions schemes.
<P>
What sort of pension vehicle is described in subsection (15)(b)? Clearly, it is not an occupational pension scheme, the rules for which remain unaffected by the clause; neither is it a personal pension scheme, because such schemes are affected by the main thrust of the clause; nor is it a stakeholder scheme, because the rules and regulations for such schemes may be applied under new subsection (15)(a). I put it to you, Mr. Malins, that we have found the Government out. They do not like to talk about LISAs. They are starting to pretend, absurdly, that a LISA is a financial instrument like any other, into which a pension fund can invest. However, I believe that subsection (15)(b) provides for the same regime to be applied through these regulations to the LISA, when it comes on stream.
<P>
The Department of Social Security has been forced to make some provision to bring the LISA within the regulatory system, but it does not want to go through the humiliating exercise of mentioning it in the Bill, because it hates the LISA.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am glad to see the Minister reading the Treasury document. He will find the word ``framework'' in it. I quoted it at him the other day. The Government are trying to pretend that the LISA is not a pension framework but simply a financial instrument, but they are providing for this regime. They were hoping that we would not notice the provision&#151;that we would give up under the complexity of verbiage and the indirect way in which layer upon layer of legislation will apply to different kinds of pension scheme and that we would not notice that they have provided in the clause for the regulations to be applied to a LISA.
<P>
If the interpretation is unfair, no doubt the Minister will be able to tell me that it is. It is no use simply saying that it is untrue; he will have to tell me what sort of animal among pension vehicles subsection (15)(b) is directed at regulating, if it is not a LISA. It cannot be a stakeholder pension and it cannot be a personal pension, which is dealt with explicitly elsewhere in the clause, and it is not an occupational pension, because such schemes are not affected by the clause. Indeed, the purpose of the clause is to extend to non-occupational pension schemes a large part of the regulatory framework relating to occupational schemes. I think that we have rumbled the Government and I look forward to the Minister's response on that point with particular interest.
<P>
The purpose of this clause and clause 9, which go together&#151;I shall not trespass on the sanctions until we reach clause 9&#151;is to extend to personal and stakeholder pensions and, as we have discovered, to LISAs, a large part of the regulatory framework that applies to occupational pension schemes. Heaven only knows why the clause says that it applies only to personal pensions and that regulations will make it applicable to stakeholder pensions and LISAs. It is part of the unnecessary complexity with which the Government proceed.
<P>
The general principle of integrating the regulatory regime and applying the same regulations, sanctions and system of enforcement to all the different pension vehicles is one of which I thoroughly approve and for which I have called. It always seemed anomalous that an employer who was good enough&#151;I keep using that phrase in this context and rightly so, because it is a great advantage for his employees&#151;to set up the classic salary-related occupational pension scheme, or any occupational pension scheme&#151;money purchase schemes are not on the whole such good value as final salary schemes&#151;should face draconian sanctions and an extremely tight regulatory regime from OPRA.
<P>
When I visited OPRA, it seemed to be an organisation that, to my surprise, was lighter in its structure and more pragmatic in its touch than I had feared when I went down to Brighton. I am glad that I spent the money on the fare because it removed one anxiety about OPRA's present practice. Nevertheless&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I vividly recall the hon. Gentleman telling us earlier today about his visits to OPRA. He must not repeat himself.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> If an employer set up not an occupational pension scheme but a group personal pension or other form of pension scheme, the regulatory burden placed on him was much lighter. It always seemed to me to be an extraordinary anomaly that all hell would descend on an employer who failed to pay a sum of money to his employee's occupational pension scheme on the due date. Inspectors would visit, sanctions would be imposed and the employer might end up going to jail if he was not careful. We shall discuss those sanctions when we reach clause 9. However, if the employer failed to make a contribution to his employee's group personal pension, in relation to which OPRA has no role, the only sanction is that the insurance company or the manager of the scheme is obliged to notify the beneficiary&#151;the employee in respect of whom the contribution is being made&#151;within a six-week period that no contributions have been received. The system is as simple as that. I believe that no further sanctions apply.
<P>
The differential is unreasonable. We have discussed some of the many burdens that employers face, including the pension tax and the differential rebates&#151;there are others, which I shall not mention now because we shall discuss them presently. The Government have borne down heavily on occupational pension schemes, especially on final salary schemes, which they have tried to put out of business. The additional burdens that they will impose on employers threaten to put many such schemes out of business. Some employers may switch to a stakeholder scheme. In that context, it is particularly undesirable for a regulatory differential to exist. I applaud any efforts to remove it and I am delighted that, for once, the Government are doing what we urged them to do.
<P>
The explanatory notes are no help in this context. They appear to have been drafted by people who are in the habit of drafting children's books. They state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``This Part of the Bill provides a number of measures intended to make the pensions regulatory framework better''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What differentials will remain in the regulations that apply to occupational and other pensions, including personal pensions, stakeholder pensions and LISAs, which are mentioned in subsection (15) of proposed new section 111A? The Minister does not like to discuss LISAs and I shall not press the point&#151;I do not want to rub too much salt into his wounds&#151;but we need a clear answer to my question.
<P>
The Minister should state that, in relation to occupational pension schemes, the clause will extend all relevant regulations&#151;some may merely apply to salary-related schemes&#151;accompanying enforcement mechanisms and sanctions to other approved pension schemes. However, in view of the various exceptions, that may be an inaccurate and over-generalised statement. In that case, he should state whether material differences will remain between the regulatory framework for occupational pension schemes and for other approved pension schemes. That important issue relates to the distortions that exist in a particular marketplace as a result of differential regulation. We welcome the fact that the Government's proposals are eroding those differences. We must ensure that that task is fully accomplished or, where it has not been, establish where differences and anomalies remain.

<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman supports the provisions of the clause. I shall limit my response to his rather lengthy remarks by again commending the Treasury-DSS document on the new portable personal pensions investment vehicle. Paragraphs 12 to 14 spell out the differences between the document's proposals and the current situation and they mention several important new features.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman seemed to think that subsection (15)(b) hid a conspiracy. In fact, the provision would apply in cases where an employer pays contributions to people other than trustees or managers. A clearing house would be an example of the kind of organisation or person other than trustees or managers to whom that provision applies. I hope that that clarifies the purpose of the provision&#151;it is not as exotic as the hon. Gentleman thought.
<P>
If employers pay contributions to a clearing house, which distributes them to the appropriate stakeholder schemes, trustees will know about late payment only when moneys arrive late or not at all. The obligations will require adjustment to cater for clearing houses between the employee, the employer and the scheme, which is the purpose of the subsection. That is an example of the difference between how the arrangements will work for stakeholder and personal schemes, and how they will work for occupational schemes. Subject to differences of that kind, the arrangements under the Bill will be broadly parallel. I hope that that is the reassurance that the hon. Gentleman required.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 8, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 9</center></H4>
<H4><center>Late payments by employers to occupational pension schemes</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The clause will enable OPRA to impose a civil penalty on employers who do not pay to their pension schemes, in good time, contributions deducted from their employees' earnings. That is part of the alignment that we discussed. It is also designed to ensure that any failure on the part of the employer is reported by the trustees and managers of the pension scheme to OPRA and, in certain circumstances, to the scheme members.
<P>
Employers are already expected to pay employee contributions within 19 days of the end of the month in which money has been deducted from employees' earnings. We do not intend to change that rule, which is in line with time limits for paying tax and national insurance contributions. We intend to change the way in which the rule is enforced; I drew attention to that when I responded to remarks made by the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel). It is a good example of how we are monitoring current practice.
<P>
The only sanction available to OPRA at present is to take criminal proceedings against employers who do not comply. In many cases, criminal proceedings were cumbersome and impractical or inappropriate to the circumstances. A civil sanction is more appropriate, especially in the light of the large number of complaints that were raised under this heading. Employers should not, however, be under any illusion that we are softening our attitude. The introduction of a civil penalty will allow OPRA to take remedial action more quickly and decisively. Although the new civil penalty will apply in the vast majority of cases, the clause will allow the authorities to take criminal proceedings where they are most appropriate&#151;in cases where fraudulent intent is involved.
<P>
The clause will introduce consistency in the penalties for late or non-payment of employee contributions in occupational and personal pension schemes. That is the consistency requested by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford, and I therefore hope that he will support the clause.
<P>
Mr. Quentin Davies:
<P>
 I can reassure the Minister that Opposition Members will support the clause. However, the Minister left out one important aspect of the clause. It would have been right to refer to it, in the interests of straightforwardness and thoroughness, both of which virtues I hope that the minister respects. That is, that the difference between civil and criminal sanctions is the burden of proof. My understanding is that&#151;I accept this aspect of the Minister's remarks&#151;in certain cases, criminal sanctions are inappropriate because the offence is not the sort that the criminal law should be used to sanction. But the regulators were finding it difficult to bring a case that could be proved beyond reasonable doubt&#151;the standard of proof that applies in criminal law&#151;so there was a danger that some people who mismanaged pension schemes would get away with it and be confident that no case could be made against them.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
There are two aspects to this. Parliament should always be careful when it allows regulators to proceed on a lesser burden of proof because that principle is the essence of justice, as is the assumption of innocence on which our legal system is based. However, given what the Minister said about it being necessary to have a gradation of sanctions&#151;the principle is that if one is late, one is fined, but if one is fraudulent or dishonest, one goes to jail&#151;we are happy with that. If the force of the regulatory sanction has been enhanced, because one can impose civil sanctions on the basis of the civil burden of proof&#151;something that the Minister curiously left out of his presentation of the clause&#151;that reinforces protection for the consumer.
<P>
We are happy with the clause. We have not been slow to criticise the Government when we think that they have got it wrong, but in respect of the alignment of the regulatory regime and the sanctions that go with it, we think that they have got it right. They are moving in the right direction and we are grateful for small mercies. I am sure that my colleagues will join me in voting for the clause.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> Perhaps I should put on record, on behalf of my hon. Friends, our congratulations to the Minister of State, Department of Social Security, for his sterling work&#151;and magnificent speeches&#151;in getting us to this stage of the Bill. In addition, it would be churlish not to mention the marathon speeches of the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Has the Under-Secretary noticed the Minister's charming habit of looking around when he is about to sum up a debate, to see whether any of his colleagues wish to speak, which of course they never do? Does the Under-Secretary agree that it is about as likely for a Labour Back Bencher to speak as it is for the hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley) to pay a courtesy visit to the Vatican?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman should refer to another hon. Member in those terms.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> The Committee must be satisfied that during the previous couple of sittings, we have made substantially faster progress, while continuing properly to discuss the issues, than we did in earlier stages. If that continues, we may have wider debates than time has hitherto allowed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Levitt </B>(High Peak): I want to put on the record that my hon. Friend is right&#151;the Front Bench is mirroring the views of the Back Bench.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for that.
<P>
Clause 10(2) lists the main tax-approved pension arrangements that will be protected in the event of a person's bankruptcy. It includes a personal pension scheme that is being considered for approval. However, as a result of changes that were introduced by the Inland Revenue, it is no longer possible for a personal pension scheme that is not fully approved to be purchased from a provider. All schemes with provisional approval have been granted full approval or wound up. The entry is therefore not appropriate. I assure the Committee that no individual personal pension holder will be affected by the change.
<P>

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I did not hear you mention those amendments. Will we have an opportunity to put them to a vote?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> There will be no opportunity to put them to a vote. When we reach the clause stand part debate, the hon. Gentleman will be able to refer to various matters, including those that are covered by the amendments. He must now speak to amendment No. 38.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The problem is one of retrospectivity. It is a long-standing tradition&#151;certainly in the Conservative party and I like to think in the House as a whole&#151;that when we legislate, irrespective of context, we are careful not to make provisions retrospective. We do not want to disadvantage anyone who has taken a particular action in good faith under the prevailing law by subsequently changing that law and retrospectively covering the action. Amendment No. 38 is designed to avoid such retrospectivity, as is Amendment No. 39. Amendment No. 40 is consequential on the other two. There should be no doubt about the extent to which the clause will apply retrospectively.
<P>
Amendment No. 41 is also important. Are we dealing with that amendment in this group, Mr. Malins? I am slightly confused as a result of what has just transpired. I want to make sure that I do not miss the opportunity to present any of the amendments.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Indeed. We are dealing with amendment No. 38, with which it is convenient to deal with amendments Nos. 39 to 41.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Clearly, you chose to take those amendments together, Mr. Malins, because they all deal with retrospectivity.
<P>
We are happy that, if the Inland Revenue decides to disapprove a scheme, it should have no protection against bankruptcy after it has been disapproved. We are entirely in favour of the Government's intention to protect pension assets from trustees in bankruptcy. The clause removes an anomaly, under which in present law occupational pension assets are thus protected but not necessarily&#151;following the Landau case&#151;other pension assets, including personal pension assets or, prospectively, stakeholder or LISA pension assets. We also accept that that protection should extend only to pension schemes and assets approved as pension vehicles by the Inland Revenue.
<P>
It follows that when the Inland Revenue has withdrawn approval from a scheme, assets put into it from then on can no longer benefit from protection. It also follows that schemes that never enjoy Inland Revenue approval will never enjoy protection from bankruptcy. To avoid the great danger of retrospectivity, it is important that assets put into a scheme while it enjoys the Revenue's approval should continue to be protected: the protection cannot restrospectively be withdrawn. That would produce an unreasonable situation. A person might believe that he is making reasonable provision for his pension by paying money into an approved vehicle, when for some reason&#151;perhaps a technical reason&#151;the Inland Revenue decides that the scheme is no longer approved, so his pension its no longer protected. That would put him in an anomalous and unfair position compared with another taxpayer who went bankrupt in similar circumstances and whose scheme continued to enjoy protection.
<P>
That is the purpose of amendment No. 38. If it is accepted, there will be no retrospectively and the protections will continue to apply to pension assets placed in a scheme during the time that it was approved.
<P>
Amendment No. 41 is designed to ensure that when trustees and managers act in good faith, believing that a scheme is approved, they will not be liable retrospectively if, unknown to them, the Inland Revenue has withdrawn approval. The amendment would insert into subsection (9) the words,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``and the communication of that decision to the trustees or managers.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It would provide that when any transaction is entered into in good faith by the trustees or managers, before the making of the decision or the giving of the notice by the Inland Revenue to the scheme
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``and the communication of that decision to the trustees or managers'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the trustees or managers could not be expected to know that the scheme had had its Inland Revenue approval withdrawn. That would be another protection, this time for the trustees and managers, against retrospective operation of the clause.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We are discussing retrospectivity and I hope that the Government share our concern that legislation should not be retrospective. I also hope that they will accept the amendments or explain that they are unnecessary. If they satisfy us that the clause would not have the retrospective effect that I fear, we should be happy not to press the amendment to a vote and to allow the clause to stand unamended.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> I hope that I can give the hon. Gentleman the reassurance that he seeks. Perhaps I should say at the outset that, although he may have missed the opportunity to move a couple of amendments, the Government will consider one among this group. He will be pleased not to have lost the opportunity to discuss the matter in Committee.
<P>
The Bill will protect a person's pension rights in the event of his bankruptcy and it might be helpful to outline the proposals before replying to the hon. Gentleman's specific points. When someone becomes bankrupt, all his assets are usually taken over by the trustee in bankruptcy. However, the treatment of pension rights on bankruptcy is inconsistent. Whereas penson rights in occupational pension schemes are largely safeguarded because of special forfeiture provisions in scheme rules, rights in personal pension schemes are at greater risk of falling into the hands of the trustee in bankruptcy. That is unfair and at odds with one of the major themes in our reform of welfare: that people should be encouraged to make secure provision for retirement when they are able to do so.
<P>
Clause 10 sets out the details of the protection to be afforded to pension rights. The measures that we are introducing will create a level playing field. They will ensure the same level of protection for rights under occupational, personal and stakeholder pension arrangements and under any other retirement benefit scheme recognised by the Inland Revenue as attracting the appropriate pension tax reliefs. Under the provision, rights in an approved pension scheme will be excluded from the bankrupt's estate. However, it would be unreasonable completely to ignore the interests of creditors. Our proposals aim to strike a balance between the protection of pensions and the rights of creditors.
<P>
There are good arguments for protecting rights under tax-approved arrangements, not least because of the Government moneys provided&#151;tax relief and the national insurance rebate. The same arguments cannot be applied to rights under unapproved pension arrangements. Unapproved schemes are usually held by high earners as a top-up to approved pension arrangements. Unapproved pension arrangements are essentially little different from other forms of savings, such as PEPs, TESSAs and investments in stocks and shares. Those are all automatically accessible to the trustee in bankruptcy and in the generality of cases it cannot be right for rights under unapproved pension arrangements to be treated differently. Rights under unapproved arrangements will, therefore, generally fall outside the protection that is afforded by the new provisions. The amendments would mean that, in the event of tax approval being withdrawn from the pension scheme, any pension rights that had accrued prior to the withdrawal of tax approval would be excluded from the bankrupt's estate.
<P>
It might be useful to explain how the Inland Revenue will withdraw tax approval from a scheme. Decisions to withdraw tax approval are not taken lightly. Where that is being considered, schemes are given every opportunity to rectify matters. In every case, the final decision to withdraw approval is taken only after consideration at senior level.
<P>
The Inland Revenue also takes steps to protect individuals in a scheme who are not involved in the irregularities, for example by allowing them to transfer their pension rights to another approved scheme.
<P>
I draw the Committee's attention to clause 11, which offers further safeguards. By virtue of clause 11, the court will be given a power to treat an individual's rights under an unapproved pension arrangement as if they were rights under an approved arrangement where they represent his sole or main pension provision. That effectively provides a safety net, which will assist people in the circumstances that the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford was concerned about.
<P>
For example, if a scheme has its approval withdrawn by the Inland Revenue, steps are taken to allow ``innocent'' scheme members to transfer their assets to another approved scheme. If a member failed to act, he would be a member of an unapproved scheme. As the hon. Gentleman knows, clause 11 deals with exceptional circumstances. Someone's pension entitlement in an unapproved scheme&#151;in practice, his only pension entitlement&#151;should have the same protection as that which is provided by clause 10 for approved schemes.
<P>
Finally, amendment No. 41 rightly acknowledges the fact that the trustees and managers will know that tax approval has been withdrawn only when they actually receive notification to that effect from the Inland Revenue. The effect of the amendment is to protect the trustees if they have made decisions, in good faith, about the bankrupt's pension rights in the period between the decision being made to refuse tax approval, and the date on which they are notified of it.
<P>
I acknowledge that clause 10 as drafted means that trustees could be liable for actions that they take in good faith in the period between when the notice to refuse tax approval is sent and when it is received by the trustees. I do not think in practice that that will happen very often but I acknowledge the force of the argument behind the amendment. The amendment is, however, incomplete as it stands because it does not refer to subsection (6), which covers cases where tax approval is withdrawn. I therefore undertake to consider the amendment further to see whether the Government might table a more complete amendment on Report.
<P>
I urge the Committee to reject amendments Nos. 38 to 40, and I hope that, on the basis of my assurance, the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford will not press amendment No. 41.

<P>

<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> In view of the Under-Secretary's assurance on amendment No. 41, for which I am grateful, I shall not press it. I look forward to seeing the amendment that the Government will produce on Report.
<P>
I should exasperate you, Mr. Malins, and the Clerk, if every time I tabled an amendment, I also tabled all the necessary consequential amendments that would be required to give it effective force. It is important for the Committee to consider the substance of amendments, particularly where they would have a material impact on the Bill. If the Committee is persuaded of the substantive arguments, the Government will have every opportunity to produce a new text on Report.
<P>
Throughout our proceedings I have worked on the assumption that many of the amendments that we table will require additional consequential amendments to ensure that they are effective and that the Bill is viable. I accept that I could have tabled a consequential amendment to amendment No. 41, but I hope that the Under-Secretary will understand why we did not do so. I am grateful for his assurance. Let us leave the matter there. It has been a constructive discussion.
<P>
However, I am not satisfied with the hon. Gentleman's comments on amendments Nos. 38 to 40, especially amendment No. 38, which we regard as crucial. It is not good enough to say, ``It may be unjust, completely wrong and retrospective, but in practice, in individual cases, the impact of the retrospectivity'', which is provided for rather obnoxiously in the clause, ``could be withdrawn under clause 11(2)''. That clause that regulations ``may'' provide for such rights
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to be excluded from a person's estate by reference to&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) future likely needs of him and his family'',
<P>
</UL></FONT>and so on. The Under-Secretary just quoted that passage.
<P>
We should not legislate retrospectively. It is no use saying, ``We can legislate retrospectively, but in individual cases the Secretary of State may use his indulgence to protect an individual who may be affected''. That is the principle of benevolent despotism: the citizen has no rights, but the benevolent despot may occasionally be graciously pleased to do him a favour. That is not a principle that we should accept as the basis of legislation.
<P>
Therefore, the Under-Secretary is mistaken in principle and I hope that he will think further about what he said. As we have not had any assurances and we cannot allow what is now acknowledged to be a retrospective element to proceed without resistance, at least from Opposition Members, I believe that all my hon. Friends, will wish to vote for amendment No. 38 with considerable conviction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> Rather than provoke a further two speeches through an exchange, may I say before the hon. Gentleman sits down that in every case where a scheme has reached the point of having its Inland Revenue approval withdrawn, the Revenue has bent over backwards to protect the interests of fund members. There was plenty wrong with the Maxwell pension fund but, to protect the rights of those in the fund, the Inland Revenue did not withdraw approval, although it made sure that the fund did not continue.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's amendment is predicated on a belief that steps taken by the Inland Revenue would deprive people of their pension rights. There is no evidence that that has happened in the past nor that it could in the future.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I know that the Minister is intervening and I do not want to draw him to a close too quickly, but interventions should be brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Again, the Under-Secretary seems to have missed the point&#151;a point of principel that we should not have retrospective legislation. I am deeply grateful to him, because he provided me with a wonderful example which I wish I had thought of myself, because it is clearly germane.
<P>
Let us consider the Maxwell pension funds, which were disapproved by the Inland Revenue, for completely correct reasons in the circumstances, but where pensioners were innocent victims of the system. The same might apply to any pension fund that was disapproved by the Inland Revenue for good reasons. If, for whatever reason, a pensioner became bankrupt after such a pension fund had been disallowed, he or she would be severely disadvantaged because those pension assets would no longer be protected. The pension assets of any other individual in equivalent circumstances would have been protected, but for the fact that the Inland Revenue removed approval for reasons entirely beyond the knowledge and control of the individual pensioner. That is a good example and it illustrates precisely how unfair, unjust and unreasonable those powers could prove.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Under-Secretary argued that, although the powers may be unreasonable or unjust&#151;he did not use those words, but that is what he meant&#151;the Revenue is run by reasonable people who would never do such things. That is no good. Although I would agree that, on the whole, the Revenue maintains high standards of conduct, we should not grant powers to Government Departments that, if used literally would produce an evident injustice. We should grant to Government Departments those powers that we think are legitimate. No Government Department&#151;indeed, no Government&#151;should have the powers of retrospectivity for which the Government are asking.
<P>
We should deny those powers and, in order not to waste too much time, we should put amendment No. 38 to a vote. Given that amendment No. 39 is largely consequential and amendment No. 40 entirely so, we shall not press them to a vote. We may, by some extraordinary chance, fail to win the vote on amendment No. 38, but we shall nevertheless make a serious point by voting on it. I only hope, Mr. Malins, that I am able to hear you call amendment No. 38, and I shall be listening hard to seize that opportunity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> I shall briefly respond to a couple of points that the hon. Gentleman made. I had hoped to short circuit them through an intervention, although I accept that that would perhaps constitute misuse of an intervention.
<P>
I should set the record straight by pointing out that tax approval was not withdrawn from the Maxwell schemes. The Inland Revenue took that approach specifically to protect innocent members of the scheme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The hon. Gentleman provided that example and one can easily see how tax approval might justifiably have been withdrawn. Again, he reinforces my arguments rather than his own. In such circumstances, the Revenue would have the power legitimately to withdraw approval for a scheme, which would have the perverse and unjust effect on individuals that I outlined. We must prevent that theoretical risk from crystallising. There is no better way to do so than to accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> First, the use of the term, ``restrospection'' is inappropriate because the clause makes no retrospective provision. It will simply enable consideration of the scheme's status at the date of bankruptcy. Clause 11 rightly provides sensible flexibility in exceptional circumstances. In the real world, it is extremely unlikely that such circumstances will arise, given that in the light of the withdrawal of tax approval from the scheme, the Revenue's priority is the protection of scheme members' assets. Theoretically, cases such as the hon. Gentleman has described could occur, but clause 11 will provide a safeguard for them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Above all, let us be clear about the meaning of the words that we are using. That is fundamental. The Under-Secretary started by saying that there was retrospection in theory, but that in practice it would not happen because the Revenue would be indulgent and the Government would, if they wanted to, use the power set out in clause 11. He then switched his position and said that, even in theory, there was no retrospection. Let us be clear about the clause. As I read it, if Inland Revenue approval is withdrawn at any stage from a pension scheme, all the assets in that scheme, whether paid in and accumulated before the date of such a withdrawal or afterwards, will no longer enjoy protection against the trustee in bankruptcy.
<P>
If I have understood the position correctly, there is retrospection. It relates to the assets that were paid into a scheme before the Revenue disapproved or disallowed it. Before the Revenue withdrew its approval, that scheme was, like any other, one into which people felt they could pay assets that would be protected against the trustee in bankruptcy. For some reason&#151;the change could have been caused by something similar to the Maxwell case, if not by that case itself&#151;the Revenue has withdrawn its approval. As a result, all the assets that everybody was entitled to believe were protected against the trustee in bankruptcy&#151;indeed, were protected until the day before the change&#151;were no longer protected. If that is not retrospection, I do not know what is.

</FONT>Question accordingly negatived.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> This clause and clauses 11 and 12, give effect to the proposals to protect a person's pension rights in the event of their bankruptcy. Currently, if members of occupational schemes become bankrupt, their pension rights are protected by means of forfeiture provisions in the scheme rules. Some personal pension arrangements contain similar forfeiture provisions; however, there is considerable uncertainty about their effectiveness. In short, all members of personal pension schemes do not appear to enjoy the same level of protection as members of occupational schemes.
<P>
That difference in treatment was highlighted in a recent High Court case, in which it was decided that on bankruptcy, rights under a retirement annuity contract vested in the trustee in bankruptcy. By extension, the ruling might also apply to rights under personal pension arrangements. That is unfair and at odds with our policy that people should be encouraged to save for retirement.
<P>
The measures will create a level playing field so that all kinds of tax-approved pensions will be protected. However, it would be unreasonable to ignore completely the interest of creditors. Our proposals are aimed at striking a balance between the protection of pensions and the rights of creditors.
<P>
The clause sets out the detail of the protection to be afforded to pensions. Protection means that pension rights will be excluded from a bankrupt's estate. Protection will extend to occupational pensions, personal pensions, stakeholder pensions and to any retirement benefits scheme recognised by the Inland Revenue as attracting appropriate pension tax reliefs.
<P>
The clause lists the main types of tax-approved pension arrangements covered by the provision. We have included a regulation-making power so that other arrangements, which might fall outside those strict definitions, can also be protected. That will enable protection to be given to the arrangements that were covered by amendments not moved earlier. We also want the flexibility to protect, as appropriate, new pension arrangements that might be developed. For example, my Department is in discussion with the Inland Revenue about the exact form of approvals that will be required for stakeholder pensions.
<P>
Pension arrangements that do not have tax approval are usually for the very well off and are generally used to top up an approved pension. Although there are good arguments for protecting tax-approved pensions, it cannot be right that unapproved pensions are safeguarded at the expense of creditors. Unapproved schemes will, therefore, fall outside the protections afforded by the new arrangements.
<P>
On bankruptcy, pension rights in an unapproved pension scheme will vest in the trustee in bankruptcy, and will thus be available for use for the benefit of creditors. However, there will be safeguards for certain unapproved arrangements, as Members will see when we discuss clause 11. I commend the clause to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> There is obviously something wrong with my hearing. I have been going to a doctor and, when I go to him next in a few days' time, I shall ask him to examine my hearing. I am in a sad position: I could swear an affidavit that I did not hear anyone call amendments Nos. 35, 36 and 37. However, I accept full responsibility for the state of my ears.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Let me explain to the hon. Gentleman what happened. I called Government amendment No. 44 and said that it would be convenient to discuss with it the amendments that I then listed by number. That list included the amendments to which the hon. Gentleman has referred.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> There are positive aspects of the clause and, in general, I approve both of its main thrust and of the essential derogation or exception from that thrust. We approve of the idea that pension assets should be protected from bankruptcy. That has always been the situation with occupational pension assets in this country because of the nature of trust law. We are in favour of preserving that central principle. It is utterly anomalous that, until now, protection did not extend to other forms of approved pension schemes. We are delighted with the proposal and we congratulate the Government on moving to address that problem.
<P>
I also agree with the Minister on the definition of assets that, being approved by the Inland Revenue, will enjoy such protection under a special regime. As he rightly said, most unapproved pension schemes are set up by people who want to make pension provision beyond the Inland Revenue limits. Such people normally make provision corresponding to salaries about the Inland Revenue limit: that is, in the order of &#163;90,000 a year.
<P>
I am delighted that people who earn large sums of money make pension provision, and we are in favour of everyone saving as much as they can. When people earn that much, saving is well worth it. There should be no question of their saying that it is better not to save and of their falling back on means-tested benefits. Someone earning as much as &#163;90,000 a year and putting away sums greater than the Inland Revenue limit, is simply adding to a substantial portfolio of financial assets. There is no particular reason to distinguish between the assets held in a so-called pension scheme and the other financial assets, such as real estate or investment assets of whatever kind, in which someone holds his wealth.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We totally approve of the main purposes and principles of the clause. However, when I first read it, I was slightly intrigued by a clear Freudian slip, which the Government still have not noticed. There is no paragraph (i) in subsection (2). You and I, Mr. Malins, learned our alphabet at the age of two or three and we learned that it goes A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J and so on. I looked in vain in subsection (2) for paragraph (i), and realised that something was missing. We know what has been left out and we know the pension vehicle that the Government do not want to talk about, that they wish did not exist and of course, for which the Bill will not provide.
<P>
Perhaps an injudicious civil servant or parliamentary draftsman drafted a paragraph (i) that referred to the unmentionable LISA. If so, I am sure that the Minister immediately bit his head off, took out his red pencil and said, ``In no way are we referring to this unmentionable rival product in my nice Bill.'' Therefore, paragraph (i) was struck out and the parliamentary draftsman forgot to adjust the lettering in the clause. Once again, the Government have been found out by documentary evidence.
<P>
In the normal helpful and constructive way in which the Opposition contribute to deliberations on the Bill, we thought that we would table amendments to help the Government out. One of them was amendment No. 35, which would have provided protection for LISAs and for the those who hold their pension assets in the form of LISAs and, by definition, up to the limits approved by the Revenue. The Minister's Department did not want to contemplate that, but it would have added to the comprehensiveness of the clause. It is an anomaly that the clause does not provide for LISAs.
<P>
Much more peculiar is an elementary error or oversight. I cannot see a sinister reason for the Government's failure to mention stakeholder pensions. Perhaps they got so carried away by their fury that LISAs should be mentioned in the clause and they were in such an emotional state that they forgot to refer to their own product. Possibly, they thought that if they did not mention stakeholder pensions, they would get away with not mentioning the Treasury's hated rival product. That might be the explanation, but it is curious that stakeholder pensions are not mentioned. Had amendment No. 37 been accepted, they would have been mentioned in the Bill.
<P>
I have described a drafting error that any of us could make and I have no intention of attributing any ulterior motive to it. However, it is extraordinary that subsection (2) describes what an ``approved pension arrangement'' means, but does not say that ``approved'' means approved by the Inland Revenue. Common sense would suggest that anyone reading the clause would assume that the Government meant approved by the Inland Revenue. However, we are drafting legislation and not holding a private conversation round the dinner table, so we need to be precise about such matters. For example, ``approved'' might mean approved by OPRA, another regulator, the Bank of England or&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Or, approved by Alastair Campbell.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> My hon. Friend touches on something, but it is almost lese majeste or blasphemy to mention the great Alastair Campbell in Committee. He is the power before which the Government bow down in terror. If Mr. Alastair Campbell knew some of the mistakes made in this Committee, I hate to think what would happen to some Labour Members. We would not want them to suffer such a fate, so we will not make any reports to Mr. Alastair Campbell.
<P>
<B>Mr. Vernon Coaker </B>(Gedling): He knows.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> According to the hon. Gentleman, big brother&#151;his name is Alastair Campbell&#151;knows everything. It would seem sensible to make ``approve'' explicitly mean approved by the Inland Revenue. That has been implicit throughout our debate&#151;and my exchange with the Minister&#151;but it would be helpful to make explicit mention of it.
<P>
Those are the three deficiencies of the clause, and we still regard them as significant and would like to remedy them. If the Government intend to adopt any of our suggestions, they have every means to do so. I do not expect them to do anything about the LISA, but they may want to mention the stakeholder. Before the Committee votes on the clause the Minister may like to comment on whether a specific definition of ``approved'' would be helpful. A careful reading of the clause will reveal the curious omission of any reference to, or definition of, that descriptive epithet.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> The truth is out. The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford made a Freudian slip when he said that this was a ``nice'' Bill. He used the word precisely, although he did not mean to say it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> He most certainly did. He said that the Minister would not want to spoil his nice Bill&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend was being sarcastic.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford was being obsessive rather than sarcastic. He is determined to raise, in speech after speech, an issue that has been clarified by my hon. Friend the Minister of State's explanations. The hon. Gentleman is exceptionally fond of the word LISA&#151;I wonder whether his wife, daughter or mother is called Lisa. Whoever Lisa is, he is clearly extremely fond of&#151;and obsessed by&#151;her. The pooled pension investment prosposal makes it absolutely clear&#151;
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> Perhaps I may finish this point and give way to the hon. Lady if there is sufficient time. The Treasury-DSS document states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It is important to appreciate that this proposed financial instrument is not a new kind of pension in its own right.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Member for Gratham and Stamford should have read the document. Even if he has not, my hon. Friend the Minister of State has made the point clearly.
<P>
As for the missing ``i'', that is simply a drafting convention, as I suspect the hon. Gentleman knows well. It prevents any possible confusion in the Committee or anywhere else between Roman numerals&#151;paragraph (i) and part I, for instance. The hon. Gentleman has demonstrated his command of Latin to the Committee and I would have expected him to remember that convention.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman made a more serious point about the need for an amendment to clarify that the clause applies only to Inland Revenue-approved schemes. I think that he will agree that it is not just Inland Revenue-approved schemes that need protection. Schemes that are run by British companies to pay for pensions for people whom they employ abroad are not Inland Revenue-approved schemes but should be entitled to protection. Some large statutory schemes are not formally approved by the Inland Revenue because they were approved by statute.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 10, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 11</center></H4>
<H4><center>Effect of insolvency on unapproved pension rights</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> The clause introduces safeguards on bankruptcy for people whose sole or main pension provision is an unapproved scheme. Broadly, clause 10 ensures that tax-approved pension arrangements will be protected but that unapproved arrangements that provide top-up pensions will not be protected. Instead, they will form part of a bankrupt's estate and therefore will be available for Creditors. We believe that that is a fair balance, but some individuals may have only an unapproved pension arrangement or a main pension that is an unapproved arrangement. We do not think that there will be many of those, but it seems right that a court should be able to examine such cases and, if appropriate, extend to them the same protection that is applied to approved arrangements.
<P>
The clause allows the Secretary of State to make regulations to exclude rights under an unapproved pension arrangement from a bankrupt's estate. We intend to make regulations which provide that a bankrupt with an unapproved pension arrangement will be able to make an application to a court that the pension be treated as an approved arrangement. The court will have to consider the application in the light of the criteria set out in the clause and will have to make an assessment of the likely needs in retirement of the individual and his family. It will also have to consider whether any other pension benefits that the person is likely to be entitled to on retirement appear likely to be adequate for meeting those needs.
<P>
If the court decides that the bankrupt's other pension benefits are likely to be inadequate, it will be able to make an order that the unapproved arrangement is to be treated as an approved arrangement and hence protected in the same way. However, if the court finds to the contrary, the pension rights will be retained by the trustee in bankruptcy to be used for the benefit of creditors.
<P>
The clause allows the court a large measure of discretion as to whether a person's pension benefits are likely to be adequate to meet his needs in retirement. We think that that is appropriate because of the wide variety of circumstances that the court may need to consider. The clause provides a useful safeguard for people whose main source of retirement income is, or is likely to come from, an unapproved pension arrangement.

<P>

<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> Our general principle is to accept the Government taking powers to make regulations that could be used only in a permissive sense to expand the freedom of the citizen and, in this case, the protections that are afforded to the pensioner. In general we would oppose powers that could be used to restrict protections or the rights of the citizen.
<P>
This clause falls into the permissive category. We agree that Inland Revenue-approved pension assets should be protected against trustees in bankruptcy. We are happy with the Government's decision to provide for the possibility of taking additional powers to protect non-approved assets in certain circumstances. We would have taken a negative view had the regulations carried with them the danger that they might be used to reduce or constrain the protections in the Bill, particularly in clause 10. On the basis, I am happy for the clause to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> These are technical matters. Reference has already been made to Alastair Campbell, who would need all his legendary skills to get our proceedings on the front pages of the tabloid press. Perhaps he would need the help of the delightful LISA&#151;the love that dare not speak its name as far as Social Security Ministers are concerned.
<P>
How does clause 11, which is about the rights of a person to be protected under an unapproved pension arrangement, relate to the previous clause, in particular to subsections (6) to (8)? The explanatory note says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If the Inland Revenue issue a notice withdrawing approval after a bankruptcy order is made and the effective date for the withdrawal of approval is before the date of the bankrupty order itself, then any rights that the bankrupt has in the pension scheme are to vest in the trustee in bankruptcy.''<P>

That itself is a complex concept to grapple with, but it is not clear to me how it relates to clause 11.
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> To respond to the hon. Member for Gainsborough, we have already debated that point at length. If a person's pension scheme loses its Inland Revenue tax approval before he becomes bankrupt, the bankruptcy trustee can take those assets in hand for the benefit of his creditors. However, if that pension arrangement is the only pension, or substantially the only pension, available to the person going through bankruptcy proceedings, he is free to go to court and ask for that unapproved pension to be treated as an approved pension. In the circumstances that I described in my speech on clause stand part, the court would make a decision. However, it is our intention that if someone is caught in the circumstances outlined by the hon. Gentleman, the court would be able to treat an unapproved pension scheme&#151;unapproved because it has lost its tax approval&#151;as an approved scheme and protect it.

<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I want to welcome the fact that this Government, who are so keen to give power to other parts of the United Kingdom, have finally remembered the Scots, who should also be affected by the Bill. I am sure that the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mrs. McKenna) is also grateful. If she wishes to make a contribution, we shall be delighted to hear from her.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> This clause is consequential upon the other changes that we are making, in clauses 10 and 11, with respect to pensions and bankruptcy. It will no longer be possible for a scheme, on bankruptcy, to forfeit a member's pension rights.
<P>
Under current arrangements in occupational pension schemes, if a member becomes bankrupt, the trustees of the scheme usually protect his pension rights by forfeiting them. This is provided for in scheme rules. The member no longer has any pension rights, so they cannot be taken by the trustee in bankruptcy. However, once the member retires, the trustees of the scheme will pay the pension to the member or his dependants on an ex gratia basis. In that way, the bankrupt's pension is protected. Such forfeiture arrangements are given statutory recognition in the Pensions Act 1995.
<P>
Forfeiture arrangements also exist in personal pension schemes. However, there are doubts about their effectiveness because of the contractural nature of personal pension arrangements. Measures in the Bill will provide a new basis for the protection of pensions on bankruptcy. All pension arrangements that are approved for tax purposes will have statutory protection against the pension being seized on bankruptcy. This protection is contained in clause 10. Forfeiture clauses will therefore no longer be needed.
<P>
We cannot, however, simply ignore these forfeiture arrangements. We must also formally override forfeiture clauses, and that is the purpose of the clause. There are two reasons why we must take that step: first, because of the potential knock-on effects in relation to unapproved pension schemes; and, secondly, because such clauses could prevent a trustee in bankruptcy from applying to a court for an income payments order against the bankrupt who was drawing his pension.
<P>
It may be useful if I say something more about the potential knock-on effects to unapproved schemes. As I have said, we plan to protect approved pension arrangements. On the other hand, unapproved pension arrangements will be allowed to vest in the trustee in bankruptcy, and will thus be available for the benefit of creditors. We believe that that strikes a reasonable balance between encouraging people to save for retirement and having regard to the rights of creditors. If unapproved schemes are allowed to retain their forfeiture provisions, that would undermine the proposals. Unapproved schemes would be protected, like approved schemes, from the consequences of bankruptcy, albeit by a different route.
<P>
If forfeiture arrangements were retained, on bankruptcy the unapproved pension arrangement would be forfeited by the trustees of the scheme, and the person's pension rights would be kept completely out of the reach of the trustee in bankruptcy. That would be contrary to the policy that I have outlined. It might also create a perverse incentive. There are limits on the amounts that people can put into tax-approved pension arrangements, but no limits on the amounts that can be put into unapproved pension arrangements. A person who envisaged that he might become bankrupt could put large sums of money, properly due to his creditors, into his unapproved pension arrangement, secure in the knowledge that, on bankruptcy, they would be protected from creditors. Clearly that kind of manipulation must be prevented.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> We have already debated the principle behind the clause. We thoroughly approve of the clause and commend the Government for introducing it. We accept the logic of the Minister's case that, if unapproved as well as approved pension schemes were protected from bankruptcy, there could be an abuse at the expense of creditors. Parliament must strike a balance between the claims of creditors and the claims of those who are bankrupt. For once, we are at one with the Government.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 12, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 13</center></H4>
<H4><center>Compensating occupational pension schemes</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I congratulate my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State on securing harmony in the Committee. I hope that we can maintain it in our debates on subsequent clauses.
<P>
The clause will extend the eligibility for compensation under the pension compensation provisions that were in the Pensions Act 1995, through the Pensions Compensation Board. It also correspondingly increases the maximum amount of compensation that can be paid to a scheme if assets are lost through theft or fraud and if the employer is insolvent. It means that all scheme members will receive a higher proportion of their pension entitlement.
<P>
Under the current provisions, a scheme's assets must have been reduced to less than 90 per cent. of the value of its liabilities before a claim for compensation can be made. In addition, the fund cannot be restored to a level above that required to meet 90 per cent. of its liabilities, which are calculated using the minimum funding valuation method.
<P>
The system involves some unfairness, which we want to correct. The clause's provisions mean that compensation will be paid to restore a scheme's assets and to meet 100 per cent. of its liabilities for older scheme members. That recognises that those members do not have the time in the remainder of their working lives to rebuild their pension rights. If their rights can be restored to that level, it is important to do so. The scheme's assets in respect of its liabilities for younger members will be restored to 90 per cent. Overall, those younger scheme members will receive more than under the current system.
<P>
Our proposals involve a fairer arrangement, which will ensure that a greater proportion of the liabilities are met.

<P>

<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> We do not object in principle to the clause. However, the Minister was less than precise when he referred to ``older'' and ``younger'' members of a scheme. The important distinction in the clause is between scheme members who are already pensioners and are in receipt of a pension, and contributing members of a scheme&#151;or members of a scheme in respect of whom an employer is contributing&#151;who are still working.
<P>
The Government's intention is that the first category should have 100 per cent. protection and that the second should have 90 per cent. protection. Subsection (2)(c)&#151;a curious little subsection&#151;will provide 100 per cent. protection for other liabilities&#151;in other words, for liabilities other than to members. To whom will those liabilities be available? Presumably, they will be available to managers, trustees, actuaries, accountants or lawyers. My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough will be delighted to learn that his professional colleagues will get 100 per cent. protection of their fees in the event of a scheme's being underfunded.
<P>
A balance needs to be drawn. In principle, one should always oppose 100 per cent. protection being provided by any compensation scheme. Doing so creates the wrong impression. A moral hazard might be created if the beneficiaries of a scheme feel that they are entirely protected. No duty of alertness would be required on their part to ensure that the scheme from which they will benefit is being properly run. They can be certain that it is the members of other schemes who will contribute 100 per cent. to restore them to the status quo ante if anything goes wrong, which is probably undesirable.
<P>
However, I follow the logic of being rather more generous that the existing 90 per cent. provision for pensioners who are already receiving their pension. As the Minister said, they are vulnerable and may not have the chance to restore the real value of their assets by any other means. Why the Minister thinks that that category deserves 100 per cent. protection mystifies me. In so far as the beneficiaries of those liabilities are professional advisers or managers of a scheme, they jolly well should bear some of the responsibility and some of the pain if a scheme ends up being underfunded. They were, one hopes, in a position to do something about it&#151;they should have been able to see the problem in advance and perhaps avert it. I rather favour the idea that professional advisers of pension schemes should suffer to some extent if they recommend a scheme that turns out to be under-funded or defaults on its obligations. However, I shall not make an issue of the matter and the Opposition will support the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> May I correct one point on which the hon. Gentleman was not quite correct? The explanatory notes state on page 20 that the 100 per cent. level applies to the liabilities in respect of people who have already retired and also to people who are within 10 years of retirement, but that the 90 per cent. level applies when people are more than 10 years from retirement. The distinction is not quite as the hon. Gentleman suggested.
<P>
<H5>7.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> This is a case of the explanatory notes being difficult to align with the text of the Bill. Clause 13 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the amount of the liabilities of the scheme to, or in respect of, its pensioner members''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is category (a), which is covered by 100 per cent. protection. Pensioner members are members who are in receipt of their pensions. Category (b) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``90 per cent, of the amount of the liabilities of the scheme to, or in respect of, any other members of the scheme''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The only other members of the scheme are the contributing members.
<P>
If the words do not bear the meaning that I put on them and the explanatory memorandum is correct, this is one more case of administrative obfuscation and I deplore it.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 13 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 14</center></H4>
<H4><center>Miscellaneous amendments</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The clause gives effect to schedule 2, which contains a number of minor but important changes to ensure the correct operation of the existing legislation. The schedule amends the definition of a personal pension scheme to ensure that any scheme, including a stakeholder scheme, set up exclusively for self-employed earners, is included in the definition; it allows guaranteed minimum pensions to be revalued by the fixed rate revaluation method after 6 April 1997; it ensures that contribution equivalent premiums are paid in all cases where there are state scheme rights to be restored; it makes clear that pension schemes can keep money in building society accounts and not just bank accounts; it simplifies the operation of the minimum funding requirement; it allows the Pensions Compensation Board to align its financial and reporting years; and it ensures that employees who are directors of a trustee company have the same employment rights as individual trustees.
<P>
Those are important technical changes and we shall discuss some of the issues when we come to schedule 2.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The hon. Gentleman seems to have moved not only the clause, but his amendments to the schedule, and we have no objection to one or the other.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>

<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 114, in page 68, line 25, at end add&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`8.&#151;(1) The Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 is amended as follows:<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
(2) In section 634(2) omit the words ``or after he attains the age of 75''.'.
<P>
This is an extremely important amendment. I could legitimately spend several hours discussing the need for it&#151;indeed, it would be a useful parliamentary exercise. It would be a good use of our time if we spent a whole day on the amendment. However, I do not propose to do so because we covered part of this subject in discussing the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) the other day and because the arguments were set out in a memorably powerful speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith) in the Chamber yesterday.
<P>
The new Labour Government have not shown any sign that they have begun to apprehend, let alone to address, the catastrophic fall in annuity rates for those who depend on purchasing a retirement with their accumulated pension fund. The Government have done nothing about it and have shown no appreciation of the problem. People's expectations are shattered when they find that they can no longer live in their own homes, as they had expected to do in retirement, but have to sell them and move somewhere cheaper. That disrupts their lives, and the sudden reduction in expected income in retirement causes considerable human misery. We discussed the other day how annuity rates have fallen by 30 or 40 per cent. in four or five years. That fall has been devastating.
<P>
Any reduction in the perceived return from pension investments makes people less inclined to invest. If the problem is not resolved, inevitably, people at the margin&#151;everything in ecomomics is determined at the margin&#151;will decide not to bother to save for their retirement. They will prefer to spend their money on current consumption because the trade-off between that and future retirement income has been adversely changed. That would be a rational but regrettable decision.
<P>
What can we do about it? The Conservative party is not in the business of regulating interest rates. Even the Minister of State, who believes that he can regulate prices in some aspects of the financial services industry, would baulk at regulating interest rates. We cannot change the annuity rates that are available on the market, but the amendment would provide a practical solution. It would remove the artificial rule that people who want an annuity must buy it by the age of 75, although up to 75 they can use income drawdown from their scheme under Inland Revenue rules. We would extend those provisions indefinitely&#151;if necessary, to the death of the individual. That would give an individual maximum flexibility for the whole of his natural life. It would provide people with the chance to decide whether to buy an annuity.
<P>
We are not talking about expense for the Revenue. It has systems in place for taxing pension assets&#151;I believe at the high rate of 38 per cent.&#151;that are left by an individual who has not bought an annuity. If the money involved and the deceased's net estate exceed the inheritance tax level, which is a little short of &#163;250,000, then inheritance tax is also payable. There is no loss to the Revenue over time. It may be argued that there is a cash flow loss, but I am not sure that that is correct because it might work the other way. Income that is drawn down is subject to tax, but income that is left in a pension fund is not liable to income tax. The amendment would protect the Revenue, enhance the position of the pensioner and reinforce the incentive to invest in pensions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> May I express disappointment on behalf of the Committee that the hon. Gentleman did not make his speech on this subject, which would have lasted several hours? We considered this matter in an earlier sitting. I made it clear that we are interested in alternative proposals, but none has been forthcoming. The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight), who we missed today, pointed out that no new financial products would do the job.
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford and others were right to raise concern about the fall in annuity rates, but let us consider the rate for an annuity that is paid monthly in arrears on a single-life basis and which is fully indexed in line with the retail price index. The current starting rate for such an annuity on a &#163;100,000 fund is &#163;5,821. Five years ago, it would have been &#163;6,596. Allowing for changes in inflation, the fall in annuity rates has been much less than it appears. If the healthy growth of the stock market under this Government's management is also factored in, the picture changes again. I urge hon. Members to resist the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> The amendment is important and it must be put to a vote.
