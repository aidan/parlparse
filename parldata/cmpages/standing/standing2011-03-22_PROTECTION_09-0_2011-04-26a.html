                           </strong> Good morning, Mr Streeter. I hope that among all
the other things you have been doing, you have had a reasonable break
and that members of the Committee have enjoyed themselves, and even on
the beaches during the weekend have been preparing rigorously for our
discussion of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000033">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is good to be on the Committee reunited with colleagues and friends. I
hope that the Under-Secretary and I swap places again soon. My brief
from an earlier Bill, the hon. Member for Northampton North, is in
Committee. I still have not received a bill for his work then, but it
is good to see him. On a serious point, the hon. Member for South
Swindon and I have not been members of the same Committee since we
discussed the Academies Bill soon after he was elected to Parliament.
We had some interesting exchanges at the time and, hopefully, in the
forthcoming razzamatazz of our proceedings, we shall have more
interesting exchanges of views and opinions as we approve this
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000034">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have suggested under amendment 93 an independent inquiry into the use
of surveillance camera systems before we proceed further with the Bill.
Later clauses bring independent inquiries under the Regulation of
Investigatory Powers Act 2000 as well as under powers of entry. One of
the reasons why the amendment is so important is that the Government
are caught on the horns of a dilemma in respect of what they are trying
to do. The Bill amends certain pieces of legislation, and an
independent inquiry would help it to achieve at its heart an
all-embracing fundamental principle to drive on amendments in other
areas. At present, it lacks such a principle. Although the Government
are seeking to amend different bits of legislation and tweak certain
pieces, as they are doing under the clause and the code of practice for
surveillance camera systems, they do not have a fundamental drive
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000035">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friends have tabled an amendment to a later part of the Bill, and
others have suggested a debate about whether such matters need to be
amalgamated under the guidance of a privacy commissioner. An inquiry
into surveillance camera systems would explain how such systems relate
to other aspects, such as RIPA, powers of entry and a range of other
emerging technologies that many of us have not yet even thought about.
Such an inquiry would establish an evidence base for what the
Government are
doing.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000036">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am not alone in wanting an independent evidence base. In 2008-09, in
its report “Surveillance: Citizens and the State”, the
House of Lords Select Committee recommended that the Home Office
commission an independent appraisal of the existing research evidence
on the effectiveness of CCTV in preventing and detecting crime. Indeed,
it proposed a statutory code for CCTV. It is not just me who is arguing
that there is a need to understand such matters and look at them in
more depth; the House of Lords Committee said exactly the same
thing.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000037">&#160;</a>

                           </span> What
assessment has the hon. Gentleman made of the cost of his very
interesting proposal for a wide-ranging independent inquiry on the
subject?<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000038">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Actually, I have not made an assessment of the
cost, but if one wants legislation that is effective and will improve
the current situation, one should start 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 325<a class="bkMark" name="Column325">&#160;</a>
                           </div>with the principle and then look at whether it is affordable. As I said,
the House of Lords Select Committee proposed a statutory code and an
independent appraisal. The hon. Lady will have read the notes from the
deputy chief constable of Northamptonshire—the hon. Member for
Northampton North will be keen on this—who stated in his
submission to the Committee, which I shall quote in a moment, that the
Government should look at a privacy code rather than have what he
politely refers to as a piecemeal way of changing the current system.
An independent inquiry to look at all the evidence, the assessment and
the rights and wrongs would help us much better to understand all the
changes.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000039">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
are some worthy proposed amendments to current legislation and on CCTV.
No doubt, in his response, the Minister will say, “The hon.
Gentleman will remember that when he was a Minister of State, he looked
at a code of practice for CCTV, and said exactly that to the House of
Lords Select Committee.” No doubt, the Minister will also point
out that the interim surveillance camera commissioner was introduced by
the last Government. That is all true, but what is missing in the Bill
is the sense that there is an evidence base for the things we are
considering.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000040">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Having
said that, I want to look at some unresolved issues in the Bill to see
whether the Minister will lay out for the Committee the
Government’s thinking and explain why no inquiry is needed. Will
he explain that my amendment 93 is unnecessary because the Government
have assessed the whole question, based their view on evidence and
accordingly made the appropriate response in the
Bill?<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000041">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For
example, an inquiry might consider, and establish for us, exactly how
many surveillance cameras there are. The figure always given was just
over 4 million, but in his evidence to us Chris Sims said that ACPO
believes 1.8 million is a more accurate figure. An inquiry on
surveillance camera systems could look at who is right and what the
correct figure is. As it currently stands, the
Bill—notwithstanding the order-making power in it—states
that the surveillance code will apply only to police and local
authorities.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000042">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">How
many police and local authority cameras are there? Is the Local
Government Group right to
state:<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000043">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“It
is also important to remember that at most councils operate 3.3% of all
CCTV cameras in England and
Wales”?<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000300">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>As
it currently stands, the Bill—it will protect freedoms and has a
great title—addresses only 3.3% of all the surveillance camera
systems in the whole country. Surely an independent inquiry should look
at that to see whether it is appropriate and whether the Bill’s
provisions should be
extended.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000044">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“This
could cause problems in practice given the many partnership
arrangements between the public and private sectors for town centre
monitoring. There is also widespread use of CCTV and ANPR systems
across all sectors including government agencies and increasing
deployment of ANPR in the private sector such as with car park
operation, where sometimes details of people’s vehicle movements
are stored indefinitely and insufficient safeguards are in place
regarding security, access and further
use.”<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000302">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p>Again,
if the Information Commissioner is concerned about how the Bill is set
up and that insufficient thought has been given to how it applies to a
small number of cameras—what about the rest?—surely an
inquiry should look at that. The Information Commissioner is not
suggesting a little tweak; he is pointing out that the Bill as drafted
deals with only a small proportion of the surveillance camera
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000048">&#160;</a>

                           </span> The hon. Gentleman is
addressing the matter with his usual eloquence, but is it not possible
that most of the cameras in the 3.3% figure he is quoting are the ones
that are most in the public eye? In other words, they are focused on
public areas, rather than many of the cameras that are calculated in
that figure, which will be within private buildings, companies and the
like, with several cameras within one building. The ones that are
mostly focused on the public, that the public are aware of, are those
under local authority
control.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000049">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is a fair point. We do not, however, know how
accurate the hon. Gentleman’s statement is. There is a need for
an independent inquiry. The Information Commissioner—not
me—is saying that there is a problem with the Bill only applying
to a small number of cameras. I am saying that an inquiry would enable
us to establish the accuracy of what the hon. Gentleman said and
whether—I am setting up a straw man here—there is a
problem. The Bill creates a code of practice for the cameras that need
a code to adhere to, which people have to have regard to. The honest
answer to his question is that I do not know, which is why an inquiry
would
help.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000050">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
the Bill, there is an order-making power for the Secretary of State to
extend the power within the Bill to other bodies. At the moment, only
the police and local authorities have to have regard to the code. There
is an order-making power, which means that that can be extended to
other public bodies, should the Secretary of State choose to do so. If
we do not have an inquiry, what evidence will that extension be based
on? How will it be determined that the order-making power should be
extended? If this is such a fundamental part of the Bill and is so
important for the protection of freedom, why are police and local
authorities covered by primary legislation, but not other public
bodies? Why should the extension to other public bodies just be a
matter for the Secretary of State to
determine?<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000051">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
inquiry could look at which camera systems are covered by the Bill. As
the European Secure Vehicle Alliance
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000052">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
context within which surveillance systems are assessed in terms of
their efficacy and legislative framework might well consider broadening
its scope to include road safety camera and ANPR systems in addition to
CCTV.”<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000304">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>As
we know, the surveillance camera systems that the Bill defines include
automatic number plate recognition. What evidence does the Minister
have, apart from the Birmingham incident, which involved both CCTV and
ANPR, that ANPR is not working and needs to be brought within the scope
of the Bill?<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000053">&#160;</a>
                        </p> 
                        <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 327<a class="bkMark" name="Column327">&#160;</a>
                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">The evidence
put before us by the ESVA shows that the vast majority of the public
are happy with ANPR. They think that ANPR is a good system that works
well. Why is the Minister including ANPR in the scope of the Bill? If
there is no evidence for it—I may have missed it, but I cannot
find it apart from that one incident—why is the Minister doing
it? Is it just that he thinks that it should be within the scope of the
Bill, and everybody would say, “Why aren’t you including
ANPR?” if he did not? If there is an order-making power, it will
be the case that ANPR could be extended so that not only the police
used it but also private car park operators, who increasingly use it.
Again, what is the Minister saying with
that?<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000054">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Surveillance
camera systems, particularly ANPR, are strongly supported by the
public. From the evidence before the Committee, they also make a huge
contribution to crime prevention. As a result of ANPR, 20,592
individuals, 5% of whom were designated as prolific or priority
offenders, were arrested; 52,000 vehicle-related document offences were
identified; 41,200 vehicles were seized for other document offences and
2,000 stolen vehicles were recovered. I hope that nothing in the Bill
will cause that contribution to be undermined, because those systems
are clearly a very effective way of dealing with vehicle and other
crime. An inquiry would need to look at the impact of further
regulation on ANPR and how it might be undermined by what the
Government are
proposing.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000055">&#160;</a>

one person about the re-extension of measures relating to DNA, which we
have debated before, but I have received none about CCTV and, from
memory, none about ANPR. The hon. Gentleman may have received a
representation from one person. The surveillance commissioner makes the
point that it is bad to legislate on the basis of isolated incidents
when things have gone wrong. That is not to say that such incidents
should be ignored, but if we legislated only on the basis of when a law
went wrong or when somebody abused it, that would be legislating
badly.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000059">&#160;</a>

                           </div>necessity for extending the measure to ensure that ANPR, instead of
applying only to police and/or local authorities, applied to other

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I have
mentioned the deputy chief constable of Northamptonshire police, who,
again, points to an unresolved and unanswered question for the
Government in the Bill. He is worried that the introduction of a
surveillance camera commissioner would mean that a further commissioner
would be involved in the regulation of ANPR. ANPR might involve not
only the surveillance camera commissioner, as the person responsible
for the code, but also the Information Commissioner, because of visual
images and data protection. In addition, ACPO is in conflict with the
surveillance commissioner, who thinks that he should be involved
because ANPR involves information collated from within a vehicle and
could therefore be regarded as intrusive. All those things could be
addressed in an independent inquiry. Clause 29 introduces a
code of practice for surveillance camera systems, and my amendment
simply asks on what basis the Government are seeking to do that. What
unresolved issues need to be addressed before we charge headlong into
the system?<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000061">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">An inquiry
into the use of surveillance camera systems could also look at how the
new code of practice might be monitored. The Government seek
to introduce a surveillance camera commissioner, who will be
responsible for the code. Is that the best way to monitor
the use of surveillance camera systems? The Information Commissioner is
worried about the introduction of a surveillance camera commissioner
because of the lack of clarity between the two roles. An inquiry could
consider whether we need two codes of practice. The Information
Commissioner has a code of practice for surveillance camera systems,
and the surveillance camera commissioner will also have a code of
practice. An inquiry to consider surveillance camera systems could try
to decide which code of practice was more necessary. A number of those
who gave evidence to us said that that was potentially a
problem.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000062">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Some
of our later amendments will deal with the issues in more detail.
However, I want to highlight the fact that almost no one who gave
evidence objected in principle to the idea of a code of practice. But
the Government have failed to explain the overall strategic framework
and how the points raised about surveillance camera systems will be
addressed. I have mentioned a few of the issues that an inquiry could
address. Will the Government address those issues or simply plough
on?<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000063">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Information Commissioner and chief police officers say that there is a
risk of duplication, and we have not even touched on the enforcement
mechanisms. The Government’s answer is that at the moment the
code is voluntary, and it can be taken into account by the courts
should they so choose. An inquiry might look at how effective that
would be. The Government’s view is to wait and see how it works,
which is not a very powerful argument. The Government say that it is a
voluntary code; they expect people to come up to the highest possible
standards and they will see how it works.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000064">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I want to
raise one other point about an independent inquiry. All members of the
Committee will be aware that we are a pilot for a public reading stage
for the Bill, which means that the public are now heavily involved in
our deliberations. We did not have a public reading 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 329<a class="bkMark" name="Column329">&#160;</a>
                           </div>hearing, which I believe is coming later, but the Bill was named by the
Deputy Prime Minister as one of the pilots for it, so there will be a
big document for us—the public reading stage report—on
what the public think. Any independent inquiry would necessitate the
involvement of the public, but one of the problems is that nearly every
time the public say something, the Government reject it. Although I
have not looked through all of the public reading stage report, it is
difficult to find one thing where the public say something and the
Government say, “That is absolutely right. We will change what
we are doing.” I quote an example:<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000065">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“A
number of individuals commented that the clauses were ‘fairly
toothless’, in particular pointing to the non-binding nature of
the code of practice. The Government rejects this
view.”<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000305">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>There
is a bit of an explanation for that, but with regard to CCTV and a code
of practice, understanding what the public think is absolutely
fundamental. It is a point that I will make later. The hon. Member for
Carshalton and Wallington asked me about that. Although I think a code
of practice is fairly reasonable in some respects, I have not had many
people rushing to me and saying that they are really worried about CCTV
and that it wakes them up at night. I have had lots of people come to
me about counter-terrorism, but not about
CCTV.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000066">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">An
independent inquiry could also look at what a code of practice should
be and what is in it. We have it before us now. The Government have
begun a consultation on the code of practice, but that ought to have
happened before the Bill. We are consulting people now on what should
be in the code of practice, and there is scope for the Secretary of
State to alter, amend or adapt the code. However, as we are a pilot for
a public reading stage, we should have consulted the public on what
should be in the code—or on any other matter—before the
Bill’s proceedings. It strikes me as rather odd that that is
taking place
now.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000067">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Through
the amendment, I have raised a series of doubts, problems and issues
about CCTV, the code of practice and what is in the Bill. The
legislation on CCTV and other aspects lacks a focal point—the
symbolic, real dynamic legislative change that would drive things
forward—and perhaps, as some people have suggested, a debate on
the privacy commissioner. Some of the Government’s thinking is
confused and piecemeal. The amendment is an important one, and it will
be interesting to hear the Minister’s answers to some of the
questions.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000068">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Local Government Group was asked at the evidence session to send us
evidence about CCTV. It was asked what evidence it had to show how
significant CCTV was, and it sent us, in the submission we have just
received, a whole range of examples where CCTV has made a difference. I
know that the Minister will say that the Government are not opposed to
CCTV and that they understand its importance, and that would be a fair
comment. The LGG points out that there

interesting thing about the hon. Gentleman’s comments and
approach is that he is struggling to find an objection to our proposals
on CCTV. He accepted that when he was a Minister, he, and the previous
Government more generally, considered introducing a code of practice,
but did not quite get round to it. That is the point at issue: his
amendment seeks to defer rather than take
action.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000073">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman will remember clearly our discussion on surveillance in
Westminster Hall two years ago, following the report on the
surveillance society published by the Select Committee on Home Affairs.
He and I had a number of such debates and discussions in March 2009. At
that time, when he was in a position to take action, he did not appear
to have commissioned the independent appraisal that he is now seeking
through his amendment. The amendment therefore seems to be about buying
time and wanting to look further at things, when we already have the
Home Affairs Committee report, the House of Lords report and various
other evidence. It was equally interesting to hear his comments about
the concerns on the issue, and whether that was a relevant
factor.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000074">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">When
the hon. Gentleman was a Minister, the Home Office commissioned an
Ipsos MORI survey on CCTV. While he is absolutely right to highlight
the support for CCTV systems, that report also highlighted the fact
that 23% of people said that CCTV cameras made them feel too watched.
Therefore, to suggest that there are no concerns downplays the survey
and the public analysis that was probably undertaken when he was a Home
Office Minister. Rather than waiting to see what further events may
occur, we believe that it is important to put in place a mechanism such
that there is some form of regulation through the code of practice as
set out in the Bill. The hon. Gentleman made fair points about some of
the details and arrangements, which we will undoubtedly examine further
when discussing other
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000075">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Perhaps
the hon. Gentleman thinks that the situation is static. I do not think
that can be so, because he has looked at the issue quite carefully
himself and must know that it is not static. Technology has changed
markedly over a number of years, and to establish a commission to look
at things almost implies that we will end up with one point that
remains the same and there is no further change, and then it will
happen again. That certainly has not been the experience. Technology
and the way we engage with it continue to change, and attitudes may
also change.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000076">&#160;</a>

the heart of the Government’s proposals is a desire to ensure
that CCTV commands the confidence of the community it serves. The hon.
Gentleman and I are on exactly the same page about that; he said
precisely those words to me on 19 March 2009 during our Westminster
Hall debate on the surveillance society. I therefore do not think that
there is a disagreement in principle or a fundamental difference
between us on the issue. The difference is that we believe that the
form of regulation we propose will help to instil the necessary trust
and confidence in CCTV and automatic number plate recognition systems,
so that they can continue to do precisely the things that we want them
to do on the issues that the hon. Gentleman has highlighted, using CCTV
in a manner that ensures that crime is reduced and offenders are
brought to justice. It is therefore about ensuring that there is trust
and confidence in the systems to do what we want them
to.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000077">&#160;</a>

Government do not set targets with a numerically based approach. We
want systems that are effective and we want the public to have
confidence in how CCTV is used, so there is no underlying intention
behind the proposals necessarily to reduce the number of CCTV cameras.
It is more that we want to ensure that there is trust and confidence in
how they are applied and where they are sited, and that they have the
appropriate support from the public. It is about looking at the issue
in a broader sense, so that cameras are able to achieve the end result
that collectively we all want to

allay people’s fears, those who think that the Bill is just
about ripping down CCTV cameras can be reassured that that is not the

number of properly regulated CCTV cameras. Is that a fair

                           </strong> Certainly, we are not looking at the issue as
a numbers game; it is about trust and confidence in how CCTV systems
are applied. The hon. Gentleman will appreciate the concerns about
Project Champion. As a west midlands MP who saw the local coverage, he
will feel more acutely than other members of the Committee the impact
of that challenge. It takes only a few such cases to start to erode
overall confidence in the use of CCTV systems as a whole, which would
be damaging and harmful from a crime prevention and criminal justice
approach.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000081">&#160;</a>

that that is a sensible means of travel. It would be wrong to stop
doing that, and to say that we need yet more evidence, despite the
evidence obtained over the past few years. It is better to legislate
now to put a code of practice on the statute book, while understanding
that the issue is likely to develop. Technology and its application are
likely to require flexibility in the use of cameras, which the
Bill’s approach will achieve. The flexibility in the code of
practice—for instance, the ability to add to those who are
subject to the code—will achieve that as practice, technology
and indeed attitudes develop. To have flexibility in the Bill is
important, sensible and the right approach, given what I have said
about the desire to ensure that CCTV continues to have people’s
trust and confidence and is not seen as spying on them, but as
supporting them, giving them confidence and ensuring that we live in a

legislative impact at this stage is prescribed as it is. It is
certainly intended to have a broader application. As we stated in the
consultation document, we need ongoing analysis and assessment of how
the code is being applied. If it is not working as we intend and if it
is having the effects that the hon. Member for Gedling highlighted, the
Government will consider the matter further at that stage. The document
is not static, as we will discuss in due course when we consider the
role of the commissioner and the reports provided by the commissioner
about the adoption and use of the code. It is a moving situation, and
we want to keep it under review to see how the code

                        <p class="tabbed">Interestingly,
that seemed to be the approach of the previous Government. Perhaps they
recognised that there was an issue with surveillance, but they thought,
“Let’s put it off for another day. Let’s not do
anything. Let’s see how things carry on. Let’s have
another commission and—in essence—kick this into the long
grass again.” That approach was mistaken. We want to ensure that
CCTV benefits from continued trust and confidence. We do not want
sudden issues to start to erode that trust because there is no
mechanism to ensure that the public feel that there is a check and
balance—a framework for the system. The code of practice is
intended to provide such a framework. We are consulting on it at
present and it is important to have that
consultation.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000089">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman raises an important
question relating to the pre-planning stages of the adoption of a CCTV
system. If there is a sense that the system will be beneficial, it will
have public support. That is one of the principal points that we are
consulting on to flesh out in detail the code of practice and what it
might mean. A specific section deals with the pre-planning stages. It
deals with the assessments that might be appropriate, the safeguards
that might need to be in place, and the consultation with relevant
partners, and, indeed, the public, that may be appropriate in the
development of CCTV. We are asking about the preparatory checks and
balances that should be included. That is very much part of the
consultation, which runs until 25 May, on the code of practice itself.
It is important that we ask such questions to ensure that the code
embodies the sense of support revealed in the Ipsos MORI survey and the
support that we know is there. At the same time, it needs to address
the more critical and negative aspects, such as people thinking that
they may be spied upon, and perhaps the issues that have arisen from
Project Champion as
well.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000091">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank the Minister for his response and his
remarks. I understand that we will come on to some of the other points
that I raised. But with regard to the inquiry, the Minster is flying
blind. What is the Government’s estimate of the number of
cameras held by police and local authorities? What is their estimate of
the number of private cameras—the point made by the hon. Member
for Carshalton and Wallington—that actually move on to public
spaces? As my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich East said, what
are the Government trying to do? Do they want more or fewer cameras?
The Minister referred to the need for confidence, and I agree—of
course we need confidence. I do not disagree that there should be a
code of practice. The Minister chided me slightly and said that we
wanted to put it off for several years. I do not want to do that, but I
want legislation that is based on evidence and research. No doubt,
therefore, when we get on to some of the other points in the Bill, the
Minister will explain about the research that shows there is not a
problem and not an unintended consequence, so I shall not press the
amendment to a vote. I simply want to understand.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000093">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister’s point is that the code of practice will increase
public confidence in the use of CCTV. He will need a
baseline—the current level—in order to understand whether
the surveillance camera commissioner, who no doubt will be responsible
for monitoring it, will see a rise or a decrease in that confidence. My
amendment was tabled simply to try to start to understand the evidence
base and the research that has been taken into account.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000094">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The witnesses
raised some real issues, which we will need to consider, and the
Minister will need to explain in some detail how those issues will be
addressed. Before I withdraw the amendment, I will finish with this
point. I talked about a great strategic, totemic principle. The Bill
that we have before us makes some reasonable amendments to existing
legislation. I am not saying that this is the right way forward, but it
does not have at its core, at clause 1, part 1, the establishment of a
privacy commissioner, encompassing all the various other commissioners
that deal with this and that—for example, such a commissioner to
review the use of surveillance cameras and such a commissioner to
review the use of RIPA. A privacy commissioner would pull all of that
together. The Minister chides me for where we are and the number of
research projects, but I chide him for the number of new commissioners
he is setting up within the Bill. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000095">&#160;</a>

coming to me, saying, “Vernon, can you please make sure that you
get rid of all these CCTV systems?” I have not had one. No doubt
other Members will turn up and say that they have had one. Fine. I am
sure we have all had one. I had someone come to see me about spaceships
once. I am sure they exist, by the way. People come to see us about all
sorts of

I know that this is the Public Reading stage pilot Bill, and that the
Government’s approach is to say, “Yes, it’s a
pilot. We will ignore what the public say,” but I suspect that
that is the experience of the vast majority of Members of Parliament in
their surgeries and their communities. That is why I am astonished that
I can find nothing on that in the Bill, which is why I have tabled some
of these amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000103">&#160;</a>

Unless Government Members or my hon. Friends can tell me that I have

sometimes the images on the cameras are not as clear as they should be.

there is a huge demand for it from vast members of the public, who are
concerned about privacy. I accept that there have been one or two
examples of the inappropriate use of CCTV and ANPR, so it is not
something that is illogical or something that we should not do; it

anomalies that have arisen, but I do not want a voluntary code of

makes a difference. They know that it makes them feel safer. They know

                        <p class="tabbed">I
will not, for reasons of time, go over all the arguments. The Minister
knows that amendment 96 is included in the group, and he said that we
would return to the various issues that I have raised when discussing
amendment 93. Amendment 96 asks why the code will deal only with the
police and local authorities. Will the Minister give us more detail on
why it is only through an order-making power that the provisions of the
code may be extended to other organisations? If he thinks that it is
important to name the police and local authorities in the Bill, why
should other organisations not be named if, as the Minister said, the
clause is about maintaining confidence? I shall be interested in what
the Minister has to say on amendments 94 and 95. I will not go into
amendment 96 in any more depth because I have raised the issues when we
debated the previous group of amendments. If we are to maintain
confidence in CCTV, we must understand that the public out there see it
as an important tool in the fight against crime, antisocial behaviour
and
criminality.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000114">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Again, I do not think that there is any
particular philosophical difference between the hon. Member for Gedling
and I. If he looks at the consultation that we are undertaking on the
code of practice, he will see that we have incorporated a section on
the benefits of CCTV, which specifically mentions crime prevention and
detection, counter-terrorism and criminal justice as three significant
benefits of the use of CCTV. I do not think that there is any pointed
issue or difference; we are not suggesting otherwise, or saying that
that is not the case, or that the Government take a different view on
the important use of CCTV for those
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000115">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Where
there is a weakness, which the hon. Gentleman highlighted in the debate
that he and I had some two years ago, it is that even he was not
interested in playing the numbers game. He
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000116">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“There
could be 300 cameras or there could be three. Their effectiveness and

                        <p>That
is right, which is why when we look at the challenges on the matter,
sometimes the use of the equipment, its locations and the systems used
do not necessarily give effect to what we wish to see. That is why
clause 29 incorporates the provisions on the development of systems,
the use of images, the consideration of whether to use cameras, the
type of systems and the technical standards. It might not come as too
much of a surprise to the hon. Gentleman to hear me say that the very
point that he is seeking to raise in his amendments will be dealt with
or is implicit in the provisions contained in the Bill and the
Government’s approach on the consultation on the points that he
has highlighted.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000117">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman again flagged up the incremental approach that the Government
have taken in limiting the statutory application of the code of
practice at this point. I again point him to the comments of Andrew
Rennison, the interim CCTV regulator. We have taken soundings off him
and have listened to him on the guidance and experience that he has
applied over the period in which he has been in place, looking at the
very issues that the hon. Gentleman has sought to highlight. Andrew
Rennison came to the conclusion that that incremental approach was the
right way to achieve an effective code. In many ways, taking account of
the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and
Wallington in his earlier intervention, simply specifying groups in the
Bill does not mean that it will not have a broader application; it
will. The approach of having regulation, and setting and applying
standards, means that those standards will be applied more
broadly.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000118">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
provisions could in some ways be categorised as future-proofing,
ensuring that we look to the future and to the issues of trust and
confidence that we discussed in our last debate and which the hon.
Member for Gedling has again highlighted. Although, as is shown by what
I quoted, I agree with him that playing the numbers game is not the
most appropriate way to consider the problem, it is interesting to note
that the evidence—he had the survey at his fingertips when he
was in a position to do something about it—showed that, as I
have already mentioned, 28% of those surveyed by Ipsos MORI for the
Home Office said that there are too many CCTV cameras in their local
area, and 23% said that CCTV cameras make them feel too
watched.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000119">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman talks about evidence, but he had evidence at his
fingertips that implied there was an issue, albeit he clearly did not
feel that he wanted to action that or recognise some of those concerns
raised at that time. Even he is not suggesting that there is not an
issue requiring the application of a regulatory framework, although he
is looking for further information and we want to bring forward our
proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000120">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> By way of a question, may I make a point to the
Minister? Using market research is not necessarily a great way of
deciding what policies to implement in legislation. If the Minister is
saying that 28% of people—<em>[</em>
                           <em>Interruption.</em>
                           <em>]</em> I
am sorry, but there was a sedentary heckle that I did not hear. If the
Minister is responding to the fact that 28% of people feel concerned
about CCTV, nothing in the Bill addresses their concerns that there are
too many CCTV cameras. He has just said that he is not legislating to
reduce the number of them, so I do not understand why he clings on to
that Ipsos MORI
research.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000121">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Far from it—I am not seeking to cling
on to anything; I am merely seeking to highlight the survey undertaken
by the hon. Gentleman’s Government. They clearly felt that it
was important to do that work, because they would not have done it in
the first place if they saw no need for it. All I am saying is that my
fundamental driver is seeing that trust and confidence in the systems
is maintained and assured in the future. The survey points to concerns
about that trust and confidence driver, on which the hon. Gentleman and
I have already had an exchange in Committee. The

                           </div>only reason for my highlighting his Government’s Ipsos MORI
survey is to identify that there is a potential question or issue on
trust and confidence. That will benefit from having the code of
practice in place, which is simply the point that I am seeking to make
to the Committee. I simply underline the need for the code of practice
to give effect to that trust and confidence
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000122">&#160;</a>

this point, so if they continue I will just carry on. I fail to
understand why, if the Minister is responding to the
research—you have made a conclusion and you are saying that
there is public concern about CCTV cameras—you have no evidence
to show that just producing a new regulatory framework will reduce it.
I am sorry to use “you”, Mr Streeter; I am getting back
into the hang of it after being away for a few weeks. The conclusion
that the regulatory framework will increase trust is not based on any
evidence at all. It is merely the Minister’s belief that it will
increase trust in CCTV arrangements. Market research says that people
think there are too many cameras; that is what the Lib Dems were going
on about, and that is why we have this ridiculous piece of
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000123">&#160;</a>

used the word “ridiculous” in relation to the
legislation. I am surprised, because I know that he takes such issues
seriously. I am sorry if I have mischaracterised him in some way. I
genuinely would not want to do that because I know that he considers
the issues very carefully and seriously. We do not regard the measure
as unnecessary. We have listened carefully to the points made by a
number of people. The hon. Gentleman will know the comments of Sara
Thornton, the chief constable of Thames Valley police, in relation to
Project Champion and the disquiet that was caused around that. We have
considered feedback from the ACPO lead around CCTV, and the interim
CCTV regulator that the hon. Gentleman’s Government appointed,
so I think there is a strong prevailing sense of the need for a
regulatory framework that is then able to respond further. It is not
something that is simply set in stone. For the reasons that I have
already alluded to, the code applies a flexible approach. It can
respond to changing circumstances and address that fundamental issue of
trust and confidence, which is at the very heart of the debate that
pervades this very issue in relation to CCTV and other issues that we
will get on to.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000126">&#160;</a>

unnecessary. We believe that the whole concept and the purpose to which
CCTV is applied is intrinsic. While I recognise the seriousness he

attach to it, we do not believe his amendment is
necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000127">&#160;</a>

Minister says that the matter is included within the consultation,
which is currently going on. That may be the case, but I think this is
a hugely important issue. Any code on CCTC should have regard to the
importance of community safety and crime reduction. That was the
fundamental reason for the placing of CCTV systems in communities and
for the use of ANPR and all such systems. To have a code that does not
lay that out in primary legislation is a mistake and therefore I want

to subsection (5), which sets out the people whom the Secretary of

given that paragraph (g)

                        <p>no
doubt people covered by the amendment will be considered appropriate.
However, the Government have a mindset with respect to the clause.
Labour Members backed the amendment that referred to the prevention of
crime and the importance of ensuring community safety and said that
such matters should be included in the Bill, but that was rejected by
the
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000155">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under
amendment 97, consultation should be not only with people under
subsection (5), important though of course they are. What about the
voice of the community? Why should that not be covered by the Bill? Is
it not as important as the voices of others who operate the systems?
Those to whom the amendment refers operate systems on behalf of the
community. They believe that such systems add to confidence, prevent
crime and catch criminals. The Government consider that such people are
so important that they have to be named, but they do not believe that
representatives of community safety partnerships should be consulted
when preparing the code. They do not believe that representatives of
Neighbourhood Watch should be
consulted.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000156">&#160;</a>

thought it was their big thing. I hope that Conservative Members will
vote for the amendment. It covers localism. I say power to the

partnerships and power to other community groups that want to make
representations about such
matters.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000157">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Such
matters show the mindset of the Government. They show one side of the
argument rather than the other. Of course, such people should be
consulted—as should those to whom the amendment refers. Why do
the Government think that those listed under the clause 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 342<a class="bkMark" name="Column342">&#160;</a>
                           </div>are so important that they have to be consulted, but that
representatives of the community are not as important? In other words,
why are those who benefit from camera systems CCTV not as important as
the Association of Chief Police Officers? The Minister says that such
people will, of course, be consulted, but why are they not listed under
the
Bill?<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000160">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">By
listing those whom the code would affect under amendments 54 and 55, we
would add to the Bill people such as the victims commissioner, and
members of police and crime panels who must have regard to the code.
Why should the victims commissioner not be consulted automatically in
respect of preparing the code or how it operates? Why on earth have a
victims commissioner if we are not to ensure that a victims
commissioner is consulted on matters that are in place to prevent
people from becoming victims? I fail to understand it. As I have said,
the only reason that I can think of is that the Government see it from
the viewpoint of those who operate the systems, rather than that of
those who benefit from the systems. That is the whole point of not only
this group of amendments, but the previous group. If people were
looking at this and thinking about it, they would see it as reasonable
to say that there should be a recognition in the Bill of the importance
of the consumer of the CCTV system, rather than the producer.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000161">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As I have
said, this Bill is the pilot of the Public Reading stage. Where are the
public in the Bill? Where is the voice of the community? Where is the
voice of the victim? Where is the voice of the people who feel that
CCTV benefits them? Where is the voice of all those who come to my
surgeries demanding more CCTV? Where is the voice of those
organisations that queue up at surgeries demanding more CCTV, as the
hon. Member for Strangford and my hon. Friends the Members for Glasgow
North West and for West Bromwich East said? The frank answer to those
people is that the silence in the Bill is deafening. It is not good
enough for the Government to include it in a catch-all paragraph (g).
It should be in the Bill and given the prominence and importance that
other people are given by their
inclusion.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000162">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I certainly hear the passion with which the
hon. Gentleman has moved his amendment. He talks about the voice of the
community, but we are consulting on the code currently. This is a
public consultation. Anyone’s voice is able to be heard in it. I
encourage his constituents, and those of any member of this Committee,
to take part in the consultation, which, as I have already alluded to,
runs until 25 May. That is a 12-week consultation for the public to be
able to have precisely the say that the hon. Gentleman seeks to chide
me on, saying that the public are excluded and that all those bodies
are somehow out of the loop. They are welcome and I encourage them to
take part in the public consultation, which is already engaged. We
welcome their participation in
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000163">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
would, as a point of detail, point the hon. Gentleman to clause
29(5)(a), which reads across to clause 33 and the defined relevant
authorities, which include the Greater London Authority, local
authorities and any chief officer of a police force in England and
Wales. Together with clause 29(5)(a), it can be seen that we are
seeking to incorporate representatives of those persons’ views
within this specific part of the Bill. For the hon. Gentleman to

                           </div>say that in some way they do not count and that there is to be some sort
of exclusion of those views is wide of the
mark.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000164">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Can the Minister confirm that, while clause
33(1)—linked to clause 29(5)(a)—says that a relevant
authority must have regard to the code, under the defined relevant
authorities later in the clause, the victims commissioner is not
included?<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000165">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Obviously, the victims commissioner is not a
relevant authority, because the relevant authority relates to those
persons who are subject to the code. The hon. Gentleman was suggesting
that local authorities and police forces were not covered, that their
voice did not count and that they were left out and excluded from the
Bill. I am seeking to highlight to him that thought has been given to
this and that it is addressed in the Bill
already.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000166">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
recognise the hon. Gentleman’s passion and his desire to ensure
that there is appropriate consultation and that the parties involved
are properly brought within scope, but I gently point him to the fact
that some of the language that he used—although I understand his
reasons for using it—was a little wide of the mark. That is
particularly true when we take into account the public consultation,
which is being undertaken to ensure that the voices and views of as
many people as possible are framed in the public engagement. We very
much welcome that engagement, which is very much at the core of, and in
the formulation and development of, the code.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000167">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman will say that that does not go far enough, but the Secretary
of State can consult other people, and that is very much embodied in
the clause, which refers to the people it may be appropriate for the
Secretary of State to consult. Members of the groups that the hon.
Gentleman has identified may well be considered appropriate. There is
not some sort of ring-fencing, with only the people specified in
paragraphs (a) to (f) being consulted; there is flexibility in the Bill
to accommodate consultation.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000168">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I hear the
hon. Gentleman’s points, but I repeat that these issues have
been dealt with. Indeed, the public consultation, which is already
taking place, and which people are still very much able to contribute
to, allows people’s voices to be heard loud and clear in the
formulation of the code and in its continuing review and development.
That is intended very much to promote the confidence that we seek to
achieve in establishing it and the CCTV systems that protect us
all.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000169">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank the Minister for his reply. I note that
the Government are consulting on who should be consulted on the code,
but I am saying that the Bill is going through Parliament, and it is
incumbent on me, as the Opposition spokesperson, to say what I think
should be in it.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000170">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments 97
and 54 are important. Amendment 54 includes the victims
commissioner, whom the Minister has accepted is not included in the
scope of the Bill. That voice of the community will not be heard as
loudly as others, and that represents a mistake in the drafting of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000171">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
looking at clauses 29(5) and 33(5), the commissioner would be
astonished to find that she—the person established by the
previous Government, and accepted by this Government, as the voice of
those affected by crime, criminality or antisocial behaviour—is
not listed in the Bill in the way that other people are. At best, that
is a surprise.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000172">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If the
Government are setting out to name those they think it is important to
include in the Bill, the victims commissioner, in particular, should be
added to the list. It is not good enough for the Minister to say that
it is sufficient for the clause to allow the Secretary of State to
consult others as he or she thinks appropriate. That is particularly
true with respect to the victims commissioner.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000173">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I would
therefore like to test the Committee’s views in separate votes
on amendments 97 and 54. As amendment 54 relates to the
clause, we do not have to wait until later to get it out of the
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000174">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I say this
because I do not have an ego about these things: I need the Minister to
help me. I have tabled the amendment because I do not understand the
meaning of clause 29(6)(b) and I think that the Committee needs the
Minister to explain why it is appropriate. Subsection (6)
describes what “surveillance camera systems” means.
Clearly, it means CCTV or ANPR, as described in subsection (6)(a), but
I do not understand subsection (6)(b), and neither does the Information
Commissioner, who thinks that there is a problem with it. Under
subsection (6)(b), surveillance camera systems means<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000219">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        <p class="tabbed">My
amendment would simply leave out “of objects or events”.
Why are those words included? Does that measure include the processing
of views? I do not understand the definition—is a person an
object or an event? I want the Minister to explain what it means. I
understand that CCTV and ANPR are surveillance camera systems, but what
is meant by “any other systems”? Are such other systems
precluded from doing anything that processes personal information? The
Information Commissioner asked if that includes the processing of views
and images of individuals, and if not, why not?<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000220">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The amendment
is probing, because as the Committee can see, instead of being my usual
lucid, eloquent, dynamic self, with full cognisance of all the facts, I
am struggling. I am sure that the Minister will come forward with a
perfectly reasonable explanation, but it does not make sense to me, and
it clearly worries the Information Commissioner. We need detailed
clarification of what the clause means.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000221">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> As the hon. Gentleman will know from our
discussions of previous Bills and in other circumstances, Bills are
sometimes drafted in language that provides as broad a definition as
possible in order to encompass relevant facts and matters. As he will
recognise, provisions are often drawn in to ensure certain things. In
this case, for example, we are seeking to define the term
“surveillance camera system”. If it could be interpreted
as either a CCTV or ANPR recognition system, that might be too narrow a
definition, so the provision seeks to provide a definition of systems
for recording or viewing visual images or objects or events for
surveillance purposes. It provides a broader definition to ensure that
we cover what we need to cover.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000222">&#160;</a>

the hon. Gentleman knows, I am a lawyer, so I take the Bill’s
wordsmithing as seriously as he does. I am happy to consider further
whether the words that he seeks to delete, “objects or
events”, add to the understanding of the paragraph. I am

covered by paragraph (a) as a closed circuit television system. It
appears from my reading of the Bill, although I will bow to more
detailed knowledge of legal drafting, that such a system would be
captured by either paragraph (a) or paragraph (b), although the matter
would need to be analysed. It is a system for recording or viewing
visual images of people, so there is nothing in my reading of the Bill
to suggest that it would not be caught by the definition of a
surveillance camera system in subsection (6). I hope that is
helpful.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000225">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
definition is intended to ensure that the Bill captures surveillance
camera systems properly, so it is important that we get it right, given
the application of the term elsewhere. As I said, the hon. Member for
Gedling highlighted that he wants clarification to ensure that the
people who are likely to be surveilled are properly reflected in the
drafting of the provision. I will certainly consider closely the point
that he highlighted. I thank him for the manner in which he has brought
it to the Committee’s attention, and I will certainly give it
some consideration to ensure that it properly achieves our intention.
The advice that I have been given suggests that it does, but at the
same time the whole purpose of the Committee is to test, challenge and
scrutinise, and therefore I welcome the challenge that the hon.
Gentleman has thrown down. I want to carefully and calmly reflect on
his comments, and the comments of others, to ensure that the measure
works in the way that the Committee and I wish it to, so that the Bill
operates in the way

tabled it because of something that the Information Commissioner
raised. I did not properly understand it. Some of it is very technical.
As the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington said, when we start
talking about “any other systems”, what that actually
means starts to become difficult. Then we start talking about objects
or events and thinking, “What does that include or
exclude?” The Minister’s offer to go back and see whether
there needs to be further clarification, and whether the drafting is
correct, is very helpful, so I am happy to withdraw the amendment. I

want the Minister to explain subsection (7), which mentions
a draft that would be treated as a hybrid instrument for the purposes
of the Standing Orders. I do not remember being on a Committee where a
hybrid instrument has been used. According to the explanatory notes, it
relates to where one section or group of individuals is
disproportionately impacted upon compared with another group, and it is
required not by the House of Commons but by the House of
Lords.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000230">&#160;</a>

hybrid instrument has been mentioned. I have been in the House since

statutory instruments which need to be approved by both Houses are
ruled to be hybrid instruments because they affect some members of a
group (be it individuals or bodies) more than others in the same group.
Hybrid instruments are subject to a special procedure which gives those
who are especially affected by them the opportunity to present their
arguments against the statutory instrument to the Hybrid Instruments
Committee and then, possibly, to a Select Committee charged with
reporting on its

agree with the hon. Gentleman. In the shorter time that I have been in

clause is intended to give clarity and, in essence, to disapply the
procedures or arguments that might otherwise apply in relation to
hybridity, because it might, for example, be argued that the rules on
hybridity were engaged. This is a technical issue, and the clause
perhaps gives clarity and assurance. If the hon. Gentleman or others
have concerns about the exclusion of the hybridity provisions in
relation to this aspect of the Bill, we will no doubt hear more about
that on Report or subsequent stages.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000234">&#160;</a>

speculate about situations where a draft order could have been ruled to
be a hybrid instrument, but it seems likely, if there are issues, that
affected groups could air their views as part of the consultation
process attending the preparation of the code of practice. In other
words, we are consulting, and if there are concerns about hybridity,
that will no doubt come out in the public consultation. However, I am
not aware of any specific concerns having been highlighted. It may well
be that this is a technical, legal, narrow issue and that subsection
(7) is set out in the way that it is to give clarity and to remove any
doubt or any question.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000235">&#160;</a>

shakes of the head, it appears that different members of the Committee

hybridity and some have not. However, it would be interesting to know
which groups, in the Government’s assessment, will be affected
differently. Is it that the police and local authorities will be
affected, but not others who run cameras? Is that the issue? Which
groups would be affected in different ways, requiring the hybridity
principle to be applied? If the Minister does not have that information
to hand, it would be of interest to know how different groups would be

go back to some of the debate that we had earlier. The amendments do
different things, but in both we are simply asking the Minister to
explain why it is not necessary for the code of practice to be
mandatory. Could the Government make it mandatory in the future, should
they choose to do so? Is there are power in the Bill to change it? I do
not think there is, but can the Minister confirm that although the code
is not mandatory, there is no order-making power to make it mandatory?
I cannot find one, but I do not know whether one is tucked away in
clause 96(4) or somewhere
else.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000242">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If
there is no order-making power, what will the Minister do if the belief
that a voluntary code will work is wrong? In other words, if there is
no order-making power to make the code mandatory, and an incremental,
step-by-step, voluntary approach does not work, what is the
Government’s thinking on how they will take things forward? I
agree that most public bodies, local authorities and police forces will
aspire to the highest possible standards, but if the code is only
voluntary, what will happen if a Birmingham-type example comes forward?
Would people not be surprised if there was nothing that the Government
could use to say that the code is there? During the Public Reading
stage, the public said that the code of practice will be toothless. The
Government reject that view, but that is not what the public feel about
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000243">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As
I have said to the Minister, I am in favour of a code of practice, but
what is the point of a purely voluntary code? There is no way in which
the Government, without coming back to primary legislation, will be
able to say, “This has not worked in the way that we thought it
would. What do we do about it?” Will exhortation and a belief
that everyone will rise to the highest possible

                           </div>standards work of themselves? With the amendments, I am asking the
Government to flesh out for us again their view on why it is not
necessary to include in the Bill an order-making power to make the code
mandatory, should it not work in the way that the Minister thinks is
appropriate. I will be interested in his

                           </strong> I think the hon. Gentleman will recognise the
approach on the clause and the code of practice. The bodies that have
been caught by the clause—local authorities and the
police—have to have regard to the code of practice, and the Bill
provides flexibility to expand that requirement to other groups. As I
have explained in previous debates on the clause, the approach will be
informed by the reports of the surveillance camera commissioner on how
the code is working and being applied. That will provide a helpful and
important mechanism to assess whether the code is having the intended
impact and whether trust and confidence, which we have discussed
previously, are at the core of the matter.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000245">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If we
reserved an order-making power to turn a provision to “have
regard to” into a mandatory requirement, we would fundamentally
change the intent of the legislation. It would be incumbent on the
Government to return to Parliament at that stage to change the intent
in that way, given that one would be fundamentally altering the nature
and structure of the legislation and meriting the turning of the
current structure of the code as embodied in the Bill into a mandatory
requirement. There are elements—I know that the hon. Gentleman
and other members of the Committee will understand this in relation to,
for example, the Data Protection Act—that are already mandatory
and which already have sanctions and specific requirements attached. If
breached, they will lead to significant and serious consequences. The
nature of what we are addressing here means that some issues that
relate to CCTV cameras already have mandatory requirements. That is
part and parcel of the provisions in the Data Protection Act, which
governs and addresses some of the points that are at issue
here.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000246">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment is simple—it aims to include schools in the list of
relevant authorities that are covered by the surveillance camera code.
I propose the measure because I want to be helpful to the Government. I
support the direction of travel in providing protection of freedoms for
our children. Children in a school environment should be afforded the
same protections that they and their parents receive outside it. An
increasing body of evidence shows that schools inadvertently contravene
the Data Protection Act, because they are unsure how it applies to
them. CCTV cameras are ubiquitous in Britain’s
schools—some 85% of schools now have them.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000252">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The amendment
aims to test how far the Government want to make real their stated aims
of trying to protect children. I readily admit that I am probably
ploughing my own furrow on this matter, but I do not think that there
is much evidence to show that CCTV in schools increases safeguarding. I
am not sure whether it makes schools more efficient or drives down
costs; I am certain of one thing—it reduces privacy, and we
should have regard to that in our discussions.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000253">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The proposal
is a neat way of ensuring that head teachers respect the code and do
the right thing by the intention of the legislation. It cannot be right
that one in 10 kids’ toilets have unregulated CCTV. That does
not feel right to me—we would not want that in the House of
Commons; I do not want it in my kids’ schools. That is why I
have tabled the amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000254">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My hon. Friend’s amendment is interesting.
Perhaps the Minister can reassure him by considering the proposal to
see whether people in education should be covered on the face of the
Bill or under subsection (5)(k).<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000255">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The code is
voluntary and the measure seeks only to ensure that schools have regard
to it; it does not state that they cannot use it, but that they should
consider its use in certain circumstances. That is why, in general, I
have always supported the introduction of a code and why we are not
opposing it. Requiring people to have regard to a code is an important
step forward. No doubt Committee members can think of other
organisations or bodies that should be included under “relevant
authority”.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000256">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">To
be fair, the Government are in a cleft stick, because as soon as we
start listing, people say, “Why haven’t you listed
<em>x</em>?” as, indeed, I have on occasion. I have sat where the
Minister is sitting and said, “We can’t list everyone,
and that’s why we have put in a section that says that we can
add anyone we feel is appropriate.” The point that my hon.
Friend the Member for West Bromwich East is making, and no doubt others
could make, about bodies that should be relevant authorities is:
which

                           </div>bodies are so important that we should not leave the decision to the
discretion of the Secretary of State but include them in the Bill? My
hon. Friend has some justification for considering, along with my hon.
Friend the Member for Glasgow North West, that this body is of such
importance that the Government should look at including it in the Bill.
His comment is powerful, and the Government should at the very least
consider including this body, perhaps along with others to which other
Members can
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000257">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> What kind of discussions has the Minister had
with the Department for Education on the issue? I do not have a problem
with CCTV, as the Minister knows, but I have a great problem with CCTV
intruding on a young person who is just going to the toilet. There is
something rather nasty about anyone wanting to put a TV camera in a
young child’s toilet; there has to be a bit more meat on the
bones. There are rules in our Education Acts to protect children, but
here that aspect is completely and utterly ignored and the Minister
must look at it. Education is important, and we have to protect our
children and not expose them to things that might fall into the wrong
hands.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000258">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank hon. Members for the way in which
they have sought to highlight the point. As a father with young kids at
school, I have sensitivities about the effective and appropriate use of
CCTV systems in the safeguarding of children, and recognise the
concerns that have been genuinely expressed in this short
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000259">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A
challenge here is that we are talking about private and public
schools—there are different sorts of environments. At the same
time as wanting to ensure that CCTV systems are used appropriately, we
do not want to become too prescriptive and undermine the very intent
behind the systems. The comment made by the hon. Member for West
Bromwich East about the Data Protection Act was germane. That is a
legal provision with teeth, with mandatory requirements attached.
Perhaps there is a lack of understanding of that Act’s
application and of how the sense of proportionality is applied. There
are, however, complexities attached, which is why we have not sought to
include schools and colleges within the ambit of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000260">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
are in the midst of the public consultation, and I would like to see
how that reports back on the code of practice and on the groups that
may be encompassed within the application of the code. Aside from the
reasons we have already debated under some of the Bill’s other
provisions, even if a particular group or organisation were not
formally prescribed in the Bill at this stage, we would intend the
provision to have a broader application than those groups. It may well
be that local authorities themselves, being directly caught, might wish
to examine the application of the code in relation to schools and other
environments. The issue is clearly emotive. The mix of educational and
community activities for which school premises can be used is complex.
The issue needs to be considered with great care to ensure safety,
security and propriety. I do not want to act rashly now; I prefer to
see what the consultation reports back, although I hear clearly the
points raised in Committee this morning. I am sure that the question of
how the code will apply in the future will be returned to and examined
further.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000261">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The Bill
envisages that the code can be extended to other regulated bodies, and
there is flexibility to do so through the order-making power. That may
allow the addition of schools or colleges, if that is considered
appropriate, but the complexities of the issue require further careful
thought to ensure that we do not create unnecessary burdens or misapply
the sense of the provision. Fair points have been made in this
mini-debate, and we will need to consider them carefully as part of the
consultation. I want to see what the consultation reports back before
considering what further steps or actions are
required.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000262">&#160;</a>

the opportunity to add to the list of relevant authorities that must
have regard to the surveillance camera code. My hon. Friend the Member
for West Bromwich East has already given the example of schools,
although we feel that that should be included in the Bill. Will the
Minister give us other examples of how the list might be extended?
Presumably, the Secretary of State will have the power under the
auspices of the clause to include all the cameras that are not
currently police or local authority ones. Will the Minister confirm
that?<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000268">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Will
the Minister explain to the Committee how subsection (5) relates to
subsection (6)? Do they mean that people can be a relevant authority
for some of the things they do but not for others, so that they are a
relevant authority not because of the nature of what or whom they are
but only for specific functions that they perform as a relevant
authority? For example, private detectives would not be relevant
authorities for what they do, but if they operated a surveillance
camera they would be a relevant authority for that purpose.
Subsection (6) seems to imply that the functions of a
relevant authority can be split, and that such an authority has to have
regard to the surveillance camera code in relation only to some rather
than all of its functions. Will the Minister clarify that and explain
how it will work? If I have read the Bill correctly and that is so, how
will the surveillance camera commissioner or whoever is responsible for
the code know what is going on with respect to a relevant authority?
How will that happen? Subsection (5)(k) gives a large power to the
Secretary of State, but I shall be interested in the Minister’s
explanation of how subsection (6) relates to subsection
(5).<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000269">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> On that specific point, the drafting is
intended to cover circumstances when certain bodies may have dual or
multiple roles; for example, they have both public functions and
private sector functions, and the duty to have regard to the code may
therefore be limited to the exercise of one or one part of their
functions. I suppose that it is a flexibility-type provision rather
than something that would provide a splitting of the roles of public
bodies in some way; it is more for where dual roles might
exist.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000270">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman highlighted an issue about the extension to other public
bodies perhaps being added in due course and asked what we might have
in mind. We clearly specified under the Bill local authorities and the
police in relation to the initial approach. Although we will be guided
by public consultation, we will also be guided by the reports of the
surveillance camera commissioner in respect of future applications. An
example has been proffered this morning by a member of the Committee of
something that might be considered part of the ongoing review, but we
do not have anything in mind in terms of extending the application of
the code at this time. We will certainly be informed by the
practicalities and by how we see matters
developing.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000271">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
desire is very much that the code is seen as a means of informing good
practice to ensure that we drive up standards and that we give effect
to the system’s retaining public trust and confidence.
Therefore, the provision obviously extends further than the police and
local authorities, although for private sector companies we see a
voluntary type of approach. I want the code developed in such a way
that it becomes a useful, positive document to which people want to
give effect because of the manner in which it has been drawn up,
embracing the standards and explaining some of the complexities that
might exist in some of the interpretive points of, for example, the
Data Protection
Act.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000272">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not envisage the code being set in stone but as something that will
develop in time, informed by developments in technology. I do not think
that any member of the Committee could second-guess what such
technology may lead to in two, three, four or five years’ time.
Having a flexible approach is important so that we can move with the
change in technology and is the reason why the Bill has been framed as
it has. The Government will keep the matter under review, but I hope
that Members will be minded to ensure that the clause stands part of
the

amendment is fairly straightforward. The confirmatory practice is quite
good. Should the surveillance camera commissioner be established under
the Bill—as

our proposal, before being appointed, the candidate would give evidence
to the Home Affairs Committee about the use of surveillance camera
systems. The candidate should have the opportunity to explain their
thoughts and views, and state how they see the Bill operating and how
they see the relationship between the Information Commissioner and the
surveillance camera commissioner, which we will come to in the next
group of amendments. They should explain how victims will be given the
voice that they deserve, and all those sorts of things. It is a
straightforward probing amendment to ask whether the Government see any
merit in the proposal.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000277">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I would like
to see such an approach taken across a range of public appointments; as
we know, there have been one or two examples. Before being made chief
inspector of Her Majesty’s inspectorate of constabulary, Sir
Denis O’Connor gave evidence to the Home Affairs Committee.
Those are steps in the right direction, and the amendment seeks to ask
the Government whether they see any merit in asking the surveillance
camera commissioner to do the same thing.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000278">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> At the heart of what the hon. Gentleman seeks
to achieve is ensuring that the surveillance camera commissioner has
the right qualities. We have made clear our intention to combine the
new role of surveillance camera commissioner with that of the existing
forensic science regulator. The existing regulator, Andrew Rennison,
gave evidence to the Committee. He was appointed by the previous
Government as the interim CCTV regulator, and he has a considerable
amount of grounding and knowledge in the area. I have asked him to stay
in that role pending the passage of the legislation, so as to provide
continuity. He has already established a wide range of contacts with
interested parties, and those will prove helpful in his new role of
promoting and monitoring the new code of practice.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000279">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As the hon.
Gentleman suggested, he raises a broader point, and the role that
Select Committees should play in the process of public appointments is
an issue that we should consider in the round. The coalition agreement
stated that it will strengthen the powers of Select Committees to
scrutinise major public appointments, and the Cabinet Office is
currently working with the Liaison Committee to deliver that
commitment. When the Public Administration Committee considered
pre-appointment hearings in 2007-08, it took the view that we should
expect them to apply to major auditors, ombudsmen, regulators and
inspectors, as well as to those responsible for the appointment system.
Others who have looked at the issue, such as the Institute for
Government in its March 2011 report on the right role for Parliament in
public appointments, have taken a broadly similar
view.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000280">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
surveillance camera commissioner does not necessarily fit strictly
within those criteria, given that the role will largely be one of
monitoring and reporting. The Cabinet Office and the Liaison Committee
will review the existing criteria and the list of posts subject to
pre-appointment hearings, and I do not want to pre-empt the outcome of
that work. That is not to say that the Home Affairs Committee should
not take an interest in the work of the commissioner once appointed,
including taking evidence from him or her as the role develops. At this
stage I am not persuaded that a 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 355<a class="bkMark" name="Column355">&#160;</a>
                           </div>pre-appointment hearing is appropriate, and I would like to see the
results of the work done by the Cabinet Office and the Liaison
Committee before considering the issue further. With that reassurance,
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be minded to withdraw his
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000281">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I will withdraw the amendment. It relates to a
broader point; the practice of confirmation and giving Parliament a
wider remit to consider who is appropriate for a particular job, rather
than just the Secretary of State—whoever that may
be—would be an important improvement to our processes. I
mentioned the surveillance camera commissioner because that is the
subject of the legislation, but there is a broader point and as the
Minister said, the Government are looking at the matter and there is a
Cabinet Office report. Hopefully that report will be produced speedily,

they go to the heart of one of the tensions in the Bill, which is the
role of the Information Commissioner vis-à-vis the surveillance
camera commissioner. The Government say that will not be a problem and
that they will work together, but there will be two codes of practice.
Once it is up and running, the surveillance camera code will be
monitored by the surveillance camera commissioner. Alongside that,
there will be the Information Commissioner, who has published a code
for surveillance camera systems. The Information Commissioner’s
code is legally enforceable through the Data Protection Act and the
legal sanctions within it. If that is wrong, the Minister will be able
to correct
me.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000287">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
82 and 83 seek an understanding about who is responsible for the
processing of personal information as it relates to the surveillance
camera code. The situation is quite confusing. Amendment 82
specifically mentions personal information that “relates to the
code”. If it was a general reference to personal information,
everyone would be able to say that it relates to the Information
Commissioner. Is it the case that if personal information relates to
the code, it would relate to the surveillance camera commissioner? We

                           </div>need some clarity about that. Does the Minister intend that the two
codes of practice will continue, or does he hope that they will
merge?<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000288">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">How
will personal information collected by surveillance camera systems be
processed? Who will be responsible for collecting it? Who will be
responsible for monitoring it? Will the surveillance camera
commissioner have to pass on personal information, collected as it
relates to the code, to the Information Commissioner, or does the
surveillance camera commissioner say, “This is to do with the
Data Protection Act, and it is, therefore, nothing to do with
me”? I do not properly understand how the two systems relate to
each other. How will people operating the CCTV system, who must have
regard to the code, know whether the part of the code that they must
have regard to is the code as it relates to the surveillance camera
commissioner or as it relates to the Information
Commissioner?<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000289">&#160;</a>

large number of witnesses—not just the Information
Commissioner—have told us that there is a real danger of
confusion between the role of the surveillance camera commissioner and
that of the Information Commissioner. I do not properly understand how
the system will work, how it will be monitored and policed and who will
be ultimately responsible. I do not know how people are supposed to
understand it. It would helpful to the Committee and to those who read
these proceedings for the Minister to lay out in detail the different
responsibilities of the Information Commissioner and the surveillance
camera commissioner and how they will be reflected in the way that the
code of practice will actually
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000290">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman highlights an important
point about the relationship between the surveillance camera
commissioner and the Information Commissioner. Nothing in the new
surveillance camera commissioner’s role will interfere with the
current role and responsibility of the Information Commissioner. We
expect the two commissioners to work together harmoniously and closely,
dealing appropriately with CCTV matters. The hon. Gentleman will know
from their evidence that the Information Commissioner and the interim
CCTV regulator already work closely together, and that they have an
understanding about the remit of their work. We see no reason for there
to be conflict between their future roles.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000291">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
surveillance camera commissioner will oversee and monitor the code,
encourage the compliance of CCTV operators, reveal the code’s
effectiveness and impact, and provide advice on it to users, the public
or the Government, as requested or as necessary. He will also act as a
conduit to the Information Commissioner on data protection. If a matter
referred to him is clearly a data protection issue, it will be referred
to the Information Commissioner. As I said, the Information
Commissioner will continue to have primacy on data protection, and the
surveillance camera commissioner will have primacy when dealing with
the more practical and technical questions.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000292">&#160;</a>

clarity and distinction of their respective roles, albeit that a
gateway mechanism between the commissioners will be needed to ensure
that they are applied appropriately. Evidence to the Committee and what
I have been told in private discussions give me every confidence that
it will be an effective means of operating the code of practice, as
envisaged under the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000293">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman highlighted the question of whether there should be two codes
or one. I seek to clarify the matter. The provisions of the Data
Protection Act are legally enforceable, but although it gives guidance
on particular aspects of the Act the CCTV code issued by the
Information Commissioner is not a legally enforceable document. In that
narrow way, it is the Act that is legally enforceable; the Information
Commissioner therefore has the responsibility to ensure that the code
is legally applied and enforced. I understand the point being made by
the hon. Gentleman about the CCTV code of practice as previously
published by the Information Commissioner. However, it is not the code
that is legally enforceable but the Act under which it seeks to give
guidance.<a class="bkMark" name="11042623000294">&#160;</a>

question of whether we need one code or two; in other words, whether
the Information Commissioner should retain his separate data-protection
focused code, or whether it would be better to have a single code of
practice as envisaged under the framework mechanism of the Bill. I am
considering the matter carefully. The question was flagged up in the
public consultation, and I want to hear people’s thoughts on the
most effective and sensible way forward. It is a question of ensuring
clarity and certainty, and having things in one place

information on standards and the potential data protection aspects
embodied in one code of practice. However, I shall listen to the views
