<P>
Amendment moved [this day]: No. 866 in page 189, line 2, leave out sub-paragraph (1).-[Mr. Jenkin.]

<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we may discuss amendment No. 867 in page 189, line 9, at end add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`provided that the Authority has not at the time of such direction committed itself to expenditure for which that amount is needed and does not need such amount within the foreseeable future to perform its functions and exercise its powers under the strategies of the Authority in place at the time of the direction.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Bernard Jenkin </B>(North Essex): I was pointing out that amendment No. 866 is a blanket right to the Treasury to claw back whatever sums it so desires from the Strategic Rail Authority. Paragraph 11(2) of schedule 13 describes how the Secretary of State can require the authority to give up any surplus, whether on a capital or revenue account, to the Treasury without any by your leave. Our amendment No. 867 proposes that the words should be added
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Provided that the Authority has not at the time of such direction committed itself to expenditure for which that amount is needed and does not need such amount within the foreseeable future to perform its functions and exercise its powers under the strategies of the Authority in place at the time of the direction.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The purpose of the amendments is to provide that all-lacking stability in the funding arrangements of the Strategic Rail Authority. Otherwise, as we have been pointing out on previous amendments, the Strategic Rail Authority simply becomes the mouthpiece of the Treasury rather than the voice of the industry and it will not be able to perform the long-term financing role that is clearly envisaged in the Bill.

<P>
<B>The Minister for Housing and Planning (Mr. Nick Raynsford):</B> The provisions of paragraph 11 of schedule 13 have to be put in context. The key point here is that we are giving the SRA freedom that the franchising director does not currently enjoy. Whereas the franchising director's franchise receipts flow immediately into the consolidated fund, this will not be the case with the SRA. The SRA will benefit from those receipts from the franchised periods. However, we are not living in a fantasy world. We must recognise that the SRA is a state-backed body within the framework of public sector funding, so it is necessary to retain a degree of financial control under our more flexible framework for retaining receipts. This provision of paragraph 11(1), which the Opposition want to delete, allows the Government to specify that an amount equal to the whole or part of any receipt may be clawed back, in the words of the hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin). He has achieved some wisdom in the lunch break. In the last moments of this morning's sitting, he described that claw-back as something that we could do without having to give a reason. When he presented it in the early part of this sitting I was delighted that the ``without having to give a reason'' was dropped from his speech. He has clearly recognised that under sub-paragraph (3) of paragraph 11
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State shall consult the Authority before giving a direction<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
so the obligation to consult and give reason is clearly there.

<P>
I assume that there is no fundamental problem with sub-paragraph (2) because the Opposition seek only to amend rather than to delete it. However, their amendment is somewhat naïve because they suggest that the claw-back in this case cannot apply if the SRA has committed itself to certain expenditure. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman knows only too well that if bodies think that money may be taken off them, they will be only too tempted to incur expenditure if they know that that provision is there so the amendment is perhaps not the best way to achieve his desired effect.

<P>
<B>Mr. Owen Paterson </B>(North Shropshire): I should like to ask a similar question to that I asked when we discussed a previous amendment to see what response I receive from a different Minister. Let us suppose that money had been lent to a private organisation that was rebuilding New Street station and that the Secretary of State was not content either with the progress of the work or the manner in which the Strategic Rail Authority lent the money. Would that be grounds for clawing it back?

<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> If the hon Gentleman reads the provision, he will realise that it does not relate to particular works. It relates to receipts that, under paragraph 11(1), the SRA may receive, which will generally be premiums on franchises or, secondly, under paragraph 11(2), surpluses at the end of a particular period. The SRA will not need to hold significant cash reserves and there is no reason why it should do so. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not suggesting that there is some great merit in an organisation holding substantial reserves when it will have no need for them because it is not prudent financial management. I see that the hon. Gentleman is nodding, so he probably agrees.

<P>
Within the more relaxed framework that we have permitted under which the receipts will flow to the SRA rather than directly into the consolidated fund, there will be a discipline that will enable the Government, if appropriate, to claw back either part of the receipts or part of the surplus at the end of the financial year. The provision is a serviceable and pragmatic response to the changed financial framework and I hope that Conservative Members will recognise that and withdraw their amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am satisfied with the Minister's response, but not for the reasons for which he may hope. In fact, he has just proved my point. To claim that 
<P>
 the precedent has been set because the franchising director does not keep the funds makes the point that the SRA is likely to be little more than a superannuated franchising director and that it is not to be the great strategic authority that the Minister imagined it to be. We have demonstrated that it is to be much more of a creature of the Secretary of State than of the industry. That underlines the dangers of proceeding with the structure of the authority as set out in the Bill. Having proved my point, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Keith Hill):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1004 in page 189, line 21, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Financial framework<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>-(1) The Secretary of State shall prepare, and may from time to time revise, a document to be known as the Authority's financial framework.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(2) The Authority's financial framework shall specify rules and principles according to which the Authority is to exercise its function in relation to-<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) financial matters, and

<P>
(b) matters relating to its employees.
<P>
(3) The Authority shall not exercise any of its functions in a manner which is inconsistent with the Authority's financial framework.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(4) A transaction entered into by the Authority is not invalidated merely by reason of a contravention by the Authority of sub-paragraph (3); and this sub-paragraph applies whether or not any person who entered into the transaction with the Authority enquired whether the Authority was acting in contravention of that sub-paragraph.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment Nos. 1005 and 1007.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Amendment No. 1004 requires the Secretary of State to prepare, and gives him the power to revise as needed, a framework document specifying the rules and principles within which the authority is to exercise its functions in relation to financial and employee matters. The authority must exercise its functions consistently with that framework.

<P>
The authority will be a non-departmental public body and, traditionally, certain matters such as pay and staff pensions have required the consent of the Secretary of State in respect of non-departmental public bodies. In addition to such statutory provisions, an NDPB's financial conduct is usually regulated by means of an administrative financial memorandum agreed with its parent Department. In practice, many such domestic issues are governed by an arrangement that transactions with certain parameters will be acceptable and have the Secretary of State's consent.

<P>
Rather than put certain consent requirements into the Bill and then set parameters administratively, the amendment reflects more accurately the system that will apply in practice. It makes plain that the authority will have a good deal of operational discretion on staffing and financial matters, but within the overall framework of public sector controls.

<P>
Amendment No. 1005 provides that the SRA is not to comply with any direction or have regard to any guidance from Scottish Ministers to the extent that to do so would be inconsistent with the financial framework issued by the Secretary of State. Amendment No. 1107 provides that the SRA is not to give effect to any instructions or guidance given to it by the Greater London Authority if, or to the extent that, implementing them would prevent or seriously hinder the SRA from complying with the financial framework issued by the Secretary of State.

<P>
The financial framework will deal with domestic matters such as SRA pay and pensions, and procurement. Scottish Ministers and the Greater London Authority do not have an interest in such housekeeping issues, and it is right that the framework control should not be displaced by directions and guidance from them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Why is it necessary for the Secretary of State to lay down a financial framework in that way? He obviously did not think that it was until late in the day or we would not be dealing with it in an amendment, the drafting of which makes me smell a rat. For a reason that I hope that the Under-Secretary will explain, the Government had obviously decided that they needed a financial framework, but then found that laying one down might invalidate a large number of actions that the SRA might like to take. They have therefore tabled the amendment. It would add proposed new sub-paragraph (3), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Authority shall not exercise any of its functions in a manner which is inconsistent with the Authority's financial framework.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It thereby puts everything else outside the law. However, proposed new sub-paragraph (4) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A transaction entered into by the Authority is not invalidated merely by reason of a contravention by the Authority of sub-paragraph (3); and this sub-pargraph applies whether or not any person who entered into the transaction with the Authority enquired whether the Authority was acting in contravention of that sub-paragraph.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
One wonders what sort of mess the Government have knotted themselves into with the amendment. Is the financial framework intended to restrict the activities of the SRA? If so, why has that restriction been invalidated with proposed new sub-paragraph (4)?

<P>
We need to know why such a financial framework is necessary. Sir Alastair Morton has been appointed to chair the SRA and, presumably, Mr. Grant has been re-appointed as its chief executive. Perhaps the Treasury decided that it wanted Ministers to be able to write a financial framework to control the SRA's activities. There have been enough difficulties trying to organise public-private partnerships without an arm's-length organisation organising off balance sheet public-private partnerships on its own account. I may have suddenly seen that the SRA will be a difficult entity for the Treasury to control, but I thought that that was its point. However, Ministers are to have the ultimate say over the SRA's activities once again.

<P>
The Under-Secretary made a point about Scotland. An amendment to clause 183 deals with devolution issues, but I would be grateful it he would run through his argument as I did not quite grasp its implications.

<P>

<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): In the amendment, proposed new sub-paragraph (1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State shall prepare, and may from time to time revise, a document to be known as the Authority's financial framework.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Much rail investment is long term, so no doubt the authority will want to make certain guarantees in terms of investment. Are we talking about months or years? Would ``time to time'' be annual or every five years? It is an open phrase and the Secretary of State may be tempted to meddle on a short-term basis, rather than intervening on the long-term basis that would be best for the authority.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> First, I shall deal with the question asked by the hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms). There may be a misconception. He mentioned rail investment, but the amendment is not about that. It is about housekeeping matters within the SRA, and issues such as pay, pensions and procurement, so the framework will apply not to the external functions of the SRA, but rather to its domestic arrangements. I hope that that helps the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Subparagraph (2) says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Authority's financial framework shall specify rules and principles according to which the Authority is to exercise its functions in relation to-<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) financial matters
<P>
It states not ``housekeeping matters'' or ``internal administration'' but ``financial matters''. I presume that that is to do with the deployment of the considerable resources that the SRA is intended to have at its disposal. If it is not intended to cover those matters, surely this is a deficient amendment and the Minister should withdraw it and bring it back in another place.

<P>
</UL></FONT><H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Despite the hon. Gentleman's expostulations on ``financial matters'', I have made clear to what the amendment applies. It is essentially a domestic and housekeeping amendment. Why table it? Because we felt that the financial framework could be covered by directions. It is not clear that directions can extent this far because they are linked to functions of the SRA and this is housekeeping. Hence the amendment and hence the financial framework has the same effect as a direction.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman asks why we should have a framework. The answer is to have appropriate control over a public body while allowing it sufficient freedom to act. He asks why that is necessary. On staff pensions, for example, it is necessary to exercise control because the SRA's employer liability for pensions is met directly from the public purse. This is not expected to be an annual, but rather an infrequent matter for review.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman raised the spectre of Sir Alastair Morton and the Government's attitude towards him. The Government have implicit confidence in him. The point about the amendment is that it is traditional for sponsoring Departments to regulate NDPBs. The amendment provides for control of the macro rather than the micro level. It is entirely consistent with how sponsorship of all NDPBs works in practice. I hope that those replies satisfy the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about Scottish Ministers. He said that he had not wholly grasped that aspect of the amendment. Amendment No. 1004 is intended to make it clear that the Secretary of State can give clear instructions to the authority about general housekeeping matters. Domestic matters such as pay for SRA staff are properly matters for the Secretary of State to control at the framework level so that they remain within public sector norms. Given the nature of this control, it should not be displaced by any directions and guidance from Scottish Ministers or the London mayor. These external bodies do not have an interest in housekeeping issues that should be dealt with at a Great Britain-wide level. The framework document is accordingly treated in the same way as Secretary of State directions.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 868, in page 190, line 2, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`except as a user of public transport or if he has been appointed a member of the Authority in order to represent a particular group, or because of his experience in a particular field, to which the matter in question relates.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient the following amendments: No. 869, in page 190, line 6, after ``interested'', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`other than as a user of public transport.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 870, in page 190, line 24, leave out sub-paragraphs (5), (6) and (7).

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I shall be relatively brief as this seems to be a case of sloppy drafting. If one looks at paragraph 16 at the bottom of page 189 everything seems to make sense. It is a statement of who is authorised to act under the authority of the SRA. Yet things seem to go off the rails on the next page, as sub-paragraph (2) seems to be an all-encompassing blanket ban on virtually anyone. it reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A person may not act in relation to any matter delegated under sub-paragraph (1)(a) if in any way directly or indirectly interested in it.<P>
</UL></FONT>
 <P>
That has probably been drafted in great haste and without the consequences being thought through. Any lawyer trying to be tiresome could pick off virtually any member of the British population. Despite the rather churlish comments from the Ministers this morning about the progress that has been made, we have 1 billion passenger journeys a year and 18,500 trains 
<P>
running a day, so large numbers of the public are immediately swept in by the schedule. There is an extraordinary boom in investment. I would have thought that all suppliers to the industry could be swept in. The finance involved is enormous-£27 billion over 10 years by Railtrack and £2.5 billion worth of new trains. Again, large numbers of people could be encompassed. This is a case of sloppy drafting and it should be tightened up, as it would be if the amendments were approved.

<P>
Amendment No. 870 removes sub-paragraphs (5), (6) and (7), which give arbitrary powers to the Secretary of State to allow placement on or off, I would have thought with great partiality. We had an unhappy count last week of the number of placements of people on health boards who are very much on the side of the Government: 80 per cent. are Labour councillors. It is unsatisfactory to give such powers of discretion to the Secretary of State.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I confess that I do not wholly recognise in the comments made by the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) the substance of the amendments. However, I shall endeavour to deal with the purposes of the amendments.

<P>
Perhaps I could preface my remarks by saying a brief word about the purposes of paragraph 17, which deals with the possibility that the personal interests of members of the SRA may be in conflict with the interests of the authority itself. This issue arises in any public body and there is a standard approach for dealing with it. Paragraph 17 follows the standard approach. Any interest, direct or indirect, leads to disqualification unless covered by a dispensation. That blanket approach recognises the fact that it is not possible to anticipate all the ways in which an interest may arise. When an interest arises that has not previously been contemplated, it is automatically a disqualifying interest unless the Secretary of State grants a dispensation for it. That may be a general dispensation, given to cover all cases of that kind, or a specific dispensation to cover the particular case. At the same time as the SRA is established, the Secretary of State will issue a general dispensation under sub-paragraphs (5) and (6).

<P>
Amendments Nos. 868 and 869 would specify on the face of the statute certain types of interests that do not disqualify a member from participating in the board's discussions or decisionns. Amendment No. 870 would then remove the Secretary of State's power to issue general or specific dispensations. The problem with amendment No. 870 is that it would set the disqualification rules in concrete, with absolutely no scope for flexibility. Any kind of interest that we do not anticipate now would automatically be a disqualifying interest, however innocent it might be. That plainly will not work. Even if we specify some automatic exemptions now on the face of the Bill, we will need flexibility later.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 868 and 869 attempt to specify some automatic exemptions: there should be no disqualification merely because a member is a user of public transport or because of the relevant experience for which they were appointed in the first place. I agree with the purposes of the amendments: those should not be matters for disqualification. However, the amendments are not needed. Paragraph 17 should not be read in isolation. It has to be read alongside the whole of the Bill. In particular, for this purpose, it has to read alongside clause 177(3). That clause makes it clear that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State shall have regard to the desirability of appointing a person who has experience of  some matter relevant to the functions of the Authority.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Plainly, then, that experience is not to be regarded as a disqualifying interest under paragaph 17. Equally, any member would actually-or, at least, potentially-be a useer of public transport. If that were a matter for disqualification, the board would never reach any useful decisions because all its members would be permanently disqualified. When paragraph 17 is read together with clause 177, it is clear that that cannot be the correct interpretation of the paragraph, so no amendment is needed to achieve the intended result.

<P>
The hon. Member for North Shropshire might ask why we do not make the common-sense interpretation explicit in the Bill. In fact, it is unnecessary to do so, and it has proved to be unnecessary in all equivalent circumstances in other legislation. We should not add unnecessary words that might complicate matters further. I hope that my remarks will persuade the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> That was an interesting explanation. I had not read the provision in conjunction with clause 177(3). The Minister partly gave the game away by agreeing that I had a point, so would he agree to redraft the provision on its way to the other place? If so-we have other matters to debate this afternoon-I would be prepared to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Nice try, but the convention is that Ministers agree to consider redrafting when they believe that a genuine issue of substance has to be taken into account. I cannot honestly say, despite the hon. Gentleman's blandishments, that that applies to his amendment, so I have to decline his kind offer.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> That is a great pity, because the amendment would improve the Bill. However, as we have other urgent matters to debate, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 871, in page 190, line 47, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4) The minutes of any such proceedings shall be made available for inspection by members of the public on request and a copy of the minutes shall be provided to a member of the public who so requests and pays such fee as shall be determined by the Authority from time to time (but shall not exceed £10 in total).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment proposes that the minutes of the Strategic Rail Authority's proceedings should be made public. That is a small plea, but I have no illusions: I know that the Government will not accept it, largely because of the impracticalities that might arise if the minutes were published. However, we have an opportunity to ask about the authority's scope for open government in the exercise of its functions. How will it be held publicly accountable for the detailed aspects of its work?

<P>
When any proposal nears the commercial arena, the Government tend to clam up, refuse to answer questions and fail to provide information on the basis of commercial confidentiality. Much of the SRA's activity can easily be covered up by pleas for commercial confidentiality. However, Ministers subscribe to the principle of open government with great enthusiasm-or so we are told-so how do they propose to fulfil it with respect to the SRA?

<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right in thinking that we shall not accept his amendment, but he thinks it for the wrong reasons. We shall not accept it because it is unnecessary, not because it is too complicated. I shall explain why.

<P>
We accept the principle that the minutes of the SRA's proceedings should be made available to the public. There may be exceptions-the hon. Gentleman has highlighted one or two-but we accept that as a principle. We are committed to open government, and our open government code of practice, together with the impending Freedom of Information Bill, provide a comprehensive regime for delivering it. I can assure the Committee that the Strategic Rail Authority, as an NDPB, will be bound by the requirements of the Freedom of Information Bill.

<P>
The open government code of practice and the Freedom of Information Bill provide more appropriate mechanisms for addressing open government requirements than setting out in legislation provisions to govern each body. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that that is the right way forward. I assure him that the open government code of practice will remain in force until the freedom of information regime comes into effect, which it is expected to do in 2002-03. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment because it is not necessary. If he does not do so, I shall resist it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his positive response, but may I ask whether safety matters will be commercially confidential, or will such information automatically be made available to the public?

<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> As the hon. Gentleman knows, that is one of those ``How long is a piece of string?'' questions. Safety matters that relate to the performance of individuals might be confidential because of personal factors. Commercial confidentiality might apply if contracts that relate to a new form of safety provision are put out to tender. In those circumstances, it would be inappropriate to reveal information that should rightly remain confidential. If the hon. Gentleman is implying that the commercial confidentiality blanket will be used to prevent general safety matters from being disclosed, I assure him that that is not the case, but must recognise that, where appropriate, confidentiality must apply to the SRA as it does to any other non-departmental public body.

<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for those assurances and beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
The Chairman, being of the opinion that the principle of the schedule and any matters arising thereon had been adequately discussed in the course of debate on the amendments proposed thereto, forthwith put the Question, pursuant to Standing Orders No. 68 and 89, That this schedule, as amended, be the Thirteenth schedule to the Bill:-

<P>
Question accordingly agreed to.

<P>
Schedule 13, as amended, agreed to.

<H4><center>Clause 180</center></H4>
<H4><center>Purposes</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 23, page 99, line 31, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) to promote the effective management of safety on the rail network;'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause is important because it sets out the new authority's purposes. Through the amendment, we want to include the promotion of safety as a purpose. It is important to get the safety culture right when dealing with any form of transport, so we must spell out that safety must be the SRA's ultimate priority. The amendment would do no harm, so I shall be interested in the Under-Secretary's explanation if he thinks that it is not worth accepting.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> It goes without saying that we all share the hon. Gentleman's genuine concern to ensure that the railways are safe. The Government take rail safety very seriously indeed. That is why, in the wake of the Ladbroke Grove accident, we set up several inquiries to review safety systems and the regulation of safety. Some of those inquiries have already reported, but further reports are awaited. My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister has announced that he wants some steps to be taken immediately, as an interim measure, but further measures must await the results of Lord Cullen's inquiry into the Ladbroke Grove crash and the joint inquiry on train protection systems to be undertaken by Lord Cullen and Professor Uff, who conducted the Southall inquiry. It would not be wise to take steps now that would risk pre-empting that advice.

<P>
In the interim, some changes are being made, but they do not preclude further steps being taken when we have received the full advice. In the short term, Railtrack's current functions in respect of the safety cases of train operating companies are being transferred to the Health and Safety Executive, which is the safety body for the rail industry. Additionally, Railtrack is being required to take steps to separate its safety functions from its commercial interests.

<P>
The amendment would not produce the desired effect, which we assume is increased safety in the rail 
<P>
industry-a desire that we all share. The SRA is not a safety body; safety is properly a matter for the HSE. Under the amendment, the SRA's prime function would be the promotion of safety, but that would risk blurring the lines of responsibility and could be difficult for the authority to achieve. That would do nothing to improve railway safety and would make responsibility for safety much less clear.

<P>
That does not mean that the SRA should not have any regard for safety. Of course it must, and it will. That is why clause 182(3)(a) expressly states that, when exercising functions allocated to it, the SRA must have regard to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the need to protect all persons from dangers arising from the operation of railways (including, in particular, by taking into account any advice given by the Health and Safety Executive).<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In light of that explanation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth </B>(Aldershot): I listened carefully to the Under-Secretary's reply and am surprised that he did not respond more positively to my hon. Friend's proposal.

<P>
I noted what the Under-Secretary said about clause 182(3), which discusses the SRA's manner of exercising its functions. However, that is buried in a load of other functions that are the authority's responsibility. By contrast, clause 180 is more like the mission statement to be found in the entrance hall of companies large and small throughout the country. One of the manifestations of our age is that every company has a mission statement-indeed, I believe that some Secretaries of State have a mission statement for their Department: for example, to have an ethical foreign policy is the mission statement of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Of course, some mission statements are more misleading than others, and the Foreign Office's mission statement is particularly misleading.

<P>
Clause 180 is a mission statement for the SRA. My hon. Friend the Member for Poole said that it would be sensible for that statement to emphasise that the SRA must take safety into account as one of its functions, even though it will not have primary responsibility for safety. Consequently, the Government would be well advised to flag up safety in setting out the SRA's purposes at the beginning of the clause.
 
<P>
If the Under-Secretary finds it awkward to accept an additional purpose, as provided for in amendment No. 23, may I suggest that he responds positively to the spirit in which it was tabled by agreeing to insert the word ``safe'' before ``use'' in clause 180(a)? As a result, subsection (a) would state that a purpose of the authority is to promote the safe
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>use of the railway network for the carriage of passengers and goods.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Alternatively, an amended subsection (a) could state that a purpose of the authority is to promote the use of the railway network for the safe
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>carriage of passengers and goods.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
By making that change, the Under-Secretary would send the public a clear signal that the SRA provides for the necessary transport system and that a safe transport system is part of its purpose. Of course, the Under-Secretary will say that that is axiomatic and that the Government do not expect the Strategic Rail Authority to provide an unsafe railway system. However, if the Under-Secretary accepts the spirit of the amendment-I would prefer him to accept it as it is, even though he has explained why he cannot-perhaps he sees the merit in it and will tell us that the Government will reconsider the matter and tackle it again on Report.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I do not wish to detain the Committee long, but some points need to be put on the record about the all-important issue of safety and the Strategic Rail Authority. The amendment has successfully called the Government's bluff. We are told that one of the fundamental problems in the railway network is its fragmentation and that to improve safety, it was important to deal with that. The subtext of the Government's language was that the Strategic Rail Authority represents the defragmentation of the railway and, thus, would improve the safety of the railways. That the Government are not interested in promoting the amendment underlines the fact that safety is a complex issue that mere gut reactions cannot address.

<P>
I am entirely happy for the Minister to retreat from the topic until the Cullen report has been published, at which time clear recommendations about the framework and safety of the railway will have been taken up. I fully respect his pleading in the Government's defence that clause 182(3)(a) provides sufficient cover for the exercise of the SRA's functions with regard to safety, but we must reflect on the deficiencies of the safety culture of the railways. The uninformed pre-Cullen feeling prevalent among many informed people is that, however strong the safety culture on the railways, it has not been strong enough. By comparison, aviation has a much more proactive management of safety.

<P>
We drafted the amendment with care. It would not make the Strategic Rail Authority responsible for safety on the railways, which is what the Minister implied is its shortcoming; however, the SRA does have a part to play in the promotion of effective safety management. I am not talking about controlling or minimising risks, but about promoting safety as one of the major benefits of a public transport system. I wonder whether the Cullen inquiry will want to make it a more explicit objective of every corporate body on the railway to promote effective safety management.

<P>
Bills are now drafted in such modern parlance. Whereas in olden days a body would have been powers and functions, it now has purposes and strategies. Why can we not have plain powers and functions? It is far easier to tie them down than a body's purposes and strategies, which, if they are not evident from an organisation's powers and functions, suggests a lack of defined thought in the preparation of the Bill. One of the purposes of the Strategic Rail Authority in its broadest sense should be to promote the effective management of safety on the rail network. I am happy to defer to the Cullen inquiry before substantive changes are made to the Bill and I hope that the Minister will take on board how important it is to make safety one of the core purposes of a body such as the SRA, not just a peripheral function.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> We understand entirely the Opposition's motives in tabling the amendment, but there is provision in the Bill for the SRA to have broad responsibilities in terms of securing a safe railway. Let me draw the Committee's attention yet again to clause 182(3), which reads
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Authority shall have regard to-<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the need to protect all persons from dangers arising from the operation of railways (including, in particular, by taking into account any advice given by the Health and Safety Executive).

<P>
</UL></FONT><H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
We have thought hard about this. There was an obvious attraction in putting that explicit safety responsibility on the face of the Bill. However, I come back to the point that I made earlier: it is our considered view that, by placing safety as a requirement on the face of the Bill, we would make it a prime function of the SRA and that could confuse the locus of responsibility for safety which properly lies with the HSE. We explicitly draw attention to the need for the authority to take into account advice given by the HSE. That is not an easy position to expound, given the very noble purposes behind the amendment, but this is our considered and firm view and it is for that reason that I must resist the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I am a little disappointed by that response. I understand that it is a matter of judgment and that the HSE has principal responsibility, but we are talking more about general culture. We believe that all those involved in the rail industry should regard safety as a critical issue. We are setting up a body over which the Secretary of State seems to have a great deal of influence, as shown in the last clauses that we debated. I would not want to labour the point, but if safety were included, it would put a greater responsibility on the Secretary of State because he would appreciate that the body that he guided had to meet that objective.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth:</B> Clause 182 effectively amplifies clause 180 and the purposes set out therein. In so far as safety is mentioned in clause 182, it would be strengthened if safety were mentioned in clause 180. Is my hon. Friend not concerned that the Government, by not wishing to put safety in the purposes, might be trying to limit the liability of the SRA?

<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> We all know how horrific rail accidents are, but sometimes there is a tendency to point fingers at various bodies. One saw that recently when the newspapers, if not the politicians, looked for people to blame. If we are not careful we get into the blame game. The reason behind the amendment is honourable and honest: we believe that safety should be part of the culture of everyone involved in the industry. No doubt we shall want to return to the matter on Report, but for today, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Both the Bill and the amendment relate to joined-up transport. As we have heard, the Bill will lead not only to a renaissance for railways, but to a post-modernist revolution in integrated transport-they will love that one in Croydon. Amendments Nos. 846 and 847, which are virtually identical, would promote measures designed to integrate journeys that involve railways and other modes of transport. In discussing both the purpose and the functions of the SRA, that objective is especially important in promoting integrated transport and creating a multi-modal seamless network to enable passengers to travel around the country without being thwarted at different interchanges.

<P>
As hon. Members know, the Government White Paper made it clear that transport should be both integrated and sustainable and that, in integrating transport, the SRA and other organisations should examine other modes of transport to establish how they can work together coherently. Page 44 of the most recent annual report of the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising, which covers objectives, instructions and guidance for the franchising director, refers to support for
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the development of railway services and facilities which make it convenient and cost effective for passengers to make journeys involving more than one mode of transport.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I welcome that inclusion in the guidance notes, but is it enough?

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The document from which the hon. Gentleman quotes relates to the pre-modernist endogenous transport policies-

<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> That is why I suggest bringing it into the post-modernist era. We are a long way from the renaissance to which the hon. Gentleman referred, but we are moving quickly along-but not off-the rails.

<P>
Are those guidance notes enough? Ministerial reassurance may be enough, but the SRA will, it seems, be in head-to-head negotiation with the train operating companies to deliver the necessary framework for integrated transport. Are we giving the SRA enough support to ensure that all passengers, including those who have come by bicycle, bus, hire car or transport for disabled people, integrate effectively into the strategic rail system? Integration is well advanced in some countries, especially Switzerland; in places such as Utrecht and Linden, railway stations have thousands of places for bicycles, and links with local transport plans. I shall be interested to hear what Ministers have to say about ensuring that local transport plans fit into the environment that the SRA will create to provide integration.

<P>
My key point is that the train operating companies are profit-maximising concerns that may not immediately want to be involved in ensuring a smooth transfer from cycling, for instance, to railway. It is therefore important that the SRA's terms of reference, in the Bill and the guidance, encourage it to enable people to go from one mode of transport to the other without hindrance. It seems to me that there is a mixed picture: Anglia Railways which operates from Liverpool Street station, has provision for bikes, provision for space and provision for publicity, but in other contracts, that is not the case. Some sort of minimum standards are required, for example, in the case of bicycles. If there is any short-term cost issue, there should be a level playing field in terms of franchise bidding.

<P>
In Holland-which is quite a flat place, unlike Britain-40 per cent. of rail passengers arrive by bicycle. In Britain, 60 per cent. of the population live within 15 minutes of a railway station, so there is enormous opportunity for people to link in to the train by bicycle or other modes. We need to ensure that the Strategic Rail Authority makes that easy.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, if there is to be a level playing field in the franchise arrangements, it would be appropriate in future for the SRA to require train operating companies to make available on each service a number of spaces for bicycles?

<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> That should be seriously considered. Ministers might also wish to consider provision for taxis and access for people with disabilities. One could manufacture an endless list of requirements. The reports also point out that the number of bicycles may vary from time to time, as trends and opportunities change. The SRA should encourage multi-modal transport, which would certainly include bicycles, so there should be provision for cycle racks and cycle spaces on trains.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That choice confronts train operators with a dilemma. At peak times, there is hardly room for people to stand, let alone for people to take their bicycles on trains. Does the hon. Gentleman think that it should be the priority of the network at crowded peak times to carry people, or to carry fewer people and their bicycles? What is his opinion?

<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> That is an interesting point that illustrates a mindset that believes it is reasonable for people to be crammed into trains like sardines at peak times so that train operating companies can maximise their profitability, whereas at other times bicycles can be allowed on along with the chickens. There is a commercial trade-off, but facilities do need to be available. One could say the same thing about people with disabilities, people with prams and people with luggage. Obviously there are these trade-offs. It may be that, because of the physical congestion on the trains, people with bicycles may choose to go at different times of the day and I recognise that. However, I am not in the business of trying to let the train operator off the hook completely, and there should normally be some provision for bicycles.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Clarke </B>(Northampton, South): I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I want to return to his comments in respect of taxis and ask whether, within his amendment, he foresees the ability of the Strategic Railway Authority to act in that respect. Currently, Railtrack makes it impossible for local private hire vehicles to take up positions on its stations by levying prohibitive rental charges. Does my hon. Friend feel that the SRA should have a role in regulating the cost to private hire vehicles of being in situ at a station?

<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Yes, that is an interesting point to which we will come later, as I have tabled amendments relating to taxis and disability access. My hon. Friend talks about cost prohibitions, opportunities for lower prices for consumers, choice and encouragement of multi-modal interchange. In an ideal world, there would be opportunities for people to travel in all sorts of ways, and it may be that some requirements are not necessary for all modes of transport. People should be able to compete at the railway station to provide different forms of transport; at the same time, there should be equal rights for those with disability. I know that we shall be coming on to that subject later, but it is part of the broader picture of an integrated transport regime that the SRA must bear in mind when setting the terms of reference for rail franchises for train operating companies.

<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
It is important that we have facilities for bicycles. If there are none at railway stations, people will travel to them by car. The two primary thrusts of the legislation are integration and sustainability. If there is not enough room for bikes, fewer people will use them and more people will go by car. That will not fulfil our objectives. We need to ask if there are enough spaces for bikes on trains. If there are only two spaces on a train, a family going out together by bike will not be able to travel on it.

<P>
There may be problems at busy times, as was mentioned by the hon. Member for North Essex. I am sorry to dwell on this, but in Switzerland the trains go by Swiss clockwork and they have a national cycle network tied into the railways. That is integrated planning. Although I am not saying that it should necessarily happen here, but if we are to have a Strategic Rail Authority and a strategic rail network, links for cycle fanatics would make sense.

<P>
I am looking for strong support from the Government for the SRA to provide an environment for joined-up transport and all that that brings. I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> We have amendments in this group that are along similar lines to that tabled by the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Davies). We see the word ``integrated'' used more and more these days, without it necessarily being defined. Sometimes people talk a great deal about integration, but little progress is made.

<P>
The problem is that each mode of transport has its own set of economics, and it is sometimes difficult to run them all together. If one arrives at a station by using public transport, but cannot get a bus or leave one's bicycle, it can cause a great deal of distress. As Members of Parliament, we have all had people coming into our surgeries very upset about these issues. I was told by a group of people in Poole that they took their bicycles by rail to Wareham and found that they could not get back because the return train did not have provision for them. People with tandems get upset about bike racks that do not take them into account.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for North Essex is right that there is a dilemma. Sometimes, one wants to get as many people as possible on a train and in this country, unlike in India, they like to travel inside. Sometimes passenger space is taken up by other things. When we are talking about first principles, it is important that the SRA should do what it can to integrate the network with other modes of transport, otherwise, the railways will not succeed.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart </B>(Eccles): I rise to speak to amendment No. 850, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Quinn) and myself. In the Bill, the Government have recognised and supported the principle and application of the genuinely integrated transport system for the UK-not only to promote, but to confirm and consolidate, the sort of multi-modal system that exists in my area of Greater Manchester.

<P>
The Greater Manchester passenger transport executive has responsibility for a multi-modal system, including rail, bus and rapid light transport-the successful Greater Manchester Metrolink system. Its success was confirmed as a significant element in the way forward for a modern integrated UK system when the Government last week announced that they would invest 50 per cent. of the costs of the Metrolink system throughout Greater Manchester. That was an acknowledgement of the great work done by the Greater Manchester passenger transport authority and executive, and was greatly welcomed by the people of Greater Manchester.

<P>
The amendment is intended to tease out from the Minister the extent to which the Government recognise the need for measures such as through-ticketing systems to ensure that the integrated system meets its maximum potential for passengers. If my hon. Friend the Minister will not accept the amendment, I hope that he will have some good words to say about it. Will he also assure us that he recognises the need for the SRA to consider local transport plans, so that local issues will be acknowledged when strategic decisions are taken?

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> You may have noticed, Mr. Gale, that I have been relatively quiet during our debates on this part of the Bill. No doubt that will have been a great pleasure to you [Hon. Members: ``No''.] and also to the Whips on the Opposition and Government Benches. I am persuaded to rise and support amendments Nos. 801, 846 and 850 variously proposed by the hon. Members for Croydon, Central, for Scarborough and Whitby and for Eccles (Mr. Steward) because of you, Mr. Gale. When this part of the Bill was introduced, we had a lengthy debate on clause 176, and at the end of our deliberations, you wound up proceedings by saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We have examined the main line, the branch line, the sidings and every goods yard relating not only to clause 176 but to most of this chapter of the Bill,-[Official Report, Standing Committee E, 21 March 2000; c. 1124.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That was an apposite summary of our debate. Throughout our deliberations on the introduction of the SRA, little debate took place about other modes of transport or the relationship between the SRA and those other modes.

<P>
In another debate-outside this Committee-on the opportunities provided by the Bill for integrated transport, I suggested that the only form of integration within the Bill was the staples that held it together. That might be unfair about local transport plans, which were mentioned a few moments ago by the hon. Member for Eccles. In the development of local transport plans, 
<P>
local government is expected to tackle the needs for genuinely integrated transport.

<P>
I listened intently to our earlier deliberations, but I managed at the same time to glance through ``Train Times'', the magazine of the transport research and information network. The opening page refers to the Bill and states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Yet it isn't all bad news. The introduction of Local Transport Plans is making a big difference to the way local authorities think about transport. They're being encouraged to look at a wider, more integrated, picture.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is appropriate for local government to consider a wider and more integrated picture in developing its local transport plans. Amendments Nos. 801, 846, 850 and some of those tabled by the hon. Member for Poole also require the SRA to consider integrated transport.

<P>
Not only do I move amendments from time to time-

<P>

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I do not always withdraw them. I have had opportunities to write several letters home to my wife, as you will recall, Mr. Gale.

<P>
Another of my functions in Committee is to try to second-guess the Under-Secretary's responses and then to wonder whether they will be adequate to the task. I predict that the Under-Secretary will say that the amendments are not necessary, although they are worthy and he supports their intentions. He will point us to clause 182(2)(d). If he is not thinking of doing so, I recommend that he does, as it makes it clear that the SRA will be required
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to promote measures designed to facilitate the making by passengers of journeys which involve the use of the services of more than one passenger service operator.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It would help the Committee if the Under-Secretary pointed out that that does not necessarily mean other rail passenger service operators. It could refer to taxi, bus or community transport operators. To have that definition clearly made by him would go some way to moving matters forward.

<P>
Even if that is the Under-Secretary's response, I will suggest that it is inadequate as it does not cover several other modes of transport, such as pedestrians, cyclists and others mentioned by the hon. Member for Croydon, Central. I hope that we shall have a clear statement about how vitally important it is that the SRA considers the needs of users of other modes of transport. I hope that the Under-Secretary will be prepared to go further than that to give a clear definition of what clause 182(2)(d) means and that he will agree that the Bill should contain words about the importance of integrated transport.

<P>
Were the Under-Secretary minded to choose an amendment that would serve that purpose, I hope that he would not choose mine as it falls down on the list C argument and specifies a mode of transport. I would strongly recommend the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Croydon, Central. He has succinctly expressed not only his views, but those of some of his hon. Friends, of our party, and I think of Conservative Members. If the Under-Secretary does not accept that recommendation, he will be isolated, as nearly every other member of the Committee supports the hon. Member for Croydon, Central.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> At the risk of isolation in the Committee, I shall say that I hope to be able to travel a long distance down the tracks with the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster), but I shall not arrive at the same destination. The spirits of our journey are closely related and our objectives are identical, even if the mechanisms are not the same.

<P>
I can hardly make it clearer that I have a great deal of sympathy with the amendments and hope to show that we have already taken account of what they seek to achieve. It is always pleasing, if surprising, to find myself in agreement with Opposition amendments, although I always fear that the idea behind them is not original, but borrowed from the Government. However, I shall make an honourable exception for the Liberal Democrat benches in due course.

<P>
The Strategic Rail Authority, the Secretary of State and the rail regulator should all contribute to the Government's aim of a properly integrated transport system. That is why we produced the first transport White Paper in 20 years. It has been the whole thrust of our policies.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth:</B> I shall not let the Under-Secretary get away with that statement. Before he winds himself into high-flown rhetoric about the Government's fantastic integration policies, may I remind him of but one example of the move towards integrated transport? The fast link between Paddington and Heathrow, promoted under the previous Conservative Government, was a good example of that Government putting integration transport policy into action.

<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I must point out that that was financed entirely by the private sector and it was no thanks to any financial commitment on the part of the Conservative Government. But why be churlish? I fully acknowledge one or two such examples in pre-history, before the post-modernist era, but we expect there to be far more in the brave new world into which we are entering under the auspices of the Strategic Rail Authority. [
Interruption.] I fear that a further helpful intervention is about to be made by my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape).

<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Snape </B>(West Bromwich, East): I am sorry, but I have been provoked into saying that it is a strange example of a Conservative-integrated transport system when the hon. Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth) boasts a railway line that accepts no other organisation's tickets.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> As ever, my hon. Friend makes an extremely salient point.

<P>
In my castigations of the belated recognition of the advantages of integrated transport, I accept the comments of the hon. Members for Bath and for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Mr. Moore). They have always argued for the fair integration of transport. My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, Central has long been an outstanding advocate of integrated transport policies and of transport innovation at the local level. We bear in mind his key role in the development of the Croydon tramlink, the inception of which we look forward to soon.

<P>
Let me also pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Eccles and his highly effective campaign, which has led to the securing of that wonderful settlement for the major extension of the Manchester Metrolink announced last week by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions.

<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Yes, but I have much to say and little time in which to say it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Does the Minister agree that the hon. Member for Croydon, Central would have a much better record on integration if he were willing to call for the reinstatement of Croydon aerodrome? That could be linked to Croydon railway station and then there would be a wonderfully integrated transport system-again, for Croydon.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> There are winners and losers in all such propositions. The reinstatement of Croydon aerodrome would mean the loss of an excellent Chinese restaurant, which is now on that site. Hard choices have to be made.

<P>
The SRA's relationship with local authorities was raised by my hon. Friends the Members for Croydon, Central and for Eccles and earlier by the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale. We want to shift the emphasis towards more inclusion and consultation with regional and local government. We expect the SRA to facilitate and lead such consultation. The shadow SRA has made a good start. It is devoting considerable effort to developing relationships with local authorities. For example, after each of his recent announcements on franchise renegotiation, the franchising director wrote to local authorities inviting comments. A series of regional discussions with the authorities has taken place, starting with one in mid-January to discuss the GNER franchise. The shadow SRA maintains close contact with the Local Government Association and the Association of Transport Co-ordinating Officers. Shadow SRA staff have also attended a number of local authorities' public meetings on local transport plans.

<P>
On local transport planning, the SRA strategies will promote rail use within an integrated transport system. Consistent with this national framework, the strategies will take account of the view of local and regional bodies. The SRA will take decisions about services in the light of local transport plans. I hope that that will reassure my hon. Friends, the Members for Croydon, Central and for Eccles and the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale.

<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> The Under-Secretary will recall that I raised this issue with him earlier in relation not only to the future but to the past. Has he yet been able to find out whether the transport plans prepared for the past 12 months have been viewed by the Strategic Rail Authority?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I regret that I have not been able to ascertain that information. I have made serious efforts in the interim period, as the hon. Gentleman will detect, to prepare a clearer statement of the role that we expect the SRA to develop in relation to local transport authorities and local transport plans. I undertake to produce information on that subject in due course.

<P>
We expect decisions about services to be taken in the light of local transport plans. That will involve consultation to identify opportunities for rail. We welcome local authority initiatives to improve the rail network. Our guidance on local transport plans makes it clear that authorities should consider the potential contribution of rail as part of an integrated transport strategy. We look forward to local authorities putting in bids to the SRA for the new passenger partnership fund, which the SRA will inherit from the franchising director.

<P>
The amendments do various things. Some add to the primary purposes of the authority, some to the manner in which it is to carry out its functions and others affect the duties of the Secretary of State and of the Rail Regulator. The amendments are all unncecessary. Such integration is part of an integrated transport system, which we support and promote and these requirements are already in the Bill. That is why we have made it a primary purpose of the authority, in clause 180(c), to contribute to the development of an integrated system of transport of passengers and goods. This is the first time that that integration objective has been set in any transport legislation as a prime purpose of the governing rail body. I can reassure the Committee that it will cover the integration of journeys and integration with all modes of transport. Under clause 182(1) all other functions of the authority must be exercised with a view to furthering this purpose in accordance with its strategies and it is not necessary to replicate this in clause 182(2). That is why we are also amending section 4 of the Railways Act 1993 to make it a duty of the Rail Regulator to contribute to the development of an integrated system of transport of passengers and goods.

<P>
The SRA's contribution to the development of an integrated transport system under clause 180 could, for example, involve it in funding the better integration of the railway with other modes of transport under clause 186. The authority could fund an interchange or-and this will be close to the heart of my hon. Friend, the Member for Croydon, Central-a bicycle store at a station.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I apologise for interrupting the Minister and I am conscious that the Committee wants to make progress, but he referred to clause 180 to cover himself. That says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to contribute to the development of an integrated system of transport of passengers and goods.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Similarly, as I said earlier, clause 182 also refers to ``passenger service operators'' and therefore also to passengers. I still do not know where in the Bill is the requirement for the SRA to consider issues such as support for cyclists who are not passengers or, indeed, for pedestrians.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Cyclists who use the railways are passengers. Indeed, those that do so must consider their cycles as luggage. Of course, we expect the SRA and the franchisees to take into account such provision when they examine new investment in the railway.

<P>
I can offer comfort to the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) on train capacity and on cycles and people. I assure him that the provision of adequate capacity to meet customer demand is a fundamental requirement of franchise replacement. There will be a requirement for more frequent and accurate recording of train loading data. We expect the SRA to examine matters such as the needs of cyclists travelling on trains as it moves further into the refranchising framework.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Stewart:</B> Is not the provision of the type to be outlined in local transport plans?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> It could be. Certainly, guidance to local transport authorities draws attention to their responsibilities for developing cycling and walking as alternatives to car use and car dependency. We are generally interested in safer routes to stations, which involves the development of cycle and pedestrian routes.

<P>
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Eccles that integrated ticketing is a vital part of integrated transport. The SRA will be able to promote such schemes, of which there are some good examples. In Oxford, people can buy a ticket on the local bus that will get them to London by rail and then into the London underground network. In more than 100 towns throughout Britain, one can buy a £1 bus add-on that provides freedom of the local bus network at the end of a rail journey. So there is already good news.

<P>
On wider integration, we have asked the franchising director to give due weight to the extent to which integrated transport measures within the rail network and with other transport modes can be achieved in his examination of replacement franchises. Free local bus travel with certain operators in High Wycombe and Aylesbury as well as secure bicycle storage at two railway stations were benefits of a passenger dividend negotiated on the change of control at Chiltern Railways.

<P>
Integrating railway transport with other transport modes, including cycling, walking, bus travel and private motoring is at the heart of the authority's mission. There is therefore no need to duplicate integrated transport objectives in clause 182(2) because, as the hon. Member for Bath said, they are clearly set out in clause 182(2)(d). I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on his perspicacity in spotting that the Government had already anticipated his objectives.

<P>
The amendment tabled by the hon. Members for North Essex, for Poole and for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) is also unnecessary. Two of the authority's primary purposes are promoting the use of the network and securing its development. Those can be achieved only by promoting a favourable climate for investment. To quote Sir Alastair Morton, it is all about ``investment, investment, investment''. Hon. Members need have no fears on that score. With those reassurances, I trust that hon. Members will agree not to press their amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Again, I am greatly encouraged by the Minister's commitment to integrated transport, multi-modal interchanges and passengers having a free run throughout the system.

<P>
To respond briefly to the hon. Member for Aldershot, who called for the reinstatement of the Croydon aerodrome-which was the first airport in Britain. That was where Neville Chamberlain came down and declared, ``Peace for our time''. Sadly, it is now a business park. As the Minister said, it has a very large Chinese restaurant and takeaway. Maybe a compromise for the hon. Member for Northampton, South would be to have a big sign saying, ``flying tonight''. I am reassured by what the Minister said. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Moore </B>(Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale): I beg to move amendment No. 797, in page 99, line 36, at end add-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(d) to identify unmet needs for railway services, and<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(e) to expand the railway network where appropriate.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The hon. Member for Poole said earlier that ``integration'' was sometimes over-used. Many hon. Members who represent rural constituencies would love to have transport systems to integrate. Our primary desire is for a comprehensive transport system that will bring people a range of choices in their everyday lives, whether business or personal.

<P>
The amendment would extend the authority's purposes to identifying unmet needs for railway services and expanding the railway network where appropriate. The existing purposes need to be extended. It is not immediately clear to me-or to those in my constituency who have studied the matter with me-how the SRA would cover situations where there is no railway but a demand for rail services.

<P>
Equally, the purpose set out in subsection (b) is too narrowly defined. It talks about developing the network, which is rather ambiguous. To my mind, that does not necessarily mean expanding into areas not already covered by the rail network. The example of my constituency and of the neighbouring constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) is a good illustration of a problem that is widespread in the United Kingdom and at which I hope the Government will look seriously. The borders used to have a railway but no longer does. To my surprise, I recently received a letter from Railtrack about its ``station of the year'' competition, which talked about how that constituted a wonderful piece of public-spiritedness. In the final paragraph, it told me that it would be in touch if a railway station in my constituency were shortlisted for the award. I have to tell the Minister-I am sure that he already knows-that the chances of that happening are rather remote, given that we have no railway station. Indeed, there is no rail track of any kind running through the constituency.

<P>
Last week, when we were debating the opening stages of part IV, the Minister said that he had had his first vision on the Waverley line, which has got a lot of people thinking. I will not speculate about how old he was when he was on the Waverley line looking at my constituency. Suffice it to say that it closed in 1969, a few years ago. It was a vital third link through Scotland from Edinburgh to Carlisle and, even in its latter days when lack of investment and other issues affected its usage, it was still important to communities throughout the region. That railway linked places as remote as Newcastleton to the south and Heriot to the north in my constituency to major towns. Indeed, the strength of feeling about the line's closure was such that my predecessor, now Lord Steel of Aikwood, had to intervene at Newcastleton on the night that the final train went through the borders to Carlisle to prevent the local minister from being arrested for blocking the track. No one has been involved in such direct action since then, but feelings are still extremely strong.

<P>
In recent years, people have had to put up with a bus link from the central borders north to Edinburgh, south to Carlisle or to Berwick on the east coast. That is as good service as we can hope for, but it is unreliable because of snow-not just the wrong kind of snow-and the amount of traffic on the roads. Although the A7 is a trunk route, it is a very poor road, especially on the southern section. Delays are common on that bus service. If problems occur, the alternatives-if any exist-that could be used operate much later in the day.

<P>
There has been much argument about the effects that the line's closure has had on the borders. Suffice it to say that the economic development of the area has been badly stymied in the 30 years or so since the line closed. Although it is a picturesque part of the world that has many aspects of the quality of life that makes people pleased to live there, it has to work hard to sustain industry and agriculture. In an increasingly competitive world, transport and infrastructure links are important to the vibrancy and sustainability of all the different communities, which range from small hamlets to large towns, such as Hawick and Galashiels, with 15,000 or 16,000 people in each.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth:</B> I have listened with great interest to the hon. Gentleman's description of that line. I have fond childhood memories of travelling on it on the overnight sleeper from St. Pancras to Hawick to stay with my family in the borders. He makes a powerful case about the loss of the line. Will he speculate on how much its loss has contributed to the difficulties of the farming community, especially the rundown of the auction marts in the borders, now that no train service is available on the line from Carlisle to Edinburgh?

<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> I welcome that intervention. The hon. Gentleman is an overshoot of a famous border reviving family. I shall not speculate about his own experiences, but his family and others were involved in broder raiding and cattle and sheep rustling for many centuries. Things have moved on, I hope. He makes an important point. The railway's closure has had an insidious effect on the area for many years; we are now talking about generations. That is not merely symbolic. We in the borders have to face the problems of the area's future and its economic development.

<P>
Many parts of the country have suffered in recent years, so I shall not labour the point, but the borders have had a bad spell because of the textile industry's vulnerability and the almost complete wipe-out of the one successful, diversified sector-electronics. Viasystems has closed with the loss of 1,000 jobs in my constituency during the past year and a half. That is not in the scale of BMW's closure of Rover, but in an area of 100,000 people, it was a devastating blow from which we are just beginning to recover.

<P>
In fairness to the Government, other agencies and everyone locally, there has been a great deal of reaction. One of the responses from Government was to establish a feasibility study to consider the reinstatement of the Waverley line. That study began last year and recently reported. It has looked both at the possibilities for a passenger service from the heart of the borders northwards up to Edinburgh and for a freight service from the south of the borders down to Carlisle. The key findings of the study have shown that the northern link, much to the dismay of the sceptics, could prove itself operationally viable. However, a fairly substantial capital investment is required to get it up and running. The southern link, which at this stage is predominantly envisaged to be a freight link, requires more work to prove that it can be viable. Thousands of trees will come out of the Kielder forest in the next 20 years as the planting cycle comes to the mature stage, which means that there is a ready-made growth market for the southern freight line. Our ultimate ambition is to have a through route from Edinburgh to Carlisle.

<P>
The key benefits are not just economic development. The line is vital for objectives such as social inclusion and the need for accessibility-both to the area and from it to major cities such as Edinburgh, Carlisle and Newcastle. All of these appear relatively close on the map, but for many people they are actually too far away. We hope that the existence of the railway might help us to tackle chronic problems such as the emigration of young people. Too many people leave the area once they have finished school, or to go to college, and do not return as there are so few opportunities locally.

<P>
Many local organisations have worked hard over the years to underpin the arguments for the railway. Borders Transport Futures, a private company, and more recently the Campaign for Borders Rail, which is an umbrella group covering many different people, have been key campaigners highlighting these issues. They have recently been instrumental in establishing a strong voice to lobby the shadow Strategic Rail Authority. Yesterday, Chris Austin, Director of External Relations, visited the area to discuss the findings of the feasibility study with local members. It is evident that the campaign and others have been instrumental in ensuring that the SRA looks seriously at this proposal.

<P>
The big question in our area and probably for other rural parts of the UK is: has the SRA been conceived as having any role to facilitate the development of projects such as the Waverley line, either directly or indirectly? Direct involvement, of course, may take different forms. On the revenue side, there is the prospect of accessing the railway passenger partnership for funding. Also, the infrastructure investment fund would help to cover the considerable costs of reinstatement of the railway. As I explained, all the railway lines have gone but the track bed is largely intact and, by luck and sometimes good judgement and planning considerations, there has been little building over the line, particularly in the northern section. It was rather depressing yesterday, however, to be told by Mr. Austin and his colleague that it was unlikely that the Waverley line would be eligible for funding from the infrastructure investment fund because of the scale of funds that might be required. It is fair to say that the borders rail campaigners are not looking for the entire funding from the Strategic Rail Authority. Far from it, they were considering many other sources long before the SRA was on the scene. It would be a bad signal if, at this early stage, it was established in principle that the SRA had no role to play in funding such projects. Will the Under-Secretary explain how the SRA will indirectly facilitate the development of such projects? If it will not have a strategic view over the whole country and identify areas that are crying out for a railway service, people will question whether it is aptly named.
 
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I am sure that we shall return to land in future debates. I mention it now because of yesterday's meeting with the shadow Strategic Rail Authority. In response to a question from someone from Edinburgh who was worried about what was up for sale in that area, the SRA representatives said that they were certainly interested in keeping land that was of strategic benefit to the railway, but that they were not interested in something that was a gleam in the eye of some well-meaning individuals and that may not be realised for 20 years.

<P>
That is a worrying statement because if people did not have a gleam in their eye 30 years ago when the Waverley line was closed and had the good sense to do their bit to campaign and protect that line, we would not feasibly be looking forward to its reinstatement. We should welcome clarification of the strategic view that will be taken by the authority of land sales, in particular. I stress that no one expects the SRA to wave a magic wand, but we look for serious support in overcoming many legal and funding hurdles when developing this and other projects.

<P>
Last week, the Minister commended the railway campaign for the Waverley line and, yesterday, my hon. Friend the Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire and I made a small piece of history when we attended the Scottish Parliament's Petitions Committee, which met for the first time outside Edinburgh since it was established last year. We and others from the borders put the case for the borders railway and we received a good welcome. Several hundred people were crammed into the town hall in Galashiels to ensure that the strength of feeling about the issue was well noticed.

<P>
There are other schemes throughout the country. It is important to pay credit to organisations such as the Transport Research and Information Network to which my hon. Friend the Member for Bath referred. It has done much valuable work. Indeed, the Department commissioned it to undertake a study on microfranchising, an early draft of which was due in the past few weeks. Can the Under-Secretary tell us whether it has been received and say what will happen now? There is much demand for rail services throughout the country-often in places that are away from the predominant public gaze and the main areas at which the SRA and others might be looking at present. I hope that the Under-Secretary will take seriously the strength of feeling about the issue, certainly in my part of the country. Will he give strong assurances that the SRA will deal with such serious issues?

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I give broad, but qualified, support to the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale. I was a little disappointed that he did not announce that a penny on income tax would solve the problem, but perhaps his approach had a note of realism.

<P>
Part of the railway renaissance must be reopening lines where demand is unmet and it is appropriate to do so. That was achieved during our period of stewardship, under which the Heathrow airport link-the fast train to Heathrow from Paddington-was constructed.

<P>
It is part of our vision for the railway to allow microfranchising. The reopening of a significant branch line such as the Waverley line might be an appropriate project for a special purpose vehicle. It might not be appropriate for Railtrack or the SRA to take responsibility, but one way of leveraging in the extra finance would be to use a special purpose vehicle.

<P>
Part of our policy on which I shall enlarge for a moment is the ``Railway Renaissance, stage 2''. We pledge that we shall allow any company that wants to build new lines that Railtrack does not currently provide to apply for permission to do so to the SRA or the Secretary of State. It is also our policy to allow companies to apply to the SRA for permission to build freight-only rail lines. I do not suggest that the case that the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale cited might be appropriate for that, but that is our policy.

<P>
We believe that it would be appropriate for Railtrack to publish details of spare capacity to encourage new operators and services on to the railway. The expansion of the railway is our objective and the framework of the Bill should play a part in that. I would be surprised if the Under-Secretary accepted the amendment as it is drawn so widely, but we support its spirit.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I can assure the hon. Member for North Essex that we would not rule out the use of a special purpose vehicle for exactly the purposes that he identified and which the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale discussed. Indeed, special purpose vehicles may, at least initially, be more appropriate for self-contained projects such as reopening disused lines and station development. That is certainly a possibility to be explored. I hope that that reassures the hon. Member for North Essex.

<P>
We have been treated to a graphic description of the transport problems of the beautiful constituency of Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale, and not least to a graphic description of the closure of the Waverley line many years ago. The hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale made a strong case for its reinstatement. Indeed, I have a strong suspicion that the good burghers of Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale will read about his speech in their local newspapers tomorrow. I was amused by the suggestion of the hon. Member for North Essex that the problems might present a further use for the famous Liberal Democrat 1p-in the words of my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) and London's next mayor, the longest ``p'' in history, although north of the border I suppose that it might be described as the ``Lib-Dem baubee''. I merely suggest that that might be a further campaigning objective for the hon. member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale.

<P>
The amendment would add two new purposes to the high-level objectives of the authority-to identify unmet needs for railway services and to expand the railway network where appropriate. I have no problem with the principle behind the amendment, which is certainly well intentioned. However, I do not believe that it is necessary to add those two new limbs to the purposes of the authority. Subsection (b) already provides that one of the authority's three purposes is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to secure the development of the railway network.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That purpose already embraces expanding the railway network where there is potential to do so.

<P>
I assure the Committee that the Government want a growing railway at the heart of an integrated transport policy. Part IV of the Bill puts the framework in place to deliver just that. The SRA will be a promoter and facilitator of schemes to enhance the level and quality of rail services and will have strategies for securing those schemes. Schemes to expand the network to meet the need for railway services will come from a variety of sources, including the industry, the SRA and local authorities.

<P>
In that context, can I reassure the hon. Gentleman about the role of the SRA in relation to reopenings, such as the one that he advocates for the Waverley line. We welcome the role of local authorities, regional bodies and the SRA in considering the feasibility of reopenings. The SRA will have powers to assist reopenings and will consider proposals, taking into account a range of factors including the environment, accessibility and value for money against competing demands. Microfranchising is an issue that I hope to return to in our proceedings. I certainly do not want to overlook this interesting concept, which was put forward by Dr. Salveson, whom I met only two weeks ago.

<P>
Imaginative proposals to reopen lines are already emerging in public statements from franchisees involved in the negotiations with the shadow SRA. I think, of course, of Connex's proposal for the Lewes-Uckfield extension, although I sincerely hope that my reference to Lewes will not stimulate a further barrage of parliamentary questions from the indefatigable hon. Member for Lewes (Mr. Baker). Where schemes appear to the SRA to fit its strategies for securing the development of the railway network, it will need to consider how the new scheme could be encouraged. If the scheme is not viable on commercial grounds alone, the SRA will consider whether direct public support for such a scheme would be justified as the best use of its resources. Alternatively, there may be ways of sharing the risk between the public and private sectors.

<P>
The SRA will administer funds such as the new rail passenger partnership scheme, which is valued at £100 million over the next three years, to support innovative proposals at the regional local level that expand the network. In assessing proposals the SRA will make a balanced judgment, taking into account a range of factors. If the difficulty lies with getting the private sector to invest in a railway facility that may not be profitable in its early years, the regulator's new powers under clause 198 to direct the provision, improvement and so on of the railway facilities may be of use. I draw that to the attention of the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for the opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to an expanding railway network where appropriate. I trust that he will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> On the vexed question of the 1p on income tax, we would be able to kit ourselves out with Eurostars and various other top quality trains. We want a good service, but we are not overly ambitious for the Waverley line. A number of technical questions concern the Waverley line, but I do not want to take up the Committee's time by pursuing them. Perhaps I can write to the Minister about them. It is important to us and other parts of the country that rural areas are not left out because the work of the SRA is focused too closely on what we accept are serious problems in other areas. I take note of the Minister's assurances and his references to other parts of the Bill. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The list of consultees is potentially endless and possibly more restrictive than we would want it to be if it were specified. It would be useful to know that it will be clear somewhere that the industry, the passenger transport executives, relevant local authorities and rail passenger representative organisations, are intended to be consulted. We have been kind and have even put down the Secretary of State as someone who should be consulted about the strategies of the authority. Indeed, we think that it is preferable for the Secretary of State to be consulted than to inflict his guidance on the authority. The correct role for the SRA is much more that of a free spirit in the industry-a catalyser, persuader or a basher together of heads-than a creature of the Secretary of State. That is why in a later amendment we propose to delete the power of the Secretary of State to give guidance.

<P>

<B>Mr. Moore:</B> Our concern is simply that although much has rightly been changed in the Bill, the consultation process may not be extensive enough. Well-established consultative committees are being renamed in the Bill, but there is an omission as regards freight groups. Given that rail freight is such a key issue, there is a major concern about how it should feed into this process. I hope that the Minister can explain how he sees that developing.

<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I could spare the Committee any further debate on the clause by simply saying, ``Argument C'', and sitting down. However, it is only fair to make two short observations. First, this is the first time in recorded history that, on a clause or amendment that would extend obligations to consult, the Liberal Democrat party has come up with a shorter list of consultees than the Conservative party. We should congratulate them is this indicates that their two parties are going in opposite trajectories. The Liberal Democrats are closer to reality; the Tories are in outer darkness.

<P>
My second observation is that I cannot understand why the Conservative party, having tried to devise this enormous list of people who want to be consulted, should have forgotten the Health and Safety Executive, the railway inspectorate and British Transport police. That demonstrates the nonsense of lists: someone is always omitted and in future when people try to interpret our provisions they might read more than they should into them. Lists are undesirable. I rest my case on argument C.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I wish to protest most strongly. We are nothing at all like the Liberal Democrats. [Hon. Members: ``Hear, hear!''] Secondly, there is no need to include safety organisations because we intended to strengthen the safety aspect in another part of the Bill. It was only a probing amendment and I was a little disappointed at the humourless way in which the Minister responded. He was taking it a little over seriously although I am grateful for his comments. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I apologise to the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale. I had not noticed that one of the amendments was in his name.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 24, page 100, line 1, leave out subsection (3).

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 875, in page 100, line 6, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Provided that no such direction or guidance shall conflict with the purposes of the Authority set out in section 180.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 26, in clause 182, page 100, line 43, leave out subsection (5).

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> This is the amendment to which I briefly referred. If the Secretary of State had been made a consultee, I suspect that there would be no need for him to inflict his guidance. It is perfectly normal for the Secretary of State to issue guidance in these circumstances. In view of the Bill's drafting, the Secretary of State's guidance will become an essential part of the SRA's operation. However, that underlines the fact that the SRA is a creature of the Secretary of State, representing an extension of his power. As always, the danger of excessive Government activity is that it will crowd out the spontaneous private activity that is currently investing in the railway.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Amendments Nos. 24 and 26 would remove the Secretary of State's powers to give directions and guidance on the authority's strategies and the manner in which it is to exercise its functions. The effect would be to remove any influence or direction that the Secretary of State has over the authority and therefore over railway policy more generally.

<P>
The Secretary of State would still be accountable to Parliament for the SRA's activities and expenditure, but could not ensure that Government policy was followed in crucial matters, such as the long-term strategic development of the industry, franchising policy and investment.

<P>
Directions and guidance powers have a precedent in the current objectives, instructions and guidance that the Secretary of State gives to the franchising director. There is also a precedent in the directions and guidance that he gives to regional development agencies on the formulation of their strategies and the exercise of their functions.

<P>
Amendment No. 875 would ensure that the Secretary of State's directions and guidance do not conflict with the SRA's primary purposes. It is unnecessary, as the Secretary of State has no power to give directions and guidance contrary to the SRA's purpose: indeed, such advice would be ultra vires. Our intention remains that the SRA should operate at arm's length from the Secretary of State. It is fundamental that the Secretary of State, acting on behalf of Parliament and the electorate, should have a key relationship with the SRA. We therefore reject the hon. Gentleman's amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 799, in page 100, line 7, leave out subsection (4) and insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4) The Authority shall secure the provision of services in various parts of Great Britain for the carriage of passengers and freight by rail by way of the Channel Tunnel.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I rise briefly to ask the Minister for assurances that the Bill will be as strong in securing the provision of regional Eurostar services as the original channel tunnel legislation that was passed a few years ago.

<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I am rather surprised at the concision of the hon. Gentleman's contribution. Presumably, the ``p'' has expired and the Liberal party believes that there is no money left for regional Eurostars. [
Interruption.] I have been told that, as the hon. Gentleman comes from north of the border, it was a wee ``p'' in the first place.

<P>
Does my hon. Friend the Minister intend to give the Committee details of the Little inquiry into the future of regional Eurostars? Those of us old enough to have been around at the time that the channel tunnel legislation went through the House-I am not sure whether you were a Committee member then, Mr. Gale-will remember that many hon. Members were anxious that the regions should benefit from the project.

<P>
Since, then, we have been overtaken by events. The previous Government neglected to build the channel tunnel to the fast rail link promised at the time and low-cost cut-price air firms have spread. Reduction in air travel time has made the provision of regional Eurostars less attractive.
 
<P>
The hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale did not give us the benefit of his views when he moved the amendment. Regardless of the restoration of the Waverley line, does my hon. Friend the Minister feel that there is much of a market for a regional Eurostar route from Glasgow to Paris with an estimated journey time of six-and-a-half hours, compared with an air journey of perhaps 90 minutes? I am sure that there is a tourist market, which my hon. Friend the Minister may mention. However, few people will be travelling on such a Eurostar on a wet Thursday in November, given that rather unattractive time scale.

<P>
I hope to avoid having another misleading press release sent to our constituencies, attacking luddites on the Labout Benches and praising the progressive nature of the Liberal party. Needless to say, it is always the Liberal party that sends such a press release. Will my hon. Friend the Minister give a detailed explanation of why he will reject the amendment?

<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I have a great deal of sympathy with the sentiments in the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale and also for the views of my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East.

<P>
The SRA should have a strategy that will best serve rail travellers seeking to get to the channel tunnel from outside London. We have recognised that by making explicit provisions in the Bill for the authority to be under a duty to prepare such a strategy. The amendment, which suggests that the authority must secure regional services serving the channel tunnel, may not be practicable and may not be in the interests of rail travellers outwith the south-east of England. It would not necessarily assist the development of the international freight market across Britain.

<P>
Hon. Members will be aware that considerable thought is being given to the best resolution of the regional Eurostar question. My hon. Friend referred to the Little report which we commissioned and which was released in February. The British Railways Board is exercising its functions under section 40 of the Channel Tunnel Act 1987 to prepare a plan setting out the measures that should be taken for Eurostar services serving various parts of the United Kingdom. It may take account of the Little report in its considerations.

<P>
The SRA will then have a duty to prepare a strategy under clause 181(4). That makes adequate provision for ensuring that the interests of passengers and freight are thoroughly met. With that assurance, I trust that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> The channel tunnel rail link has been fraught with difficulties and has lacked credibility for many years.

<P>
I was going to say that I welcomed the remarks of the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East, but that would be pushing it a bit, given the mixed nature of his contribution. Before he gets paranoid, I assure him that I have no desire to send any press releases to his constituency now and for ever more.


<P>
Those who suggested that I table the amendment are concerned about the weakening of the Government's commitment to rail links to the regions, although they accept that there are practical difficulties, as the Minister made clear. However, everyone will have taken note of the hon. Gentleman's words and, on that basis, I beg to seek leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> These amendments are all similar and express our concern about the amount of consultation that the authority will undertake and how it will do it.

<P>
Clause 181(5) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Authority shall publish its strategies in such manner as it considers appropriate.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is not enough. The authority should be tied down to ensure that its strategies, how it determines them and reaches its decisions are communicated to those directly affected. We would like a toughening of the provision to put a greater obligation on the authority to publish its strategies.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I do not propose to shilly-shally on this issue or appease the Committee. I am willing to stand here in isolation.

<P>
This group of amendments is totally unnecessary. They all affect provisions for the publication of some form of information, including the SRA's strategies, the designation of services for franchising, the withdrawal of substitute bus services, the publication of byelaws, penalties, general approvals or minor closures. The amendments would require such information to be brought to the attention of those consulted on the action or information and those likely to be affected by them. Yes, that is why they are to be published.

<P>
Of course the SRA or the Rail Regulator will publish: that is why provision is made for publication. Let me repeat, the SRA is to be the champion of the railway, its voice and its strategic direction. It cannot be a champion or a leader to the industry if its actions are not shared with the industry. We fully acknowledge that. Of course the SRA will, in publishing its strategies, let everyone know who was consulted and take the wider industry and others affected by it into account. Of course, it will let the industry's train operating companies or potential train operating companies know when a service is being designated for franchising. Of course, people will know when a substitute bus service is withdrawn and applications to make byelaws will be announced. That is the whole point of publication, which is not to fill a cupboard with paper.

<P>
Equally, the Rail Regulator will make general determinations under clauses 205 and 211 to be of use to the industry. Regarding either access agreements or minor closures, the system will be made less complex for everyone. All concerned will, I agree, need to know. There would not be much point in imposing a penalty under clause 200 without informing those affected. Put simply, and I repeat the point, these amendments are wholly unnecessary.

<P>
Let me reassure the Committee that if the SRA needs further steers on how to publicise its programme-and from the record of the shadow body, that seems unlikely-it could be achieved through the directions and guidance of the Secretary of State. The Committee should not view the regulator as publicity-shy. With that reassurance, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> My breath is taken away by that diatribe. I am shell-shocked and do not know what to say. We can rest assured that the SRA will have got the message, so I am confident about withdrawing the amendment. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 27, in page 101, line 3, at end add-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(6) Before exercising any powers under this Chapter and prior to each subsequent year that this Chapter remains in force, The Secretary of State shall lay a report for the forthcoming year before both Houses of Parliament for approval by each House, setting out the manner in which he shall exercise his functions under this Chapter, including-<P>

<P>
(b) the calculations the Authority has used to arrive at its conclusions;

<P>
(c) the decisions the Authority will make during the year in question to achieve its objectives.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> I move nervously on to the next group of amendments. They continue the theme of the previous group, only more seriously. We are asking for the Secretary of State, on behalf of the SRA, to lay a report about its plans for the forthcoming year before both Houses of Parliament, which would allow proper scrutiny to take place. As is clear from our debates-particularly from listening to the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale-railway transport is enormously interesting to many people, doubtless in both Houses. Parliamentary scrutiny of the plans is essential and should be built into the Bill to ensure a regular information stream to Members of Parliament.

<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) said that he moved the amendment nervously. He did so with good reason. I have read some daft amendments in my time, but this one takes the biscuit. It would require the Secretary of State to make a detailed report, to obtain advance parliamentary approval for the exercise of every power under the Bill and even to anticipate 12 months in advance every decision that the SRA may take. It is reasonable to expect some anticipation of the sort of decisions that will be necessary, but how the SRA-let alone the Secretary of State-is expected to anticipate every development in rail services in the forthcoming year, I simply do not know. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will recognise, on reflection, that the amendment will not help the efficient government of our railways and that he will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> That is not a satisfactory answer. The Minister takes the amendment literally. It may be defective in some manner. It is clearly nonsensical to suggest that we are asking for dot and comma of the plans to be put before Parliament. We want proper parliamentary scrutiny of the major strategic plans. I am sure that the Minister and his parliamentary draftsmen can make a better job of amending the Bill if the amendment is defective, but it is important that Parliament is not shut out of the important stratetic decisions that will be made in the following 12 months. We are entitled to know, which is why the amendment is important.

<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Amendment No. 27 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Before exercising any powers under this Chapter and prior to each subsequent year that this Chapter remains in force, the Secretary of State shall lay a report.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on to state that the functions will include:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) The decisions the Authority will make during the year in question to achieve its objectives.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for North Essex tell us how any reasonable authority could predict every decision that it would take in the subsequent 12 months? That is preposterous nonsense. I do not object to the principle of accountability; I strongly support it. The Secretary of State will be accountable to Parliament, but the amendment is nonsense as I hope that Opposition Members recognise.

<P>
<B>Mr. Akinson:</B> If the amendment is defective in its details, I apologise to the Minister.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> My hon. Friend should not be apologising to the Committee. If the amendment is defective, it is because I drafted it. [Hon. Members: ``Oh!''] No one has flushed me out. I am prepared to shoulder my responsibility. The Minister is being unreasonably touchy about accountability. Parliament deserves an annual debate on the way in which the SRA exercises its functions. If he would agree to take the amendment away and return with a more reasonable one that meets his requirements, we would be happy to withdraw it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> My hon. Friend anticipates my comments. If the amendment is defective, the Minister can return with some other proposal. We want an opportunity for both Houses of Parliament to consider the SRA's strategic plans for the ensuing year.

<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> If the hon. Gentlemen are worried about accountability, which is our concern, I can reassure them: it is guaranteed. Every year, the authority must prepare a report on its activities under section 75 of the Railways Act, and the Secretary of State must lay that report before Parliament. The amendment is unnecessary and impractical. I hope that the hon. Member for North Essex will now agree, after this over-protracted debate, to withdraw it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The defect of the arrangements as proposed by the Minister is that there is no guarantee of a debate or a vote in Parliament on the performance of the SRA as guided and directed by the Secretary of State. It is his Government's policy to take the new powers and set up the so-called strategic authority. If it is strategic, I should point out that it should not be difficult to divine the sort of decisions that it will take, unless the decisions are less strategic and more detailed than the Government are prepared to admit.

<P>
It seems reasonable that there should be an obligation in the Bill to provide for a debate and a vote on the performance of the SRA. That is accountability, not the Government's producing glossy coloured reports launched at press conferences and quietly laid on the Table of the House of Commons. The Opposition want a proper measure of accountability. That means Ministers appearing at the Dispatch Box to explain the performance of the services for which they are responsible, but the Bill does not provide for that. Will the Minister at least admit that and agree that it would be perfectly reasonable to amend the Bill to provide that a regular debate, with a Division, took place on the SRA's performance?

<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> The lesson learned from that little spat is that the Minister would have got away much quicker if he had been more courteous and considerate. The seriousness of the matter should be reflected in the Bill, so we shall return to it later. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 880, in page 100, line 19, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(in particular in rural areas by means of new franchising arrangements) provided that the Authority shall not exercise its powers to subsidise a service in competition with that operated by an existing franchisee'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment deals with a point that the Conservative party made in its submission to the Select Committee. The Bill will not prevent the SRA from gaining better terms for itself that those of the train operating companies. The SRA should not be a competitor in the franchising process and should only be an operator of last resort. The Government's intention is that the SRA should intervene only if a problem occurs. The SRA should not compete with those companies that wish to operate trains.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Under the clause, the SRA will have a new duty to contribute to achieving sustainable development. That reflects our commitment to deliver a transport system that supports sustainable development: we want transport to contribute to our quality of life, not detract from it.

<P>
The duties under the clause will apply equally in rural areas, so there is no need to single them out for special mention. Sustainable development can be promoted in many ways, not only by means of new franchising arrangements.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> We have singled out rural areas because microfranchises will be most applicable in them. We do not want microfranchises to undermine the viability of main franchises.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am aware of the concern that rural lines are expensive to operate and carry relatively few passengers and that those factors act as a strong disincentive to current operators doing more than their franchise commitments. As part of its franchise renegotiation strategy, the shadow SRA has asked Dr. Paul Salveson-to whom reference was made earlier-who heads the Association of Community Rail Partnerships, to consider the options for microfranchising in rural areas. His final report is expected in June. When the shadow SRA has analysed his report, a proper judgment can be made on whether any of the options might be worth pursuing.

<P>
We shall deal with the operator of last resort, to which the hon. Member for Poole referred, when we debate clause 187. This probing amendment would not contribute to the purposes of the SRA and, in the light of my assurance that we shall deal with such issues later, I urge the hon. Gentleman withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> In the light of Under-Secretary's comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`through competition the provision of good railways services which meet the needs of the public and innovation, efficiency and economy on the part of those providing them;'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment refers to an important quality that is missing from the way in which the authority is expected to exercise its functions. We believe that the authority should promote healthy competition, but the Government thinks that ``competition'' is a dirty word. I am pleased to see the Under-Secretary shake his head-perhaps he will accept the amendment. The Government thinks that competition has contributed to fragmentation, people not talking to each other, hostility and other unpleasant events. However, it is competition, whether direct or not, that is leading to the explosion of innovation on the railways and to the improvement of services for passengers. Yet it is not included in subsection 2 as one of the matters that the authority should bear in mind when exercising its functions. We propose that subsection 2(c) should read:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Authority shall act in the way best calculated-<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) to promote through competition the provision of good railway services which meet the needs of the public and innovation, efficiency and economy on the part of those providing them.

<P>
The SRA is not intended to be a provider except as a last resort. The franchising director currently has an obligation to promote competition, and we want that to be translated to the Strategic Rail Authority.

<P>
</UL></FONT><H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> As the hon. Gentleman has indicated, the amendment would place a new duty on the SRA to exercise its functions in the way best calculated to promote, through competition, the provision of good railway services. The SRA will help to promote the provision of good railway services which meet the needs of the public and, if a competitive process is appropriate, it will be undertaken by the authority. Indeed, where it is appropriate, the authority may be required by its value for money duty, set out in clause 182(4), to see to it.

<P>
Competition will be most appropriate where the authority is in the process of securing services from others. Franchising is an example of that-indeed, companies are currently competing for longer, replacement franchises as part of the franchise replacement process. Through that process the franchising director will secure significant and innovative service improvements.

<P>
However, competition may not be appropriate where the authority is not securing services itself, but is responding to a request from the industry for specific financial assistance, such as an application for a freight facilities grant. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to place the authority under a wider competition duty. It is for the authority to decide what degree of competition is appropriately based on the common-sense application of its value for money duty to the facts and circumstances of each case-and not on any dogmatic requirement for competition.

<P>
The amendment also relates to promoting, through competition, innovation on the part of persons providing railway services. I do not recognise the gloomy portrayal of the SRA as a bottleneck, stifling the industry. The SRA's replacement franchise contracts will remedy weaknesses in existing contracts. The industry will need to innovate if it is to meet the significant service improvements that the franchising director-in future, the SRA-demands. In the light of those observations, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 883, in page 100, line 29, leave out ``enable'' and insert ``provide a stable environment enabling''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 884, in page 100, line 30, leave out from ``businesses'' to end.

<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> This is a probing amendment referring to clause 182(2)(f), which states that the SRA shall do what is best calculated
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to enable persons providing railway services to plan the future of their businesses with a reasonable degree of assurance.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What does ``assurance'' mean? Does it mean time of the franchise? Does it mean money? Does it mean passengers? We think our wording is a bit better, and I shall be interested to hear whether the Minister agrees.

<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> On this amendment, I can say to the hon. Member for Poole that our objectives are broadly similar. However, we believe that the current wording in the Bill is preferable to that in the amendment. I hope that he will accept my explanation and withdraw it.

<P>
The existing wording of the best-calculated duty in subsection (2)(e) matches the existing duty of the regulator under section 4(1)(g) of the Railways Act 1993 and is well precedented in other utilities legislation. I was so pleased to hear again argument A-it has been several weeks since we have been able to use it. The clause strikes the right balance and it is preferable to the formula in the amendment. The SRA should balance the need for companies to plan their business with a reasonable degree of assurance against other considerations in clause 182, since anything more than that is unobtainable.

<P>
We have heard concerns expressed by the Opposition about uncertainty and delay, but nothing can be further from the truth. Our policies were set out clearly in the transport White Paper, in the Railways Bill, in our response to the Select Committee, in directions and guidance given to the franchising director and in the Bill. The franchise replacement process is well under way, and it will remedy the shortcomings of the short-term franchises that we inherited. A range of other measures are in place that I shall not explain, but I assure Opposition Members that we are keen to create the atmosphere best calculated to assure operators that they can plan their business in advance in a stable environment. We share that objective with the Opposition, but we believe that the wording of the Bill is preferable to that of the amendment and is precedented.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(6) In exercising its functions under subsections (1) and (2) the Authority shall have regard to the local transport plans prepared by local authorities in accordance with section 92.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment is self-evident. It sets out exactly what the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for ``St. Reatham'' says that he wants to happen, so I am sure that he will accept it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am in the happy position of having some sympathy with the amendment, without thinking that it represents the right way in which to achieve the aim, or that it is necessary. To start on a positive note, I agree that there must be synergy between local transport plans and the work of the SRA. We want the emphasis to shift to greater inclusiveness and consultation with local and regional government. I look to the SRA to facilitate and lead that consultation, and the shadow SRA has made a good start.

<P>
The SRA's strategies will promote rail use within an integrated transport system. Consistent with that national framework, the strategies will take account of the views of local and regional bodies. The SRA will take decisions about services in the light of local transport plans. That will involve consultation to identify opportunities for rail: for example, the shadow SRA embarked on a major round of regional meetings with local authorities and passenger representatives to discuss franchise replacement plans.

<P>
There are a great many policies, plans and people to which the SRA will have to have regard. It would be unduly cumbersome to specify all of them in the Bill and would detract from the arrangements' flexibility by casting doubt on any that were not so specified. Indeed, there is no need to specify local transport and regional transport plans. The need for local authorities to have regard to the regional transport strategies and the SRA's strategies will be set out in guidance on local transport plans under clause 93(6). Reciprocally, directions and guidance to the SRA may also be used to cover local transport and regional transport plans.

<P>
In addition, the SRA already has a purpose to contribute to the development of an integrated transport system that will include consideration of both local and national integration. I hope that, in the light of my assurances, the amendment will be withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am sure that the Committee will agree that what the Under-Secretary said does not justify a letter home, but the assurance that similar words will be contained in guidance justifies a postcard. With that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Clause 182 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 183</center></H4>
<H4><center>Directions and guidance by Scottish Ministers</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 816, in page 101, line 9, after ``which'' insert ``either''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 817 to 821.
 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Members of the Committee will recall that the Government have agreed to the executive devolution of some railway functions to Scottish Ministers under the agreement known as the McLeish settlement, which was made during the passage of the Scotland Act 1998. That agreement gave Scottish Ministers directions and guidance powers in relation to certain Scottish services, provided they were consistent with the overall Great Britain strategic framework. For cross-border services, which are not Scottish sleeper services, the agreement was that the Scottish Ministers could issue non-binding guidance to the SRA.

<P>
The matter of non-binding guidance was not provided in the Bill as originally drafted because it did not seem to us to require a statutory provision. However, we have agreed that it would be best to clarify the power in the Bill and thus ensure that the fulfilment of the McLeish settlement is transparent.

<P>
The amendments give Scottish Ministers the power to give advice to the SRA on cross-border services. The SRA is under an obligation to take note of advice given in relation to such services. The advice is non-binding-as the McLeish settlement strategies, thus, the SRA may take its own view whether it should follow that advice. However, it is not permitted to give any wieght to that advice if it conflicts with directions and guidance given by the Secretary of State. While the advice is non-binding, it will none the less aid the SRA in taking full account of the Scottish interest without compromising the overall Great Britain strategic view. The advice must be published, which will make it clear and transparent to the industry.

<P>
Amendment No. 818 slightly changes the position in relation to directions and guidance from Scottish Ministers. Under the Bill as originally drafted, the SRA was unable to comply with Scottish directions or guidance because to do so would require expenditure from the non-Scottish budget, or would adversely affect other services. We concluded, however, that there may be cases in which the SRA considers that the proposals are vital in the wider Great Britain interest and wants to carry them through, even though there will be an effect on the general budget. It would be inappropriate if the only issue that prevent the authority from acting was that Scottish Ministers had requested that the action be taken. Accordingly, we propose amending the provision to allow the SRA the appropriate discretion and flexibility.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Amendment made: No. 817, in page 101, line 11, at end insert ``, and

<P>
<B>Dr. Gavin Strang </B>(Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh): I beg to move amendment No. 844, in page 101, line 12, leave out subsections (2) and (3) and insert-

<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 887, in page 101, line 12, leave out subsection (2).
 
<P>
<B>Dr. Strang:</B> My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has already given the Committee a flavour of the problem. It is worth making the point that we now have a powerful Scottish Government who are answerable to a Scottish Parliament in Scotland. It is to their great credit that the Government enacted that settlement. We have also discussed the role and responsibilities of the Welsh Assembly. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan (Mr. Smith). I am sure that he recognises that the situation in Scotland is different from that in Wales because of the power of the Scottish Executive, the authority of the Scottish Parliament, and the fact that we have Ministers with responsibility for education, health, transport and so on, all of whom are answerable to the Scottish Parliament.

<P>
As the Minister reminded us, on 31 March 1998, the former Scottish Office Minister, Henry McLeish, gave an unambiguous commitment that, in relation to passenger rail services that start and end in Scotland, Scottish Ministers would have sole responsibility for issuing objectives, instructions and guidance to the new rail authority. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That responsibility will be exercised within the overall Great Britain stategic policy framework for railways, and will allow Scottish Ministers to instruct the rail authority on matters such as service levels and fares policies, within relevant contractual constraints.-[Official Report, 31 March 1998; Vol. 309, c. 1062.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Mr. McLeish also announced that the Scottish Minister would have similar powers, subject to any adverse impact on services in England, on overnight sleeper services between Scotland and England, and would also be able to offer non-binding guidance on day-time cross-border services. Those ministerial undertakings were consistent with the intended transfer to the Scottish Executive of financial responsibility for funding internal Scottish passenger services and overnight services between Scotland and England.

<P>
Government amendments to clause 183 do not meet those earlier commitments. The clause will allow the SRA-a non-elected quango-to overrule the decisions of democratically accountable Ministers. The constitutional and presentational implications could be enormously damaging and I am sure that the whole Committee will understand that crucial point.

<P>
<H5>7.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The Select Committee on the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs came to similar conclusions about the ambiguity of the SRA's role. In its report of 4 November 1999, the Committee recommended:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Government ensure that discussions take place between itself, the Strategic Rail Authority, Railtrack and the devolved bodies to ensure that Railtrack's relationship with the Authority and the devolved bodies be made clear to the company.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Along with the criticisms of Strathclyde Passenger Transport, the Select Committee received complaints from Railtrack, which claimed:
 <P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There does not appear to be a mechanism to resolve disputes between the SRA and the devolved disputes between the SRA and the devolved institutions and there is a potential danger that Railtrack will find itself caught between two bodies pursuing different agendas.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Again, the Committee should be concerned about that important issue.

<P>
It is conceivable that differences of perspective could arise between the SRA and Scottish Ministers. I would certainly not suggest that the views of Scottish Ministers should prevail over those of the SRA in every instance. In some situations, GB-wide strategic considerations should be given precedence over domestic Scottish requirements. However, the amendment would provide a neutral means of resolving conflicts by ensuring that they are settled by a Minister who is accountable to the Westminster Parliament. Otherwise, we shall end up with legislation that allows a London-based quango to overrule vital strategic decisions of Scottish Ministers without any check or challenge and that permits one party to such potential disputes-the Strategic Rail Authority-to be judge and jury in its own cause.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before we proceed, I noticed that during his remarks, the right hon. Gentleman referred to Mr. McLeish. I wish to make a statement, which can be taken as a ruling and a precedent. As I understand it, Members of the Scottish Parliament refer to each other by name. However, Members of the Scottish Parliament who are still Members of the House of Commons must be referred to by their constituencies, not by their name. The right hon. Gentleman should have referred to his hon. Friend the Member for Central Fife, not to Mr. McLeish.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. Gale, lest I tumble into the same trap. Your ruling is important and probably unprecedented in this Parliament.

<P>
The Committee is indebted to the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh (Dr. Strang) for his efforts to reconcile the conflicts that are built into the compromise brokered by the hon. Member for Central Fife. It is ironic that we are debating this amendment in Committee on a day in which both the major parties lay claim to Britishness-ours with rather more credibility than the governing party's, I venture to suggest, as the governing party has diluted the coherence of the United Kingdom by the establishment of the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly.

<P>
The die is cast for the Scottish Parliament and these issues must be confronted. The settlement that the right hon. Gentleman says has been reached has now got to be bedded in. The problem about these arrangements is that the settlement legislated for does not delegate to the Scottish Parliament primary legislative responsibility for railway matters. If the devolution settlement is to be a settlement, that should have been the end of the matter. However, as we were regularly told during the devolution debate, devolution is a process and not an end in itself. Here we have the process, which is possibly the thin end of an immeasurable wedge.

<P>
I reiterate that we do need to resolve this issue, but whether it is possible to resolve it in the way that the 
<P>
right hon. Gentleman suggests in his amendment I do not know. The other unfairness that this clause is compounding is that by giving powers to give guidance to the Strategic Rail Authority, we are of course entering the territory of the famous or infamous West Lothian question. The right hon. Gentleman, as a Scottish Member of Parliament, will be holding the Secretary of State in this House to account for the guidance that he gives to the Scottish Parliament. However, the hon. Member for Central Fife will also be held to account in the Scottish Parliament for guidance that he is giving to the Strategic Rail Authority. It seems that on questions affecting Scotland, possibly at the expense of questions facing England, the Scottish voter is better represented than the English voter. At no point do I see in this Bill an unfettered right for English Members of Parliament to influence the guidance given to the Secretary of State on English matters or rail services that start and end in England without involving at the same time the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh who is also sitting on this Committee and deliberating on these matters.

<P>
If the devolution settlement is to be extended by successive legislation that establishes new bodies, we do not have a settlement at all. Far from resolving the inherent unfairness that now exists for England in the devolution settlement, we shall be further compounding it. I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about the right hon. Gentleman's amendment, but I should refer briefly to our amendment No. 887. This proposes to leave out subsection (2) altogether because it gives the right for the SRA to disregard any direction that it might receive from Scottish Ministers which is inconsistent with directional guidance given under section 181.

<P>
Our amendment was a probing amendment. Technically, the amendment conflicts with the right hon. Gentleman's amendment, but these are serious questions. A little bit of fiddling and fudging by the Minister, as he re-writes the Bill during its passage through Parliament is not going to resolve it. I foresee that there will be disputes in which the Secretary of State will have to assert the supremacy of United Kingdom guidance over Scottish guidance. It will leave bad blood because the expectation has now been raised that Scottish Ministers are going to be listened to on this matter. It does not help that the Minister who gave the assurance on behalf of the United Kingdom Government is now a Minister responsible for these matters in the Scottish Executive. We have a mess here, and I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The Government and my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh have, I think, the same aim, which is to implement the McLeish settlement on the executive devolution of some railway functions to Scottish Ministers. The Opposition have a different aim, as their amendment would overturn that settlement, but I shall talk about that in a moment.

<P>
I tell my right hon. Friend that I firmly believe that the Government have honoured the McLeish settlement in full. We agreed with Scottish Ministers that the way to preserve the Great Britain policy framework was to ensure that directions and guidance from Scottish Ministers were consistent with those from the Secretary of State. My right hon. Friend does not disagree with that, but he is concerned that the SRA will have to judge between two conflicting sets of directions and guidance and act as judge and jury. He would rather that the Secretary of State be brought in to arbitrate on a conflict. I do not agree that the SRA would act as judge and jury and I do not consider that giving the Secretary of State a further power to arbitrate is a good idea.

<P>
The situation is hypothetical. The SRA must consult Scottish Ministers on their strategies, due to the amendments made to clause 181, and the Secretary of State will consult the Scottish Executive on directions and guidance as well as publishing them. Scottish Ministers will therefore be in a good position to ensure that no directions and guidance conflict and can discuss any concerns with the Secretary of State and the SRA in advance.

<P>
It would be a remote case, but if there were an apparent conflict under the current provisions, the SRA would have to take a view based on the facts of the case and on those facts only. It does not have an unfettered discretion. That judgment of fact could be challenged in court if no reasonable body could have reached it. All the directions and guidance and strategies will be published, so the facts will be public and transparent.

<P>
The SRA is required to comply with Scottish Ministers' directions and guidance unless, on the facts, there is a conflict. That provides greater clarity for all concerned and more effective devolution than would be provided by an arbitration provision to give additional powers to the Secretary of State.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> Will the Under-Secretary give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> No, I will not give way at the moment.

<P>
I shall deal with the Opposition amendment. The overall Great Britain strategic framework is important. Privatisation split the network into a fragmented jigsaw. There was an overall picture, which meant that industry had no direction and the network had no development. We are trying to rectify that problem through the creation of the SRA. That is why my hon. Friend the Member for Central Fife agreed directions and guidance powers within the overall strategic framework. Scottish Ministers can ensure that no directions and guidance conflict. If there is conflict, there must be a means of resolving the problem and maintaining the overall framework. The answer is not to put the SRA in the impossible position of having conflicting guidance. It must have a means of resolution and of carrying forward its strategies.

<P>
On the basis of that explanation, I ask my right hon. Friend to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Dr. Strang:</B> I do not accept that the SRA's powers will not be unfettered. As matters stand, it is judge and jury, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
