[Continuation from column 996] 
<P>
<H5>8.10 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming-- 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Maxton. 
<P>
This may not be a point of order, but it is a quick point that I wish to register with the Minister. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It has to be a point of order. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> It is a point of order on which the Minister may be able to provide help, Mr. Maxton. I apologise for neglecting to make such a point at the start of proceedings today, when some of the Minister's senior officials were here on the day shift. 
<P>
I notice that the Amendment Paper contains about 55 Government amendments and on new clause. An indication of the number of Government amendments that the Minister thinks may be necessary would help Opposition Members to plan their progress over the coming hours, days and weeks. 
<P>
I know that the Minister cannot give me an answer now; I should have registered the matter at an early stage. However, perhaps his officials would reflect on the matter, and later tonight or tomorrow morning we may be told whether to expect a large tranche of Government amendments and new clauses. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. For a start, that is not a point of order, but a matter for the usual channels. I may be marginally misusing my chairmanship, but I fear that those channels are not operating as they usually do. The Minister has obviously heard what the right hon. Gentleman has said, and presumably will reflect on it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 202, in page 16, line 29, leave out "significant" and insert "reasonable". 
<P>
In our previous debate, we touched on some of the matters that I wish to raise in relation to amendment No. 202. I will raise them again only to refresh the Committee's memory about what they are. 
<P>
Amendment No. 202 concerns the circumstances in which a court may release a transporter after someone has applied to a court for its release. The court may release the transporter if satisfactory security is tendered or, as clause 23 (3)(a) states, if 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"there is significant doubt as to whether the penalty is payable and the applicant has a compelling need to have the transporter released."
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Amendment No. 202 is straightforward: it would replace "significant" with "reasonable". Earlier, we had a debate about the meaning of words. However, there is a difference here which may be material in many circumstances, especially those relating to small firms. 
<P>
We think that "significant doubt" is pitching the matter a little high. Committee members will remember that I made observations about a case in which there was some doubt, but not a significant doubt. The person in that case had a compelling need to seek the release of the transporter. I will not flesh out that example further, as I believe that Committee members will remember it. 
<P>
I have already touched on the fact that I find it curious that the Government have put two completely different requirements in clause 23. One of those requirements is doubt as to whether there should be liability, the other a compelling need. It would have been far better for the measure to have been framed in an either-or way, as it will catch some people who have a significant doubt and want their transporter back, but cannot demonstrate that they have a compelling need. On the other hand, other people can demonstrate that they have a compelling need, but not a significant doubt. 
<P>
Our amendment concerns the latter group of people, which is why it replaces "significant" with "reasonable". A compelling need is pitching it high. If someone really has a compelling need or particular reason for the return of his transporter, it is harsh to require him to show significant doubt too. The degree of doubt should be pitched lower. 
<P>
<H5>8.15 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
We are discussing the application made to the court after the penalty notice has been issued to the responsible person, probably at the quayside, and the transporter detained. The responsible person wants to get his vehicle back and the clause provides for the opportunity for him to go to court. If he can show significant doubt and a compelling need, he can get the transporter back. He will not have to establish significant doubt in court because subsection (3) states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The court may release the transporter if it considers that . . . there is a significant doubt".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The burden of proof is not on the person concerned as it is in the other cases that we discussed. In this case, he does not have to show anything if the court 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"considers that . . . there is a significant doubt".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The proposal is curiously worded because if the court thinks that there is significant doubt whether the penalty is payable it will release the transporter but only for the time being, until the Secretary of State can determine the issue, as the Minister will confirm. We are talking about getting the transporter back after it has been detained, not about determining whether the penalty is payable. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien indicated dissent. </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister now shakes his head, although he agreed with me a moment ago. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The issue is detaining the transporter until the penalty is paid. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister is right; I assumed that he was following my argument in the case of a person who wanted to dispute the liability. I shall take the matter back a stage: the person concerned has been issued with a penalty notice because he is alleged to have been bringing in clandestine entrants. His vehicle has been detained and he wants it back so he goes to court, disputing liability. He establishes significant doubt that he has to pay the penalty and the transporter is released to him. He issues a notice of objection to the penalty and his case then has to be determined by the Secretary of State. How can the Secretary of State consider that the penalty should be paid when, in the minds of the court, having adjudicated on the matter, there is significant doubt about it? That is what is curious. Of course, in order for the court to consider that there is significant doubt, it will have to look at the circumstances and the facts of the case. If the court has considered whether there is significant doubt it has obviously considered the facts of the case, which then goes to the Secretary of State. 
<P>
How can the Secretary of State reach a conclusion that is at variance with the court? Would not that turn everything upside down? A court has found significant doubt, and the transporter has been released; the matter goes to the Secretary of State who decides that the penalty should still be imposed because the person concerned has brought in clandestine entrants. The Secretary of State will have made the decision that the penalty is payable on the basis of the civil standard of proof, about which we heard earlier. 
<P>
There is enormous confusion in the clause. If there is significant doubt in the mind of the court, how on earth can the Secretary of State find to the contrary later? I should like to hear the Minister's view because it seems to be a bit of a nonsense. It is pitching it too high for the clause to state "significant doubt". If it stated "reasonable doubt" it would leave matters open for the Secretary of State to consider. That is looking at things from the Government's point of view. It would still be open to the Government to look at it in the following way: the court finds there is reasonable doubt so the transporter is released. The matter goes to the Secretary of State who concludes that it is more likely than not that the person is responsible and therefore the penalty is payable. That makes matters just about reconcilable. To leave the clause as it is will only cause confusion. 
<P>
The concept of reasonable doubt is well known to the courts, so it will be easier for them to interpret than significant doubt. A High Court judge will hear the case--he will obviously be familiar with the term "reasonable doubt". In one well-known case, a leading legal text book states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A reasonable doubt is a doubt based upon good reason and not a fanciful doubt, as the sort of doubt which might affect you in the conduct of your everyday affairs."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If someone can show that amount of doubt about whether they are liable to pay, their transporter should be released until the Secretary of State can fully consider whether it is more likely than not that the penalty is payable. That is a much better way of putting it, for three reasons: first, reasonable is a lesser threshold than significant; secondly, because it will be more familiar to the courts; and thirdly, it avoids the confusion of the courts prejudging something that will be decided by the Secretary of State. 
<P>
Reasonable doubt is less than the civil standard of more likely than not, thus the two will be reconcilable; as the clause stands, they are not reconcilable. The heavens will not fall in or the earth open up if the Government accept the amendment, but it would make the measure more reasonable. I invite the Minister to consider it carefully. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> The Government are getting into a wee bit of a pickle. I can understand how it happened; they want to have the toughest possible legislation, with the fewest possible get-outs. In trying to draft a catch-all in this and other clauses, they have made a mistake that they may live to regret. There are two limbs in the proposal--there must be a significant doubt whether the penalty is payable, and the applicant must have a compelling need to have the transporter released. 
<P>
My first point relates to the use of the word "significant" No doubt the Minister will inform me that "significant" is a term that occurs in other legislation instead of "reasonable". If he quotes the example of criminal justice acts passed before May 1997 in which the word "significant" was inserted instead of "reasonable", I can only blame myself for not paying attention to the proper civil liberties of the subject. 
<P>
I should be grateful if the Minister would quote other examples of legislation in which the word "significant" has been used in place of the word "reasonable". He may be trying to create new terminology for the law, and a new body of case law will have to be set up at a much higher threshold. We all know the example of the man on the Clapham omnibus, which is the test of reasonableness. There will have to be a new test of significantness if the courts are to determine what is significant doubt as opposed to the tried and tested concept of reasonable doubt. That concept is known throughout our judicial system on both sides of the border, although it may sometimes be better applied north of the border. It is a well understood term. The Minister thinks that he is substituting that term for one with a higher threshold. In the dictionary and in ordinary usage, significant doubt must be a much higher threshold than reasonable doubt. But as far as I know it has not been legally interpreted; we have no idea how the courts might interpret it in terms of legislation on immigration or the detention of vehicles. It may apply in other statutes, and I should be interested to see the case law showing how judges have interpreted "significant doubt". They may regard "significant doubt" as the highest threshold that is almost impossible to prove. It may be a couple of notches above reasonable. But we need to know how "significant doubt" will be applied, any examples of its use in legislation and how it has been interpreted, if it has been. 
<P>
Another point that I want to make is marginal but relevant. It seems a little unfair that in clause 21 the Secretary of State must take "reasonable steps" to secure the penalty notice, but in this clause the court must be satisfied that there is "significant doubt" before the applicant can get his transponder back. Therefore, the Secretary of State must take not signifcant or important steps but simply reasonable steps, but for the guy concerned--the potential criminal, or the victim if innocent--there must be significant doubt. 
<P>
That is another small example of the way in which the legislation will be perceived to be stacked in favour of the driver or the haulage operator. There is no harm in that if he is guilty, but the Committee must ensure that there are not only adequate penalties and deterrents for the guilty but systems that do not impinge on the innocent and create additional penalties for those who find themselves wrongly accused and have to spend a great deal of time and money trying to prove their innnocence under the Bill. If reasonable steps are good enough for the goose of the Home Secretary, they may be good enough for the gander of the transporter owner. 
<P>
My final point relates to the twin hurdles in subsection (3)(b)--"significant doubt" and "a compelling need". Why has the Minister included both? Could they not be separated? If the court says that there is "significant doubt", is that not a good enough reason to release the transponder, even if there was no compelling need? A court of this land may conclude that there is doubt whether the Government can confiscate or detain someone's property--[Interruption.] The court may conclude that there is significant doubt that that high threshold is satisfied. Let us assume for the moment that we are not successful in persuading the Minister to insert "reasonable" and that, reasonable man though the Minister is, he insists on sticking with "significant". If a person goes to court and satisfies the extraordinarily high hurdle of "significant", surely in those circumstances he should get his transponder back--transporter. Being an avid fan of "Star Trek", I got carried away and muddled up my transponder and my transporter. No doubt some Labour Members wish I could be beamed up to Deep Space 9 any minute now. [Interruption.] If the clause said "vehicle" rather than "transporter", it would be much easier, but I presume that transporter applies to vehicles, small ships and small aircraft. I apologise for getting the Government's terminology wrong. 
<P>
Surely if a person satisfies the hurdle of significant doubt, he should be entitled to his or her transporter back, because that is not the end of it: the penalty still applies and the Secretary of State can still pursue him or her for the full amount of the penalty, which is not cancelled in the meantime. 
<P>
I shall not comment similarly on the points that my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere made about the other doubt that might exist. If the court rules, "Yes there is significant doubt and there is compelling need, and yes, you can have your transponder back", the Home Secretary could reply, "We are still going for the penalty and we do not accept that there was significant doubt." The individual may refuse to pay and would thereby trigger the appeal mechanism of refusing to pay and would be sued by the Government for the penalty. 
<P>
In court, it will presumably emerge from the evidence that a few weeks before the judge ruled that there was significant doubt whether the penalty was payable. The individual will say, "I got my transponder back and the Home Secretary is still after the money." It is extraordinary. [Interruption.] I am happy to be chided by you, Mr. Maxton, if I have got it wrong or am out of order or am being tedious or repetitious.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> I would never describe the right hon. Gentleman as tedious, but the last word he used probably adequately describes his speech. 
<P>
<H5>8.30 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I apologise for being repetitive. I thought that some Opposition Members might not have heard my contribution when they were attempting to drown out my remarks. I wanted a nice guy like the Minister to be able to show that he had heard and understood what I had to say. Not being a lawyer I appreciate that I have not described the concept in proper legalese. I tried to explain it in simple language which even I can understand. 
<P>
The Minister has a potential muddle here. If he sticks with the significant doubt and the compelling need he has the muddle my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere described when people have to go to the court to challenge the Home Secretary on the penalty. My concern is that the word "significant" is too high a threshold and clause 23(3)(b) should be separated, and "significant doubt" or whatever term he accepts should stand on its own and "compelling need" should be a third limb. 
<P>
If a court rules that a lorry driver or a transporter operative has satisfied the Minister's threshold of significant doubt, surely to goodness he should be entitled to get his vehicle back in those circumstances so that the Home Secretary can still go after him for the readies. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I intend to be brief following the eloquent case put by my right hon. Friend. I support amendment No. 202 as "significant" is too high a threshold. I think that "reasonable doubt" sounds better. In fact, I might omit the "reasonable". It would probably be all right if there was merely a doubt whether the penalty was payable. As for "compelling need", I do not like "need" much. I would prefer "compelling reason" to have the transporter released. That is all that I intend to say. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Member for Hertsmere was candid in saying that he was seeking to reduce the test in the clause. I have already explained my concerns on the broad principles about risking whether the penalty would be paid. Detaining the vehicle is the process by which we secure some liability and reduce the risk that the taxpayer would not be able to recover the money that the legislation should enable him to recover. The clause hangs on the protection of the taxpayer. We do not want the security for the taxpayer taken away unnecessarily or without a proper cause. 
<P>
Clause 23(3)(b) quite properly has two limbs and the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border suggested that we should separate them and reduce even further than the hon. Member for Hertsmere suggested the security that the taxpayer would seek to have for payment of the penalty. We want to ensure that the taxpayer's rights are protected and that is why we want a subsection like (3)(b) which has two limbs, both of which are necessary. 
<P>
Amendment No. 202 would introduce a different test as to the doubt that needs to be shown before a court may release a transporter where a compelling need for the release is shown. There will always be an element of dispute about whether a civil penalty is payable. We intend, by using the word "significant", to require that a real doubt--a material doubt in the circumstances--is to be shown without the court having to come to a conclusion about the arguments, even to the extent of assessing whether they are reasonable. We intend to keep the application, which is intended to be a quick remedy for those with a transporter, as simple as possible. Therefore do not accept the amendment. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere suggested a series of possible scenarios. Let us consider what is likely to happen. A vehicle is likely to be detained for a short period while doubts about the ability of the person to pay the penalty are resolved. There is no interest in detaining the vehicle longer than that. If a couple of clandestines were found on the back of a vehicle and it was decided to detain it because of doubts whether the penalty would be paid, and the following day the owner was able to provide a guarantee and deposit--even though he might later want to argue about it--that is the sort of thing that might well happen. 
<P>
In practice, few vehicles will be detained for more than a day and we hope that none will be detained, which is the whole purpose of the policy. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Will the Minister give way on that point? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Let me give way later when I have finished my argument. 
<P>
As I said, it is unlikely that many vehicles will be detained for very long and it is likely that those who want their vehicles returned would be able to achieve that--even if there were a dispute about paying the penalty--by providing some deposit or security, which would be held in escrow until a decision was made. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's point is that the penalty notice will be served, representations will be considered and at this point, he believes, the court will be asked to intervene. It is possible in a lengthy consideration of representations that a person may wish to go to court quickly to release the vehicle, perhaps because it contains perishable goods. The hon. Gentleman argued that, because the court would have to consider the matter and decide that there were significant doubts, the Secretary of State could not conclude that the penalty be paid. 
<P>
That is not the case. All that the court is assessing under clause 23(3)(b) is whether there is a significant doubt. The Secretary of State can take the view that, on the balance of probabilities, the penalty is nevertheless owed, notwithstanding the existence of significant doubt--so can a court in any action brought by the Secretary of State to recover the penalty. 
<P>
That issue is different: the hon. Member for Hertsmere has not quite made the case that he believes he has. He put his case with care and I listened to it with care. Rather than dismiss it entirely, I would prefer to reflect on it and perhaps write to him after I have examined in greater depth how this provision is going to operate. 
<P>
I do not accept the amendment proposed by the hon. Member for Hertsmere and I do not want to weaken the test that needs to be applied. However, the hon. Gentleman made an interesting point about the court's decision and I want to be satisfied that the court will not take a decision that could restrain or constrain the Secretary of State from taking a decision about whether the penalty is payable. 
<P>
As I said, I will reflect further and write to the hon. Gentleman, but I do not want to raise his hopes for the amendment and I will not water down or weaken the test. As I said, he raises an issue on which I would like to think further. On that basis, I hope that he will withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Dare I say it but the Minister's response was reasonable and in the fullness of time I hope that it will also be significant. It is good to have a dialogue. The Minister will consider the matter, and I shall not prolong our discussions with further argument, but I want to leave one or two points in his mind while he examines the matter. I agree with the Minister that the provision will affect few people, but I want to consider those exceptional cases. 
<P>
At the beginning of his remarks, the Minister mentioned the taxpayer's interests, which we must all consider. However, at the end of his comments, he said that there would be few cases. Therefore, although any amount of public money is important, we are not contemplating massive amounts. If the Minister takes the course that I recommend, it may prove to be a means of avoiding unnecessary expenditure. 
<P>
The Minister took my point about the incompatibility of the court's decision on liabiity with that of the Secretary of State. The Minister agrees that there is more room between my formulation of "reasonable doubt"  and "more likely than not". We all know about cases that are determined differently in civil and criminal courts. There is less room between "significant doubt" and "more likely than not". 
<P>
Let us consider the case of a person who is aggrieved about a decision and questions liability. He will go to court and get his transporter released under subsection (3)(b) . However, although the transporter has been released, he has not been found not liable. The matter will go to the Secretary of State, who may reach a different decision. I am worried that the person will be even more aggrieved if that happens, and that, if we leave any legal loopholes, the matter will be back before the courts, perhaps through judicial review, with all the attendant public expense. 
<P>
"However, I am grateful to the Minister for his response. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I hope that I may ask the Minister a couple of questions before my hon. Friend withdraws the amendment. 
<P>
I am grateful to the Minister for his offer. He rejected some of my points on the basis of protecting the taxpayer's interest. We all agree that the taxpayer should be protected. However, it is a bit much to claim that, if we change the provision to allow the court to return the lorry in cases of significant doubt, the taxpayer's interest may be severely jeopardised. 
<P>
The clause allows the Government to detain goods to help them to ensure that a civil penalty is paid. Customs and Excise has draconian powers, but it cannot detain goods if VAT is due or it is owed money. It has tremendous powers to put people out of business, and it is usually first in line to get its money. How many other examples exist of organs of the state, or the courts detaining goods in advance in case someone does not pay a fine? 
<P>
The provision contains a draconian power. Ministers justify not separating "significant doubt" and "compelling need" by saying that the taxpayer's interest must be protected. I agree with protecting those interests. How could the taxpayer's interest be undermined while the right to sue, get the money and sell goods exists? The Government, or any person, are entitled to obtain money that is owed to them. If a company was sued for health and safety reasons, or by Customs and Excise, or for not paying national insurance contributions, the Government have the right to take its goods, sell them, clean it out and get the money. If the company refused to pay the fine, the Government would have the right to sue it. If the company lost, the Government would be entitled to recover £2,000, £4,000 or £102,000; the goods and full expenses. The taxpayer would not lose out. It may be administratively more convenient to hang on to the guy's lorry, but the Minister cannot use the argument that we must protect the taxpayer. The taxpayer is protected when the fine is paid, and the Government have full powers to get that.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Customs and Excise can detain vehicles, and it does so regularly. We do not intend to detain goods. 
<P>
On the point about the powers to sue being adequate, I have already mentioned overseas hauliers and it is possible to imagine circumstances in which someone might be able to avoid paying a penalty. He might face a large penalty because he carried in quite a few clandestines, and he could sell his vehicle, go to ground and not pay the taxpayer. This clause is about protecting the taxpayer and it represents the right approach. We need the tests and the protections that are in it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I should he grateful if the Minister would write to me before Report because I want to think about what he might say. I shall consider the issue in light of that. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien indicated assent. </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister suggests that he will write, and I am grateful to him. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 205, in page 16, line 34, leave out "56" and insert "84". 
<P>
I hope that I shall do even better with this amendment. Clause 23(4) states that if a court does not order the release of a transporter, the Secretary of State may sell a detained transporter if the penalty is not paid within 56 days. The amendment would lengthen that period and would give the person liable a bit more time to pay. He would have 84, rather than 56 days, in which to pay. 
<P>
The Minister is interested in saving the taxpayer money, and the amendment would not affect the taxpayer very much one way or another. If the worst comes to the worst, the transporter will be sold. Although the Government will not keep all the money that comes from its sale--I imagine that in most cases that will be more than the liable amount--under schedule 1(5), any proceeds arising from the sale will go in various ways, including back to the person who had an interest in the transporter. 
<P>
The amendment is not about money. Hardly any money will be at stake unless the Secretary of State wants to receive the interest due between 56 and 84 days. I doubt whether that would make a tremendous difference. However, extending the time limit could make a big difference to a small operator who has difficulty in getting money together at short notice. The earth would not fall in if the Minister accepted the amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I support the amendment. It would give more time to someone in difficulty to raise money without having to make a sale with all the fees connected with that. 
<P>
Earlier my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East mentioned the phrase "connected expenses", which appears in the clause. Will the Minister tell us what that phrase means? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The amendment would increase from 56 to 84 days the length of time that the owner of a transporter had to pay any penalty and connected expenses before the Secretary of State could sell the transporter. 
<P>
The period of 56 days is the same as that contained in the Civil Aviation Act 1982, which deals with the sale of aircraft detained because of the failure to pay airport charges. I understand that the proposed longer period would give owners more time to arrange payment. However, the sentiments behind the amendment might be misguided. The longer a transporter is detained, the higher the expenses connected with its detention will be. That means that, if the transporter is ultimately sold, the owner will receive even less money. The amendment might damage the interests of those whom it seeks to help. The hon. Gentleman suggests that it will give the haulier more time to get his money, but, if he cannot get the money within the 84 days, it might result in his not getting so much money. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is not helping the hauliers in the way that he suggests. Does he know the views of the Freight Transport Association and the Road Haulage Association? I would be surprised if the amendment were proposed by those organisations. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> May I help the Minister? I shall be quite honest: no, I do not know their views. I was simply asking for a little more time to pay because I thought that 56 days was rather tight. If the Minister will consult the road haulage industry on that point and then write to me, I shall take the matter no further. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I have no doubt that the haulage associations will be monitoring this debate, and that they will approach me if they want to raise that issue with me, so I shall not initiate a discussion. In broad principle, having the same time as in civil aviation is a good idea. I believe that 56 days is entirely reasonable and not at all excessive. I am not convinced that it is in the interests of the hauliers to have a longer period. Indeed, it may damage their interests. 
<P>
I am not disposed to reconsider the matter, but if the haulage organisations want to discuss it with me further, I shall be perfectly happy to do so. We shall consider any representations that they make. I reiterate that I have no doubt that they are monitoring our debates day by day. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere asked about connected expenses. They are defined in subsection (6) and relate mostly to the removal and storage of the vehicle. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I do not want to take too much time, but I wish to press the Minister a little further. I was slightly disappointed by his immediate response to my intervention, because I wanted to bring matters to a head there and then, and I thought that that was a reasonable way of doing it. 
<P>
The Minister said that he will not accept the amendment because he does not think that it is in the interests of the hauliers. I thought that it was in their interests, but I am not sure. Why not consult them? They know better than anyone else what their interests are. I would be quite happy if the Minister would consult the hauliers and then write to me. However, I would like to hear from the Minister the results of that consultation. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I put my objection on two grounds. First, 56 days is reasonable and not excessive; it is similar to other legislation and we should stick with it. Secondly, the amendment is misguided; it is not in the interests of the hauliers. 
<P>
On reflection, however, I shall write to the hauliers to hear their view, and send the hon. Member for Hertsmere a copy of any replies. I have two reasons for taking that view. The fact that the hauliers may take a different view does not necessarily mean that I will accept an amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> The Minister has given a good reply. If someone cannot redeem a vehicle quickly--they are valuable assets and the means by which hauliers earn their living--either he will have gone bust, or there is another problem. It would be extraordinary if the vehicle had to be sold. Unless there are multiple fines, the connected expenses will probably be rather larger than the fine. Keeping a vehicle secure and insured in a coastal area will be a heavier burden. Therefore, I was fully satisfied with the Minister's response. I reassure him that I shall vote with him if the amendment is pressed to a Division. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> To thwart a Back-Bench rebellion, and in response to the Minister's reasonable remarks, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
Amendment made: No. 45, in page 16, line 38, leave out "detention and".--[Mr, Mike O'Brien.] 
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The clause deals with what a person whose vehicle has been detained can do about it. We are concerned that it is part and parcel of a system of detention that, in many ways, will be unfair to those who are subject to it. Those subject to the regime, and human rights organisations, are concerned about it. For example, Justice states 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The remedy available to a person whose transporter has been detained in the form of a challenge in court, is an ineffective remedy, given the serious prejudice will already have occurred ... and the fact that the court cannot provide any remedy for any losses sustained as a result of the transporter's seizure."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 Other organisations have commented as well. The Committee is familiar with those points, and I shall not go over that ground again, but I put our views firmly on the record. 
<P>
I shall take this opportunity to explore the important issue, which put its head above the parapet in an earlier debate, of the court before which such proceedings will be brought. The Minister will remember that we briefly touched on that matter in an earlier debate. The person whose transporter has been detained must go to court to try to get it back. As I thought would be the case, we have established that that person must go to the High Court--under clause 28, which deals with the interpretation of part II. I do not understand why that should be so, especially as we hear many complaints that the High Court is clogged with too much business. Will the Minister reconsider that requirement? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman has tabled amendment No. 215, which deals with that point. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have, but the Minister will know that the interpretation clause will apply to courts throughout these provisions. We shall return to such matters later, especially if he wants to, but I want to make a specific point about the clause. The Minister referred to the detailed rules that will govern such procedures. I would like to know about those rules of procedure. How easy will people find it to avail themselves of them? During what time scale will the various procedures kick in? 
<P>
Why should such cases be brought before the High Court, rather than county courts or even magistrates courts? I know that a civil penalty is involved, but such cases could still be heard in county courts, or even in magistrates courts, which also deal with civil matters. The character of the provision would not be compromised. 
<P>
It will be intimidating for a lorry driver to be told that he must go to the High Court to do anything about the detention of his lorry. What affect will that have on someone, given all the expenses and so on that will be involved? The Minister owes us an explanation.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The courts' rules will be a matter for the courts and the appropriate bodies to work out in due course. The hon. Gentleman asked why such cases will go before the High Court. The value of the transporter is likely to be such that those cases will end up in the High Court in any event. Such vehicles are often very valuable. It would be appropriate for the court to deal with the matter. I shall reflect on the issue to see whether there is an argument for a county court, or other court in Northern Ireland or Scotland, to examine such cases and, depending on when we reach clause 28, I may have reached a decision. If I have not had sufficient time by then to consider the issue, I shall write to the hon. Gentleman. 
<P>
<H5>9 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> The term "transporter" almost implies that it is a single vehicle, but a heavy goods vehicle is made up of a cab and a trailer. If the immigration authorities simply kept the cab, that would more than likely cover the costs. Within the Bill is provision for someone who owns the cargo of the vehicle to move it and, if the immigration service always detains the cab and the trailer, there will be the problem at port of trans-shipping loads from a detained vehicle to another vehicle. That brings with it problems of security, goods moving at port and inconvenience. If possible, it would be sensible just to detain the cab, let the trailer go off with another vehicle, and sort out the liability. That would also be practical in terms of space, storage and efficiency and would have a material effect on connected expenses. I hope that my comments will be taken on board. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) made a valid point. Unless there were 100 clandestines and the trailer were dirt cheap, the value of the trailer would infinitely exceed the amount of the penalty. When the load is removed and one a or two clandestines are involved, in the majority of cases the trailer on its own should be worth more than the level of the fine. I hope that the Under-Secretary would conclude that, in all cases, he would accept the trailer and let the tractor unit--the £40,000 or £50,000 bit--do its other duties and pick up other trailers. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> To save the hon. Gentleman repeating the point made by the hon. Member for Poole, the objective of the clause is to provide security and, as long as it covers the value of the penalty, that would be the main concern of the authorities. He need not seek to convince me any more on that point. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I am delighted. My only justification for repeating the point--[Interruption.] I have to repeat it, because of those who are not with us at present in the Strangers Gallery and who represent organisations that gave evidence in earlier proceedings. They have told us that, although they were initially impressed by the Government's willingness to listen and to conduct Select Committee proceedings, they feel that the Government are not now making much headway. I can only conclude that this listening Government have not heard what we and others have said, which is why I must repeat our argument. 
<P>
I shall not vote against the clause. I am happy for it, or at least 90 per cent. of it, to remain in the Bill. However, I regret that, apart from the few exceptions when the Minister said that he would be willing to think about certain matters, some changes need to be made to the clause. It stacks things too much in favour of the Secretary of State and against the innocent person who is accused of bringing in clandestines. 
<P>
Of course, we must bear in mind the interests of the taxpayer and the fact that the law needs to be enforced. A law that cannot be enforced and which lets evil people get away with a crime is a bad law. We have spent many years in this place, on different sides, always trying to tighten legislation, because as soon as we make one improvement, some guy finds a way round it. We are always trying to bear down on criminality. 
<P>
In this Bill, the Minister is bearing down on a newish problem, which is about lorry drivers or other transporters bringing in clandestine immigrants. A balance must be struck between the innocent and racketeers. I would have no qualms with any of this if I knew that on every occasion, racketeers would be caught. I am happy that an almost impossible pressure--not a significant or a reasonable one, but a dashed near impossible pressure--will be put on racketeers, so that criminals are punished. 
<P>
However, we have to think about whether someone may be innocent--I certainly had to think of such things when I was in government. What if a lorry driver has been duped or has acted under duress? In those circumstances, although we must make sure that the law bears down on criminals, taxpayers' interests must be protected against those who are ultimately found guilty. We should not stack the odds so far against those who might be innocent. 
<P>
That is why I believe that the significant power in the clause is a little too strong and the subsections are a little tough. I hope that, as the Minister reflects on some of the points raised by my hon. Friends, he will reflect on my remarks, too. I refer now to the connected expenses, such as court and detention costs. Will the Minister confirm that the detention costs of storing the trailer will vary, depending on where it is stored and the charging rates for storage? Does he envisage a standard detention cost of, say, £10, £20, £50 or £100 a night? Will it be infinitely more expensive to store a lorry trailer at Dover than at Silloth-on-Solway in Cumbria, for example? Will the charges vary, depending on local charges for a secure lorry park or for whatever other facilities the Minister chooses? In many ways, that could be a deterrent, but it could be disastrous if someone brings in a lorry through one port and the overnight storage charges for the trailer are £100, but £10 or £20 in another place. 
<P>
My final point refers to schedule 1. I appreciate that the Minister may not have an answer to hand, but I shall be happy to have his response later in our proceedings tonight, if that is in order, or in writing. Paragraph 5 of schedule 1 refers to the "proceeds of sale". 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It would be convenient if the hon. Member saved the discussion on schedule 1, as we shall be coming to it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> In that case, I am content, Mr. Maxton. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Clause 23 provides the necessary safeguards and I commend it to the Committee. 
<P>
In response to the remarks of the hon. Member for Poole, I have already said that the immigration service should be able to maintain security. The point that he made about the value of the cab and the trailer is valid, and I am with him in principle on that issue. Detention costs will be dealt with on the usual basis. It is already the practice of Customs and Excise and others to detain vehicles, and we will no doubt follow similar principles. We shall discuss schedule 1 later. 
<P>
Question put and agreed to. 
<P>
Clause 23, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill. 
<H4><center>Clause 24 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Assisting illegal entry and hourbouring </center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 208, in page 17, line 8, after "acquitted", insert-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"or all charges have been withdrawn".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have now moved on to a clause that covers a different subject. The amendment is designed to deal simply with what we think is a drafting error. If the Minister can provide me with a good explanation, I will he easily persuaded to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
The clause concerns the procedure for detaining ships, aircraft and vehicles after a person has been arrested for the criminal offence of assisting illegal entrants under section 25 of the Immigration Act 1971. I hope that the Minister will now tell me that he agrees with my amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I cannot tell the hon. Gentleman that I agree with the specific wording of the amendment, but I think that it identifies an issue that we need to look at. Perhaps if I can get due process and legal advice from the parliamentary draftsmen on how to deal with the problem, we can make progress. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am as good as my word. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 224, in page 17, line 18, leave out "claims" and insert "appears". 
<P>
Again, this will be a short point about something that looked strange in the Bill and that I thought should be examined. As I said, clause 24 concerns vessels being detained after someone has been arrested. In cases where the vehicle belongs to someone other than the person arrested, the Bill provides for another person to come forward and apply for the vehicle's release under proposed new section 25A(3), which says 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A person (other than the arrested person) who claims be the owner of a ship, aircraft or vehicle which has been detained under this section may apply to the court for its release."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I was a little concerned by the use of the word "claims", because I thought that it should be established properly that the person seeking the vehicle's release is the owner. It should not be sufficient for people to claim to be the owners; they should have to establish that they are the owners. One would not want a terrible situation in which someone was arrested, a vehicle was detained, and as some sort of fraud another person who was not the vehicle owner claimed to be and was able to obtain it. That would give rise to newspaper headlines, which should be avoided. I look for an explanation from the Minister. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I assure the hon. Gentleman that the immigration service will make every effort to ensure that the person who claims to be the vehicle owner is the vehicle owner. However, I do not want the immigration service, having made the various attempts at investigation that it reasonably can, to be the subject of a claim because an error is made. We hope that no error will be made in such circumstances. 
<P>
We do not accept the amendment, but the hon. Gentleman's point that we should always carry out the necessary checks to ensure that the person claiming to be the owner is the proper owner is entirely valid.

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I would not expect the Minister to write to me on the subject, but I expect him at least to take it away and reflect on it. In those circumstances I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
<H5>9.15 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 46, in page 17, line 31, leave out

<P>

<P>
(iii) if he has been charged and proceedings for the offence are being heard, the court hearing the proceedings;".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 47. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Amendments Nos. 46 and 47 will make clearer which is the appropriate court when seeking the release of a vehicle, ship or aircraft that has been detained in cases of the facilitation of illegal entry. At present, subsection (5) of new section 25A of the Immigration Act 1971 specifies the courts concerned, which vary in different parts of the United Kingdom. 
<P>
It is necessary to make clearer the appropriate court for cases arising in England and Wales and Northern Ireland. The amendments spell out that the relevant court in England and Wales and Northern Ireland is the Crown Court, where the associated criminal proceedings are heard. They also provide that, in other cases in England and Wales, the appropriate court is the magistrates court for the petty sessional area in which the arrest took place, the defendant was charged, or the case is proceeding. In Northern Ireland, the equivalent to the petty sessional area is the county court division. I invite the Committee to agree to the amendments. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I heard what the Minister said. Why would the proposal make life easier for the immigration service or the police in enforcing the provision? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> It would give clarity to the law, and ensure that the police and the immigration service knew which courts were dealing with matters. Obviously, the civil penalty issues do not require similar elaboration, as the criminal courts are not involved. The amendments make clear which courts are involved. It is a straightforward matter, and I cannot add anything to it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The proposal may add to the clarity of the Bill, but it will not change the substance of the provision. Will not it make the work of the immigration service or the police more difficult because they will have to go to a higher court despite a local court being available? Will the Minister assure me on that? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We want to ensure that the immigration service knows precisely to which court it can go. All that the amendments provide is guidance. It is not a difficult matter. The amendments represent a perfectly straightforward insertion, to clarify the Bill's provisions. I cannot envisage that it will put any burden on the immigration service. I am not sure that I follow the hon. Gentleman's argument. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I do not want to labour the point. I refer to the Northern Ireland jurisdiction. I know that we have no Northern Ireland Members on the Committee, but they are always extremely sensitive to the interests of Northern Ireland being borne in mind. We have the opportunity to probe the Government, to make sure that life is not being made especially difficult for those who have to administer the provisions in Northern Ireland--because they are as important in Northern Ireland as they are in other parts of the country. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The situation in Northern Ireland is already clear. If a person has been charged and proceedings are being heard in Northern Ireland, we do not need to add anything to the Bill. We are satisfied that the Bill, if amended, will deal with such issues. There is no separate Northern Ireland issue. However, I shall reflect on what the hon. Gentleman has said, and if there is any need, return to the subject. It is clear that the court is one of summary jurisdiction. I do not think that the point is worth labouring. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I do not want to labour the point. I am grateful to the Minister for his response. It is always best if different arrangements for different parts of the United Kingdom are made at the beginning; it should not seem that interests have been overlooked. I do not suggest that that is what has happened in the Bill, but it is how things might look. It is always best to get things right at the beginning, because a Northern Ireland Member may read the Bill and decide that it contains nothing of any interest to him, yet that might change materially. 
<P>
I take the Minister's word on the matter. I shall not pursue the matter any further. 
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> As I said earlier, the clause moves into different territory. It is important to draw a distinction between carriers' liability, which we discussed with the necessary care, and the criminal liability of people engaged criminal activities. The offence covered by the clause has been a criminal offence since 1971, when it was created. In the light of some comments made in our debate, we are strongly in favour of tough action against people involved in racketeering. We urge the Government to go further in that regard and we will look carefully but sympathetically at proposals that will help bring such people to justice, including the detention of ships, aircraft and vessels. Such proposals must always be fair and subject to scrutiny, but unlike the regime provided for in the previous clause, this is not a new regime, but one that dealt with existing criminal liability. 
<P>
Looking at how the clause fits into the general picture, I urge the Minister not to slacken in any way in the fight against those involved in criminal activities. The Minister has been at pains to draw a distinction between the civil character of offences dealt with in previous clauses and the criminal character of the offences detailed in the clause. I am not saying that I share it, but concern was expressed by some of the witnesses who gave evidence to our early sittings that the availability of the civil penalty will mean that some people who previously were justifiably dealt with under the criminal regime will now be dealt with under the civil regime. If there is evidence that people have engaged in the sort of criminal activity dealt with in the clause, they should be brought to justice and face the range of suitably condign punishments available, up to a maximum of seven years imprisonment. People involved in the trade can be unscrupulous, exploiting human misery and often defrauding people; as the Minister said, they cost the British taxpayer large amounts of money in the long run and put a burden on our immigration services. That is a serious public issue and we want a crackdown on such people. 
<P>
Would the Minister comment on the trend in convictions for that type of offence? What further measures have the Government taken to co-operate with European Governments? It is very much a European problem. Many of the gangs are active on the continent and, without making controversial statements about Europe--[Hon. Members: "Oh, go on."] No, I will not give in to that temptation. There was a time when if a Conservative Member mentioned Europe it was to enlist a certain sympathy, but I will not pursue that. Even the most hardened Euro-sceptic would want vigorous co-operation between our police force and European police forces to bring those people to justice, not only from the perspective of our immigration controls but from that of stopping people acting unscrupulously. That is our view and we shall support measures taken by the Government to achieve that purpose. So, too, despite some of what has been said--although not by Opposition Members, I hasten to add--will the road haulage industry. It has made it very clear that it has no time for people engaged in such activity. The industry is as eager as the rest of us to see them brought to justice. It will certainly extend the hand of co-operation to the Government in this respect. It already co-operates with the Government in dealing with other international crime such as drug smuggling and no doubt will wish to play its full part. I ask the Minister to respond positively to the Road Haulage Association in this respect, to assure the Committee that the Government will still vigorously enforce the regime of criminal liability for people engaged in criminal actions, to tell us what the Government are doing at European level and to say whether they have any new ideas on the subject. It would be interesting for us and it would be within the spirit and scope of the clause for him to do so. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I am glad that we are now on to territory with which I feel slightly more comfortable--the hanging and flogging of criminals. However, as I cannot wax as eloquently as my hon. Friend, I say merely that I support entirely his robust stance on the clause. I have one brief point about what my hon. Friend called the trend in prosecutions. How many prosecutions, have there been under section 25(1)(b) and (c) of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996, in total or per annum, because that may show a trend? That apart, I endorse entirely everything that my hon. Friend said about the clause and about his ideas for making things even tougher for racketeers. If the Minister has any ideas, he will save us drafting new clauses.

<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I commend the clause to the Committee. It amends and supplements section 25(6) of the 1971 Act, which is targeted specifically at those who knowingly engage in criminal activity by facilitating the entry of illegal immigrants into the United Kingdom. While the current provisions apply equally to ships, aircraft and vehicles, by far the greater problem lies in facilitation of illegal immigrants secreted in freight vehicles and vans. Vehicles used in this criminal activity are currently subject to forfeiture by a court, but only where owned by the person convicted or by the company of which he is a director. Furthermore, there is no power to detain vehicles pending the court's decision, so unless they are required by the police for evidential purposes they can be taken away or driven abroad, despite the court's power to order forfeiture on the conviction of the offender. This serves to undermine the deterrent value of the current legislation. We therefore wish to strengthen it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> On the deterrent value of the present legislation, does the Minister agree that from time to time the House sends a signal to the courts that if something is of serious public concern and is causing harm to the public, an increase in the maximum sentence for such an offence could be considered? Does he further agree that if there was that sort of evidence in this case, as there might be, that penalty is something that might be worth considering for the future? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We will consider all appropriate means to ensure that we have an effective deterrent, but we also need to ensure that what we do is is proportionate and reasonable. 
<P>
We want to strengthen current legislation--which needs to be strengthened--by introducing a new power to detain ships, aircraft and vehicles at the time of the arrest, and when the offender is charged. We also wish to encourage more responsibility among vehicle owners. We therefore intend to make employers more accountable where their drivers are knowingly involved in this criminal activity by providing for vehicles and other transport to be detained whether or not the offender is the owner. The remedy available to owners under section 25(8) of the 1971 Act will remain. This allows for an application to be made and heard by the court where forfeiture might be ordered. 
<P>
The immigration service has increased co-operation with our European partners. The police are now working very closely with the immigration service, as are the intelligence services, and there is also increased international co-operation on that basis. Europol is also involved. A very large area of criminal activity is now being combated and as racketeers become more sophisticated in people trafficking, the forces of law and order need to co-operate more effectively across European and other international boundaries to deal with them. 
<P>
The right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border asked me about prosecution figures. I do not have them to hand, but I shall write to him. 
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman might like to know that the facilitation support unit, a joint police and immigration operation based in Dover, has been set up. It has brought about a substantial increase in the number of convictions over the past two years. We aim to build on the link between the police and the immigration service and to work closely with the National Criminal Intelligence Service and Europol. 
<P>
With those comments, I hope that the Committee will endorse the clause.

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 209, in 209, in page 18, line 19, at end insert-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(4A) No charge is payable in respect of a person who fails on arrival in the United Kingdom to produce the documents required under subsection (1) if the owner or train operator of the ship, aircraft or train in which that person arrived can show that before that person embarked for the United Kingdom the following procedures had been applied-- 
<P>
(a) full document check of all passengers had been conducted immediately prior to boarding 
<P>
(b) in the case of an aircraft the check had taken place at the departure gate and each passenger's documents had been reconciled with their boarding card, and 
<P>
(c) that reasonable security arrangements approved in advance by an immigration officer (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) had been used at the point of embarkation to ensure that passengers could not circumvent the document checks".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Having moved from the alleged civil penalty of carriers, liability for the road haulage industry in clauses 18 to 23 to the criminal regime of clause 24, we now move back to civil law and civil liability, but in the existing form of carriers, liability. Is it is the existing form, although it is still a serious matter, we do not have to approach it from the Point of view of something completely new, because this is an established form of civil liability for carriers who carry improperly documented passengers. It is the regime to which I adverted earlier, in which airlines and ferries are subject to a penalty if they carry inappropriately documented passengers. 
<P>
In earlier debates I made some remarks on the background to the amendment and I shall not take the Committee over the same ground, although I think that I would be entitled to do so. I shall, however, refer later to the proposed change from the existing regime, and no doubt the Minister will want to deal with that, but the amendment relates to a narrower point, which has been suggested by British Airways. 
<P>
The reason for the amendment is that some asylum seekers destroy their passports in flight and therefore have no documents to show to immigration officers when they arrive in the United Kingdom to claim asylum. That puts the carrier in breach of subsection (1). A defence is provided by subsection (4), but it has proved in practice to be of doubtful value. The amendment proposes another form of defence for carriers who have acted responsibly in checking all documents of all passengers at overseas stations. 
<P>
The amendment sets out the steps that can be taken at check-in desks and the like by those dealing with people about to travel on airlines to ensure that their documentation is in order. I can see the force of the argument that British Airways and others are putting forward. Without saying that I necessarily adopt it, I believe that it is an argument that the Minister must answer. As a general proposition, it is good for people to know what steps they are expected to take in such matters, but I await the Minister's response. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> This is also an important amendment, which has been suggested by some airlines. Its import would be--I am happy to be corrected by the Minister if I have got it wrong--that it would establish in statute something informally called the approved gate check status. At present all passengers must possess travel documents when they board flights to the UK, certainly the flights of British Airways and other legitimate and respectable carriers. As my hon. Friend says, some people are adept at producing their documents to get through passport or immigration controls and the airline's controls and then, the second they are on board destroying the documents. On some airlines the documents may be tastier than the food, but not in the case of British Airways, I hasten to add. Then, when the people land at the airport, they have no documents. The airlines are automatically fined £2,000 per person and they find it difficult to prove that they had checked the documents. 
<P>
As I understand it, the airlines have put procedures in place. I do not understand them--I think that many of them are electronic--but as laymen and laywomen we have all seen, when we travel on British Airways flights, even domestic flights, the computerised tickets that are supposed to be thief-proof and fraud-proof. They are fed through machines and there are checks. How many times have I cursed the fact that the procedures seem to be slowing us up too much, because everything is double-checked? However, no doubt the checks are absolutely necessary. 
<P>
The Home Office has sensibly recognised that it is dashed difficult for the airlines to prove that they checked all the documents at the port of embarkation, so the airlines have come to an arrangement--it is not a defence, technically--with the Home Office and the immigration service, which is an administrative solution. As I understand it, they explained to the immigration service, "This is what we do. Here are our systems, here are our checks, this is how our staff are trained. We carry out all these procedures." I think that the immigration service makes spot checks around the airports to see if they are being carried out in reality. If they are, the immigration service waives the charges. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Like me, would my right hon. Friend find it of interest to hear from the Government how many approved gate checks they have carried out in the past two years, because, as my right hon. Friend said, the Government have to approve the procedures? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> It would be worth knowing that, because if the Government intend to increase the number of gate checks, it is clear that they recognise that there is a potential unfairness. I am informed that approved gate check is the right term. The system grew up after the 1996 Act. I am not sure whether the number is increasing. The immigration service must find it an acceptable defence, if it then waives the charges when British Airways or other airlines can prove that they have a legitimate system of carrying out the checks. 
<P>
We are suggesting to the Minister in the amendment that he should formalise that arrangement. Let us adopt in this part of the Bill the code of practice concept that he adopted in the earlier part of the Bill. It will be a defence for the owner, the lorry driver, the transporter chappie to get away with it if he can show that he has a system and checks and is following the code of practice. 
<P>
The immigration service already accepts an informal arrangement, in which the airline says "We've got the checks, we've got the scrutiny, we've got the documentation, the staff are trained. Here is the code showing how we do it. Come and check us out. We are happy for you to check whether we are doing it legitimately, thoroughly and properly", to use the terminology in a much earlier clause. If the airline is doing it properly, the immigration service says, "That's all right. We'll waive the charge." Can we now put that concept in statute? If putting it in statute and formalising it means that there will have to be another code of practice, I do not think that that will prove a great difficulty to the Minister. I cannot see the problem with that. It seems a sensible way to proceed. What cannot be right is an informal, legitimate, but almost under-the-counter deal, which says, "We've got systems. I know that technically they are breaking the law, but we have put good systems in place and have convinced you, the Government, that we are doing our level best to prevent illegal entrants. We can't prove that we checked the documents, because people have eaten them or disposed of them on board. If you think our systems are good enough, let us off". That is what the Government are doing. They are doing it, I assume, every day of the week because embarkation reports satisfy them that British Airways or others have legitimate systems. Systems checks and procedures for lorries, along with codes of practice, were formalised in another part of the Bill. Therefore, it is wrong to continue with an informal, under-the-counter decision to waive the penalty because the Government think that the operators have legitimate systems. 
<P>
Amendment No. 209 seeks to replace the present informal arrangements with a statutory measure. Were that to be done, the Minister may say that a code of practice, a formalised defence and other measures would be needed. That is okay: we would be happy to draft such measures. Should the Minister decide to go away and think about the matter, we would give him full support on Report. 
<P>
I would not complain if the Government dropped 50 amendments on us overnight because I am asking for them. Government amendments relating to the principle that I am articulating are perfectly acceptable. However, I would probably complain about the hundreds of other amendments that the Government have yet to indicate that they may table.

<P>

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I support the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere. 
<P>
People destroy documents on aircraft. We have had some time in which to see whether the Immigration (Carriers' Liability) Act 1987 works. There are question marks over how well it works. Yesterday, we heard about the figures for the fines that have been imposed and about the give and take that is needed to make the measure operational. 
<P>
The amendment's wording would improve matters. It would be better to move towards an approved date for the checking procedure. Security is important in this day and age. One has to go through a number of checks at airports and one's passport is examined several times. One must accept that different passports, visas and ways of doing things cause difficulties for airline staff. 
<P>
I have always found it difficult to believe that someone without a passport could get on board an aircraft until I was in Nigeria three or four weeks ago, when a gentleman clasping two children got on board the aircraft that I was on. The staff knew that the man had no passport, and four stewardesses had to get him off the aircraft. So boarding without documentation does happen, although Lagos airport is not necessarily the most secure place in the world. 
<P>
I therefore hope that we will take the opportunity to make the Immigration (Carriers' Liability) Act 1987 work a little better. I am disappointed that the Conservative Government--whom I supported--did not get the measure right, so we should take the opportunity to improve it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The amendment seeks to widen the scope of clause 25(4) by providing a defence for carriers, especially in cases in which passengers dispose of their passports in-flight or soon after, and have no documents to show immigration officers. 
<P>
I accept that some asylum seekers destroy their passports and that carriers find it difficult that those people produced an acceptable document on embarkation. However, that is a real problem only for those who do not keep proper records. 
<P>
We recognise that difficulty, so we developed an administrative concession whereby carriers can apply for approved gate check status. AGC status is not under the counter, as the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border said. It is open, works well and operates efficiently. The administrative concession is aimed specifically at those carriers who demonstrate a diligent approach to their responsibilities under the carriers' liability measure and have in place effective procedures for checking the adequacy of documents. 
<P>
AGC status is similar to the terms proposed in the amendment, and a charge would normally be waived on no-document type cases. It is open to any carrier to apply for AGC status against criteria clearly set out in guidance known as the Green Guide published by the immigration service. The approved gate check concession covers particular carriers and routes. It is widely welcomed by the airline industry. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison rose-- </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Just a moment. I think that I am about to answer the hon. Gentleman's question. Some 190 AGC concessions are held by more than 50 different airlines. Over 90 of those are held by British Airways. The amendment seeks to put those arrangements in the Bill. That is neither necessary nor appropriate as the arrangements already in place provide carriers with a concession where they can demonstrate through AGC status that they have effective checking procedures in place. 
<P>
<H5>9.45 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman knows that these suggestions came from British Airways. He will also know that British Airways wrote to him on 20 April 1999 following a meeting that its representatives had with me. They said that delighted though they were that he had tabled the amendments they had suggested, they were pleased with that meeting and the proposals that I made to them. They wished to work on some initiatives in a working party which we had created. They told the hon. Gentleman that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"we will therefore not be pressing the Government or the Standing Committee to incorporate these amendments."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would agree that that is their view. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister was wrong in the first particular as that was not my question. If I was any airline in the world and I applied for an approved gate check status for a gate check somewhere in the world, how long might I expect to wait? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> No doubt I will be able to give the hon. Gentleman that answer shortly. 
<P>
The amendment is otherwise defective in that, among other things, it would provide the defence, even if the carrier's document checks established that no documents were held but failed to take action to stop the passenger boarding. As I said, discussions are on-going with BA on all these matters. It is part of a working party looking at simplification of documentation and the way in which the CLA works and seeing whether there are any incentive systems. It has said that it is satisfied with the way in which this operates and does not wish the amendments to be pressed. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean rose-- </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The answer may be coming. There is no set waiting time. We inspect the arrangements made. The aim is to carry out such checks as soon as possible. I cannot give an average time for a wait for such AGC status to be granted, but we try to do it as soon as possible. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I understand that there is no set time in that it is not set down that a person has to wait three months before he could get it, but my question was how long might I expect to have to wait? Surely the Minister's Department will be able to tell me how long I might expect to wait. I do not expect it down to the day or even the week, but roughly speaking if I applied for now, how long would I wait before the inspection was carried out and I received it? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am advised that it is done as soon as possible but no doubt the airline that makes the application will have to be assessed. Obviously it will be easier to check the procedures of certain airlines than others, particularly in cases where an airline has AGC status, and especially one like BA which has 90 AGC concessions. The examination of its procedures may well be less time consuming than those of a foreign airline about which we know very little. It may be a small airline and we will need to carry out a lot more checks. The aim is to carry out the checks as soon as possible. It will vary considerably between the various airlines. I am advised that the airlines want the checks carried out as soon as possible--and that is the intention. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> What would happen if an airline that had applied for special status was waiting for it to be granted but during the course of the wait--weeks or even longer--an incident occurred which, had the status been granted earlier, would have kept the airline in the clear but which in the absence of the status leads it to be penalised? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> If we are not satisfied that all the procedures are in place and properly run, under current legislation framed by the previous Government, that sort of penalty would apply. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> Would it not be good enough for the airline to show that it had already submitted its application for special status and that the necessary standards had been met before the incident occurred? Let us imagine that an airline has already introduced satisfactory checks and sends off for accreditation. Two weeks later, an incident occurs for which the airline is liable to be penalised. Another two weeks later, the Government do their checks and indeed bestow the appropriate accreditation on the basis of the system that was put in place a month earlier. In those circumstances, would the airline still be on the hook or would it get off? 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The way in which the system works is far more complex than that. In practice, the immigration service will have discussions with the airline about the way in which the penalties are paid. It is not quite the same system as we have been debating in respect of lorry drivers, because the penalty does not have to be paid immediately. Airlines are much easier to access: they are bigger and have so many contractual relationships that there is not usually the same risk of someone disappearing. Some difficulties with Nigerian airlines were well publicised in the past and one hopes that they will be resolved in due course. 
<P>
A tally of cases is drawn up and particular cases are examined. Discussions take place about whether to impose a penalty. Where there is doubt, negotiation takes place. Until AGC status is agreed, the airline does not have AGC status. However, fines will be dealt with through a process of discussion with the airline,which can continue for some time. That happens because of the nature of the airline industry and because of the scheme that we inherited from the previous Government. The system has been criticised by the press but still seems to work in a way that allows the airlines and the Government to rub along with it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I was slightly disappointed with the Minister's reply. Let me clarify my remarks to avoid any misunderstanding. When I referred to an under-the-counter system I was not implying that it was illegal and that there was anything shady about it in terms of money changing hands improperly. That was a sloppy use of language. 
<P>
In his reply, the Minister stressed the administrative aspects. Whenever the Government talk about an administrative system, they mean that the law says one thing but, within the law, we have evolved a system that does not get round it completely but which deals with a problem or an injustice without changing the statute law. Perhaps "under the counter" is not the right term, but the administrative arrangements are a derogation from statute law. Perhaps "derogation" is not the correct word, but, under that system, statute law is not applied warts and all, but in the spirit that was intended. The Government have rightly found that if it is applied warts and all, there is injustice and unfairness. In the absence of a statutory slot in which to circumvent the problem or an opportunity to present a different measure before the House, clever officials, assisted by able Ministers have evolved a system that avoids injustice. 
<P>
There can be no objection to placing on a statutory footing that excellent administrative system, which avoids the injustices of current legislation. The Minister's reply was not credible. If the administrative  system is good enough to continue outside the statutory framework, why cannot we apply it to the Eddie Stobarts of the world and the RHA and the FTA? Why cannot an administrative system deal with lorries? What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My right hon. Friend makes a point that I had considered. Does he agree that it is instructive that the administrative system developed after the carriers' liability legislation was passed because of the inherent difficulties in the form of defence for which the clause provides? 
<P>
<B>Mr Maclean:</B> My hon. Friend is right. I was not involved in the 1996 Act--the Committee will be pleased to know that I did not serve on the Committee that considered that measure. Many hon. Members apart from me probably wish that I was not serving on this Committee. I do not know what the previous Government intended, but I do not believe that they or their officials, however farsighted, anticipated the problem. Therefore, after numerous meetings with airlines, they invented the wonderful, get-round-the-law system of approved gate checks and the approved gate check status on which the Minister relies. 
<P>
The Minister wants the approved gate check system to continue. He said that he wanted it to expand and that he hoped that more airlines around the world would obtain approved gate check status so that we could rely on good, thorough, legitimate passport and immigration controls at more points of departure. He wants the informal, non-statutory system to be expanded. If such a system is good enough for the airlines, the Minister should reflect on what should be done for the road haulage industry. Perhaps, when the measure is up and running, he may find that he will have to develop a non-statutory administrative system to tackle some of the injustices to the road haulage industry. 
<P>
In my experience of being on the receiving end of administrative problems in government, informal, non-statutory systems work brilliantly. When they work, they are better than statute. They can be bent and changed if, for example, British Airways claims that they are not working properly. Civil servants, Ministers and operators can get together to make some changes without having to bother with. I do not mean that in a derogatory way, but, with such a system, the law does not need to be changed. As soon as everyone agrees that something works, the system can be amended. That is brilliant until, after some time has passed, an airline refuses to give approved gate check status to, for example, Air Clappison, because it does not meet the standard. If that happens, there is a judicial review, the case comes to court and the whole pack of cards comes tumbling down. The High Court judges will look at the statute and not be happy with it. The good, informal administrative arrangements are dealt with by officials and airlines but if the judges rule against the provision the Minister will have to introduce emergency measures in the House; the informal system of approved gate-check status will have collapsed because the House of Lords or the High Court has ruled that it is not on. 
<P>
<H5>10 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> Is not it also the case that as the Bill proposes substantial increases in the penalties to be paid, there is a greater likelihood of cases being brought before the courts than when penalties were smaller? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I agree entirely; there is a greater likelihood of that happening. There is also a greater danger of the approved gate-check status not being brought into disrepute but being ruled illegal or unfair. The Minister has not given us a list of all the airlines that have approved gate-check status. I suspect that those approved at present are some of the largest and best airlines--those that most of us would be happy to travel on. I suspect that those who are still waiting for approved gate-check status, or who might not get it, are the smaller international airlines or those with whom we might not be happy to travel. I say no more. 
<P>
Some of those nationally owned, foreign airlines that are not given approved gate-check status may feel that there is nothing to lose in challenging the measure in the courts. They will say, "The British Government have approved British Airways, and the American and European airlines. They haven't approved us; that is discrimination." If they then challenge the Government and the Government lose, they will have to table emergency measures as soon as they can to recreate in statute what they think should continue administratively. 
<P>
I conclude by asking the Minister please to think again about the proposed system. If it is so good, put it in statute and take the credit for it. It is a good system until it is challenged and fails legally. In that case, the Minister will be in a deep, deep hole. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B>  As a Conservative the right hon. Gentleman should remember that Edmund Burke said that change is only necessary when change is necessary. The approved gate checks work; change is not necessary on this occasion and we will not do it! 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have one last concern and I should be happy for the Minister to write to me about it. I was unfair in asking the Minister what was the average waiting time, because it was a rhetorical question and I suspected that he might not have that information at his fingertips. If the Minister writes to me setting out the average waiting times with as much particularity as he can, I shall be satisfied. The amendment would encourage the Government to employ more people to carry out the approved gate checks at airports. That would be a good thing. It is in everyone's interests that such checks are made to the highest standards. I shall give way to the Minister or I may be tempted to develop my case further. 
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> At this time of night I am always anxious to see a happy man. I undertake to write to the hon. Gentleman with such information as I am able to obtain on the issue that he raised. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I do not ask more than that. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 211, in page 18, leave out lines 20 and 21 and insert-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(5) For the purposes of this section-- 
<P>
(a) a document is what is purports to be unless its falsity is reasonably apparent, and 
<P>
(b) in deciding whether the falsity of a document is reasonably apparent it shall be assumed that the person making the appropriate judgment is not an immigration officer.".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendment No. 476. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> This is another amendment suggested by British Airways. It sets out with greater clarity just what is expected of someone who is checking documents to discover their falsity and outlines with some particularity exactly what is required. I understand from BA that immigration officers expect airline check-in agents to apply what they consider to be forgery recognition skills that are a little on the high side. BA says that, as a result, 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"too many charges are levied on carriers as a result and the relief contemplated by the Act is not being given in all appropriate cases".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore I should like the Minister to make a few comments. The questions at issue are, what standard is expected of the person making the checks, and is the standard that which would be expected of an immigration officer? We are interested in hearing the Minister's views on that interesting question. Although we also want high standards to be maintained, if a reputable organisation tells us that it is being asked the impossible, we should listen to what it says. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> This is a fair amendment, and it would be fair to advance it even if British Airways had not suggested it.Other airlines that are not as switched on as BA, which advised the Committee of some of its worries, might find exactly the same problem. That problem is that an airline will be fined £2,000 each time it brings an inadequately documented passenger into the United Kingdom; this includes passengers arriving with false travel documents, unless the falsity of the document is not reasonably apparent. It is difficult to recognise masterly forgeries. 
<P>
False documentation will frequently be associated with organised crime. The forgery of some documents and visas will be done with considerable forensic skill and professionalism. If the documents are often good enough to get some criminals through immigration and passport control, and good enough to fool police and others tracking organised crime, it is a bit unfair if airline staff are deemed not to have spotted documents that it would take an expert to spot. The concern here is that, at present, that part of the law is being interpreted a bit too severely. The immigration service may be expecting too much from airline staff and officials; it may expect them to display skills that only a trained immigration officer might or should have. 
<P>
I invite the Minister to go to the National Criminal Intelligence Service and examine some of the documents there. If it is still in possession of a large sack of forged money that I had the pleasure of looking at--but unfortunately not taking away as a sample--he will be amazed at the quality of forgeries. As a layman, I was astounded at some of the documents that the NCIS had acquired: it was impossible to tell that they were forgeries, which is what one expects of good forgeries. I could have held up a forged £20 note, and held up the real thing, and I could not have told, nor could most of the officers there, that one was a forgery. It was detected by other means. The officers' view was, "If these notes got on the street, Minister, we'd have a deuce of a job trying to detect whether they were forgeries." Fortunately, the NCIS was able to get to them before they hit the streets. The same happens with passports and other documents, most of which will be produced by master forgers. 
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> Does my right hon. Friend think that it would help us if the Minister spelt out to us what help the Government offer airlines in equipping them to spot forgeries? If no such help is made available to airlines, how can their employees be expected to develop the skills necessary for them to have any chance of detecting the type of skilled forgeries of which my right hon. Friend spoke?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valid point. The amendment suggests that the assumption should be that the person making the judgment is not an immigration officer and does not have those skills. If the Government reject the amendment and say that airline staff should have such skills, they will be under an obligation to provide all the necessary training for those of them who are not required to have those skills. 
<P>
I expect different airline staff to have different qualities and skills. Pilots have certain skills and stewards and stewardesses have others, as do the ground staff and the people who work at the ticket desks. Those who carry out controls have some skills, but they are not as knowledgeable as immigration officers. They do not know all the changes that every country in the world makes to its passports, visas and documentation. 
<P>
I shall quote two examples that British Airways has given me. It states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"For example, airline staff are expected to know: whether a French passport issued in a particular year should have a matt or sheen laminate covering the photograph page; or, that the photograph featured in a Dutch passport must be black and white and part profile".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are just two examples from our nearest European neighbours. We know that, in many countries, Governments change the colour, size and shape of passports and documentation regularly. In such circumstances, to expect even the most skilled airline staff to have the knowledge that we expect of highly trained immigration officers and agents of Government is a bit much. 
<P>
The Minister should either accept the amendment or undertake that the Government will not continue with an interpretation that will expect far too much of airline staff in recognising forgeries. It is a bit unfair for immigration officers to say, "We know that this is a forgery. You should have known likewise." In many cases, only a skilled professional, who receives the latest update from intelligence services on the types of forgeries that are on the go, and members of a state-run service have access to such information. I hope that the Minister will listen to our pleas.
