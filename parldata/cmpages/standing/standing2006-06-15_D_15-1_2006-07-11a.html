</i>I cannot help the hon. Gentleman with that.
<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i></div><a name="0607124000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607124000222"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I like to preserve reasonable informality
in our proceedings, but we cannot have debate conducted by chuntering
from a sedentary 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column586" />Column number: 587</div>position. I say that with no discourtesy to the hon. Member for
Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly), but it is better to try to preserve
formality.</div><a name="0607124000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607124000223"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I will send the hon. Gentleman a copy of the
<i class="I">Hansard</i> that I am
quoting.</div><a name="0607124000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607124000224"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Minister stood up to make a point. I am not
sure what it was but I think that it was about the Conservative party
changing its tune or tabling an amendment, but she cannot say which one
or, precisely, what it was about. Perhaps she will express her point.
We may then be able to respond to
it.</div><a name="0607124000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607124000225"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> In the House of Lords, Lord Freeman, on behalf of
the Conservative party, said that he was satisfied that the range of
amendments that had been passed brought together all the concerns that
Conservative Members there had raised about the original framing of the
clause. By the time the House of Lords reached the clause, there was
consensus on it. That is my point. That consensus now appears to have
disappeared in the House of Commons. It related to the central theme of
how to bring together company success with wider social and economic
concerns.</div> <a name="0607124000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
make some points of principle about the clause and then to deal with
some of the issues in detail. A point of principle is that the clause
should not be seen on its own but with the clauses on narrative
reporting that we shall discuss later. It should also been seen in the
context of wider rights for shareholders, including amendments that I
tabled today on the rights of indirect shareholders. I discussed those
informally with members of both Opposition parties yesterday and
believe that we have reached a consensus on that with all stakeholders.
With the new narrative reporting requirements and by widening the
access for shareholder participation, the clause will make a
difference. That is why we are introducing
it.</div><a name="0607124000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another point of
principle is that, as I have increasingly acknowledged during the eight
or nine years that we have been in government, law of itself will not
transform the culture of companies. It will not suddenly create a
culture whereby companies take on the social responsibility to which
hon. Members alluded. The law can, however, provide a support framework
that will lead to a transformation in culture.
</div><a name="0607124000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">That leads me on to
the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Bedford (Patrick
Hall). I shall return to his proposals and amendment in detail, but he
suggested that we adopt a more pluralist framework. He felt that we
relied too much on what he called the voluntary framework. I share his
goals, and the argument is about the best means of achieving them. Like
the hon. Member for Huntingdon, I believe that our company law
framework needs to ensure that we maintain the UK&#146;s standing as
a good place in which to form and retain businesses. I often talk about
the promiscuity of capital, and it will place itself somewhere else in
the world if we do not have a business-friendly environment that
provides the conditions for effective business management and
expansion.</div> <a name="0607124000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why
we must keep in mind the Bill&#146;s core purpose: providing clarity
to business about the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column587" />Column number: 588</div>objectives of business. Hence the duties in the proposals before us. We
cannot diminish the core purpose of business, but Labour Members
believe it can carry out that purpose effectively only if it has regard
to the wider community&#146;s interests.</div>
<a name="0607124000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill takes a huge step
forward in trying to align corporate social responsibility with
business efficiency and prosperity. It is a real step change, and I
hope that all hon. Members see it that way. To find corporate social
responsibility, we must look elsewhere. The biggest advances in proper
regard for employees are found in health and safety legislation, not
company law. We must consider that with regard to the impact of
businesses on the environment and the long-term impact of businesses on
their communities. CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>emissions are being discussed in the
statement by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and
Industry on the Floor of the House.</div>
<a name="0607124000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our actions internationally,
through Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
guidelines, the industry transparency initiative that the Prime
Minister launched and the round table on sustainability, will be a key
factor in taking forward Labour Members&#146; ambitions to protect
the environment for the long term and ensure that companies, when
pursuing their interests, do not damage community interests or the
environmental interests of communities elsewhere.</div>
<a name="0607124000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill attempts to open up
companies to much more public account. Whether through indirect
shareholder interest or the voting of institutional shareholders, it
will begin to open up the actions of companies to public account. In so
doing, those actions could transform consumer behaviour and determine
whether consumers invest in or buy products from particular companies.
If and when people do so, we will pursue cultural change. That is the
route down which we wish to travel. We want to create a framework to
facilitate the cultural change that meets the aspirations of many
Members, in particular Labour Members.</div>
<a name="0607124000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue under discussion is
one of the most serious in the Bill. I was disappointed by the
contribution of the hon. Member for Huntingdon. I had hoped that I
could reply seriously to it, but at the end of the hour it was
difficult to find anything that genuinely warranted a serious response.
We can all quote lawyers and commentators, and as he did, and I thought
of jokes along the lines of &#147;How many lawyers does it take to
change a light bulb?&#148; However, I shall give the hon. Gentleman
just one quote. It is from another eminent QC who said in a letter in
the <i class="I">Financial Times</i>&#151;he quoted one and I am quoting
another&#151;that the</div>
<a name="0607124000173"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;provisions are no threat to the
practical running of companies in the
UK&#148;.</div><a name="0607124000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The letter
continued:</div><a name="0607124000174"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Of
the companies directors I see, those worth their salt already have
regard to all of these factors and
more.&#148;</div><a name="0607124000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Quoting
one set of lawyers does not help us. As the hon. Member for Grantham
and Stamford (Mr. Davies) said, 50 per cent. of lawyers think one way
and 50 per cent. think the
other.</div><a name="0607124000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my view there
is an essential dishonesty in the argument that the hon. Member for
Huntingdon attempted to make. On one hand, he said that he 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column588" />Column number: 589</div>favours corporate social responsibility, which is an advance and we
welcome that. On the other hand, he predicts that stating in statute
that companies should have regard to corporate responsibility factors
in carrying out their key duty to pursue their interests spells
possible disaster. The purport of his argument was that that would lead
to endless litigation. I left it to the hon. Member for Cambridge
(David Howarth)&#151;he is a lawyer and I am not&#151;to destroy
that argument. The hon. Member for Huntingdon argued that the provision
could end in huge costs or wipe out any benefits from our deregulation.
That was a dishonest
argument.</div><a name="0607124000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">On one hand,
the hon. Gentleman supports the proposition of corporate
responsibility. On the other, he rejects it. On one hand he
claims&#151;</div><a name="0607124000052"></a>

<a name="0607124000058"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0607124000232"></a><b class="B">Patrick
Hall</b> (Bedford) (Lab): I am not going to dispense advice on
which word should be used. What matters is how people vote in this
place and the other place. When it comes to where a party stands on
enlightened shareholder values and corporate social responsibility, we
had a clear indication of where the Conservative party stands from the
way that it voted in the other place. Perhaps it would help if the hon.
Member for Huntingdon said whether he intends to follow the line taken
by his colleagues in the other place. That would be not honest or
dishonest, just
clear.</div><a name="0607124000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607124000233"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I started by
saying&#151;</div><a name="0607124000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607124000234"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. We cannot have an intervention on an
intervention. It is necessary for the Minister to respond to the
intervention by the hon. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column589" />Column number: 590</div>Member for Bedford before any further interventions can be taken. Before
the right hon. Lady resumes her remarks, let me also say that there has
been no breach of order. It is perfectly in order to describe an
argument as dishonest, but not in order to describe another right hon.
or hon. Member as dishonest. However, I hope that we are not going to
have an endless and circuitous semantic
exchange.</div>
<a name="0607124000185"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div><a name="0607124000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607124000235"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> Thank you for that clarification, Mr. Bercow. I was
extremely careful in the comment that I made. I simply note that the
hon. Member for Reigate (Mr. Blunt) accepted that the remark by the
hon. Member for Huntingdon was at least
disingenuous.</div><a name="0607124000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607124000236"></a>Mr.
Blunt:</b> No, I do not accept that at all. I am grateful to
the Minister for allowing me to make that point, but she was very ill
advised to start chucking around the term &#147;dishonest&#148;.
There are other ways to describe such things, which are slightly less
offensive and would better sustain the Committee&#146;s good
spirit.</div><a name="0607124000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607124000237"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> It was in an attempt to return to that good spirit
that I just had to get that in.</div>
<a name="0607124000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Opposition Members must ask
themselves how one can support a proposition on the one hand but reject
it on the other. How can one claim to promote corporate social
responsibility on the one hand, but denounce it on the other? As my
hon. Friend the Member for Bedford said, this morning&#146;s debate
on corporate social responsibility exposed the inconsistency and the
central weakness of the Conservative party. By opposing this part of
the Bill, the hon. Member for Huntingdon shows that the Conservative
party&#146;s language might have altered, but that its actions remain
the same. At the end of the day, it is not what you say in politics
that counts, but what you
do.</div><a name="0607124000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman
made a very long contribution, and I am not saying that it did not
warrant serious consideration, but I interpreted it to mean that
business interests had to stand untrammelled by any other public
interest, be it the interest of the community, the environment or
employees.</div><a name="0607124000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607124000238"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div>
<a name="0607124000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607124000239"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> No, the hon. Gentleman might like to hear this
point. The Conservative party, in taking the position that it has, is
setting itself against Britain&#146;s best and most highly successful
businesses, and their leaders, who tell us that the way that we propose
is the future for
business.</div><a name="0607124000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman talked about the clause clouding the law, but he is clouding
his view and his genuine purpose in this series of amendments. He does
not think that companies have responsibilities to the long term, the
community, the environment or their suppliers.</div>
<a name="0607124000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me acknowledge the
contribution of the hon. Member for Cambridge. When he started, I said,
&#147;Oh dear,&#148; because he was going to give us a legal thing.
Of course, because I love company law, I meant to say, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column590" />Column number: 591</div>&#147;Hurray!&#148; I very much agree with what he said about
litigation, and it is likely to be extremely rare. We do not expect the
clause to give rise to significant litigation, just as cases under
current case law have been very rare. However, the clause is important,
because although most directors might already pay regard to the factors
mentioned, it is important that they consider them in thinking about
how best to promote the company&#146;s success.</div>
<a name="0607124000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important that I briefly
take Members through where we are on the clause and why, I am afraid,
we must reject all the amendments. I wish to set out how we responded
in another place to some uncertainties and misunderstandings about the
meaning of the clause. Its title is &#147;Duty to promote the success
of the company&#148;, which is the right title to describe the duty.
It is not a pluralist duty, which was the other route that we could
have taken.</div><a name="0607124000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Directors
are required to have regard to the factors laid out when promoting the
success of a company for the benefit of its members, but if a director
puts one of those factors ahead of his overarching duty to promote the
success of the company, he acts in breach of that duty to the
company.</div><a name="0607124000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">In another
place, the clause was amended to bring together what are now its
subsections and make even clearer&#151;I hope to hon. Members, and
certainly to those outside who will have to use the law&#151;our
intention that while a director must have regard to the various factors
stated, that requirement is subordinate to the overriding duty to
promote the success of the
company.</div><a name="0607124000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">We had further
discussions with business and other stakeholders, and re-tabled a
Government amendment to delete from the clause a second
&#147;must&#148;, which we considered could be perceived as
creating a separate duty. Its deletion does not affect the obligation
to have regard to the factors, but it makes it even clearer that clause
158(1) is a single
proposition.</div><a name="0607124000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
that a director should be required to give proper consideration to the
list of factors, so far as it is relevant to the decisions that he is
taking. That is the essence of enlightened shareholder value. At the
same time, a director will not be required to consider any of the
factors beyond the point at which to do so would conflict with the
overarching duty to promote the success of the company. That would
clearly not be helpful or
sensible.</div><a name="0607124000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">In another
place, another Government amendment was accepted to delete the words
&#147;so far as reasonably practical&#148;. We tabled that
amendment for a purpose. The words were originally intended to have a
dual effect, operating as a limit on what is required of directors and
making clearer the fact that directors are required to do more than pay
lip service to the factors in the clause. It became clear during the
debate, in which we listened, that there was uncertainty about the
effect of the words. That was why we chose to delete
them.</div><a name="0607124000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also wish to
draw to the attention of hon. Members the issue of good faith business
judgment. We believe it essential for the weight given to any factor to
be a matter for a director&#146;s good faith judgment. Importantly,
the decision is not subject to the reasonableness test that appears in
other legislation.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column591" />Column number: 592</div><a name="0607124000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">As now, the courts will not be
able to apply such a test to a director&#146;s business decisions.
That is in sharp contrast to, for example, decisions on public law, to
which the courts often apply such a test. We are trying to achieve the
effect that a director must give such consideration to the factors
identified as is necessary for the decision that he must take. We do
not intend a director to be required to do more than apply good faith
and, as elsewhere in the Bill, the duty of care and skill is an
important ingredient. Nor do we want it to be possible for a director
to be held liable for a process failure that does not affect the
outcome.</div><a name="0607124000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
does not impose a requirement on directors to keep records, as some
people have suggested, in any circumstances in which they would not
have to do so now. That is an important point, because companies might
wish to record their decision-making process in respect of key business
decisions, but nothing is gained by a box-ticking mentality that
records information without proper
reason.</div><a name="0607124000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607124000240"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Does the Minister not appreciate that almost
every commentator writing on the provision says that that is exactly
what will happen? It will bring in a box-ticking mentality, with boards
having to jump through hoops to justify their thought
processes.</div><a name="0607124000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607124000241"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> No, I do not accept that, and I refer the hon.
Gentleman to the contribution made on that point in another place by
the Attorney-General. That issue was raised in the debate on that
clause by their lordships. All I can do is to reiterate that we do not
believe that the clause will end up with an expensive paper trail,
which is what the hon. Gentleman has suggested. The reason for that is
how the law will
work.</div><a name="0607124000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The company will
have to bring a claim against the director for a breach of his or her
duties under the clause, and would need to show that the director had
not had regard to one or more of the factors. There is no reason to
believe that a director would have to provide written evidence proving
that in taking a particular decision he or she had had regard to those
factors. That evidence would not be required for him or her to defend
themselves against such an
action.</div><a name="0607124000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607124000242"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Is not the problem that when a company takes
advice on how it can best show that it has complied with the clause, it
will be told to put it in
writing?</div><a name="0607124000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607124000243"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The onus will be on the company to prove that the
director has not complied, rather than on the director to show that he
has. Because the onus lies with the company, rather than the director,
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s fears are not
justified.</div><a name="0607124000084"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0607124000244"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Quentin Davies</b> (Grantham and Stamford) (Con): Does the
right hon. Lady accept that she has just given the very important
assurance that, in her view, the Bill will not require directors to
keep further records than those they do currently? In the event of that
issue coming up in court, under the Pepper <i class="I">v.</i> Hart rule, her
statement this afternoon could be prayed in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column592" />Column number: 593</div>aid by the director concerned. So, she has just given the Committee a
very important assurance, of which we should all be
aware.</div><a name="0607124000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607124000245"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> It was for that reason that I chose to emphasise
that point. Clearly, companies need to keep records of their
appropriate decision making, but in our view no further burden is
required by that particular duty. That is the point that I was trying
to make. Obviously, there is a general need to provide effective
records. All that the clause does is give fuller expression than is
currently in the law, but it should not require further record
keeping.</div><a name="0607124000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The six
factors discussed emerged from the company law review process, but
because we know that they might change over time, we said that the list
is not exhaustive, which is why &#147;amongst other matters&#148;
has been inserted in clause 158. The insertion of those words in no way
detracts from the obligation to have regard to the listed factors, but
leaves it open. As I have said, the duty cannot be considered in
isolation.</div><a name="0607124000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was a
quick run through of the general view of the clause, which it was
important to put on the record. Let me now deal quickly with the
amendments as best I can. On amendments Nos. 40 and 42, which concern
the size of a company, a director has a duty, whatever the size of the
company, not to put his or her own interests ahead of those of the
company. That is as true of a small or medium-sized company as it is of
a larger quoted company. The company would suffer a loss in just the
same way, whatever its size. So, in our view, those duties should not
be different for directors of smaller companies. I am trying to keep my
answers as short as I can. I hope that I have answered that question,
but if I have not, I am happy to return to
it.</div><a name="0607124000186"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div><a name="0607124000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment No.
300, which my hon. Friend the Member for Bedford tabled, I am afraid
that we think that the phrase &#147;endeavour to&#148; instead of
&#147;have regard to&#148; brings a stronger pluralist approach. It
might not have been his intent but it is the effect of those words in
law. There would be confusion over the duties and there might well be
competing duties. That is the argument against the pluralist approach
to the directors&#146; duties framework that we are attempting to
establish, and on that basis we do not wish to accept the amendment. It
is a &#147;have your cake and eat it&#148; amendment and while
ingenious, in that requirements are not quite spelled out in the
traditional way, the impact would be such. I sadly must therefore
reject the proposals.</div>
<a name="0607124000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The way in which we have framed
the clause and brought it together with the narrative reporting
clauses, and the opening up to public account through shareholder
engagement, which pervades the Bill, will begin to have a massive
impact on the corporate social responsibility agenda.</div>
<a name="0607124000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our view on amendment No. 166 is
simply that it is not necessary. We do not intend a director to be
required to do more in having regard to the factors than acting in good
faith and in accordance with the duty of care and skill. It will, for
example, be for the director to make a judgment on the likely
longer-term 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column593" />Column number: 594</div>consequences of his decisions in good faith and in compliance with his
duty to exercise reasonable care, skill and
diligence.</div><a name="0607124000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Grantham and Stamford sought to probe us by suggesting that
we leave out the word &#147;environment&#148;. I have a long
quotation, which I can come back to if he is not listening at this
moment. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> I am addressing his
amendment No. 297; I do not know whether he wishes to listen to
my response on it.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607124000246"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> Of course I wish to listen to the response. I am
sorry, but the calls of Whips are difficult to
resist.</div>
<a name="0607124000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607124000247"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I got the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituency
right. He said that his amendment was designed to probe our thinking a
little. Incorporating the concept of the environment into the list of
factors came out of the consideration of those factors by the company
law review, and I have many quotations in that regard.</div>
<a name="0607124000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall suggest to the hon.
Gentleman three good reasons why we would want to cover the
environment. First, people care passionately about the environment.
That might not be something that he shares, but it was considered by
most of the people who participated in the company law review process
to be one of the key issues of interest. Secondly, in recent years, we
have seen the devastating evidence of the impact on the environment of
the action of companies, be they large or small, although the hon.
Gentleman elected to focus on a small company&#146;s
contribution.</div> <a name="0607124000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly,
the company&#146;s impact on the environment can be a direct route to
financial success, and that is shown by the growing number of members
of the Environmental Industries Commission. As the Prime Minister has
made clear on a number of occasions, we want Britain to be a leading
player in the green industrial revolution.</div>
<a name="0607124000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607124000248"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> I am grateful to the right hon. Lady for those
comments. As I explained this morning, the object of my tabling this
probing amendment was to get the Government to think about the matter
and to come up with a reasoned response. We have now had
that.</div> <a name="0607124000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right hon.
Lady&#146;s first reason, that people feel strongly about something,
is not a good reason for law making. I feel strongly about the
environment; I gave an answer on the radio this morning in which I said
that I thought that global warming was the most important medium and
long-term problem facing the human race, together with nuclear
proliferation. However, that is not a good reason for imposing
one&#146;s feelings or prejudices on others by law making. The
provision should be excluded. The argument that it may be good for
companies to be environmentally conscious corresponds exactly to the
decision that the director should take anyway under clause 158. They
should take strategic decisions in the interests of the
company.</div> <a name="0607124000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has been
an interesting discussion, but I can give the Minister the assurance
she looks for: I shall not press the amendment to a
vote.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column594" />Column number: 595</div><a name="0607124000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607124000249"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I shall deal with the other amendments.</div>
<a name="0607124000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 41 is curious and
we cannot support it. It is unnecessary, partly because it fails to
distinguish duties with which a director must comply and matters to
which they must have regard in fulfilling their duties, and again, the
list is not exhaustive.</div>
<a name="0607124000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 43 and 165 are
also misconceived. They appear to take the view that clause 158 imposes
several different and potentially contradictory duties. However, we
have been clear that it is not a question of a hierarchy of duties. One
duty is enunciated, and in carrying it out, directors must have regard
to the factors. We have said that a number of times. Amendment No. 165
would create a hierarchy, which we do not understand.</div>
<a name="0607124000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to amendment No. 417, and
to new clause 27, which is about the publication of statutory and
non-statutory guidance. We have said that we will publish non-statutory
guidance, so I was amused by that discussion. The purpose of
non-statutory guidance and legislation generally is to help
people&#151;in this case, companies&#151;obtain a better
understanding and interpretation of legal provisions, not to create
problems. We will publish the guidance in that regard. It does not need
annual renewal and review, so we will not agree to the proposal. We
intend to publish non-statutory guidance, which I am afraid does not
meet the desires of my hon. Friend the Member for Bedford.</div>
<a name="0607124000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause would re-impose a
section of the Companies Act 1985, which we have discussed extensively.
The most helpful thing I can do is quote from the company law
review:</div> <a name="0607124000175"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
is nevertheless considerable evidence that the effect of the law is not
well recognised and understood. This may be in part because the
relevant principles are not
enacted&#148;&#151;</div><a name="0607124000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">hence, we
are legislating for them
today&#151;</div><a name="0607124000176"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;but have to
be derived from quite extensive case law, developed over 250 years and
rooted in the eighteenth century law of trusts.&#148;</div>
<a name="0607124000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">The relevant part of the quotation
says:</div> <a name="0607124000177"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
situation is also complicated by the statutory redefinition (or
extension) of the directors&#146; core duty in what is now section
309 of
the&#148;&#151;</div><a name="0607124000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">1985&#151;</div><a name="0607124000178"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Act.&#148;</div>
<a name="0607124000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment is a curiosity. I
take it as a probing amendment more than anything else, especially if
one considers it alongside other amendments. If the hon. Member for
Huntingdon accepts that, I shall not pursue it.</div>
<a name="0607124000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had a long discussion,
and hon. Members want to discuss other key matters. It has been a good
debate, but I hope that at the end of the day people who support the
purpose of corporate social responsibility and do not see any conflict
between it and the long-term interests of companies, which in
themselves create the wealth that is so important to our nation, will
vote with us and not pursue any amendment in any hon. Member&#146;s
name.</div>
<a name="0607124000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607124000250"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> First, the Minister cited amendment No. 78 and
mentioned that our noble Friends supported the clause She is simply
wrong. Amendment 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column595" />Column number: 596</div>No. 78 in the House of Lords proposed replacing the words from
&#147;act&#148; in the first line with</div>
<a name="0607124000179"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in good faith in what he considers
to be in the interests of the company&#148;.</div>
<a name="0607124000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is basically just reasserting
existing law and deleting the list of directors&#146;
responsibilities in its entirety. The hon. Member for Bedford was
correct. That is what the Lords did and it is not what the Minister
said. However, the hon. Gentleman seemed to have missed the fact that I
started off the debate today by saying that that is what our noble
Friends did and I had to decide whether simply to follow their line or
to take a more constructive line of amending the clause to make it more
acceptable. That is a point of
clarification.</div><a name="0607124000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
appreciate that the Government are being pulled in various directions,
but this is a situation of their own making. I highlighted the
technical problems with the codification of directors&#146; duties,
which many have pointed out. I quoted many commentators who believe
that the provisions have real implications for companies. To that
extent, whatever view one takes of the clause, the Minister went rather
over the top in her denunciation of my approach, which is shared by
many other people.</div> <a name="0607124000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
believe that this is important. By using the &#147;one size fits
all&#148; approach, the Government will be tarring the corner shop
with the same brush as the multinational. That has the potential to
hinder the growth of businesses and UK plc. By attempting to codify the
common law duties of a director in statute, the Government have
introduced language that almost every corporate law firm that has
contacted us has said will lead to greater uncertainty and
confusion&#151;the exact opposite of what the Minister said she wants
from the clause.</div><a name="0607124000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">On a
rather simplistic level, the Government argue that it would be easier
for company directors to refer to a statute than a great amount of case
law. However, by putting directors&#146; duties into rigid statute, a
great deal of the flexibility of the common law system will be lost.
The Government inevitably end up cherry-picking those items that they
think should go into their list, which will in itself lead to
uncertainty and lack of clarity. They have also sewn confusion in the
debate by maintaining that they do not intend to change the common law
while at the same time introducing the concept of enlightened
shareholder value. All commentators seem to note that there is a change
in the common law position, and the Government should accept
that.</div><a name="0607124000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is the old
adage that one should always expect the unexpected. That certainly
applies to the hon. Member for Cambridge. He made the case that the
clause is unlikely to lead to many court cases in practice. I do not
think that he is necessarily correct. Clearly the broad spectrum of
City lawyers who have been commenting would disagree with
him&#151;but that in itself is a debatable issue. Even if he were
right, the fact that not many people are to be sued does not justify
the clause. He then argued that the clause would protect directors.
Again, if there is credence to his argument it is because the change in
the law will so muddy the waters that people will be put off going to
court.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607124000252"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Perhaps, but we are looking for a degree of
certainty in the Bill.</div>
<a name="0607124000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Bedford
advocated his separate approach in his informed speech. He was confused
as to how the Conservatives could support corporate social
responsibility but at the same time query enlightened shareholder
value. CSR does not need strict definition in an area which does not
need definition. What could be a huge effort of presentation of CSR for
a small company could be a small effort and not doing much for a large
company.</div><a name="0607124000187"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div><a name="0607124000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607124000253"></a>Patrick
Hall:</b> The hon. Gentleman has just alluded to a fascinating
philosophical point. While the impact of a large company will obviously
be greater globally than that of a small company such as a corner shop,
surely the principles of being responsible are exactly the
same.</div><a name="0607124000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607124000254"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Yes. One could apply the elephant test to a
company&#146;s attitude to CSR, but that cannot be done with
enlightened shareholder value in the way that the Government propose,
as it needs to be defined in the Bill. I have said why I think that
that is not desirable. To the extent that it is to be done, we think
that there are problems in making it
work.</div><a name="0607124000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was pleased
that the Minister emphasised that enlightened shareholder value does
not extend common law duties, and it was good to have that put on the
record, but that does not make the relevant issues any less relevant or
important. I agree with
that.</div><a name="0607124000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister&#146;s attempt to throw up an Aunt Sally that somehow shows
that we do not like CSR was pretty weak. The Conservative party has
championed a proposal for dealing with climate change that is much more
serious than the Government&#146;s suggestion, and we do not propose
to use non-specific company law. Our proposals are in our energy
review. We believe that championing renewable, carbon-neutral energy
sources is the way to make a real difference. Equally, a company law
review is not the forum in which to debate climate change policy. If it
were, we could spend the next month debating the environment and
ignoring all the other common law
duties.</div><a name="0607124000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman) showed where the
Government are coming from when she asked whether the good intentions
shown by all hon. Members would not be toothless without regulation.
What we have here is the eternal cry of the regulator and, dare I say
it, the socialist. Perhaps we have moved on from that. Yes, the
Government have a role in guiding, in praising good CSR and in
castigating bad practice, but, as the Minister herself said, general
regulation will not necessarily improve the situation. We maintain that
it could make matters worse. Regulation, where required, should be
specific, but that is not the case in this situation.</div>
<a name="0607124000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth mentioning the
probing amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and
Stamford. As fascinated as I was by the law according to him, I must
say that we do not agree with his amendment, although I appreciate that
it is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column597" />Column number: 598</div>probing. However, I am pleased that he tabled it, because it allows me
to reiterate that the Conservative party values the environment as an
issue.</div><a name="0607124000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">While we have
problems with the list as a whole, both conceptually and legally, we
certainly have no wish to single out the duty that relates to the
environment for deletion from the list of directors&#146; duties. To
the contrary&#151;if there must be a list, we are happy that the
environment has been included. We remain puzzled, however, as to why so
many other duties and responsibilities have not made the list, and are
concerned about the potential for confusion that will result from the
measure.</div> <a name="0607124000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have chosen six responsibilities for a director while
ignoring hundreds of others. We have been advised that that approach
will lead to great uncertainties and confusion as companies and lawyers
try to work out which duties rank above each other or are more
important. Do they all carry the same weight? The Minister strongly
maintained that they do, and we will reconsider what she said. If that
is the case, why were only those six chosen? If the codified
responsibilities are more important than the uncodified, why is
that?</div><a name="0607124000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Overly
restrictive general regulation is not an example that we should be
setting. UK companies that have been spurred on by shareholders and
consumers are already beginning to set an example to their competitors
on corporate responsibility, and we support that approach over
heavy-handed interference. We shall reserve our position on the clause
as we move towards consideration on Report because we wish to review
the Minister&#146;s words and the sheer weight of amendments has made
an immediate response difficult. We also wish to consult further in the
summer months. In the meantime, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="0607124000127"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607124000255"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We move on after a long interlude on clause
158.</div><a name="0607124000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 159
introduces to statute a duty that directors must exercise their powers
independently and must not fetter the future exercise of their
discretion unless acting in accordance with an agreement made with the
company or in a way authorised by its constitution. Although clearly
based on the current legal position, the wording has been altered
significantly.</div><a name="0607124000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provision was debated in the Lords when Lord Freeman moved a probing
amendment to omit subsection (1). He said first that directors might be
restricted in relying on fellow directors or external advisers,
particularly non-executive directors who as common practice rely on
advice, reports and recommendations given by others. He also said that
nominee directors appointed by a corporate 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column598" />Column number: 599</div>shareholder would, for obvious reasons, be unable to exercise
independent
judgment.</div><a name="0607124000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord
Goldsmith responded that a director can take advice or copy someone
else&#146;s judgment, but the judgment that he exercises must be his
own. He said that in some circumstances directors might breach their
duties if they failed to take appropriate advice, but that slavish
reliance would be unacceptable. In relation to nominee directors, case
law supports the notion that they are required to exercise their best
judgment in the interests of the
company.</div><a name="0607124000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Law
Society&#146;s parliamentary brief recommends leaving out the clause.
It points out that the law in this area is developing and that the
clause casts doubt on whether a director can rely on other directors or
external advisers. Furthermore, it states that it is unclear what, if
anything, the clause adds to the duties in clause 158. The CBI and a
briefing note received from City solicitors Norton Rose point out that
it is unclear whether the duty in clause 159 precludes a director from
delegating functions to committees of a board. However, guidance from
the Department of Trade and Industry seems to indicate that that would
be permitted if allowed by a company&#146;s constitution. Will the
Minister explain how the Government came to that point of
view?</div><a name="0607124000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our concern is
that a non-independent, non-executive director&#151;for instance, a
nominee director of a large shareholder&#151;might fear that under
the clause the duty to exercise independent judgment could be used to
make their position more difficult. What can the Minister say to put
such people&#146;s minds at
rest?</div><a name="0607124000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, clause
159(2) notes that a director will not be in breach if he acts in a way
authorised by his company&#146;s constitution. On that basis, is it
not the case that if a company&#146;s articles said that a
non-independent nominee director could act in accordance with the
instructions of the nominating shareholder, or at least that he could
have full regard to such instructions, that would end or reduce the
duty set out in the clause, which presumably overrides the existing
common law
duty?</div><a name="0607124000137"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607124000256"></a>The
Solicitor-General (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</b> The duty is about
directors having to make their own judgments and not follow blindly the
views of another without considering the interests of the company. In
other words, the role of a director is to exercise independent judgment
for the benefit of the company. That is what we expect directors to do.
It is surely right that they should have that obligation, given that it
is what they were appointed to do. If the clause were deleted as the
amendment proposes, the duty would remain an uncodified equitable
principle.</div><a name="0607124000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607124000257"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> To clarify, there is no amendment. I have put to
the Solicitor-General a few probing questions for the stand part
debate.</div><a name="0607124000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607124000258"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We are discussing clause 159. I think we are all
conscious of
that.</div><a name="0607124000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607124000259"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Solicitor-General referred to an
amendment.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column599" />Column number: 600</div><a name="0607124000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607124000260"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I did refer to an amendment, and I have
a note here on it, but I accept that the hon. Gentleman did not move
one, so let us deal with the stand part debate.</div>
<a name="0607124000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The aim is to codify the law so
that it is easily accessible to directors. The duty does not mean that
a director cannot take proper advice from a lawyer, an accountant or
anyone else he feels it appropriate to take advice from. He can take
such advice from others and rely on it if he chooses to do so. Although
he is exercising an independent judgment, that does not mean that he
must be independent himself. He might have an interest in the matter,
and conflicts of interest are dealt with in clauses 161 to 163. It is
only the director&#146;s judgment that must be independent, in the
sense that it must be his judgment, not that of someone
else.</div><a name="0607124000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The director may
even adopt another&#146;s judgment, provided that he believes that it
is in the best interests of the company&#151;in other words, that his
judgment is that someone else&#146;s judgment is in the best
interests of the company.</div>
<a name="0607124000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (2)(a) reflects the
current law in Cabra Estates plc and Fulham football club. Under
subsection (2)(b), companies can authorise the fettering of the
discretion through their constitution, if they choose to do
so.</div><a name="0607124000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The statutory
statement does not affect the current law that a delegate may not
delegate unless he has been given the power to do so. Provided that a
company gives a director a power to delegate, he may choose to exercise
that power, but it is for the company itself to give him it. Directors
may delegate the performance of their functions and the exercise of
their powers if the company has given them the power to delegate. They
will know whether they have that power, because it may be conferred
expressly on them by the company&#146;s constitution or by
shareholders&#146; resolution, or it may be implied, provided that it
is clearly implied.</div>
<a name="0607124000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Article 15 of the draft model
articles for companies limited by shares, which were published in the
March 2005 White Paper, provides that, with certain exceptions,
directors may delegate any of their functions to any person they think
fit. The Law Commission&#146;s draft summary of the general duties
did not deal with delegation. The company law review included the
principle in its draft statement because it wanted to emphasise the
fact that directors may not subordinate their judgment to that of
another by delegating their functions unless such delegation is
authorised by the constitution. We have concluded that the principle
does not belong in the statutory statement. How the directors
distribute their functions among themselves on a day-to-day basis is
part of how they organise their affairs in accordance with the
constitution.</div><a name="0607124000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
question arises as to how the duty adds to clause 158. It has been said
that most of the fiduciary duties can be seen as aspects of one
fundamental duty to act in good faith for the benefit of the company.
Even if that is so, the conventional approach is further to classify
the duties. That helps to show the range of the duties and the various
ways in which they apply. The Law Commission and the company law review
both considered that the statement of duties should include a separate
reference to a requirement on a fiduciary not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column600" />Column number: 601</div>to fetter discretion, and we agree with
that.</div><a name="0607124000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was asked whether the Bill will change the law on nominee directors.
The general duties do not prevent the appointment of nominee directors,
who are appointed by a particular party to protect their interests.
However, once appointed, the nominee director must be left free to
exercise his best judgment in the interests of the company that he
serves. The nominee director must ignore the interests and wishes of
the person who appointed him, and we rely there on case law, including
Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society Ltd <i class="I">v. </i>Meyer and Kuwait
Asia Bank EC <i class="I">v.</i> National Mutual Life Nominees Ltd. The statutory
statement does not change that, but subsection (2)(b) will allow the
status of the nominee director to be enshrined in the company&#146;s
constitution so that the nominee is able to follow the instructions of
the person who appointed him without breaching that duty. The extent to
which that is possible under the existing law was unclear, but we have
now made it clear. However, even when a nominee follows instructions,
he must still comply with all his other duties&#151;there may well be
other duties&#151;such as a duty to act broadly in the interests of
the company. I hope that that deals with the points raised by the hon.
Gentleman and I hope that he will be able to support the
clause.</div><a name="0607124000188"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30

<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
160</h4><a name="0607124000008"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Duty
to exercise reasonable care, skill and
diligence</div><a name="0607124000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607124000262"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b><b class="B"> </b>I beg to move amendment No. 272, in
clause 160, page 70, line 34, leave out
subsection (2).</div><a name="0607124000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause is a new provision and codifies the duty to exercise reasonable
care, skill and diligence, which is to be judged by both a subjective
and an objective standard. Lord Freeman moved a probing amendment in
the other place to leave out subsection (2) so as to remove the
objective/subjective test introduced by section 214 of the Insolvency
Act 1986 as it adds a level of severity. The extent of a
director&#146;s duties, failings and liabilities should be determined
on the particular facts of a case. This also raises the issue of the
standard on which a director who is also a professional should be
judged. Lord Goldsmith responded that subsection (2) is essential to
establish what the standard of care owed by director to a company is.
He said that the wording of subsection (2) is clear and that the duty
of care will take into account the general knowledge, skills and
experience of that director. He also said, in response to a Law Society
query, that if a director is a professional but is not employed by the
company in his professional capacity, he would not be expected to bring
his professional expertise to the directorship. Will the
Solicitor-General provide the grounds on which the Attorney-General
made that statement?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column601" />Column number: 602</div><a name="0607124000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The City firm, Linklaters,
pointed out in a report that the provision follows recent case law,
which has adopted the twofold duty that I discussed. However, adopting
such a test, which was originally introduced in an insolvency context,
may cause concern if applied in all situations and for all types of
company. Directors of smaller companies, particularly those established
for non-commercial purposes, would find that standard particularly
onerous. Furthermore, non-executive directors are to be judged by the
same standard as executive directors. Norton Rose&#146;s report
pointed out that non-executive directors will often have more
experience than their executive counterparts. Does the
Solicitor-General consider that the impact of the clause could be to
put directors off serving as
directors?</div><a name="0607124000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607124000263"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Those who take it on themselves to act
on behalf of or to advise others may have a duty to exercise care and
skill in doing so. The clause is concerned with the application of that
duty to company directors. The duty of care that a director owes to his
company is an important area of law and has evolved significantly over
the past 20 years. Historically, there was a very low standard of care
and a director was not required to exhibit in the performance of his
duties a greater degree of skill than might reasonably be expected from
a person of his knowledge and experience. That was in re City Equitable
Fire Insurance
Company.</div><a name="0607124000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some 19th
century cases remain well known, in part because their outcome now
strikes us as out of step with modern expectations. For example, in
1892 the court held that the Marquis of Bute, who was appointed a bank
president at the age of six months and attended only one meeting of the
board in 39 years, had not breached his duty of care. That
was in re Cardiff Savings Bank. Standards have changed and the law has
developed significantly. The Law Commission considered that we should
ensure that our current standard is the right one and that that should
be set out in statute. The company law review agreed, as do
we.</div><a name="0607124000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">The duty requires a
director to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence. Subsection
(2) explains what that means.
It</div><a name="0607124000180"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;means the care, skill
and diligence that would be exercised by a reasonably diligent
person.&#148;</div><a name="0607124000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">The duty is based
on</div> <a name="0607124000181"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the general
knowledge, skill and experience that may reasonably be expected of a
person carrying out
the&#148;</div><a name="0607124000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">same functions as the
director in that particular company, and the
actual</div><a name="0607124000182"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;general knowledge,
skill and experience that the director
has.&#148;</div><a name="0607124000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">The former is the
minimum standard required by the duty on all directors. If the
particular director possesses greater general knowledge, skill or
experience than that which may reasonably be expected of a director
carrying out the same functions as him in that company, he will have to
meet a higher standard of care, skill and diligence appropriate to his
general knowledge, skill and experience.</div>
<a name="0607124000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">That deals with executive or
non-executive directors who might have different levels of knowledge
and skill, where they are expected to exercise that. If the director 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column602" />Column number: 603</div>happens to possess less knowledge, skill and experience than that which
would be reasonably expected of a director carrying out the same
functions as him in that company, he would nevertheless be required to
meet the minimum standard set by the objective test in subsection
(2)(a), which was referred to also in the case of re DKG Contractors
Ltd.</div><a name="0607124000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">The standard of
care takes account of the differences between the responsibilities of
directors of different types and in different situations&#151;for
example, the chairman, chief executive, finance director, chairman of
the audit committee or an independent non-executive director. The
objective element of the test looks at the general knowledge, skill and
experience that may be reasonably expected of a person carrying out the
same functions as the director in that company, enabling the court to
take account of all such
differences.</div><a name="0607124000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a
sense, I have dealt already with non-executive directors. The duty
takes into account an individual&#146;s general knowledge, skill and
experience that they are expected to deploy. However, the duty does not
require the director to use all his skills. For example, a lawyer on
the board of a company is not expected to second guess the lawyers
advising the company, but to use his general knowledge, skill and
ability to look at things. It might be that, as a result of those
skills, he will have some questions about a decision with a legal
impact and for which legal advice has been obtained. However, he is not
expected to go off and spend a week researching the subject that a
barrister has been employed to research in order to see if he agrees
with it. That is not the required level of diligence. So it is about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column603" />Column number: 604</div>exercising reasonable care, skill and diligence. The non-executive
director will use some of his experience and skill in his involvement,
but he is not expected to have all the knowledge about the internal
workings of the business that, say, an executive director is, and so
the law will take account of people&#146;s different
perspectives.</div><a name="0607124000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause provides sufficient guidance to directors so that they can
exercise their roles with a degree of certainty about what is required
of them. I hope therefore that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to
support our position.</div>
<a name="0607124000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0607124000264"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Solicitor-General explained the test in
section 214 of the Insolvency Act 1986 very well, and I appreciate that

214.</div> <a name="0607124000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Tom Mackay, chair
