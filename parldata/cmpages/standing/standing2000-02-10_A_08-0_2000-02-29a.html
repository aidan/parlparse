<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce </B>(South Dorset): It is kind of you, Mr. Hood, to allow us some comfort. I do not know whether that is necessary as a result of the soporific effect of my speaking immediately after lunch.
<P>
I believe that I was in mid-sentence when we adjourned. The hon. Member for Ilford, North (Ms Perham), whom I did not recognise earlier, asked me about people on low incomes being included in the list as well as those of pensionable age, but the two categories are not necessarily linked. I do not think that those who read the Bill will look at all four together: one does not have to have be in all four categories for one's interests to be taken into account. Each is individual.
<P>
When the Committee adjourned, I was seeking an explanation from the Minister about what the Government are trying to do. Are they trying to make special arrangements, so that any of the people in this group can say, ``I am now better off because of this wonderful Utilities Bill. I shall now be cross-subsidised by other people'', or will they not be disadvantaged, as under the previous legislation, because they had a special need that the utilities would take into account at low cost?
<P>
With that, I shall sit down and listen to the Minister. I am sure that my hon. Friends will also want to jump in and find out what they want to hear.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Dr. Kim Howells):</B> I welcome you back to the Committee, Mr. Hood. It is good to see you, as ever.
<P>
I made it clear in earlier sittings that the eradication of fuel poverty is a high priority and that we must help poorer consumers to obtain cheaper energy and more efficient homes. We are tackling this problem through a range of measures, as the Committee knows, including the regulator's social action plan and the home energy efficiency programme. In addition, the Government intend to use the new powers for energy efficiency obligations in the Bill to target poor consumers, as the existing regulator's energy efficiency performance standards do at present. The first tranche of the new obligation, for the period 2002_05, will be targeted at the poor. In our view the amendments would not help our efforts to target disadvantaged customers more effectively.
<P>
I want to deal particularly with two of the points raised by the hon. Minister for South Dorset (Mr. Bruce). As I have explained, a fundamental aim of the Bill is to redress the balance between the interests of shareholders and of consumers, both domestic and business. That is why we have placed the interests of consumers where they belong--at the heart of the regulatory process.
<P>
As hon. Ministers will by now be aware, the Government are concerned that certain groups of disadvantaged consumers do not yet reap the full benefits of competition. Even as competition drives down prices and raises service standards, differentials in tariffs are widening and the problem of fuel poverty becomes further entrenched. We are determined that that state of affairs should not be allowed to continue.
<P>
I have already described some of the measures that we are taking to address those problems. The measures are underpinned by the aspect of the primary duty that requires the regulator to have regard to the interests of such disadvantaged groups, including the disabled and those on low incomes. As the hon. Minister for South Dorset noted this morning, these groups have particular interests. The chronically sick, such as those on dialysis machines, have a vital interest in the continuity of energy supply, as do many of pensionable age. I am not certain what definition of those who are retired the hon. Gentleman was trying to tease out of me, but I hope that what I say will address at least part of his concern.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> None of us wants to see these groups disadvantaged, but we are concerned about the level of advantage. One question that we raised with officials when we were first briefed at the Department of Trade and Industry was how much money would be transferred from an able-bodied, wealthy consumer to these disadvantaged consumers. We were told that the Government would announce a figure and it would be helpful if the Minister could give us an indication of the likely level of spending.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I am not aware of any figures. If I discover any, the hon. Gentleman can be certain that he will have them.
<P>
Those on low incomes have an interest in low-price services. It will be for the regulator to determine what is meant by the words ``pensionable age'' in the clause and who falls within the description of ``individuals with low incomes''. However, these matters may become the subject of statutory guidance issued by the Secretary of State under his power in clause 9.
<P>
It is not a duty to have regard to disadvantaged groups above all other consumers, as the immediately following words make clear:
<P>
but that is not to be taken as implying that regard may not be had to the interests of other descriptions of the consumer.
That provision enables the regulator to weigh the interests of different consumer groups and to use his judgment.
<P>
We therefore intend to resist amendments Nos. 306, 307, 311, 312, 340 and 341.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I made it reasonably clear at the outset that these were probing amendments. I was trying to elicit from the Government a better idea of what they were trying to do. We have had a fairly clear steer from the Minister that he is simply trying to ensure that special interests are taken into account without the need for an enormous switch of resources. I do not know whether the figure for that switch has yet reached the Minister and whether he might wish to intervene.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The eagle-eyed hon. Gentleman noticed that I had been passed a piece of paper. The point discussed at the Department of Trade and Industry briefing, which I think is the one to which the hon. Gentleman was referring, was the cost of energy efficiency targets, which we shall come to in later debates.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. That is helpful. I do not think that large amounts of money are involved, and we shall reach energy efficiency and other environmental areas later in the Committee. Having done my job of obtaining those additional pieces of information, which I am sure the utilities and consumers will be interested to know about, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 203, in page 5, line 33, leave out subsection (4) and insert--
<P>
(4) the Secretary of State and the Authority may, in carrying out any function under this Part, have regard to--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the interests of consumers in relation to electricity conveyed by distribution systems (within the meaning of the Electricity Act 1989); and
<P>
(b) any interests of consumers in relation to--
<br>(i) telecommunication services and telecommunication apparatus (within the meaning of the Telecommunications Act 1984); or
<br>(ii) water services or sewerage services (within the meaning of the Water Industry Act 1991), which are affected by the carrying out of that function.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<p><B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 204 and 205.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Taken together, the amendments honour a commitment made in the 1998 White Paper that has been widely supported during consultations. They adapt the energy and telecoms regulatory framework to the emergence of firms that supply services in more than one regulated sector, which are known as multi-utilities.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 203 and 204 reproduce the substance of new subsection 4 in clauses 8 and 12. As such, they will allow the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority--GEMA--to take account of the interests of electricity consumers when carrying out its functions under the Gas Act 1986, and of gas consumers when carrying out its functions under the Electricity Act 1989. Secondly, the amendments will enable GEMA to have regard to consumers in the telecoms and water sectors who may be affected by the exercise of a particular function.
<P>
Amendment No. 205 will allow the Telecommunications Authority to have regard to consumers in the energy and water sectors who may be affected by the exercise of its functions under Telecommunications Act 1984. The appearance of multi-utilities--utility firms that supply services in more than one regulated sector--is a good example of a development that was not foreseen by the original utilities legislation. Multi-utilities have the potential to bring consumers significant benefits through economies of scale and convenience. At present, each regulator's duties and associated licence conditions are limited to his own sector. That might hinder realisation of the benefits that multi-utilities can bring.
<P>
We are not imposing any detailed requirements in respect of multi-utilities. No one can be certain about the future characteristics of multi-utilities, or even whether they will prove a permanent feature. Instead of making detailed provisions that assume future knowledge, we are equipping regulatory authorities to respond to a range of possible developments by acting separately or in concert, as necessary.

<P>

<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): Why has the Minister included telecommunication apparatus in amendment No. 203?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> The Government are increasingly discovering the difficulties that they will encounter as a result of over-regulation. In many ways, the amendments are to be welcomed, because they acknowledge that, for example, a water company is more than merely a water company. When I was involved with the Industry and Parliament Trust, it was known that I had an interest in telecoms. I visited a research area that was developing an electricity cable with a telecoms capacity. It could be used for switching electricity, but it also provided a high band-width facility.
<P>
If the Government take the view that, where an electricity company is involved, they must be able to intervene when anything nasty happens, that the consumer must be protected by rules and regulations and that they must do their best to produce a watertight Bill, they will experience the complications and convolutions associated with trying to cover every avenue. We should not move in that direction. Instead, regulation should be light and kept to a minimum. Were the Minister to decide to allow each authority to employ 10 people, and were he subsequently to produce a Bill that such numbers could deal with, he would be moving in the right direction.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) has sprung a surprise--I cannot find the reference he cites, let alone answer his question. However, that is what officials are for, and I now have one of my own. The amendment reflects clause 89's description of the new general duties. That point is covered in amendment No. 309, but if the hon. Gentleman requires further information I shall provide it.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 181, 188, 190 and 200.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The amendments are intended primarily to correct errors that were made in transposing the gas and electricity regulator's secondary general duties from the existing legislation to clauses 8 and 12. We have recast the regulator's general duties to put consumers at the heart of the regulatory process. In both the gas and electricity sectors, that has involved elevating the consumer duty, which is a secondary duty in the existing legislation, to ensure that nothing takes precedence over the interests of consumers.
<P>
Apart from those changes, our general approach has been to preserve the other existing secondary duties in terms both of their content and their position in the hierarchy of duties. In seeking to preserve the remaining secondary general duties in the Bill, we made two accidental omissions. The amendments correct those, and make an additional change.
<P>
The first omission relates to the gas sector. The secondary duty to protect the public from dangers arising from the conveyance of gas through pipes or from the use of gas was omitted from the Bill. That duty is currently located in section 4A(1) of the Gas Act 1986. Amendment No. 180 transposes that duty word for word, in the same position within the hierarchy, into the gas regulator's general duties in clause 8. The secondary duty will match its electricity equivalent, which is set out in clause 12, and sit alongside the new specific duty in clause 10 to consult the Health and Safety Commission on gas safety issues, and to take account of any advice that is given.
<P>
The second omission also concerns the gas sector. Clause 8 states that the gas regulator's secondary duty to promote efficiency and economy applies in relation only to licence holders. However, under the 1986 Act, that duty applies in relation to persons who operate under an exemption, as well as those who hold a licence. The amendments correct that omission by ensuring that the duty to promote efficiency and economy applies equally to exempt persons and to those who hold a licence.
<P>
The amendments go further by making similar changes to the electricity regulator's duty in clause 12 to promote efficiency and economy. That widens the existing scope of that duty, as it appears in the Electricity Act 1989, so that it too captures persons operating under an exemption, as well as those who hold licences. That change to the existing position in the electricity sector makes it conform to that of the gas sector, which is desirable given that both sectors are now to be regulated by a single authority, GEMA.
<P>
The appointment of a single regulatory authority reflects the convergence of the two sectors and the necessity, whatever possible, to subject the two sectors to a common regulatory regime. The authority's principle objective of protecting the interests of consumers extends to customers of exempt suppliers, and elsewhere in the Bill there are provisions that make it clear that conditions may be attached to the granting of exemptions. Promoting efficiency and economy to exempt persons is consistent with that approach, and I commend the amendment to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> I rise to speak briefly before my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton because I tabled amendment No.{**TH**}342. It seems that my concerns have been reflected in the Government's amendments. The original wording of subsection (5) did not go far enough in terms of the safety and environmental implications of gas leaks. My amendment goes a little further than that tabled by the Government, especially in terms of the licensee. The person supplying the gas must be concerned about gas leaks, in relation to the wasting of energy and the problems caused by the release of gas into the environment. I hope that the Government will consider whether the amendment, which I shall not press to a vote, might contain some elements that might be included in their complex amendments to the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I start by paying tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for south Dorset for spotting a significant error--one of many, I am afraid--in the drafting of the Bill. The Government have already tabled 54 amendments, and no doubt they have been kaleidoscoped down to make the number less. Rumours suggest that the Government are planning 450 amendments to the Bill. This morning, the Minister gave a broad hint that the Government would give careful and serious consideration to the letter from the operators group about removing the telecommunications sector from the Bill. We have just heard the Minister speak about ``accidental omissions'' from the Bill, and errors in transposing secondary duties from the original Acts.
<P>
The Bill has been handled with complete incompetence from start to finish. What concerns me is not that incompetent people are drafting and dealing with the Bill, but that other errors may go unnoticed on to the statute book. Although the Opposition do our best to scrutinise the Bill in detail, we do not have resources or expertise available to the Government, civil servants and regulatory authorities. My hon. Friend and I will continue to scrutinise the Bill as thoroughly as we can. If the Government get it wrong, the Bill will affect the safety of dangerous industries.
<P>
Our consideration of the Bill so far has revealed error after error. The first few clauses may contain further errors, for which the Government have missed the deadline for tabling amendments, and they may be too proud or embarrassed to table them at a later date. The Committee does not know what is going on. As the Member leading for the Opposition, I have no confidence that the Bill will be thorough and properly drafted by the time it reaches the statute book. The Government should seriously consider taking the Bill away, thinking again and trying to address the concerns of industry. I have spent many hours with many sections of industry discussing their concerns about the Bill. Those concerns are felt across the utility sectors. The Government would be well advised to subject a revised Bill to a First and Second Reading all over again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian White: </B>(Milton Keynes, North-East): That was an interesting Third Reading speech. I want the Minister to address one small point, to which I referred in the previous sitting. It concerns the relationship between the Department of Trade and Industry as the regulator for the offshore industry, the provisions in the amendment that relate to efficiency from the beachhead inland, and the overlap between the two. I know that the offshore industry has had discussions with the Minister, and I would ask him to consider the amendment in that light. An issue remains to be resolved.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East (Mr. White) that we will look carefully at that division of responsibility. I want to make it clear to the Committee that the Government are determined that health and safety within the sector are our greatest priority. There will be no sloppy drafting of any part of the Bill that relates to health and safety.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am concerned about clause 8. Together with clauses 12 and 89; it goes to the root of the changes that the Bill proposes to the regulatory framework. the three prime objectives of the previous regime were to protect competition, to ensure financial viability and to maintain security of supply in the utilities. They have now been replaced by the one prime objective of protecting the interests of the consumer. We have not received a proper response from the Minister to the concerns raised during the debate, despite the fact that the Government have resisted all the Opposition's amendments.
<P>
Our first concern relates to the term ``wherever possible''. It is to be found throughout the Government's documentation, including the Green Paper and the response to the consultation document, which propose that, wherever possible and appropriate, the regulator and the Secretary of State should pursue competition as a way of promoting and protecting consumer interests. However, the term ``wherever possible'' was removed from the Bill, probably due to an error in transposition, not from the original Act but from the documentation. It would be far more powerful to have the phrase ``wherever possible and appropriate'' than simply ``wherever appropriate'', which is far more subjective and gives the regulator far more discretion to promote competition as a way of enhancing and protecting the interests of the consumer.
<P>
The evidence so far, since privatisation, suggests that the promotion of competition has been the most effective way of bringing down prices and introducing new services, better quality, more choice and opportunity for the consumer--more effective than any amount of regulation. As competition increases, it is time for the regulator to back off. A different approach appears in the Bill, and I would like to know why the phrase ``wherever possible'' was omitted from the drafting in clauses 8, 12 and 89.
<P>
The Government resisted the amendment that proposed revoking conditions or regulations that were no longer required. This is a regulatory and interventionist Bill. It is, therefore, imperative that when new regulations, conditions or exemptions are proposed by the regulator or the Secretary of State, specific objectives for them should be clearly set out so that people can judge whether and when those objectives have been met. If they have been met, it will be time to remove those regulations that the Secretary of State has imposed.
<P>
The third question to which we have not received a satisfactory response relates to our proposal for an annual report to Parliament, which would set out the status of competition in the market, the changes that have occurred over the previous 12 months and an analysis of the regulations that impede competition. It could also contain recommendations on which regulations could be repealed to enhance competition and to invite more competition into the marketplace. That would be a superb way of ensuring a more competitive market, and of getting rid of burdensome regulations. Ministers often speak of the better regulation unit and the regulatory impact unit. However, we are faced with the most interventionist regulatory Bill that the Government have introduced so far, which is saying much. They should take heed of the comments made by Lord Haskins about the level of regulation, and the McKinsey report, which points to the burden of regulation as one of the key reasons why Britain does not enjoy as successful an economy or as high a standard of living as countries such as the United States. The Government should do more to reduce that burden.
5 pm
<P>
The Green Paper, which the Government seem unable to transpose into the Bill, warns of a framework of regulation that cuts across the independence of economic regulators. It suggests that that would increase regulatory risk and thus the cost of capital. The Green Paper goes on to state:
<P>
A framework which stacks the cards too heavily in favour of short term benefits for consumers would blunt incentives for companies to become more efficient and innovative and deter investment--which would in turn be bad for consumers in the long term.
That comes from the Government's own Green Paper and is precisely what they fear might arise from changing the objective framework. Putting the consumer first and piling on too many regulations to protect them will damage then in the long term by blunting incentives for companies to become more efficient and innovative, and will deter investment. That is the real fear about what will happen as a result of the Bill. It is supposed to help competitors to fight the dominant player in the market, but the non-dominant players are as concerned about the Bill as the dominant player, and they want the telecommunications section removed from the Bill.
<P>
The Bill does not respond to the needs of the industry and its concern about how to provide the best deal for consumers. The Confederation of British Industry, for example, is worried about clause 8 and has stated:
<P>
It is important that as well as pursuing its principal objective of protecting the interests of consumers, the regulator also has a duty to ensure that licence holders are able to finance their activities. Long term viability of businesses should be fully taken into account throughout the decision-making process.
Even the CBI believes that subordinating the duty--which was a primary duty in previous legislation--of maintaining the financial viability of the utility sector to the interests of protecting the consumer will be extremely damaging. It went on to state that
<P>
the quality and reliability of service is as important as price. It will be important for Ministers to clarify how far they expect the newly framed duty will change the regulators' current practice, ``having regard to'' securing financial viability does not place a strongly worded duty on the regulator to actively take into account these concerns.
The phrase ``have regard to'' suggests that only if they happen to remember should they examine the financial viability arising from the consequences of the regulations. It is important to ensure not only that existing companies in the sector remain viable and stay afloat during this highly regulated era, but that others are not deterred from coming into the sector. We have said many times and will continue to say that competition is the best way of delivering lower prices and better quality for consumers. The Minister has said nothing about why the Government decided to remove that prime duty and subordinate it way down the list of priorities in clauses 8, 12 and 89. The Minister has said nothing about how changing the duty will affect competition in the industry.
<P>
We said on Second Reading that we had some concerns. We proposed and voted for a reasoned amendment but abstained in the vote on Second Reading because we wanted to table amendments in Committee. We have tabled more amendments than the Government because we are very concerned about the Bill, but perhaps they will table further amendments. If the Government do not show that they understand the concern about the Bill by accepting at least some of our sensible and reasoned amendments, we shall vote against it if it ever reaches Third Reading. The Government would be well advised to take the Bill back to the drawing board, to start again and to try to make it less burdensome on business and, therefore, less costly to consumers.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I call the hon. Member for Lewes (Mr. Baker).
<P>
<B>Hon. Members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Norman Baker </B>(Lewes): I thank my fellow Committee members for their warm welcome. I apologise for my absence this morning and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell). If two Labour Members or Conservative Members are absent, people do not notice, but if two Liberal Democrat Members are absent, they do notice, which says something for our contributions to the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I have hardly started, but I shall give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I suspect that the hon. Gentleman is trying to point out that, whereas the Liberal Democrat Members did not move their amendments, to date no Conservative amendment has not been moved because there was no one here to move it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I am grateful for that helpful intervention. Without straying too far from the clause, I would point out that, if we had a fair voting system, there would be more members of the House of Commons on the Liberal Democrat Benches than there are.
<P>
I am deeply touched by the concern for my welfare and that of my hon. Friend, which has been expressed outside this Room and by members on both sides of the Committee. I look forward with interest to reading the Hansard report of this morning's sitting. I hope that the Minister appreciates the intellectually challenging amendments that the Liberal Democrats have tabled to the Bill.
<P>
I want to talk briefly about the principal objective of the clause, because that is perhaps the most important point. The key phrase is
<P>
to protect the interests of consumers.
A little probing is necessary to find out what that means. The phrase may appear to be self-explanatory, but--
<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> The hon. Gentleman may be aware that I tabled an amendment to probe that issue. The Committee had a substantial debate on it this morning and various points were made to the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I accept that. I have already said that it would have been helpful if I had been here this morning. I apologise to you, Mr. Hood. I cannot do any more than that. However, some points need to be made from our perspective. I intend to make them now, and I hope that the Committee will bear with me.
<P>
First, it is not clear to me whether the phrase relates to the long-term or the short-term interests of consumers. Short-term interests may relate to pricing policy, for example, and long-term interests to such matters as the way in which the industry is managed and its long-term environmental implications. Secondly, as I have said in previous debates--I have no idea whether the hon. Minister for Milton Keynes, North-East made the point this morning--I do not believe that the interests of consumers, albeit important, are of such paramount importance that they merit the phrase ``the principal objective'' in subsection (2).
<P>
The Government often tell us that a certain policy is at the heart of government--whether it is an environmental policy or a measure that is in the interests of consumers. There is so much at the heart of government that there is very little in the body--it is all congregated around the heart. It is a little narrow to set out one principal objective in the clause; two other issues should be given due and proper weight. One is the social objectives, which are referred to in lines 25 onwards. Subsection (3) says that
<P>
the Secretary of State shall have regard to the interests of--
and then lists various categories. I am glad that that is in the Bill. It might have been worth including in the clause those with poorly insulated homes, for example, or inefficient gas heating systems. I hope that the Minister will recognise that those are important points and will have regard to them when considering the interests of consumers.
<P>
As for the environmental objectives of the clause and the Bill, the interests of consumers could be construed as contrary to the interests of the enviornment, if the former are taken to be solely short-term financial interests. It would have been helpful if the commitment to a sound, long-term, sustainable environmental policy had been spelt out more clearly in the clause.
<P>
Clause 9 states:
<P>
The Secretary of State shall from time to time issue guidance.
That seems a little vague, and appears not to place too onerous a burden on the Secretary of State. Given pressure from members of the public and others for cuts in fuel bills, the Bill's environmental implications could largely be ignored. I hope that that will not happen, but why does the Bill not spell out the Government's environmental objectives? Are they on a par with consumer objectives, or are they to be pursued only if they do not obstruct others?
<P>
Do the Government intend to increase energy conservation and efficiency? Amendments that were moved a few moments ago referred to such measures, so I hope that that is a key objective. Is the minimising of fossil fuel consumption a Government objective? One hopes that we should be moving from reliance on fossil fuel to reliance on renewable energy from sustainable sources. Is that a Government objective, or will it be suppressed because the short-term interests of consumers do not demand a change of energy source? The Government must recognise that in, say, 30 or 40 years' time, this country's energy policy should not be based on fossil fuel and nuclear fuel consumption. That aspiration should be reflected in the Bill, but I do not think that it is.
<P>
Is the prevention of pollution, whether at source, during transmission, or at the consumer's end, a Government objective? During a previous sitting, the Minister referred fully--and, indeed, movingly--to his experience of pollution when living in Wales. Clearly, he is aware of the need to prevent pollution, so why is that not spelt out in the Bill as a principal environmental objective?
<P>
The clause should address the issue of a consumer impact assessment, which is an important way in which to examine the consumer's needs. I am not arguing with the notion of putting the consumer on a pedestal, but we must be able to measure what the consumer wants and what the impact will be. If we cannot measure impact, we cannot decide whether consumers' interests are being protected. Such an assessment could examine a range of issues, such as price, standards of service, choice, performance against social obligations, performance against environmental obligations--which affect the consumer--awareness of competition and freedom of information, and developments in other areas deemed to have a possible impact on the interests of consumers.
<P>
There are a number of issues relating to consumer impact. So far, the history of that subject is not one that should fill us with confidence. For example, Ofgem's recent consultation on British Gas Trading's price control review provided an insufficient breakdown of the effects of price control on different groups of domestic users. The review analysed payment methods--direct debit, standing order, cheque, and so on--but contained hardly any information on standards of service and consumer awareness of competing offers. We must define how the Government will ensure that the interests of consumers are protected, and a consumer impact assessment is the best way in which to do that.
<P>
I have kept my remarks necessarily brief, and I hope that my comments were relevant and did not bore Committee members. They are sensible points that needed to be made, and I hope that the Minister will respond to them.

<P>

<B>Mr. White:</B> It is typical of the Liberal Democrats to start talking about something after the moment has passed and they do not have to do anything about it. The hon. Gentleman made several points that would have been useful this morning. If he had been present, perhaps he would have been able to press the amendment to a vote and win it. When Liberal Democrats actually have a chance to influence matters, they miss out.
<P>
The clause makes vital changes, and is one of the reasons why the Bill has been given such a wide welcome across a diverse range of groups. It takes a large step forwards in putting the consumer at the heart of the regulator's activities and gives the consumers council major responsibilities.
<P>
When the Minister responded to the debate on environmental issues this morning, he made it clear that environmental and social objectives play a key role in the Government's thinking. That is welcome. The clause will have a significant impact on the lives of ordinary people.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Chope </B>(Christchurch): I wish that I could share the hon. Gentleman's enthusiasm for the clause, but I feel that it is vague and confusing. It is also sinister, in that it raises people's expectations beyond what can ever be delivered. The explanatory notes use a phrase that does not appear in the Bill. I quote:
<P>
Identifying groups of consumers in this way, however--
it is referring to the disabled or chronically sick, those of pensionable age, those on low incomes and those living in rural areas--
<P>
does not oblige the Authority to give these consumers preferential treatment.
Yet the wording of the clause is intended to give those consumers the impression that they will be given preferential treatment. The Minister said earlier that he is not able to define those categories, and that the Secretary of State will, or may, issue guidance on what is meant by individuals of pensionable age or individuals with low incomes.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Let me give the hon. Gentleman an example. Someone on a dialysis machine needs a constant and predictable supply of electricity. That is what I mean by preferential treatment. If the hon. Gentleman thinks that it should be left to the market and that it is tough luck if the dialysis machine victim does not get his electricity when he needs it, he should say so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> If the Minister is saying that someone on a dialysis machine should have preferential treatment, why do the explanatory notes say that nothing in the clause guarantees such treatment? The notes state that identifying groups of consumers--it does not go into sufficient detail to identify people on dialysis machines--in no way obliges the authority to give them preferential treatment.
<P>
I shall give the Minister another example. What is meant by a rural area, and how would a member of the new authority define it? In my constituency, several people are so remote from the main gas supply that they would never be able to get piped gas in a million years. The clause may raise their expectations so that they believe that they are able to pray in aid the fact that, because they are individuals living in rural areas, the Secretary of State and the authority must have particular regard to their interests. How could those expectations ever be satisfied?
<P>
If special subsidies are to be given to particular groups of consumers, who is to pay for them? The answer is other groups of consumers. In his evidence to the Trade and Industry Committee earlier this Session, the regulator said that he was by no means sure that the abolition of the standing charge would necessarily benefit the poorest consumers. Any action of that kind may have a beneficial effect on some consumers--who might be poor consumers--but an adverse effect on other poor consumers or consumers with low incomes.
<P>
Does all the verbiage in the clause amount to anything? It raises expectations, but it has caused enormous consternation in the industry. Concern has been expressed that it could be interpreted as inimical to the effective operation of the industry in a highly competitive environment. I hope that the Minister will provide practical examples of how it may work in practice. He said that even the issue of defining individuals of pensionable age would not necessarily be a matter for the authority. That remark caused confusion, because the Government recently announced a differentiation between pensioners in relation to the television licence fee. A cut-off point will be introduced at the age of 75, which implies that those aged over 75 are in a different category from those under 75. Will the Minister confirm or deny that there will be a differentiation in the treatment of pensioners depending on their age? That is not included in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that he will tell his constituents he is opposed to giving free television licences to people over the age of 75?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I have already told my constituents that I am in favour of abolishing the television licence completely. I hope that the Minister will vote in support of the Television Licence Fee (Abolition) Bill on its Second Reading on 7 April.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce rose--</B><P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not follow the route that he is being invited to take.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. Hood.
<P>
The Minister rightly pointed out, in relation to licences, that the focus is on elderly people. I am surprised that he did not read my hon. Friend's ten-minute Bill speech.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I am grateful for the support that my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset has lent to my Bill, and also that of my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Mr. Fraser).
<P>
We are concerned about not only pensioners aged over 75--I probably have a higher proportion of such pensioners in my constituency than almost any other hon. Member--but all pensioners. It is dangerous to compartmentalise one group, and assert that that group will be given benefits for which others will have to pay. New burdens on gas and electricity suppliers will be paid for by consumers in general. If the Minister expects some consumers to receive privileges and preferential treatment, which consumers will have to pay for those benefits? Would it not be better to use the mass of social security legislation to decide how to allocate benefits to the needy, instead of such an indirect method? We know that many people rely on heating oil to heat their homes, especially in rural areas. Would suppliers of heating oil be subject to a new regulation that required them to have particular regard to individuals living in rural areas, those on low incomes or of pensionable age, or those who were disabled or chronically sick? That would be as ludicrous a proposition as that in clause 8 in its current form.
<P>
To return to a point that I made on Second Reading, the Bill places tremendous emphasis on the burden on the authority to ensure that consumers' interests are met, but there is no reciprocity in terms of the Secretary of State's role. He has no equivalent duty to have regard to the interests of consumers in deciding energy policy. We know that the Director General of Gas and Electricity Markets described the Secretary of State's decision not to allow the construction of more gas-fired power stations as inimical to the interests of consumers. The Secretary of State has stated that he disagrees with the director general on that, but who will adjudicate on the issue? The Secretary of State expects to be able to have a control over the exercise of commercial judgment by those in the industry, but he is not prepared to allow his own judgment to be subjected to any outside authority. If it is clear that the Secretary of State is not acting in the interests of consumers, why should a consumer body not be able to give directions to the Secretary of State?
<P>
The clause and the equivalent clause 12 raise expectations. In the words of the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East, they give the impression that the consumer is put at the heart of activities. However, the probable result will be enormous bureaucracy, and an increase in costs for all consumers. One consumer will be set against another, and, in the end, the only people to benefit will be employees of the authorities and consumer councils.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> We have had an interesting debate on the clause. The Minister was perhaps lulled into a false sense of security by Opposition Members' attempts to improve the clause so that it would do the least harm possible. We wanted to elicit from him the purpose behind the clause. That led him to believe that Conservative Members thought that he had done a good job with the clause.
<P>
You will be aware, Mr. Hood, as will those avid readers of the Bill on the Labour Benches--they do not speak about the Bill, so they must be doing something--that clause 8 relates to gas, clause 12 to electricity, and clause 89 to telecommunications. The purpose of clause 8 is to amend section 4 of the Gas Act 1986. It is telling to consider it in the light of the phrase, ``Never mind the quality, feel the width''. Section 4 of the 1986 Act was also intended to deal with competitive issues, and runs to three quarters of a page. However, clause 8 runs to a page and a quarter, and, if one remembers that the Government have amended it, it probably runs to a page and a half. When comparing that with section 4 of the Gas Act 1986, it is important to appreciate that clauses 9, 10 and 11 also need to be taken into account. Those clauses run to three pages. What is the purpose of that? Surely, there must be massive changes. We will debate clauses 9, 10 and 11 later, and I not shall not test your patience, Mr. Hood, by trying to do so now.
<P>
What does clause 8 do that is significantly different from section 4? It is more wordy, which makes it less easy to understand the Government's objective. That is why we probed the matter earlier. The only difference is that the people to be taken into account in the supply of gas are individuals with low incomes and individuals residing in rural areas. Disabled people and pensioners were covered in the original Act introduced by that cruel Conservative Government, who worried about such people. There is no need to change existing legislation to look after those people. Why should we, in a Utilities Bill, do the Government's social bidding in terms of dealing with people on low incomes?
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
We understand that there is a real agenda about fuel poverty. We are not suggesting for a moment that the Government do not have a legitimate right to deal with fuel poverty, but not in section 4 of the old Gas Act 1986 and certainly not in the clause. This is social engineering. The Government are saying, ``Whether we shall give you special treatment depends on whether you can afford to pay your gas bill.'' Despite all our probing, the Government have not said how much they intend to charge other people for keeping gas bills low for those on low incomes.
<P>
If the Government believe, as they clearly do, that people on low incomes should be assured of nice warm homes and as good a life style as everybody who can afford to pay their gas bills, that is a worthy aspiration. The Government should set it out and the Chancellor should say in his Budget how he will deal with it. They should not include it in a Bill that effectively places a self-tax on other consumers or in another way and expect the Committee to allow it to go through on the nod.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. White:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman saying that companies such as Scottish Power that are dealing with this issue are wrong to do so?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising an important point, which I had not yet reached, and I shall address it. People always think that, for example, letting pensioners travel for half price may be a cost to the bus company, but if the pensiners would not use the bus because it is too expensive, it is not a cost. A company can often, for commercial reasons, decide to give certain people a special deal and justify it on a cost basis, saying, ``This individual would not do this, that or the other unless we gave them a special deal. The special deal is good for us as a company, for our shareholders and for our other customers.'' That is a valid decision for the company to make. I gather that several companies are doing just that, and they are to be commended for taking that commercial decision.
<P>
What we are talking about here is what a Minister might be able to do for social reasons, to help people with low incomes. The Government have not yet said what they will do. They may be minor things about which we could say, ``That seems fair. We would all be willing to chip in a few pounds a year to help.'' That was part and parcel of the previous Government's gas regime.
<P>
The second new item was suggested by my hon. Friend the Minister for Christchurch (Mr. Chope). We had the Dorset representation; whether it was the mafia I am not sure. He said that we should be talking about rural areas. Of course that is of great importance to Members of Parliament who deal with rural areas. One reason why we will win the next general election is the rural policies that we will introduce. That does not mean that a Government measure should be hidden away in clause 8 of a Bill, among the three pages that will take over from the three quarters of a page, to conceal what might be happening in the rural areas.
<P>
It is important, particularly when we are dealing with gas, to place the principle in the Bill. One problem with gas is that it is expensive to get it to every part of a community--for instance, to a farm building in the middle of nowhere, four or five miles from the nearest road, let alone the nearest gas main. It may be that an economic case cannot be made for putting gas into every rural home. The Government should tell us whether they want a universal service. There are other ways of providing gas--for example, those who want to use gas in rural areas can use bottled gas, but that is not covered in the Bill. I have already referred to inequalities which may fall foul of other Acts, including the Human Rights Act 1998. Coal, oil, solar power and wind energy may be more viable in rural areas and those important matters should not be hidden away in the clause. Until we know what money is involved, the Committee and those outside who follow our proceedings will want to know what the Government are up to.
<P>
I was reading the Postal Services Bill yesterday in my room and noticed how the Government had used almost the same words in that Bill. I shall not discuss that, but the Government have an agenda and I suspect that, before long, there will be a bread Bill with special criteria for those in rural areas and on low incomes to have bread supplied, as well as salt and meat because they are the stuff of life. I could go on and on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Fraser </B>(Mid-Dorset and North Poole): To illustrate my hon. Friend's point, in many villages in my constituency the gas board will install appliances but tell residents that it is impractical to connect them. People do not know what to do; they are left between one option and another, but they do not benefit at all in the way suggested by the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Yes, indeed.
<P>
It is valid for a democratic Government to put their policies forward to the hon. Gentleman's constituents and mine--they need find only 38 or 39 in my constituency and offer a free gas line. They should do that through the proper mechanisms, and not hide it away. The Minister may think that, if this proposal comes from the gas authority, he will not receive the credit. If he wants to give away free gas lines to everyone in my rural constituency, he should take the credit, but also the blame.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman knows, having been a parliamentary private secretary, that Under-Secretaries do not receive credit for anything.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The Minister may have the wrong parliamentary private secretary. I was parliamentary private secretary to my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) and to my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague), who is leader of the Conservative party and our next Prime Minister. The Minister should ensure that his parliamentary private secretary is properly briefed to make sure that he receives the appropriate credit.
<P>
The Minister forced me to digress and I do not want to detain the Committee. The Minister must make a stirring speech--the speech of his life--on clause 8 because I can see that his hon. Friends behind him are taking note of the extra verbiage and why so many more trees will be chopped down to print the Bill, let alone anything else. They will want to know why the Minister believes that clause 8 should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> First, I declare an interest. I act as a parliamentary private secretary, and I give full credit to my boss, who leads for the Opposition in the House of Lords, for all the good work that he is doing, so I am surprised that the Minister does not receive the credit from a parliamentary private secretary that he so justly deserves.
<P>
It is a great pity that the hon. Member for Lewes and his colleague were not here this morning when we discussed many of the issues that they wanted to raise. That is a crying shame, and I hope that it is not an indictment of the Liberal Democrats' future treatment of the Committee. However, the hon. Gentleman made some interesting points about the Bill's environmental objectives and I support him in asking the Minister what the Government's environmental objectives are.
<P>
We need to deal with three aspects of the environment. First, there is the social environment, in which an organisation, a company or a part of Government operates. Secondly, there is the economic environment. Thirdly, we must deal with the issue of the political environment, which has not been mentioned, but is worth noting. During the past year or two, I have served on several Committees in which environmental issues have arisen, and it is the political aspect of the environment, which is never dealt with in a Bill, that ends up rearing its ugly head and playing more of a part than anybody would ever give it credit for. When the Minister sums up, he should deal with all three aspects of the environment, not just the two mentioned in this part of the Bill.
<P>
The issues of performance, price and competition have been addressed, primarily by the previous Government, in much of the work that they did to solve some of the problems that we are talking about--problems that I mentioned when I asked the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Mrs Gilroy) for her opinion on the price reductions since privatisation.
<P>
The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East (Mr. White) spoke about putting the consumer first. We all aspire to that, but how can it be achieved? We need to identify groups of customers. My hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch spoke about giving customers a false sense of security by telling them that we will look after them. I agree that many constituents cannot receive a supply of gas. I not only represent my Dorset constituency, but live there, and I cannot receive a supply of gas; we have to go elsewhere for our service. I admit that I live in the countryside, but we are not so far away from a supply. As I said to my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset, many people offer such services but cannot deliver them. How will the Government overcome those problems? Heating oil is an alternative, and we also need to consider gas in cylinders. However, as we are considering how we can all be socially, environmentally and politically included in this great exercise, I challenge the Minister to ensure that that is the case. There is no evidence of that in what has been said so far.
<P>
The poorest consumers in society had already been identified by the previous Government, who looked carefully at the issue. When we privatised the gas industry, the average bill was cut by about one third, which benefited not only one category or another that one side or the other had plucked from the air, but everybody who uses the gas industry. The Government have failed to recognise that in the Bill. It must not be forgotten that the Labour party--now the Government--opposed that privatisation, although one Labour Member did at least agree earlier that competition benefits the consumer overall.
<P>
<B>Mrs Linda Gilroy </B>(Plymouth, Sutton): I remind the hon. Gentleman that domestic gas prices rose by 30 per cent. above the rate of inflation in real terms in the three years before privatisation. I also remind him that the problems of at least 4.3 million households were not resolved by the liberalisation measure introduced in 1995 by the Conservative government.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> I thank the hon. Lady. Her comments this morning were frank, and I note what she says now. I will take her back to what I said about social inclusion and the people who will benefit and those who will not. I said that car drivers are suffering most from fuel poverty, but the Minister threw that point aside, and Labour Members guffawed.
<P>
It is convenient to say that the Government are looking after the consumer, but many people in rural constituencies are worse off than before because of taxation on the fuel that they must put in their cars. The Government's argument is spurious, and their presentation of the issue is hypocritical. My constituents cannot obtain gas, and they are penalised for using other fuels in their homes. The Government's policy is not going to be of benefit.

<P>

<B>Mr. Chope:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the problem affects not only cars, but rural buses? To organise a school bus, people must pay penal rates of tax on diesel.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> I agree entirely. The clause is sorely lacking in that regard. All bureaucracy causes extra cost to the consumer. The more bureaucracy, the more the consumer ends up paying. The Minister will agree with that, and I defy him to say otherwise.
<P>
Why is it no longer the regulator's priority to ensure that the gas supply can satisfy all reasonable demands for gas delivery in Britain? The Minister should bear in mind my comments about people who are socially excluded, on whom the Government are concentrating at present. It may be a clich, but many people are saying, ``What is this? The Government are saying one thing, but clearly doing another.''
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> This has been the Committee's longest debate, and I am grateful for the contributions from all hon. Members. It is important, as the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said, to have proper scrutiny of Bills. However, the hon. Member for South Dorset is the only Conservative Member who has grasped the fact that the clause relates solely to the gas regulator's general duties. I shall stick to speaking about the clause in the context of gas.
<P>
I shall attempt to answer the question raised by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. He was in a bit of a spin about the phrase ``wherever possible'' and its omission. When something is said not to be possible, it means that it is not appropriate. Legal language is not used in Green or White Papers. The clause, however, is an example of the taut, concise drafting of the Bill.
<P>
General duties lie at the heart of the regulatory process. They set the framework in which regulators--both the regulatory authorities and the Secretary of State--exercise their functions under the utilities Acts. Whenever regulators exercise a power or perform a duty, they must do so in the manner that they think is most consistent with the duties in the framework.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I have just digested the Minister's previous comment. Does he think that the phrase ``wherever appropriate'' means wherever possible or appropriate?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I am sorry, but I cannot grasp that point. I emphasise that something that is not possible is not appropriate. I hope that that answers his question, because that is what I understand by the phrase.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb rose--</B><P>

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I will not give way, because I want to make some progress.
<P>
The duties form a hierarchy, which is designed to assist regulators in resolving potentially conflicting regulatory objectives. Thus, there are primary duties and secondary duties. In a conflict between a primary duty and a secondary duty, the primary duty will take precedence.
<P>
Under the utilities legislation put in place by the previous Government, the regulators' duty to protect consumers is secondary, and therefore subordinate to all the regulators' primary duties. It is notable that one such primary duty is the requirement for regulators to ensure that companies can finance their licensed activities. It follows that, should a conflict arise, that duty takes precedence over the regulators' duty to consumers. We are concerned that, under that arrangement, the interests of consumers have been subordinated to those of shareholders. In particular, regulators may have thought it necessary to err on the side of caution in setting price controls; to the extent that they have done so, consumers have paid for shareholders' gain. It is not acceptable for such a state of affairs to continue, which is why we are putting consumers first and placing them at the heart of the regulators' general duties. For the first time, we are giving regulators a principal objective--to protect consumers' interests.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> Can the Minister give us a specific example of such a problem?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> It does happen. The clause will ensure that, for everyone buying, selling or using gas, the bias is in favour of consumers--as it should always have been--not the companies.
<P>
The best companies are those that can win and keep consumers. The previous Government were constantly featherbedding and protecting companies that should have been exposed at all times to the harshest possible climate of competition. That is how the best companies emerge--not by featherbedding them, as my Department did for many years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce rose--</B><P>

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I want to make a little more progress. There will be plenty of time for the hon. Gentleman to speak.
<P>
The regulators' sole primary duty will be to carry out their functions in the manner best calculated to further the principal objective. As I have said, we do not expect that there will be a dramatic upheaval--a revolution, indeed--in utility regulation, and there is no point in Opposition Members pretending otherwise. The regulatory and economic environment in which utility companies operate will not be turned upside down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I have some difficulty with the Minister's statement that the new clause is very different from the old clause. He is raising false expectations.
<P>
The Minister said specifically that the DTI had not been sufficiently harsh on the gas industry. There may be evidence for that from the early years of gas privatisation, but not today. One need only compare gas share prices with what they were a year or two ago.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes my point for me. Regulation has evolved substantially, and gas prices have dropped as a result; they will drop further, with increased competition. I support that fully and have no argument with the hon. Gentleman about it. By the way, I do not believe that that is the Government's role to be harsh on companies; rather, their role is to help create an environment in which there is fair competition, and the barriers to other firms that wish to enter the market and take part in the gas supply business are as low as possible.
<P>
I will explain our treatment of the primary duties under existing legislation by reference to our new consumer-orientated perspective. Apart from the duty in respect of competition, which was debated this morning, the Director General of Gas Supply has two primary duties. The first is to ensure that, as far as is economic, all reasonable demand for gas is met; I shall reer to that as the ``demand duty''. The hon. Members from Dorset--the ``Dorset Three''--asked whether the duty to have regard to the interests of rural consumers meant that the regulator was obliged to ensure that those who cannot now receive a supply of gas are able to do so. The answer is no--not if it would be uneconomic. The hon. Member for South Dorset made that point: it would be impossible to take a gas pipeline perhaps 20 miles to one or two houses--or even to a village, sometimes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> My driveway is not that long.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I do not suppose that it is. The primary duty defined in proposed new section 4AA(2) includes a requirement for the authority to have regard to
<P>
the need to secure that ... all reasonable demands in Great Britain for gas conveyed through pipes are met
so far as it is economical to meet them. In performing that primary duty, the authority must have regard to the interests of those living in rural areas. The two provisions have to be read together.
<P>
The second duty, to which I shall refer as the finance duty, is concerned with securing that utility companies can finance their licensed activities. Under the existing legislation, both the demand duty and the finance duty have to stand alone. In the Bill, those duties are positioned where they more naturally belong--as aspects of the primary consumer duty. That positioning informs what we mean by ``the interests of consumers''--the phrase used for the principal objective. The phrase incorporates not only the narrow consumer interest in a high-quality service at low cost, of which I am sure that we are all in favour, but the broader requirements of a sustainable industry, of which I know that the hon. Member for Lewes, who missed the debate on the environment this morning, is in favour, as we are. The phrase reflects the realities of the consumer's position.
<P>
Consumers have an interest in ensuring that all reasonable demands for gas are met. Ensuring that they receive a gas supply is gas consumers' most fundamental interest, which is why the demand duty is restated as an aspect of the primary consumer duty. As I noted this morning, it is clear that consumers have an interest in ensuring that utility companies operate in a viable market with a long-term outlook. That is why the regulator is charged with protecting the interests of future as well as existing consumers, and why the finance duty has also been incorporated as an aspect of the interests of consumers. The need to ensure that utility companies can finance their activities should be seen as essential to those interests.
<P>
Under the legislation passed by the Conservative Government, the regulators' general duties were biased in favour of utility companies and their shareholders. The general duties set out in the Bill remove that bias and substitute the broad inclusive concept of consumer interests. I take no lessons from the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton when it comes to promoting competition. For 18 years, the Conservative party opposed the principle of the Competition Act 1998, and played footsie with companies that were price-fixing, forming cartels and generally up to no good. The Government have given regulators, for the first time, precisely what they wanted--the teeth to start biting those characters. Believe me, we will ensure that customers are not ripped off as they were for two decades by the Conservative Government.
<P>
<B>Mrs Gilroy:</B> The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole said that poor consumers benefited as much as other consumers. Although I am sure that the Minister is not taken in by that, I draw his attention to the November 1999 issue of Energy Action, which is published by National Energy Action. It carries a report on poor electricity consumers under the title ``Poor consumers switched off by competition''. I crave his indulgence for a second while I read from that report. It states:
<P>
Disadvantaged consumers are worse informed about electricity competition and less likely to have switched supplier. This is particularly true of low-income groups, those without a bank account and prepayment meter users. Only 2 per cent. or fewer of these groups have switched to date, compared to the national average of 5 per cent.
Does that not underscore the need for the provisions in subsection (3) of the proposed new section?

<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> My hon. Friend, who has great experience in this field, makes an important point. The new general duties set out in the clause are intended to result in a fair deal for consumers. They ensure the right balance between the interests of consumers and those of shareholders, and correct the bias inherent in existing arrangements. I commend the clause to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> I want to make a couple of points.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fraser:</B> I want to make a couple of points. It is clear that the overall importance of the Government's porposals is the new priority role for regulators to protect the consumer. The Bill reorders the priorities of the regulator, but the Gas Act 1986 made the need to secure the gas supply top priority. The interests of the consumer were protected, but subject to that priority. Will the Minister comment on the Department of Trade and Industry's 1999 energy report which said:
<P>
The continuation of energy supply is important because a modern society is crucially dependent on the availability of energy in sufficient quantities
That makes it clear that the Government recognise the importance of a continuation of supply over consumer considerations.
6 pm
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I want to follow my hon. Friend and press the Minister on why a group of energy consumers is being singled out. If there is a regime to protect poor or rural consumers who use heating oil, bottled gas and solid fuel, why does not the general law of competition and consumer protection also protect consumers of gas and electricity?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Government's intention was categorically stated by the Minister when he said that the Bill will not lead to a revolution in the regulatory environment. But if it does not, all the Minister's anger on behalf of the consumer is purely synthetic. The Bill cannot not change the direction of regulation and transform different consumer interests. They cannot have it both ways. Either it is revolutionary or it is not.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The hon. Gentleman clearly has difficulty getting his head around the idea that it is possible to build a balance in regulation that does something for consumers while creating regulatory consistency and predictability for companies. That is the Bill's aim.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> There is no predictability in the Bill. Indeed, it introduces regulatory unpredictability. The consensus in the industry is that it increases regulatory risk, which will increase the cost of capital to the utilities. Given that the utility industries are capital intensive, that will deliver a large hit to the profit and loss accounts of those companies, which will be passed on to the consumer because, in the western world's free capital market, there is nowhere else for it to go. That is a fact of life. We are worried that consumers will get a bad deal because they will either pay higher prices or pay prices that are not as low as they would otherwise have been. The windfall tax has not had an ostensible effect. Although the regime is reducing prices, the windfall tax has meant that consumers have not received as low a bill as they might otherwise have received.
<P>
We do not object to consumer councils. The consumer has always been part of the regulatory regime. The chronically sick and disabled, people of pensionable age and those who live in rural areas were a major feature of the previous regulatory regime. It was always thus. In establishing a regulator to mimic competition, it was necessary to ensure that consumers were not exploited by the fact that they were dealing with a monopoly, which could exist for various reasons--it could be legally protected, a product of natural circumstances or in a market that had no other competitors. The role of the regulator was to ensure that the monopolist did not exploit his position. He would protect the consumer and, in particular, he would have to protect the interests of vulnerable consumers--pensioners, the chronically sick and disabled, and those who live in rural areas. What is different is that prime duties of promoting competition and ensuring financial viability and security of supply will be demoted. The basis of regulation will have been changed from the promotion of competition to new social regulatory machinery. Or will they?
<P>
The Minister's statement that it will not lead to a revolution in the regulatory environment is seminal, because I believe that it was the right answer. It has been pointed out that the wording is vague and that it could be subject to all sorts of meanings. It would be revolutionary if we were supposed to take its literal meaning, which is what we have suggested. The Minister is expressing the intention of Parliament, because his party represents the majority opinion in the House. If it is Parliament's intention that it should not lead to a revolution in the regulatory environment, many people will give a sigh of relief; but that will mean that the Minister's promises about what the Bill will achieve will not lead to a revolution, because there will be no change.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that it would be better if it was made clear in the Bill? Will my hon. Friend press the Minister to table amendments on Report that would reduce the scope of the clause to reflect what he said about its limitations?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. He is right that it would be helpful. The Minister talks about the Bill increasing clarity and certainty in regulation, yet the Committee is unclear about the certainty of a central clause. If the Bill survives to Report and Third Reading, it would help if the Minister were to table amendments to make it absolutely clear that clause 8 is not meant to be as far-reaching as it would appear.
<P>
I should like one further clarification, which would be usefully made under Pepper v. Hart. The Minister said that the phrase ``wherever possible or appropriate'' is taut and concise. If he is saying that Parliament intends it to mean the same as the phrase
<P>
wherever appropriate by promoting effective competition
it would be extremely helpful to have it on the record. My understanding is that those two phrases have completely different meanings.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I shall try to clarify it again. I can confirm that the words ``wherever appropriate'' used in clause 8 have the same effect as the words ``wherever possible and appropriate'' that were used in the Green Paper. Something is not possible that cannot be appropriate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful for that, because it means that the regulator will have to make his prime concern the promotion of competition. That has achieved huge falls in prices to the consumer--a 30 per cent. fall in the cost of electricity and gas, and a 50 per cent. fall in real terms for telephone charges.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bill Tynan </B>(Hamilton, South): I have listened carefully to what the Opposition have said. Does the hon. Gentleman accept that fuel poverty exists, that the problem must be addressed and that the Government intend to do so through the Bill? Does he also accept that the Conservative party will not succeed in forming the next Government because of the propositions made by Opposition Members?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I do not accept that. We do not challenge the Government's intention to try to alleviate fuel poverty.
<P>
<B>Mrs Gilroy:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I shall give way when I have answered the hon. Member for Hamilton, South (Mr. Tynan). The Government may mean the Bill to deliver on its provisions, but as it stands it will not relieve fuel poverty because it will lead to higher prices. Competition in the utilities has resulted in a huge decrease in the price of electricity. Since privatisation of the energy sector, the proportion of households with central heating has increased from just over 60 per cent. to almost 90 per cent. Coupled with the fall in fuel prices, that must be the best way to alleviate fuel poverty.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyan rose--</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I will give way in a moment.
<P>
I strongly believe that continuing along that path will deliver to poor people a further decrease in the price of fuel and will enable a higher proportion of people to have central heating in their homes. Despite the fact that the Minister says that the Bill does not change the direction of regulation, the Opposition believe that it does, and if it does, it will mean that fuel prices will not be as low as they should be. That puts in jeopardy all the achievements that have been made so far in the years since privatisation and which could have been progressed had we continued along the same route. I do not question the fact that Government Members genuinely believe that the Bill provides the solution to fuel poverty--
<P>
<B>Mrs Gilroy:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I will give way in a moment.
<P>
I believe that increasing bureaucracy, putting 450 people in a luxury office in Millbank, giving them more powers, issuing more forms, sending out more questionnaires, imposing more burdens on companies, fining unlimited fines, increasing the regulatory risks and uncertainties and increasing the cost of capital to the utilities will restrict competition, restrict new entrants to the market and dampen the innovativeness of utility companies to produce new schemes, such as the PowerGen_Age Concern scheme for the elderly. As a result, the most disadvantaged people in this country will not get as good a deal as they would have had if the same regulatory regime had continued.
<P>
<B>Mrs Gilroy:</B> I am pleased to hear that the hon. Gentleman shares the commitment, which I know is cross-party, to make significant moves towards tackling the problem that at least 4.3 million households spend more than 10 per cent. of their income to keep warm. Will he say how he thinks that problem should be tackled? I note that in Utility Week of 18 February the hon. Gentleman said:
<P>
If the government wants to implement a social objective it should do so itself through the Department of Social Security or whatever and the funding should come from the Treasury and the taxpayer.
<P>
A week on Friday, we shall debate the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Bill. I suggest that the price tag for introducing that measure will be 8 billion to 10 billion. Will the hon. Gentleman commit his party to paying for that through the tax system?

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I must remind hon. Members that they should not make speeches in their interventions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> No. I do not agree to the hon. Lady's suggestion. The problem with high taxation--I thought that the Government accepted this point--and high public spending is that it damages the economy, increases unemployment and, therefore, damages the most vulnerable people in society. Any large spending programme will do that. The best way to reduce poverty is to do what the Secretary of State for Social Security suggests; increase employment and create a dynamic entrepreneurial economy. Coupled with that, the best way to alleviate fuel poverty is to bring down the price of fuel, which has been happening since privatisation. I do not believe that the price of fuel would have decreased if the industries had not been privatised. The industries have slashed costs and reduced the number of people employed.
<P>
<B>Mrs Gilroy rose--</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I shall give way to the hon. Member for Hamilton, South before I give way to the hon. Lady.
<P>
The industries have slashed the number of people that they employ, which sounds harsh but, in most cases, those people have found jobs as a result of the low levels of unemployment since 1992. If an industry has reduced its staff by two thirds and still produces the same output, that must benefit the whole of UK plc. That has been translated into lower prices because of the brillian RPI minus X formula developed by Professor Stephen Littlechild. That is why we have seen a 30 per cent. real-terms reduction in the price of gas and electricity and a 50 per cent. reduction in the price of telephone use. If the same regulatory regime had continued to apply, those falls would also have continued. I am not clear whether the Bill will lead to a change in direction, whether it is pure wording which is intended to court the consumer lobby or whether it creates a consumer activist body at all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tynan:</B> I did not doubt the hon. Gentleman's sincerity when he expressed his belief that the best way to proceed is in a different fashion from that proposed in the Bill. However, his approach would not deliver what is required for people who are suffering fuel poverty. That is why the Government are attempting to target people suffering from fuel poverty and to take proper action. Although I recognise what the hon. Gentleman said, I believe that it is important that we do it on the proposed basis.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The problem with the approach of the hon. Gentleman and of Labour Members is that it makes companies cautious about providing innovative products, as they will have to keep looking behind their shoulder to see whether the regulatory will impose a penalty or fine. They will always have to clear an innovative product with the regulator in advance, for fear of being hit with a limitless fine that could wipe them out. That is the view of the industry, which believes that the Bill will dampen down the innovative nature of the utility sector, which is producing some good products for disadvantaged people. That is why PowerGen produced the Age Concern product, and I believe that many more such innovative products would be designed to help the poorest people in society.
<P>
<B>Mrs Gilroy:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I shall do so in a moment. As I said, I might be wrong, and those products might not emerge in the marketplace as competition increases. However, I genuinely believe that they will, and massive experience in other industries supports that view. If they do not, the Department of Social Security should step in. If its funding for disadvantaged people is not sufficient to enable them to pay their fuel bills, there is something wrong with the calculation of their benefits. That is the most appropriate delivery mechanism, and it is better than imposing on the utilities extra burdens, regulatory concern and increases in the regulatory risk, which would pass on higher cost to the consumer. If such measures did not pass on that cost, we would all be in favour of them. However, there is genuine worry that that will happen if the Minister's belief that the Bill will not cause a revolution in the regulatory environment is wrong.
<P>
<B>Mrs Gilroy:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman reflect on what he has said? At least 4.3 million households remain in fuel poverty and the size of the challenge is such that its solution must come from all sorts of different directions. Labour Members do not claim that the provisions contained in the clause and the Bill solve fuel poverty on their own. However, they have an extremely important contribution to make, along with some of the things mentioned by the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I return to the same point. I too, would like the 4.3 million figure to reduce significantly. I believe that the best way of achieving such a decrease is to promote competition in the utility and energy sectors, and that is what motivates me. I am not motivated by a desire to boost the utility companies' profits. I do not have shares in the energy companies and neither I nor many of my hon. Friends would benefit from our proposals. We are so passionately in favour of competition in these sectors because it works and has delivered lower prices, and I want to ensure that it continues.
<P>
The trouble with debates such as this is that we can never prove which of us is right. When the Bill is enacted, the price of fuel might fall slightly less deeply than it did previously, but so many external factors have an influence that we cannot necessarily prove the case. That is a pity, because I genuinely believe that free competition is the best route and that a controlled experiment, if one could be set up, would show that the Conservative approach is the most effective in delivering the objectives of the hon. Member of Plymouth, Sutton.
<P>
<B>Mrs Gilroy:</B> I do not think that there is that much disagreement between the hon. Gentleman and me. I refer him to this morning's debate, in which I suggested that the thrust of clauses 7 and 88, which is underpinned by the clause before us, is to create a market and competition in warmth. The environmental and social objectives are needed for that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The hon. Lady may be right, but I suspect that she is not. I think that the companies that would have provided very good products for the poorest people in society will not do so, because of fear of the regulatory impact. The regulatory paraphernalia that the Government are devising will so hamper and stifle competition, innovation and new entrants to the market that there will not be the desperation for customers on all economic levels that there would otherwise have been. That will be the tragic consequence if the Bill does what we are told it will do.
<P>
One of my concerns is the price of using pre-payment meters. It is objectionable to have to pay 9 or 27 a year more for that facility. In one area an electricity price discount is being given for those who use pre-payment meters. Why do all suppliers not do that? The pre-payment meters hark back to an era when the utility companies were state-controlled and when, as a student, I had to pay a deposit of 100 to be connected to the electricity supply. That is no longer the case. Companies are more desperate now for student customers. If we could get competition to function properly in the relevant sectors, the utility companies would be desperate for the customers who now use pre-payment meters. They would not charge ridiculous fees. The Bill puts that prospect in jeopardy.
<P>
There is a philosophical difference between the two sides in this debate, and that is why I want to vote on the motion.

<P>
Gas and Electricity Markets Authority (in this Act referred to as ``the Authority'').
<P>
This is a technical amendment and I am sure that the Committee will be relieved to hear that I shall be brief. The Gas and Electricity Markets Authority is to be established under clause 1 of the Bill, but GEMA's general duties and the majority of its functions are to be found in the Gas Act 1986 and the Electricity Act 1989, as each will be amended by the Bill. The amendment is intended to clarify that the first reference to the authority in the amended Electricty Act is a refeence to the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority, as opposed to some other authority. The first reference to the authority in the amended Gas Act has been similarly clarified.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 187, in page 7, line 41, leave out ``the supply of electricity'' and insert
<P>
electricity conveyed by distribution systems.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Governments amendments Nos. 189 and 195 to 197.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The amendments relate to a phrase used throughout the Bill to identify electricity consumers. That phrase is:
<P>
consumers in relation to the supply of electricity.
It appears first in clause 8 in relation to a provision that is subject to amendment No. 203, which is why the amendments are being considered together.
<P>
The phrase was intended simply to identify a group of persons--consumers of electricity. The problem is that the phrase ``in relation to the supply of electricity'' can be misinterpreted as focusing on electricity consumers' particular interests in supply. If so interpreted, it would draw attention away from all the other electricity-related activities in which consumers might have interests, such as the generation, transmission, distribution and use of electricity. That is not the Government's intention.
<P>
The amendment tabled in the name of my right hon. Friend, the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe, will replace the phrase with the wording based on the equivalent definition for gas consumers found in clause 8 and elsewhere. The new wording is neutral on what electricity users' interests might be, and should be a welcome clarification of our policy intentions.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> I am sure that the Minister and his officials have carefully considered the original words and said to themselves that they could be misinterpreted. ``Supply of electricity'' has a folk meaning about something that comes in a wire into one's home. The phrase ``Electricity conveyed by distribution systems'' is more confusing than the original one.
<P>
I do not know whether we should show our mobile phones again. Electricity is conveyed in mine by a distribution system--the battery inside it. The Minister is attempting to create clarity and certainty, but is actually introducing a term of art that no one understands. The new wording makes no sense. Any physicist will tell the Minister that electricity is not conveyed by distribution systems. Rather, electrons are agitated so that a component will work at the other end.
<P>
The phrase ``supply of electricity'' is a well-understood term of art, but the Minister has come with an extraordinary phrase that we do not understand. He must go further and define ``electricity conveyed by distribution systems.''
The definition is probably ``the supply of electricity''. We are going round in circles. I wonder whether the Minister has taken good advice on the matter; it seems strange advice to me.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 313, in page 8, line 9, at end insert--
<P>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) the need to have a variety of methods of generating electricity to prevent the suppliers of a particular type of fuel gaining an unfair market position.</font></ul>
<P>
We have come to a serious issue within clause 12; it is specific to electricity. I should explain why it is specific to electricity and not to any of the other issues. The clause relates to the diversity of supply. I direct colleagues' attention to page 8. The Secretary of State and the Authority are asked, following the principal objective, to have regard to
<P>
the need to secure that all reasonable demands for electricity are met.
That is fair enough--we all want to ensure that everyone gets their electricity. In addition, they should have regard to
<P>
the need to secure that licence holders are able to finance the activities which are the subject of obligations imposed by or under this Part.
That is also a good point. I should again declare my interest--I have a few shares in electricity companies. I am glad that the Government are concerned that the companies should not go bust, and that shareholders should not lose their funds.
<P>
My amendment is not designed to benefit shareholders. It relates to the diversity of supply. I have suggested that a third requirement should be placed on the authority and the Secretary of State:
<P>
to have a variety of methods of generating electricity to prevent the suppliers of a particular type of fuel gaining an unfair market position.
Those of us who are old enough, and who have been watching politics for long enough, will recall that this country has been held to ransom by two groups of fuel suppliers on several occasions.
<P>
We have had coal miners who wanted to ensure that their jobs were secure, and who clearly had a right to defend their industries. We have had serious coal strikes, and Governments fell because the coal industry decided to cut off electricity. In the second crisis in fuel supply, the oil sheiks decided that, by reducing the amount of oil coming through under the OPEC agreement, they could push up the price and cut off our supplies.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there was a third category--the nuclear industry, which has been heavily over-subsidised throughout its history? We were told that its electricity would be too cheap to meter, but now it turns out to be a multi-million pound fiasco.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The hon. Gentleman's view of the nuclear industry differs from mine. However, I was moving on to the justification given by Ministers from the hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair), when he was in a similar position to the Minister in ensuring that there was a nuclear industry. That was all about diversity of supply. The argument is simple: if, at any time, one were to ask how electricity should be generated, there is probably one route that is the cheapest.
<P>
During my period in the House, I have been told that burning gas to generate electricity was massively expensive and could be justified only for short-term surges of electricity and we could not afford gas. I have not been here that long--13 years. Half way through that period, gas stations were suddenly being built, because the market said that that was the cheapest way of producing electricity.
<P>
This is very much a market interference provision. Its purpose is to tempt the Minister into deciding whether he should include a provision to allow the authority and the Secretary of State to take account of these matters. Under the Bill at present, they are not able to do that.
<P>
There are a number of forms of electricity. The hon. Member for Lewes referred to the nuclear industry. I believe that nuclear will only ever become a sensible and competitive fuel if it is given the market forces that other industries are given. Since privatisation of the nuclear industry, the proportion of energy generated from that fuel and its efficiency have increased. I am a great supporter of having some market mechanisms.
<P>
There could easily be a sudden glut of one product on the market, and the industry might say, ``Right, to hell with this. We will close all the nuclear stations and gas-powered stations and we will burn only coal.'' That would be environmentally damaging. These issues occur in cycles. Gas is gas, water is water, and telecommunications are telecommunications, but electricity could be produced from gas, coal, oil, nuclear materials or refuse or by burning or using renewables or solar energy. It is no good people saying, ``If you do not have any electricity arriving at your house, you can use coal.'' It is difficult to find a coal-powered computer or microwave. Electricity is required for a large number of purposes--indeed, it was seen as the universal fuel, even though it is expensive for some uses and one might sometimes want to use other fuels. However, today it is seen almost as a human right, and it is believed that everybody must have it.
<P>
My amendment would not mean insistence on diversity of supply, but it would allow the Minister and the authority to have regard to it. I may be a bit old Labour in tabling the amendment, and I am certainly very old Conservative, as the Conservatives decided to keep diversity of supply for various reasons, mostly related to coal miners and what they might be able to do to the country. My right hon. Friend the Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Sir E. Heath) learned to his cost that one needed full diversity of supply. However, I hope that the Minister will accept that such measures should be included in the Bill, as they deal with matters in which the regulators should be involved. The clause is probably the only place where such proposals can be properly integrated into the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> The hon. Member for South Dorset is right to push the Minister on that point and to establish the Government's thoughts on energy supply. It has been the policy of successive Governments to maintain diversity of supply for security purposes, to help indigenous industry, to tackle policial problems such as those referred to by the hon. Gentleman and problems arising with a particular source of fuel. That is why it is right to maintain diversity, but it is also right to ensure that energy policy is clear on where electricity will come from. If energy policy does not have that clarity, the Government will have abdicated their environmental and social policy to market forces. That is why I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman tabled the amendment, for which I have considerable sympathy but which seems contrary to his natural free-market tendencies.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Dorset used the phrase ``cheapest route''. It is important to distinguish between capital and revenue costs. The nuclear industry is currently meeting a large proportion of our energy needs because of huge capital investment at the beginning of the nuclear programme and huge cost at the end, during shutdown and decommissioning. It makes sense financially to run the stations on and on; indeed, the Magnox power stations and others are now running well beyond the lifespan intended for them when they were built--in many ways, too far beyond.
<P>
It is also not necessarily correct to consider the cheapest route. There is a question mark over how a sensible energy policy should dispose of fossil fuels. In the rather cavalier way in which we run our world, they might be disposed of over a period of 50, 60, 70 or 80 years. However, they have taken billions of years to build up, and it is not clear what alternatives will be available when the glut--if it is a glut--is exhausted. It is therefore sensible for the Government to have a clear view on what the energy mix should be. Will the Minister confirm that they still have a view on that?
<P>
Furthermore, will the Minister confirm that the energy mix is based on the need to ensure minimal impact on the environment--clauses on renewables will be considered later, although I am not sure that their definition of the term is correct--and, for security and other reasons, that it reflects the need to ensure diversity of supply? First, will he set out his attachment to an energy mix and, secondly, will he say what that mix is? How does he anticipate the nuclear element being replaced? It will be winding down if the Government are not building more nuclear power stations. Will it be replaced by energy efficiency or conservation, expansion of renewables or more use of fossil fuels? The Government's thoughts on that affect the Bill, which is why the amendment is important.

<P>

<B>Mr. Chope:</B> On reflection, my point is relevant to the clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> You and I, Mr. Hood, come from an industry that has been promised many things by many Governments. One prediction was we would be burning 300 million tonnes of coal at the turn of the century. We are lucky if 30 million tonnes are burned this year. It is sad.
<P>
Predicting energy demand and energy mix has been a hazardous business as long as I have been interested in the subject, which is most of my adult life. Lord Robens told me, when he was chairman of Vickers on the 40th floor of Millbank, that when he tried to predict what would happen to energy in this country, he could not have got it more wrong than the woman who cleaned his office. That was a strong admission from someone who was paid a huge salary to manage part of the energy industry. I make no claim for the Government's powers to prophesise what might happen to energy demand and the mix of energies. Although I believe that we should have a wide mix of generating sources, it should not be a duty of the regulator.
<P>
The Government recognise the importance of the two issues that the amendment touches on in relation to electricity generation--diversity and competition. We have dealt at length with competition. The Government have adopted the right approach to both issues. The amendment would undermine the Bill's effect to the detriment of competition and diversity.
<P>
The amendment would prevent the suppliers of a particular type of fuel from gaining an unfair market position. Not only is a framework of competition law in place to tackle dominance and the abuse of market power, but the Bill will place competition at the heart of the regulatory process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> The Minister says that, but the Competition Act 1998 does not apply to oil sheikhs or anyone who imports a product.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I remember well that in the 1960s we built huge 2,000 MW oil-fired power stations all over the country. Only a few people had dreamt of OPEC, which has now pushed oil prices to almost $30 a barrel from an all-time low of $9 a barrel not too long ago. I do not pretend that our deliberations will alter what Sheikh Yamani or any other oil producer decides to do in Saudi Arabia. However, the Bill will help to ensure a diversity of supply to compensate for when we have to pay through the nose for energy supplies because of actions that are beyond our control. Gas is relatively cheap, but it could become expensive. We have learned that lesson from recent history.
<P>
The last thing that the regulator needs is a principal objective that promotes competition in generation and another duty that deals with the same thing but in a different way. The Bill completes the work to ensure that there is genuine competition in generation by introducing new electricity trading arrangements--NETA. We are replacing the opaque and unsatisfactory system of the pool, which inherently distorts competition between types of generation, with a new system to encourage competition and remove market distortions.
<P>
We have all been asked to declare our credentials, and I declare my free-market credentials. As someone who was on strike for a year to sustain a particular industry and one fuel, I declare that I have completely changed my mind since 1984. Indeed, it was my experience in 1984_85 that taught me a painful lesson about trying to maintain an ossified industry.
<P>
As you know better than I do, Mr. Hood, if at the time there had been the sort of advances that we have now in clean coal burn and more efficient coal-fired power stations, and if the environmental implications had been properly considered, perhaps we would now have a larger coal industry. Perhaps, if some of the money that went into research into the nuclear industry had been shared out more evenly in other sectors, and if the administration of the coal industry, not only by the managers but by successive Governments, had not been so smug, inward looking and unimaginative, we would have a bigger coal industry now. I believe that we should have learned from those experiences and that the play of the free market will determine the best mix of energy sources.
 <P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I have listened with interest to the Minister speak from the heart, but does he accept that the free market would not necessarily choose renewable sources, which might have a high initial cost and a long payback period?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> That is why we have made special provision in the Bill to ensure that renewable resources are encouraged. I believe that the new electricity trading arrangements will encourage those types of generation. The biggest driver will be the overarching concern about the environment. We must meet our Kyoto obligations and we must convince other countries to do the same. People will not want to live in the environments in which many of my constituents were brought up, with slap heaps on mountain sides and despoilment. People want to live in decent environments.
<P>
I am excited by the new forms of power generation that have been developed. Pollution by burning carbon fuels is not the only form of pollution. I am a keen mountaineer. Not long ago, I could go to the top of any mountain or hill in Wales and all I could see was other mountains and hills, but now all I can see is damn windmills--white ones--not producing much electricity, but a lovely sop to the environmental lobby.
<P>
I will not condemn nuclear energy. My son is asthmatic and when I started to read about the causes of asthma I realised that the way in which we generate electricity in this country is killing children. I am not talking about some terrible Chernobyl accident that may take place in 30 years' time; we are killing kids now. I am convinced that, if we are to avoid being held hostage by providers of gas, perhaps from the great Siberian fields, we will have to seriously consider how we will generate the huge tranches of electricity needed for the electronic equipment that the hon. Member for South Dorset and everyone else has in their offices. We should not close our minds to that. [Interruption.] I thought that the Whip was going to ask me to sit down.
<P>
It does not make any sense to call for greater diversity and then rule out an entire part of the industry which is generating, quite cheaply, a lot of electricity. In the long term, we can argue about whether that is feasible. It is important to keep an open mind.
<P>
In the Bill, we have the right framework for competition and diversity in generation. With the amendment, we would have a good deal more muddle and confusion. I know that the hon. Member for South Dorset is fascinated by this subject and knows a great deal about it, but I ask him to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> That was a memorable speech, and we will all read it later. I know the difficulty faced by any Government in trying to achieve diversity of supply.
<P>
The Minister has clearly demonstrated that he is now a free-marketeer and that he believes that the market will maintain some diversity in methods of generating electricity. I am glad to have heard him say that nuclear power will have a great role to play. I hope that his impassioned pleas about windmills, along with the fact that there are virtually no coal pits in south Wales, will do him no electoral harm--I mean that personally rather than politically, because we would love to win the seat of Pontypridd from Labour.
<P>
I am not sure whether Llantwit Fardre is part of the Minister's constituency-- [Interruption.] In that case, the Minister is Member of Parliament for my birthplace. I was trying to work out where Penwaun was, but I could not find it in my map book. However, we can swap stories later. On the basis that his speech will do as much good to the Conservative cause as any speech that I might make, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Further consideration adjourned.--[Mr. Pope.]

Adjourned accordingly at nine minutes to Seven o'clock till Thursday 2 March at half-past Ten o'clock.
