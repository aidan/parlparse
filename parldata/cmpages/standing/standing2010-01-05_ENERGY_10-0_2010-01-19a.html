<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011991000308"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> We were talking about Ofgem. I was quoting from
the Energy and Climate Change Committee evidence session of early
December when, among others, the hon. Member for Amber Valley, who is
not in her place, was quizzing Mr. Alistair Buchanan, the
chief executive of Ofgem. I had just come to the point in their last
exchange when the hon. Lady was suggesting that there could be
immediate action to deal with the anomaly that the current rules allow
energy suppliers to increase their prices but not tell their customers
for 65 days. Mr. Buchanan said that he was going to talk to
Ofgem&#146;s consumer panel and that it was to be its first
project.</div><a name="10011991000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does
the Minister agree that, whatever the history, it is nonsense that
people can be told about a price increase three months after it has
happened, but have a much shorter period&#151;only 20 working
days&#151;in which to change supplier as a result of that price
increase? Does she agree that something ought to be added the Bill to
deal with that through licence conditions? What will the timetable be
if there is not such a change in the Bill? How long will people who
have had increases or are going to have increases have to wait before
the law or the policy is changed, so that they get advance notice of
any
increases?</div><a name="10011991000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is entirely of merit and would be hugely popular among users.
It would do nothing adverse to the utility companies. It would,
however, give them the advantage of up to three months of increased
price and payment from customers, and a reduced chance of the customers
changing to another tariff. All the eggs are in the basket of the
utility companies and none of the advantage lies with the
consumer.</div><a name="10011991000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have covered the amendment in the group. There are also three new
clauses, one of which is in the names of Conservative Front-Bench
Members. New clause 18
would</div><a name="10011991000244"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Within
six months of the passing of this
Act,&#148;</div><a name="10011991000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">require
the Secretary of State to</div>
<a name="10011991000245"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;limit to no
more than 10 the number of tariffs which each energy supplier may offer
to any residential
customer.&#148;</div><a name="10011991000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
we were questioning the representatives of the six companies, they told
us, in general terms, how many tariffs they had and accepted that,
historically, they had had a huge number of tariffs. They explained
that some were historic and that there were so many because each region
in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland had separate
arrangements. We have had helpful responses because we asked them how
many tariffs they currently
have.</div><a name="10011991000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
conclusion is that there are still hundreds, if not thousands, of
tariffs. From the point of view of the consumer, the situation is still
extremely confusing. The backdrop to the new clause is not only my
concern that the current situation is thoroughly confusing, but the not
untypical experience of a constituent of my hon. Friend the Member for
Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey).</div>
<a name="10011991000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Margaret
Erskine has been in a long-running dispute with npower, which I have
taken up with npower and Mr. Buchanan. With her agreement, I
am going to summarise her complaint, as set out in a letter to my hon.
Friend in November. She applied to be an npower gas and electricity
customer on 19 May 2006 and an agreement was made that no more than
4,572 units would be charged for gas at the higher unit rate. She
was 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column323" />Column number: 323</div>entitled to a discount because she was receiving both gas and
electricity from the same supplier and was paying by monthly direct
debit.</div>
<a name="10011991000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">In her first
year as a customer, she was charged 4,432 units, just below the figure
that she had been given at the higher rate, and clearly within the
rules set out. However, in the following year, to 15 May 2008, she was
charged 6,194 units at the higher rate. That clearly did not satisfy
the agreement that no more than 4,572 units would be charged at the
higher rate.</div>
<a name="10011991000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am going to
pause here, because the issue about the nature of the tariffs and how
they are described also relates to the debate that we will have later
about investigations and the timetable for investigating. The Minister
will be aware of that issue because we have discussed it in general
terms before. I am not going to repeat the same facts twice, but I
lodge with her the fact that this case has two implications in terms of
the transparency of the system and the investigatory process.</div>
<a name="10011991000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Margaret
Erskine took up the matter with npower and would, I am sure, be happy
to release the correspondence generally. She was told that for the year
from 1 November 2007, no more than the published total of 4,572 units
would be charged at the higher rate. It was perfectly clear to
everyone&#151;her phrase&#151;apart from npower and Ofgem, that
this was not so for any year that included the six months between May
and November. The point that she discovered was that npower effectively
changed its tariff year when it introduced a new tariff. Unbeknown to
her, the year that ran from when she started, and annually thereafter,
did not qualify her for the benefit of a lower tariff charge after the
higher number of units.</div>
<a name="10011991000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have all
probably paid bills in which the first set of units is paid at a higher
rate, which then diminishes. I think that has always been an
unfair system because low users and poor users are inevitably charged
at a higher rate per unit than high users, who get a discount once they
use more than a certain amount.</div>
<a name="10011991000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have always
felt that there needs to be a system that does not give a benefit for
using more energy. It seems a perverse incentive; we should be trying
to incentivise people to use less energy, not more. One reason for
transparent tariffs is to expose the fact that at the moment there is a
benefit to the companies from those who use less and a disbenefit to
them from those who use more, given the amount of money that people
pay.</div>
<a name="10011991000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">A most
extraordinary explanation was given in a letter from npower, which
states:</div><a name="10011991000246"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
took this (ie the abnormal number of higher units charged in the period
1 May to 31 October 2007) into account when we set our lower gas
charges in April
2007&#148;.</div><a name="10011991000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">Miss
Erskine, however, says that that is complete nonsense and has shown
that the balance for the six months that would have given her the
advantage if they had been counted from the beginning, and that for the
following six months, were similar. Before setting out the comparative
tables that show how unfairly she was treated, she
writes:</div><a name="10011991000247"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Since
more units were being charged at the higher rate from 1 May
2007 and since the rate of charge for these units was increased, the
result was an even higher charge than before. The possibility of
gaining from the reduced rate for the balance of the units was remote,
in the summer months, for most customers. The hope expressed in the
letter that &#145;...it&#146;s now a bit clearer&#146; went
down like a lead balloon!&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column324" />Column number: 324</div><a name="10011991000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">She then states that the
seasonally weighted profile is detailed in the letter of 7 July and
outlines what actually happened in the relevant year, before concluding
very strongly on the lack of action and senseless explanations from
Ofgem.</div><a name="10011991000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
information has been of use because it has amplified one of the
complaints about the system. To be fair to the companies, the general
message that they had too many tariffs and that the system was too
complicated has been getting through. The companies have supplied us
with the summaries of their current tariffs, which we requested when
their representatives attended our evidence sittings. A survey of
utility companies in a &#147;Spotlight&#148; article in the August
2009 issue of <i class="I">Call Centre Focus</i>&#151;I was not previously
familiar with the magazine&#151;concluded that Scottish and Southern
Energy Group, to be fair to it, had the greatest customer satisfaction
of all the big six utility
companies.</div><a name="10011991000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Scottish
and Southern Energy Group states that
it</div><a name="10011991000248"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;currently
offers 13 distinct nationwide energy products across its four regional
supply businesses: Scottish Hydro; Southern Electric; Swalec and
Atlantic.&#148;</div><a name="10011991000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
then sets them out. The first two are Standard Energy and Standard
Energy Online&#151;one pays less online. There are also energy saving
tariffs including Better Plan, which provides discounts for customers
who reduce their energy use by 10 per cent. There is also an M&amp;S
vouchers option called M&amp;S Energy. There are three discount
tariffs, one of which offers 10 per cent. off purchases at Argos and
Homebase. Another involves discounted high street vouchers for
participating stores, and the other is a social tariff.</div>
<a name="10011991000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are two
time-limited tariffs: Atlantic Online FP and Price Fix 4 August 2011,
which fix the price over a longer period. The other three are
energyplus Pulse, which provides support for the British Heart
Foundation; power2, which is a green tariff involving tree planting and
other initiatives; and Go Direct 2, an online tariff with paperless
billing and direct debit. There are also regional variations
and</div><a name="10011991000249"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
discount available from standard credit for those who pay by direct
debit.&#148;</div><a name="10011991000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moreover,
there are prepayment meters and Economy 7 and Economy 10
options.</div><a name="10011991000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
illustration, from just one of the six companies, shows the breadth and
range of options available. Anybody interested in our affairs can see
the evidence submitted to the Committee outlining the companies&#146;
tariffs: Scottish and Southern Energy Group&#146;s response is in the
document entitled EN 10, ScottishPower&#146;s is in EN 11, and so on.
Colleagues will be pleased to hear that I will not read all of them,
although I am tempted to because they show the complexity of the
product. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I could indeed read them
all, if encouraged.</div>
<a name="10011991000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
conclusion, however, is that there are all sorts of variations. There
are discounts for prompt payment. There are still discounts for
prepayment meters and monthly direct debit. Then there is a whole range
of different types of tariff, sometimes with slightly unhelpful or
misleading names: capped deals, fixed deals and tracker deals.
Sometimes the deals stay on the adopted tariff, sometimes they revert
to a previous
tariff.</div><a name="10011991000275"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div>
<a name="10011991000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure the
Minister must agree with me that from the point of view of the ordinary
consumer&#151;the person who does not have all day to spend weighing
things up: 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column325" />Column number: 325</div>who runs a home or has a busy life; who may not be well, or who may be
fit but busy; who may not be terribly numerate or literate; who may be
poor; or who has other pressures&#151;we could be much stricter in
what we require Ofgem to insist on. That is why my colleagues and I
have said that it must be reasonable to say that in any part of the
country there is an upper limit to the number of tariff
options&#151;10 for any customer in any product.</div>
<a name="10011991000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course,
the figure 10 is arbitrary; it could be 12, eight or six. I am not
seeking to argue that there cannot, for good practical reasons, be
different tariffs in different parts of the country. However, for one
user in one place I would like the Minister to say whether she supports
the range and variety of options that exist now, or whether she agrees
that Ofgem has been a paper tiger&#151;a toothless wonder&#151;in
trying to ensure that the utility companies serve their customers
rather than themselves. There are many people, as Margaret Erskine
discovered, who pay more than they should pay because they could not
work their way through the minefield of options and come out safely on
the other side.</div>
<a name="10011991000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">That leads us
to new clause 19, which is consequential on the other new clauses. It
requires
that</div><a name="10011991000250"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Within
six months of the passing of this
Act&#148;</div><a name="10011991000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ofgem</div><a name="10011991000251"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;will
publish or cause to be published, at least three times a year, in
national, regional and local press a full list of energy
tariffs...applicable for the next period of six
months.&#148;</div><a name="10011991000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have chosen three months. It could be two months, twice a year or
quarterly, because there are, for most people, three times a year when
they think of a new start and new beginnings: the new year, when people
plan for the year ahead; the new financial year at the beginning of
April; and, for a lot of people, there is the new school and academic
year, which also precedes winter. We are not so bothered about that. It
could be quarterly, but I hope the Minister will agree that it is about
time that people were able to find, in one place at one time, in an
easily accessible way, a league table that gives the up-to-date
information&#151;just a grid and a list of suppliers and
options&#151;so that they have the best possible chance, in a way
that is directly comparable.</div>

Mike Weir</b> (Angus) (SNP): I have listened carefully to the
hon. Gentleman and I understand his point. What strikes me as one of
the problems for consumers is not so much the number but the complexity
of the individual tariffs. Even if presented with the choice of two, it
is often very difficult to work out which tariff suits a
person&#146;s circumstances and is the best one to go for. I am just
a bit concerned that new clause 19 would not be able to determine the
best tariff for an individual person.</div>

has put into place a package of reforms to make it easier for consumers
to understand their bills and engage with the energy market...From
1 September 2009 Ofgem introduced two new licence conditions which stop
suppliers charging more for one payment than another. The first
requires that any difference in the terms and conditions offered in
respect of different pay methods must be cost
reflective.&#148;</div><a name="10011991000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have already touched on that debate. It
continues:</div><a name="10011991000253"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
second prohibits undue discrimination between terms and conditions
offered to different groups of customers.&#148;</div>
<a name="10011991000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am still not
persuaded. I understand the argument that if people have a prepayment
meter, which is a bit of kit they receive only if they ask for one, it
costs a bit more. There is therefore a differential cost to such
customers and it is proper to reflect that. That is still unfair
because the people who have prepayment meters are generally those who
are most strapped for cash. Either they are paying more themselves or
the burden is spread over everybody else.</div>
<a name="10011991000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">In this
market where the choice of suppliers is so limited&#151;unlike the
telecom market or groceries, where hundreds of options are
available&#151;I can see no justification for a differential unit
price, according to whether one pays by cheque or direct debit or
prepayment meter. A fair system would not give advantages to people who
are, bluntly, the most affluent, the best off, the most organised and
who run their lives by direct debit because they know there will always
be enough in their bank account. It is unreasonable that the charge
should be higher for those who are not in that position and who have
things like prepayment meters, either voluntarily or forced on them.
Ofgem has not gone far enough to get rid of the unjustified price
differences.</div><a name="10011991000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
the heading &#147;Clearer information on bills&#148; the memorandum
from Ofgem states:</div>
<a name="10011991000254"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;From
July 2010 energy suppliers will be required to make significant
improvements to bills to aid customer understanding and help them
compare tariffs. Under the new rules each bill will need to
display:</div>
<a name="10011991000255"></a><div class="hs_brev">The tariff
name</div><a name="10011991000256"></a><div class="hs_brev">The
customer&#146;s consumption for the past 12 months in kilowatt
hours</div>
<a name="10011991000257"></a><div class="hs_brev">The projected
cost in pounds per year if the customer remains on the same tariff and
uses the same amount of energy</div>
<a name="10011991000258"></a><div class="hs_brev">Suppliers
will also have to supply customers with an annual statement containing
this information plus the principal terms and conditions of the tariff.
It will also:</div>
<a name="10011991000259"></a><div class="hs_brev">Point out any
premiums or discounts that apply to the tariff compared to standard
monthly direct debit with the same
supplier</div><a name="10011991000260"></a><div class="hs_brev">Contain
a reminder that the customer can switch along with advice on how to do
so</div><a name="10011991000261"></a><div class="hs_brev">To
underpin these rule changes, from September 2009, Ofgem also set out
over-arching standards of conduct that set out how we expect suppliers
to behave. For example, suppliers should not sell a customer a product
that they do not fully understand or is inappropriate for their needs
and they should not offer products which are unnecessarily complex or
confusing.</div>
<a name="10011991000262"></a><div class="hs_brev">We also
looked into the issue of the large number of tariffs that are currently
available and decided that, at this time, any restriction would have
negative effects on customer choice (eg there are currently a variety
of different payment methods available, green tariffs, capped rates and
social tariffs) and the ability of suppliers to innovate. However we
recognised the issue of customer confusion which our remedies sought to
address.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column327" />Column number: 327</div><a name="10011991000263"></a><div class="hs_brev">Given the
detailed investigation that has been undertaken, Ofgem believes it is
appropriate to allow the remedies that have been imposed time to take
effect. Ofgem will closely monitor the impact of the new measures and
remains willing to amend the remedies should they prove insufficient in
addressing consumer
concerns.&#148;</div><a name="10011991000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am, to be fair to Ofgem, aware that it has said that the situation is
still confusing. We have taken some measures and others will be taken.
To deal with the point made by the hon. Member for Angus, unless a
customer can be told on their bill, over the phone or both what is the
cheapest tariff for them, often, they will not avail themselves of it
and will pay over the
odds.</div><a name="10011991000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011991000311"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> I think that gets to the point. As the hon.
Gentleman quoted, Ofgem says that suppliers should not sell a customer
a product they do not fully understood or that is inappropriate for
their needs. My slight worry with his amendment is that if we are
publishing simply a list of tariffs, it will be very difficult to look
at individual needs within that. There needs to be more contact between
the supplier and the customer to discuss these individual needs, rather
than a simple table for a customer to stick a pin into to choose a
tariff.</div><a name="10011991000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011991000312"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I absolutely agree. A good consumer world would be
one where, three times a year, there was a table, a contact phone
number, an e-mail address and a website for those who wanted to check
all the implications, but also a little explanation of the particular
characteristics of a tariff, together with the price. Then there would
be the good practice referred to in the conversation, &#147;What is
good for you?&#148; However, a person would also be told about the
cheapest option on offer from ScottishPower, npower or
whatever.</div><a name="10011991000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 4 has been tabled by the hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg
Clark) and his colleagues, and signed up to by my hon. Friends and me.
It would implement an additional measure to do what we have been
talking about and ensure that the cheapest tariff is available on bills
sent out by companies. A person should receive a bill and, in addition
to the things they are now going to be told, they should be informed of
the cheapest option.</div>
<a name="10011991000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are on the
way to improving the system, but it has been terribly slow and people
have paid hugely over the odds. The poor have been greatly
disadvantaged, and I hope the Government will be at least as robust as
they have sounded recently, and indicate either that they will accept
the amendments and new clauses, or that they will insist that Ofgem
implement those measures later this year, unless there is a marked
improvement in the ease with which customers can choose cheaper and
clearer tariffs. This is an important issue&#151;it is one of the
biggest energy-related issues in the country&#151;and I hope the
Minister will be responsive.</div>
<a name="10011991000061"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011991000313"></a><b class="B">Charles
Hendry</b> (Wealden) (Con): The amendment and new clauses are
bound together by the desire to give more information to consumers.
There is a growing sense that consumers do not have enough information
to make real choices, and the Bill provides us with a vehicle for
making the necessary changes that would give people the opportunity to
make informed choices and ensure that they receive the best deal
available.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column328" />Column number: 328</div><a name="10011991000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 36
has significant validity. A consumer&#146;s only being notified three
months after a tariff has changed is something we would simply not
accept in any other aspect of our lives. I hope the Minister will come
forward with a positive response. If she will not accept the amendment,
I hope she will indicate how the matter could be addressed in another
way.</div>
<a name="10011991000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
background to the legislation is the perception on the part of
consumers that they are not getting the right deal from their energy
companies, although they cannot tell. There is too much opaqueness and
a sense that although retail prices go up quickly after wholesale
prices rise, they do not come down as quickly once those wholesale
prices decline. We know that Ofgem held an investigation into that, but
it looked only at whether there was a general market failure across a
range of companies; it did not look at the behaviour of specific
companies. Together with the Liberal Democrats and others, we are keen
to ensure that consumers are given as much information as possible in
order to choose.</div>
<a name="10011991000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Companies are
already beginning to go down the route of giving people more
information. They recognise that there are some aspects of
people&#146;s bills about which they would like greater clarity. For
example, companies are now providing details about the extra charges in
bills that have nothing to do with the actual electricity bills.
ScottishPower is incorporating elements that state that wholesale
energy costs account for 54 per cent. of people&#146;s bills;
delivering energy to their homes accounts for 19 per cent.; looking
after the energy account accounts for 18 per cent.; and the VAT and
Government obligations&#151;renewable energy, social incentives, the
carbon emissions reduction target, profitability of retailers and other
aspects&#151; accounts for 9 per cent. Companies are telling people
that they should be aware of how the bill is broken down. Centrica uses
a rather effective radiator symbol to indicate how the different
elements stack up in people&#146;s total gas bill, and it uses an
energy efficient light bulb symbol&#151;I am glad to say&#151;to
show how they apply to its electricity bills.</div>
<a name="10011991000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">First Utility
is perhaps the company that has led the way. Its starting point when
taking on a new customer is to equip them with a smart meter. It
believes that a smart meter can be used properly only if people
understand what they are paying for, and what the opportunities and
options are elsewhere. The bill shows people how many kilowatt-hours
they have used per month, and the cost for each of the previous four
months. It gives a breakdown of the hours of the day when consumption
is high and when it is low, so that people can begin to understand what
might cause that, and react to any surprise elements. It gives an
hourly-spend figure and considers the four-week usage elements as well.
The consumer can therefore look at that bill and say,
&#147;I understand why I am paying this much money.
I understand why I am using more energy at this time of
day&#148;, or &#147;I am surprised by that. What is running in my
house that is using up so much electricity? What can I do to address
that issue and further reduce my
bills?&#148;</div><a name="10011991000276"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div><a name="10011991000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is said that smart meters will not necessarily reduce people&#146;s
bills, but they will if consumers chose to use them intelligently. They
give the power to the consumer. Other things such as smart grids will
in time reduce 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column329" />Column number: 329</div>demand but the key element of the smart meter is that it will ensure
that consumers are in charge of their consumption patterns and
tariffs.</div><a name="10011991000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are keen to push things further. The new clause is straightforward. It
simply says that consumers would be told on their bills what tariffs
they were on, which would be the cheapest tariff available to them and
how they would go about switching to it. The hon. Member for North
Southwark and Bermondsey referred to changes that Ofgem is bringing in,
but the annual statement does not provide the up-to-date timely
information that consumers require and would find helpful. It shows the
comparison only between the consumer&#146;s tariff and the standard
direct debit rate, not between their tariff and the one that would be
the cheapest and most appropriate for them.</div>
<a name="10011991000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause is a starting point, and we have tabled it in a way that we hope
will be extremely easy for Ministers to accept. We would like to go
much further, but by going for a modest initial approach we hope that
the Minister will say yes, and that we can then explore further. I
realise that that is a vain hope, but there is no reason to lose hope
this early in the
afternoon.</div><a name="10011991000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
think that other things should happen in due course. Consumers should
be empowered by having information on their bills about how their
household consumption compares with that of similar households in their
area. First Utility will be doing that shortly, so it is clearly
technically possible. It means that the consumer can make an active
comparison between the electricity and gas they use and what would be
expected for a house the size of
theirs.</div><a name="10011991000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">They
should also have information about the environmental charges, because
if we want to engage people in a real debate about climate change and
energy efficiency, they will need to know what they are paying for
those things. That information is hidden away rather opaquely in their
bills, which means that we cannot have this important and honest debate
with the public. If they know what they are contributing to the costs
of the renewables obligation certificates, the European Union emissions
trading scheme and the carbon emissions reduction target, they can say,
&#147;Okay. I think I&#146;m getting value for money. I think this
is important.&#148; Otherwise, we will have an abstract debate about
moving in the right direction, without the public ever understanding
what amount they are contributing.</div>
<a name="10011991000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also hope
that the levy for carbon capture and storage will be a clearly
explained part of the Bill, rather than something tucked away in the
figures, so that people can see what their direct personal contribution
will be. I hope that that will enable us to have an honest debate about
pricing. Those measures put the consumer in charge and enable them to
make the right choices about the right pattern for
them.</div><a name="10011991000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand the appeal of new clause 18 and why the hon. Member for
North Southwark and Bermondsey has chosen to table it, but we have to
beware of perverse consequences, as the hon. Member for Angus
mentioned. If we were to go down the route proposed in the new clause,
it would be possible that a company wishing to introduce a new tariff
could do so only by removing an existing one that might be popular. The
wording does not make it clear whether historical tariffs would be
allowed to be maintained, or whether when a new
tariff  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column330" />Column number: 330</div>was introduced people would be forced to migrate from an existing one
that they might have opted into, to something that may or may not be as
good for them.</div>
<a name="10011991000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
of the tariffs on offer are clearly time-related; they are linked to
people committing to a certain price over a period of months. That may
make it more difficult, according to when the time scale is to be
introduced and the particular publication point at which it could
happen. We understand the principle and thinking behind it&#151;it is
intended to enhance simplicity&#151;but we need to be persuaded that
there will be no perverse consequences.</div>
<a name="10011991000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The driving
point is to give consumers more choice. A key area in trying to deal
with fuel poverty is to ensure that consumers actively consider their
opportunities to switch. In an earlier debate on the Bill, we heard
about the range of issues and how complicated it can be to switch. Many
people start the process but do not continue to the final act of
switching, because it seems too complicated and they cannot be certain
that they will be better off. We want to ensure that consumers have
that information, so when they try to make an accurate comparison they
can be in no doubt as to what is the best tariff to suit them and their
circumstances.</div><a name="10011991000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011991000314"></a>The
Minister of State, Department of Energy and Climate Change (Joan
Ruddock):</b> This has been a very interesting debate. We have
heard a lot of suggestions about what is best practice, and the hon.
Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey has raised many cases of the
very worst practice.</div>
<a name="10011991000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, I need
to look at the technical details of amendment 36. It seeks
to amend clause 18, to extend the list of provisions in the Secretary
of State&#146;s powers to include the ability to set a
&#147;minimum notice period&#148; for suppliers to give consumers
of changes to their energy tariffs. Clause 18 is designed to prevent
the exploitation of market power, which leads to generators obtaining
excessive benefits. The notification of tariff changes is therefore out
of the scope of the clause.</div>
<a name="10011991000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">In any event,
clause 18 applies only to generation licences. The amendment would
require the modification of supply licences and would therefore need to
be a self-standing provision to be effective. I suggest that the
amendment makes no sense in terms of the clause against which it is
tabled. Having said that, I have every sympathy with the sentiment
behind the amendment. Both the Government and Ofgem recognise that
energy tariff changes are a matter of concern and, of course, action is
being taken to address those issues.</div>
<a name="10011991000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will deal
with the issues, even though I am making the case that the amendment is
out of the scope of the clause. Following its probe into the energy
retail markets, Ofgem highlighted the need for suppliers to notify
customers of a price increase as soon as possible, and preferably in
advance. It also announced a number of licence modifications effective
from yesterday. Those modifications included an extended period of 20
days for customers to notify their supplier that they wished to switch
tariffs following a price increase. When customers notify that they
want to switch, the price increase will not apply to them. There is a
requirement for suppliers clearly and prominently to explain to
consumers the right to switch in order to avoid price increases, and
extra time for consumers in debt to switch after being notified of a
price increase, to give them an opportunity to clear their debt and
switch.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column331" />Column number: 331</div><a name="10011991000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is quite clear that Ofgem has made a number of responses to the issues
raised over a period of time by many hon. Members and by the
Government. The question that we have to ask, which is clearly posed in
this debate, is &#147;Is this enough?&#148; I do not think that it
is, if energy companies can still take 65 days to notify. I am told
that energy companies are generally taking much less than 65 days to
notify, and Ofgem has made clear what is expected in terms of best
practice. It has also said that it is keeping the matter under review.
I intend to draw this debate and the strong feelings expressed here to
Ofgem&#146;s attention and ask it to address the matter
urgently.</div>

Hughes:</b> I understand the Minister&#146;s point on the
technicalities and I am grateful for her tone on the substantive
arguments. It should not be that a supplier should
&#147;preferably&#148; notify a customer in advance. Does she agree
that there is no excuse for a supplier of a product not telling
somebody about the cost of that product in advance? I know of no other
regularly bought and sold product in this country that somebody could
buy or sell without knowing that the price has increased for a week,
two weeks, a month, two months or three months. Does the Minister agree
that that is unacceptable? The position should move to informing in
advance and to giving people the opportunity to change product or
supplier.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011991000316"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> As I said, I have every sympathy with what the
hon. Gentleman has said. We have to allow Ofgem to work this through
because if energy companies have to give prior notification to every
customer, they will need a mechanism that requires a lot of people to
be engaged in transferring the information at the same time.</div>
<a name="10011991000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
current arrangement, companies can spread the notification over a
period of time. That makes a lot more sense administratively; a company
could get so many people in to do a particular task and not need them
again until there was another price rise or tariff change. One has to
acknowledge that it is not absolutely clear how the transfer of the
information at the same time would be organised cost effectively. If
something costs more money to do, the cost is passed to
consumers.</div><a name="10011991000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
need Ofgem to look into the situation in great detail. As the hon.
Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey said, the current provision
means that only those who have the ability to know will know, but those
who do know have a new opportunity to say that they wish to cancel, and
they will not bear the penalty of the increased tariff. We have made
some progress, but I ask, as the hon. Gentleman does, whether it is
enough. I do not believe that it is.</div>

the Minister&#146;s remarks, in response to my hon. Friend the Member

be conciliatory and understanding, the reality is that in October the
Secretary of State, no less, said that the situation was unacceptable.
The Minister of State says, in this Committee, that it is unacceptable.
She said that my hon. Friend&#146;s amendment is flawed, and we
accept her understanding of that. Surely, all she need do is say to the
Committee that she will bring back, on Report, a new clause that either
instructs Ofgem to instruct the companies, or instructs the companies
themselves, to have an appropriate scheme in place by a specific date.

conducted with a real sense of co-operation and a real desire to
achieve outcomes for some of the poorest customers, particularly the
fuel-poor. Ofgem&#146;s record, however, has been deplorable. The
Minister and the whole Committee know that Ofgem has been one of the
most useless and toothless organisations it has been possible to
invent. No Minister of State should simply say, &#147;I&#146;m
going to pass this on to Ofgem to consider in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column333" />Column number: 333</div>the fullness of time, and at some point in the future people might get
an account sent to them by which the price increase is indicated on
time&#148;.</div><a name="10011991000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011991000327"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I have made my position clear on all counts, and,
as I have indicated, I will be in touch with Ofgem. I know that work is
being done, and I will see that I am in a position to report further to
the Committee. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I should make some
more
progress.</div><a name="10011991000098"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011991000328"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Brian Binley</b> (Northampton, South) (Con) Will the Minister
give
way?</div><a name="10011991000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011991000329"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I will give way on this occasion, but we need to
have some regard to our lack of progress. We still have a lot of new
clauses and amendments to cover, and I would like to make some
progress.</div><a name="10011991000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011991000330"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> I am most grateful. The Minister has been kind
during the whole process. I am, however, confused. The Minister
welcomed the fact that action could be taken on this important issue,
but Ofgem is not flavour of the month with many people in the industry
because of its inability to get real involvement in those areas.
Thirdly, we have the Minister later taking additional powers. The whole
thing is confusing. Why does she not only simply tell us that something
needs to be done, but take the opportunity to come back on Report with
an inclusion, or even an acceptance of the new clause tabled by my hon.
Friend the Member for Wealden? The Minister should do something in the
Bill, so that we all know that when she says that there are things to
be done, she really means
it.</div><a name="10011991000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011991000331"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> The hon. Gentleman asks that I bring something
back on Report and do something in the Bill. That is not necessary; we
want to get action, and action by Ofgem does not require further
provision in the Bill. I have undertaken to ask Ofgem urgently to
address the
matter.</div><a name="10011991000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall move on to new clause 4, which aims to enable the Secretary of
State to modify licence conditions for electricity and gas transmission
and to supply licences. The purpose of doing so would be to require
that customers&#146; bills provide information on the
suppliers&#146; lowest tariffs. The provision of clear and
transparent bills is critical for the effective functioning of the
electricity and gas markets, so I have some sympathy with the sentiment
behind the new clause. Ofgem has consulted widely on proposals to
improve customer information, and has received views from a range of
organisations, including consumer groups. I support the changes that
Ofgem has made. It is fair to say that whatever we think of
Ofgem&#146;s past record, the evidence we have received and the
evidence before our eyes shows that Ofgem has recently made changes
that we all ought to agree have been more in the interests of
consumers.</div>
<a name="10011991000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a result
of those changes&#151;the hon. Member for North Southwark and
Bermondsey referred to this&#151;each domestic customer&#146;s bill
will need to display the exact tariff name; a comparison of the
customer&#146;s consumption in the period covered by the bill with
the corresponding period in the previous year, if available; and,
except 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column334" />Column number: 334</div>where a customer has been with a supplier for less than 12 months, the
customer&#146;s consumption for the past 12 months in
kilowatt-hours, and the projected costs in pounds per year if the
customer remains on the same tariff and uses the same amount of
energy.</div><a name="10011991000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Customers
will be entitled to an annual statement that contains this information
plus the principal terms and conditions of the tariff. It will also
point out any premiums or discounts that apply to the tariff as
compared with the supplier&#146;s standard monthly direct debit
tariff. The statement will contain a reminder that the customer can
switch, along with advice on how to do so. Ofgem has chosen comparisons
with the supplier&#146;s standard monthly direct debit tariff in
order to help inform customers of the offers available to them. This is
because it is considered more practicable and helpful than comparing a
customer&#146;s tariff with the cheapest available offer. That might
not seem obvious, so I would like to explain why we think that is the
case.</div><a name="10011991000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Suppliers&#146;
standard monthly direct debit tariffs are widely available, so they can
act as a benchmark when making a comparison with all other tariffs.
This is not the case with suppliers&#146; cheapest tariffs, which
tend to be temporary, introductory offers or only available online.
These would not be available to all customers, due to their
circumstances or status with the supplier, and may not provide the best
deal in the longer
term.</div><a name="10011991000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011991000332"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I hear what the Minister says and I understand her
second point, but she has to accept that not everybody has access to
direct debit. Millions of people do not and there are
others&#151;millions, I am sure&#151;who do not want to use it
because they do not trust other people to take the right amount from
their bank accounts. Could she just accept that direct debit is not a
proper or reasonable standard because for many people it is not
available?</div><a name="10011991000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011991000333"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> The hon. Gentleman is arguing a case about the
cheapest tariff. My argument is that if there needs to be a tariff for
comparison, which is what the amendment seeks, then the direct debit
standard monthly tariff is the most appropriate benchmark. So it is not
a case of saying that that is what people should go on to, but it is
freely available and commonly used, and it is Ofgem&#146;s and our
view that it is the most appropriate benchmark. That is the only
context in which I raise that
tariff.</div><a name="10011991000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011991000334"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> The Minister referred to the fact that some of the
cheapest tariffs may not be available because they may be an
introductory offer. The amendment refers
to</div><a name="10011991000265"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
cheapest tariff available to the customer from their
supplier&#148;.</div><a name="10011991000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
would by definition exclude tariffs to which they were not entitled.
She might also note that one of the things that annoys people most is
that they get an attractive introductory offer and as soon as they have
been ensnared, the prices start going up. That causes a great deal of
anger.</div><a name="10011991000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011991000335"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman entirely on that
point, but he is proposing something that I cannot foresee being
practical&#151;that for every single individual the energy company
could provide the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column335" />Column number: 335</div>cheapest tariff for that individual, as opposed to its cheapest tariff.
There is a real difference, and in order to provide the cheapest tariff
to that individual person and household, it would be necessary to know
a whole raft of answers to questions about the circumstances of that
individual household. The general tenor of debate on these issues has
been about the cheapest tariff that the company offers. I took that to
be what the hon. Gentleman referred to.</div>
<a name="10011991000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I expect
Ofgem to continue to work with energy suppliers, consumers and consumer
representatives to ensure that consumers have good information about
the best electricity or gas deals and how to switch to them. It is also
important that consumers understand their consumption, so that they can
reduce it and their emissions as far as possible.</div>
<a name="10011991000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn now to
new clause 18, which aims to require the Secretary of State to limit by
regulation the number of retail tariffs offered by energy suppliers to
no more than 10, within six months of the Bill becoming an Act of
Parliament. The hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey, who
proposed this, said that it was arbitrary to pick on 10. It would be
difficult to set a specific number, as distinct from saying that it
would be desirable for companies themselves to operate a
limit&#151;to help with information and to enable people to get the
best deal&#151;in order to avoid unnecessary and useless tariffs. We
would all want to encourage that. To set a specific number does create
problems.</div>
<a name="10011991000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is crucial
to the efficient working of the energy market that consumers be able to
engage fully with and understand the range of products available to
them. Again, I have every sympathy with people who are currently
baffled by the array of different tariffs on offer. Like most people in
this room, I suspect, I have not delved into this issue in any depth
because it is daunting and I do not have the time. We all recognise the
difficulties.</div>
<a name="10011991000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
while undoubtedly well intentioned, the new clause would have an
unintended and detrimental impact on innovation and choice. That risks
higher prices for consumers, and may also mean that the introduction of
tariffs that meet real consumer needs and wants would be slower. We
have seen in recent years the growth in popularity of online tariffs
and the advent of green tariffs. We can expect further tariff
innovations associated with smart metering, such as the new
&#147;time of use&#148; tariffs. If the new clause were adopted, we
could anticipate that tariff innovations such as these would be less
likely to be introduced and would be introduced more slowly, as
suppliers would be more cautious about introducing innovative tariffs
that usually have a small and limited market.</div>
<a name="10011991000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition,
the new clause would make it more difficult for suppliers to offer a
range of tariffs tailored to customers&#146; needs. For example,
there are now tariffs with or without a standing charge, which will
appeal to different customers depending on whether they consume large
or small amounts of energy. We should also not forget the existing
range of social and discounted tariffs aimed at helping the most
vulnerable consumers to meet their energy needs. In general, the
ability to offer a range of tariffs that can more fully meet consumer
needs and enhance the overall competitiveness in the market, leading to
lower prices, is of course a positive one.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column336" />Column number: 336</div><a name="10011991000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The critical
issue is ensuring that consumers can understand what is on offer and
can easily find clear and comprehensive information that will help them
make the right choices regarding the most cost-effective energy
supplies for their circumstances. Lack of clarity and transparency is
the real issue. That is why Ofgem is taking action to address confusion
about the range of tariffs available and ensure consumers can select
the best tariff for their needs. It has introduced new rules to make
suppliers&#146; marketing clearer, improve information on all
consumers&#146; bills and require suppliers to provide customers with
a detailed annual statement from this year. The statement will include
a comparison of the customer&#146;s current tariff with their
supplier&#146;s standard monthly direct debit tariff, as I said, and
a reminder that customers can switch. That will help them to establish
whether they might be able to move to a cheaper
tariff.</div>
<a name="10011991000280"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div><a name="10011991000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ofgem
has also introduced new overarching standards, including requirements
that suppliers must not sell a customer a product or service that he or
she does not fully understand or that is inappropriate for their needs
and circumstances, or offer products that are unnecessarily complex or
confusing. Most importantly, Ofgem will be monitoring the effectiveness
of the remedies; as part of the process, we expect it to review whether
the changes have proved sufficient to help consumers understand the
range of tariffs available to
them.</div><a name="10011991000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 19 requires Ofgem to publish a full list of available energy
tariffs in the national, regional and local press at least three times
a year. The published tariffs would be fixed and be the only ones
available for the six months following publication of the list. It is,
of course, important that consumers should have easy access to the
information that they require to understand the full range of
tariffs.</div>
<a name="10011991000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Following its
probe into retail energy markets, Ofgem is taking action<i class="I"><b class="B">
</b></i>to ensure that consumers are aware of the range of tariffs
available and<i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>can select the best tariff for their needs.
As I set out earlier, customers will get with their current tariff a
comparison with their supplier&#146;s standard monthly direct debit
tariff and a reminder that they can switch. That will help them work
out whether they might be able to move to a cheaper tariff. In
addition, Ofgem has introduced new rules that require written estimates
to be provided prior to the completion of door-to-door sales, to help
prevent
mis-selling.</div><a name="10011991000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Consumer
Focus also plays an important role in overseeing the switching and
price comparison websites. Consumer Focus accredits reputable price
comparison websites through the confidence code, its voluntary code of
practice. Accredited websites help consumers decide the best deal for
their circumstances, by comparing their current supplier&#146;s
tariffs and usage with those of all the major
suppliers.</div><a name="10011991000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not sure whether it was the hon. Gentleman&#146;s intention to
limit the introduction of new tariffs, and changes to the rates of
tariffs, but that would be a consequence of the drafting of the new
clause. Such a requirement would limit customer choice and
significantly undermine competition by limiting the opportunity for the
introduction of new tariffs, or the amendment of existing ones&#151;a
point made by the hon. Member for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column337" />Column number: 337</div>Angus. It could also lead to higher overall prices for consumers. If
tariffs are fixed for six months, suppliers would probably load an
extra risk premium on to customers because they would not be able to
respond to price changes and price shocks in the wholesale market.
Furthermore, fixed rate energy deals suit the needs of some consumers,
but not all of them.</div>
<a name="10011991000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The debate
has covered a number of important issues related to energy tariffs. All
of us consider this to be a field where many unsatisfactory practices
still continue. Ensuring that consumers can understand their own bills
and the other options available to them, and can be confident that they
will not get hit with price rises without appropriate forewarning, is
central to the delivery of the fair deal for consumers to which the
Government are committed. However, a number of measures have been
implemented recently to address those issues and we look forward to
seeing more action from Ofgem in due course. I therefore believe that
the hon. Member&#146;s amendments and new clauses are unnecessary at
this stage.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011991000336"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> The Minister has given a careful and gentle reply,
but consumers need a robust ministerial response to an organisation
that has existed for many years, and which the British public view as
one of the most feeble regulators. As my hon. Friend the Member for
Harrogate and Knaresborough said, Ofgem has been pathetic in upholding
the interests of consumers over the years; it has always been slow off
the mark and behind the curve. It is always unwilling to be tough
enough for the utility companies and it has always responded belatedly
and slowly to public pressure.</div>
<a name="10011991000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">To be fair,
however, Ofgem has moved in recent months and I have outlined its
current position. However, it is not acceptable that we should have to
wait for it again to consider when it will move next. My hon. Friend
and I have indicated what needs to happen. If the Government are not
willing to table a new clause or amendment on Report to ensure that
people know in advance what their bills will be, we will do it for
them. I believe that all Opposition parties and a significant number of
Government Back Benchers would support that. The Government ought to
realise the way the wind is blowing and join those who see the need to
stand up for the consumer. I hope that the Minister will not resist
that too
much.</div><a name="10011991000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am also minded to try to persuade my Opposition colleagues that, when
they choose subjects for Supply days, they should table a motion along
the lines of, &#147;This House has no confidence in Ofgem,&#148;
with a proposal for reducing the salaries of those in charge until they
understand the implications of what they do. We have to get the message
across. I hope that those who listen to and read our deliberations
understand that some of us think that they&#151;particularly the poor
and disadvantaged&#151;have been ripped off and have not been
supported by the regulator, in all the time that it has had power. I do
not think that I can be clearer. If, after the general election, there
is not an overall majority, Ofgem had better watch out.
[<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span> &#147;Oh!&#148;] I
hope it gets the message loud and clear.</div>
<a name="10011991000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have dealt
with the issue of needing to tell people the price in advance. I will
not talk at length about the benchmark tariff, but I wish to respond to
the Minister&#146;s reply to my point. I understand the difference
between 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column338" />Column number: 338</div>the benchmark and the lowest tariff available to the consumer. I also
understand that every household has a different pattern of use and that
what may be cheaper for one family may not be cheaper for their
neighbour.</div>
<a name="10011991000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Using the
standard monthly direct debit figures as a benchmark&#151;they may
indeed be the standard lowest price&#151;implies, by definition, that
people are being incentivised to go for direct debit. That is not an
option for a lot of people and many others do not want it as an option.
Some people will never trust the system to take money from their bank
account. Neither will they ever trust the person who receives the money
to control when that
happens.</div><a name="10011991000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011991000337"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> Something has struck me. If a company&#146;s
cheapest tariff is an online tariff, what is the value in telling
consumers who cannot possibly go online about that cheapest
tariff?</div><a name="10011991000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011991000338"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> That is why we have to try to get an understanding
that works and is available for everybody. We have been logical,
because we have said that there should be no difference in the unit
cost whether one pays online, through direct debit, by cheque or by
prepayment meter. The Minister&#146;s point is perfectly valid if we
agree that there should be different rates depending on how one pays.
If there is no difference of rate, however, that issue does not arise.
We can then argue that a standard tariff of a monthly payment might be
the cheapest way to do
it.</div><a name="10011991000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the number of tariffs, there could be more felicitous or accurate
drafting to make sure that we are not seeking to get everybody to move
to a new tariff. The intention behind our proposal is that only a
limited number of tariffs should be available, but that does not mean
that they cannot change over time.</div>
<a name="10011991000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am open to
the argument that there should be eight tariffs rather than 10. The
great god choice is not as wonderful as people often proclaim it to be,
and socialists in the Labour party do not normally argue that it is
what everybody needs most. Our experience with the utility companies
tells us that people can have far too many choices&#151;if they
cannot understand what the choices are, they have no choice at
all.</div><a name="10011991000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 19 is not intended to be inflexible, but there would be merit in
having some rigour or discipline in the frequency with which people can
change the prices. I suggested that the tariff should be advertised
three times a year, or quarterly. Most people pay quarterly or more
frequently, and very few people pay less frequently than that. That
comes back to the initial debate about when people should be told about
price rises.</div>
<a name="10011991000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not see
any reason why there would be the great administrative burden mentioned
by the hon. Member for St. Albans in her intervention. If people were
to know three months in advance that there was going to be a price
rise, they could receive that notification in the batch of
three-monthly bills. That would cover most people in the country who
get a bill, and I do not see that there would be a great cramping of
the style of the utility companies.</div>
<a name="10011991000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will go
away and reflect on the best drafting of the new clauses and
amendments. Initially, we were minded to press the amendment to a vote,
but I buy the Minister&#146;s point about the amendment being more 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column339" />Column number: 339</div>appropriate for a different stage of the Bill, so I will not seek to get
colleagues to divide on what is an inappropriately placed amendment.
However, I give notice that an amendment, or a new clause, will be
tabled on Report, to ensure that Ofgem does its job better and that the
utility companies tell people in advance how much their energy will
cost and address some of the other issues. I hope that, by then, the
Minister will have realised that it will be in her interest, as well as
that of the consumer, to support the measure. I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="10011991000135"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave, withdrawn.</i></div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011991000339"></a>The
Chairman:</b> In order to make progress, it may be convenient
for the Committee to consider clauses 19 to 25
together.</div>
<a name="10011991000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011991000340"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. I
know that we have had an extraordinarily long debate about the
amendment, but we have not had a clause stand part debate. There were
some other matters relating to the clause that it would be helpful to
discuss.</div>
<a name="10011991000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011991000341"></a>The

Bill.</div>
<a name="10011991000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011991000342"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> I do not intend to keep the Committee long, but I
should be grateful if the Minister clarified a few points. Under the
market power licence condition, Ofgem&#146;s powers have been
increased due to suspicions that the constraints have resulted in
gaming by some of the energy companies, particularly in Scotland. The
interconnector to England is limited to 2.2 GW, which is insufficient
to cope with the constraints in Scotland, although there are plans to
upgrade it to 3.3 GW by 2011. As renewables uptake increases and fossil
fuels and nuclear power come off line, Scotland will become more
reliant on base load from England and larger connections will need to
be made.</div>
<a name="10011991000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is some
ambiguity about whether that new power is to overcome balancing issues
in the grid or whether it is to identify gaming, and it would be
helpful if the Minister set out what the powers are intended for and
how she expects them to be used. There is concern that there is no
definition of what constitutes a constraint, and the authority has the
ability to determine what that might be. Again, it would be helpful if
the Minister set out her interpretation of the concept of a
constraint.</div>
<a name="10011991000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also need
greater clarification on what would be considered as gaming. As the
volume of renewables increases in the mix, there will be a need for
more gas plant as a back-up capacity, which will run only for limited
periods. That would inevitably be more expensive per kilowatt-hour, as
there will be a need to recoup the capital costs over a shorter
operating period. That could be considered gaming, although it would be
a natural commercial activity. I would be grateful if the Minister
clarified whether she would consider that to be gaming.</div>
<a name="10011991000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
legislation should not be drawn in such a way as to discourage the
development of peaking plant available when there is a need for a small
amount of extra capacity in times of great demand, as that could
discourage investment. We need a distinction between what was 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column340" />Column number: 340</div>referred to during the evidence-taking session as a &#147;good
spike&#148;, a signal that demand is outstripping supply, and a
&#147;bad spike&#148;, where there is considered to be an abuse of
market power. I would be grateful if the Minister provided further
clarification on those issues before we continue with further
consideration of the
Bill.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011991000343"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> I want to raise some concerns about the market
licence condition. After hearing the evidence from Ofgem and the energy
companies, I remain slightly confused as to what the position is, so I
would like to press the matter
further.</div><a name="10011991000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I understand it, Ofgem takes the view that it would like more power to
control excessive returns in the wholesale market and has particular
concerns about balancing market constraints in the grid system. As has
been pointed out, the main constraints appear to be in the Cheviot gap
and the interconnect between Scotland and England. ScottishPower has
raised the prospect that the situation has a very adverse effect on the
two main Scottish generators and the ability to invest in future
plant.</div>
<a name="10011991000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we
explored the issue in evidence, it appeared that the main problem was
that there should have been a major upgrade of interconnection before
the adoption of the British electricity trading transmission
arrangements, or BETTA, system that brought the Scottish grid into the
UK-wide transmission system. That was not done, and the result has been
that due to weaknesses in the grid, the present system of constraints
has arisen. As I understand it&#151;perhaps the Minister can clarify
this&#151;generators can be paid not to generate electricity at
certain times when the grid cannot take the electricity because of a
lack of capacity. That is a concern.</div>
<a name="10011991000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Member for Wealden said, when the amount of renewables changes on the
grid, and as we see other types of generation, coal and gas could
increasingly become a back-up system for renewables when not enough is
produced from wind or whatever. It could become very difficult for them
to come on the system if capacity was constrained. My main concern is
that while Ofgem appears to take the view that companies might
deliberately exploit the system to make excessive profit, it does not
seem to me that it produced any concrete examples in its evidence of
when that has happened. It mentioned that it had set up the Competition
Act inquiry, but apparently the matter was not
pursued.</div><a name="10011991000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is fair to say that there is a lot of disagreement between Ofgem and
the companies about the real reason for ending the inquiry. Can the
Minister tell us anything more about that? In particular, will she tell
us why she feels the Competition Act cannot deal with the matter? I
would have thought that if there was any evidence of an electricity
company abusing its market position in such a way, the Competition Act
should have been able to deal with it.</div>
<a name="10011991000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">When I
pursued the issue with Sarah Harrison of Ofgem in the evidence session,
she stated that it was important to think ahead. She
said:</div><a name="10011991000266"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
a world that envisages a connect-and-manage approach to transmission
access, those opportunities for constraints on the network are going to
get even greater. Therefore, there is the risk that undue exploitation
can be exercised.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,
Energy Public Bill Committee, </i>5 January 2010; c. 72,
Q172.]</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column341" />Column number: 341</div><a name="10011991000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other words, Ofgem
seems to be of the view that someone in the future could do something
to benefit from the constraints, although there is no evidence that
that has been done at present. Sarah Harrison also quoted a figure of
&#163;125 million as the cost of such constraints as evidence that
the clause should go through. However, on being pressed by me, she
conceded that this was the cost of constraint within the whole grid
system, rather than that due to abuse of the constraint system. Does
the Minister have figures if she feels there has already been abuse
within the system, as opposed to constraints over the whole system?
Again, if I understand it correctly, that arises because of
deficiencies in the grid system, and not necessarily&#151;although it
could be the case&#151;due to abuse. It is important to make that
distinction.</div>
<a name="10011991000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we are to
have a truly open market in energy, we cannot also try to restrain
generation in this manner. ScottishPower made a point about the adverse
effect of risking investment in new generation in Scotland and
therefore security of supply. The point, which was explained by Rupert
Steele during his evidence, is that in a commodity-only market, there
needs to be a way to signal the value of capacity to stimulate
investment. If restrictions are placed on the balancing market and only
short-run marginal costs went into the equation, there would be less
incentive to invest in new plant. I reiterate that that could become
important when we are looking at more renewables, with regard to where
the base load comes from. Not all plant can be turned on and off as
necessary. In essence, it seems that rather than necessarily being a
symptom of use of the market, the constraints might well signal the
need for greater
investment.</div><a name="10011991000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause might have the perverse effect of discouraging new investment.
If there is evidence of the consumer suffering as a result of what is
happening, clearly the market power licence condition is fair and
should be pursued. I would like some reassurance, however, that we are
not going down a road that will endanger necessary investment in the
grid system and future generating
capacity.</div><a name="10011991000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011991000344"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> Before I answer the specific questions that have
been asked, it might help the Committee if I try to set out what is
embodied in the clause, because it is easier to get the
framework.</div><a name="10011991000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause sets out the framework within which the Secretary of State will
have the power to introduce a condition on generation licences
to protect the consumer from undue exploitation of market power
in the electricity balancing market. Ofgem has identified an aspect of
that market that is vulnerable to the exploitation of market power, to
the detriment of consumers. In March, it consulted on potential
solutions to the problem, including the introduction of a specific
licence condition. That consultation revealed that one example of the
exploitation might have led to costs of up to &#163;120 million to
the consumer during the 2008-09 financial year
alone.</div><a name="10011991000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem area being targeted is unique to the electricity balancing
market. As electricity cannot be stored, National Grid has an
obligation to ensure that supply and demand are constantly in balance.
In some 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column342" />Column number: 342</div>areas, the transmission lines that transport the electricity do not have
the capacity to move excess generation to the areas that need it. Such
situations are known as transmission constraints. I was asked to define
&#147;constraint&#148;&#151;that is the definition. In such
scenarios when a constraint arises and there is generation one side of
it that cannot be received at the other side, National Grid will often
rely on the help of a number of plants either side of the constraint to
increase or decrease generation and so maintain
balance.</div><a name="10011991000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Occasionally,
due to the location of a constraint and the spread of available
generation, National Grid will find itself dependent on a specific
company to alter its output to help to balance the system. That can
create an opportunity for the generator to exploit that market power
and charge over-high prices for its services. Those excessive fees are
ultimately passed on to the consumer via electricity bills, and that is
what we wish to prevent by taking the new
power.</div><a name="10011991000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is vital that the problem is addressed now&#151;the hon. Member for
Angus referred to this. In the coming years, the transmission network
is set to be upgraded considerably, and that work will ultimately
remove the conditions that provide the opportunities for the
exploitation of market power. In the short term, however, the practical
implications of that development and maintenance of the network will be
an increase in transmission constraints and hence the potential for
exploitation. I believe that the clause provides a proportionate and
effective way to ensure that the consumer is protected during the
coming years. Importantly, it is a targeted solution that will avoid
regulatory uncertainty, and therefore any impact on much-needed
generation
investment.</div><a name="10011991000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Four
specific conditions have been outlined under which a generator may be
deemed to have received an excessive benefit as a result of a
transmission constraint period. I emphasise that this is all about
excessive benefits, not normal commercial opportunities that arise in
the balancing of the electricity market. The first condition is when an
electricity company has acted in such a way as to make it more likely
that National Grid will be forced to accept its offers and bids in the
balancing mechanism at a high price. For example, it may withhold the
electricity produced by a particular plant from the market because it
predicts that National Grid may later rely on that plant to produce
electricity to balance the system. The company is then able to use a
resulting position of market power to charge an excessive price for
that increase in generation. That is probably what the hon. Member for
Wealden was referring to when he asked if it was
&#147;gaming&#148;&#151;I imagine that it is the appropriate
term.</div><a name="10011991000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second condition applies when a generator takes advantage of market
power during an existing transmission export constraint and charges
National Grid an excessive amount to reduce its generation, knowing
that the system operator will have no choice but to accept. The third
condition refers to a bilateral balancing contract with National Grid
known as an inter-trip. Inter-trips are an automatic switch that can be
fitted to a generation plant. It will trip if the transmission system
becomes overloaded and it allows National Grid to run the system at a
higher capacity than would otherwise be possible. Licence holders are
able to charge an arming fee to allow the set up of the controls on
their generation plants. There is evidence to suggest that arming fees
for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column343" />Column number: 343</div>commercial inter-trip services have not always been priced reasonably
and the clause aims to prevent such exploitative
behaviour.</div><a name="10011991000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
three conditions correspond with those scenarios that need to be
tackled to protect the consumer. Although it is not our intention to go
further, we need to be sure that the Government have the power to
address any related scenarios that come to light as we consult on the
licence condition, and that is the purpose of condition four. Although
it is not expressly set out in the clause, our clear intention is that
the licence condition will relate only to situations where there are
transmission constraints, and it will be applied to all generators on a
non-discriminatory basis. Our aim is not to prevent generators from
flexing prices or following normal market behaviour. The conditions
have been specifically designed to target behaviours that enable
generators to earn excessive profits where restricted transmission
capacity allows them to do
so.</div><a name="10011991000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall now try to answer some of the specific questions asked. The hon.
Member for Angus asked about the Competition Act inquiry into the
pricing and dispatching of ScottishPower and Scottish and Southern
Energy. It was launched in 2008 by Ofgem to look into a problem with
transmission constraints on the Cheviot boundary, as the hon. Gentleman
indicated. As Ofgem failed to find an infringement using competition
law, the case was dropped. Ofgem was confident that exploitative
practices had been taking place and believed that the lack of
infringement was due to intrinsic limitations applying to competition
law in these specific circumstances, as there are often difficulties
with defining &#147;market power&#148; in the electricity
market.</div>
<a name="10011991000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have found
that when Ofgem is confident that there is abuse taking place, and
companies are charging higher prices or benefiting more than they
should, it has been unable to fit the complaint into competition law.
That is why it has sought a means of tackling the problem and why we
have sought to facilitate that in the clauses on market power licence
conditions.</div><a name="10011991000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was also asked how Ofgem had arrived at the figure of &#163;125
million and if that sum related to excess profits or the overall cost
of the balance arrangement. Following the evidence session, I asked for
clarity on that point, with which I have now been provided and which I
shall share with the Committee. Ofgem, in its initial consultation
document on the market power licence condition, estimated that in a
worst-case scenario, the potential direct costs attributable to undue
exploitation of market power in the balancing mechanism could have been
as much as &#163;125 million in 2008-09. That is very much a maximum
that assumes that every balancing action in Scotland will involve the
exercise of market power. That figure is derived by taking the average
megawatt per hour price for various balancing actions in Scotland,
comparing that with the average price in England and Wales, and then
multiplying by the forecast level of Scottish constraints. The higher
average price in Scotland is considered to be due to lack of
competition and evidence of the exploitation of market
power.</div><a name="10011991000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hearing
that may not please the hon. Member for Angus, but that is the basis on
which Ofgem calculated the figure. It is clearly the worst-case
scenario, using constraints that exist between Scotland and England; if
they were all the subject of market power abuse, that would be the
outcome.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011991000345"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> I understand what the Minister is saying, and I look
forward to considering in more detail the written explanation, which
seems reasonably complex. However, it is clear that there are natural
constraints in the system, and it seems unfair to cite the full cost of
those constraints as the result of misuse of market power. It appears
that Ofgem is saying that its calculation of &#163;125 million is
likely to be due to the abuse of market power. However, as we all know,
there are constraints in the Cheviot boundary. There are also
constraints in other parts of the system, and if Ofgem takes that
attitude, it may well make companies think, &#147;Do we want to
invest if we are not going to get a return, because it is going to push
our prices
down?&#148;</div><a name="10011991000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011991000346"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> The issue is complex, as the hon. Gentleman has
said. Obviously, we do not have the expertise. It is difficult for any
of us to distinguish whether natural or normal commercial practices
would be involved&#151;whether a company was gaining some financial
reward from an opportunity in the balancing market, or whether it was
exploiting the position and gaining an excessive reward because of its
market power. That is the judgment that Ofgem has made and the
calculation that it had to quantify. It has indicated what the case
would be in that fairly extreme
scenario.</div><a name="10011991000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must be willing to accept that Ofgem is confident that there have been
abuses of market power and that it needs to have an opportunity to make
accusations properly within a legal context, when it thinks that that
has happened. Of course, there also have to be systems of fairness and
accountability, and companies so charged have to be able to make their
case. We will come to that later in the Bill. Here we are providing the
framework within which such presumed misuse of market power can be
tested by Ofgem. At the moment, that appears not to be the
case.</div><a name="10011991000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me try to conclude. The Government believe that the electricity
balancing market is currently vulnerable to exploitation, and estimates
suggest that there may be a high cost to the consumer. For that reason,
we think it absolutely right that we should target such exploitation
and ensure that consumers are properly protected until the underlying
cause is resolved through the completed upgrade of the transmission
network.</div><a name="10011991000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will acknowledge one further point that I was asked about and which I
have so far failed to address. It regards the question of whether this
is a problem of the need to further upgrade and invest in the
transmission network. That is absolutely the case. Over time, with
greater investment, we envisage the problem not existing in the way
that it does today. We will come on to discussions about investment in
the transmission network. The Government are absolutely committed to
making such investments, as a result of which the problem will
undoubtedly not exist in the same way in
future.</div><a name="10011991000170"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011991000349"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I have a simple pair of questions, which go
together. The Minister might not be able to answer them now, which I
will understand, but it will be helpful if she can. If not, can she
supply the information and make it available to the Committee at the
earliest available
date?</div><a name="10011991000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause deals with penalties imposed by Ofgem under their regulatory
powers. We want to consider that fully, and we will want to consider it
again on Report. Can the Minister publish and circulate the penalties
that have been imposed by Ofgem until now, with a summary of the
reasons for which they have been imposed; the amounts of the penalties;
the periods that companies or others were given to pay them;
confirmation that they have all been paid; an indication of where there
have been appeals in the past; and, when there has been a challenge
through a procedure or in the courts, the penalties imposed.</div>
<a name="10011991000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has been
difficult to discover exactly what the history is without a
comprehensive trawl. The Minister will have better access to the
information than some of us, and I am sure that she has the ability to
work with Ofgem to give us the information at the earliest date. May I
request first that that information is supplied and, secondly, that it
is given to us in reasonable time before the Bill is considered on
Report, so that if we want to come back to this, we
can?</div>

to trawl through all my briefings and give him an inadequate or
incomplete answer. On the penalties imposed by Ofgem in relation to the
breach of the market power licence condition, companies will be allowed
to appeal directly to the competition appeals tribunal. In that
instance, they may dispute the decision to issue a penalty, the size of
that penalty and the date by which they have been directed to pay. That
is sufficient information on the clause. I will undertake to provide in

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011991000353"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> Clause 26 is in the part of the Bill that covers
financial penalties by the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority. The
issue is a live one; it is the other half of the debate in which the
case of Margaret Erskine was raised. I referred to it earlier and
indicated that I would come back to it in the context of this
debate.</div><a name="10011991000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friends and I have tabled two amendments. Amendment 23 would
change the rules about the period in which an investigation can occur.
We raised the matter with Ofgem representatives in the evidence
sessions, and they said that this was one of the two areas where they
had asked for changes. They asked Ministers for greater powers and the
Ministers had
acceded.</div><a name="10011991000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
23 would bring the new timetable into operation from 1 June 2010. The
intention is to try to get it up and running as soon as is reasonable.
The Government have said that they want the Bill to be on the statute
book before the general election. That has to take place no later than
June, so the date in the amendment seems
reasonable.</div>
<a name="10011991000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 5
would delete subsection (3) of clause 26, which
states:</div><a name="10011991000267"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
amendments made by this section do not apply in relation to any
contravention or failure occurring before the day on which this section
comes into
force.&#148;</div><a name="10011991000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to make it very clear that we do not seek to provide a
retrospective penalty; we seek, from now on, to extend the period in
which investigations can start and continue from one year to five
years. It is clear to Ofgem, to the Government and to us that the
present system is flawed. Investigations have begun but, to speak
bluntly, they have run out of time. The clock has ticked and passed the
deadline for investigations to be completed. Ofgem has said that to
Ministers; Ministers have said that to us. We all agree that we need a
longer period.</div>
<a name="10011991000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
seeks to allow current problems to be investigated for a period of up
to five years, and for that to apply to issues that are live now, as
opposed to issues that will be live in future. I do not think that that
should offend the lawyers at all. The extension to the time limit would
not apply to licence breaches that happened before the date of the
passing of the Act. It would not make things retroactive; it would
simply allow Ofgem to impose a penalty for a licence breach already
committed, rather than introducing new retroactive offences.</div>
<a name="10011991000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clearest
example of that was the differential tariff pricing that I referred to
earlier, when Energywatch made a complaint to Ofgem. Energywatch
complained in March 2008 over npower&#146;s use of the tariff year. A
&#147;tariff year&#148; was defined at the time by
npower:</div><a name="10011991000268"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;When
we publish gas charges, we state that 4,572 higher priced primary block
kilowatt-hours will be applied each year. The year quoted is a
&#145;tariff year&#146; that begins with the introduction of any
changed charges. When npower change the way customers are charged, a
new tariff year commences from the date it
changed.&#148;</div><a name="10011991000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
stated that its customers had never been informed of the existence of a
tariff year. They had never been given a definition of it, nor had how
to operate it ever been explained to them. npower has conceded that; it
is not a matter of dispute. The charge is, therefore, that because how
the tariffs were structured was changed and the tariff year was
restarted at a different time, consumers  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column347" />Column number: 347</div>never reached the 4,572 kWh threshold and so did not benefit from the
falling block tariff. In the end, they paid the higher rate for more
than 4,572 units.</div>
<a name="10011991000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">Consumer
Focus has looked at that, as Ministers know. I know, too, that the
Under-Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change is due to have a
meeting shortly with Consumer Focus to continue to look at the issue.
<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>That is what I am told, anyway, whether he knows
that that is in his diary or not. I tell him that on 16 January 2010,

took the matter up with Ofgem and npower, writing to them after it had
been brought to my attention by the lady in south-west London. In a
letter to me, Ofgem has said that if the Consumer Focus analysis is
right, action should be taken, but that in legal terms its hands are
tied by the one-year barrier that currently applies. I will not take
the Committee through the whole of my correspondence with Andrew Duff,
the chief executive officer of npower, who courteously and promptly
replied on 12 November, nor the correspondence I had with
Mr. Buchanan, who replied promptly on 20 November. However,
I will select a couple of things from their
replies.</div><a name="10011991000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
npower argues that it has made changes so that the issue will not arise
again, and has explained that it was all part of a process of changing
how it bills, the reply does not adequately deal with the failure of
information and the fact that people were led to believe that they
would be on a lower rate than they were after a certain time. Margaret
Erskine, the lady who brought the matter to my attention and that of my
hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr.
Davey), and then was also in contact certainly with <i class="I">The Times</i>,
if not with other newspapers, was offered and, I understand, accepted a
small compensatory ex gratia payment by npower. However, she has
changed her supplier, as she was a thoroughly discontented npower
customer.</div><a name="10011991000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
matter had been brought to the attention of the press in the autumn by
Consumer Focus, because of not only that lady&#146;s complaint but
that of another named complainant: Andy Beck, an npower customer from
Teignmouth in Devon. He
said:</div><a name="10011991000270"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;When
Ofgem received the complaint in March 2008 it still had two months
before the time limit ran out and could, among other things, have
issued a &#145;stop the clock&#146; order. What&#146;s more,
where it cannot act directly, it could pass its conclusions on to other
people or organisations that could take the matter
further&#148;.</div><a name="10011991000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is, therefore, evidence that a large number of people were overcharged.
It may be a matter of only &#163;50 each, but if there are 2.2
million customers that would come to over &#163;100
million.</div><a name="10011991000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
was some uncertainty about when Consumer Focus started its
investigation. Although I had been led to believe that the inquiry had
started, when npower wrote to me it said that it had not been alerted
to that fact. Consumer Focus has confirmed, however, that it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column348" />Column number: 348</div>has done its investigation. In the briefing, which I am told the
Under-Secretary has also received, the watchdog
says:</div><a name="10011991000271"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Following
an investigation, Consumer Focus has concluded that npower overcharged
2.2 million of its gas customers in 2007-08. Our analysis suggests that
the potential overcharge per person is a maximum of &#163;78, with an
average figure of &#163;47 per customer, equating to an overall
consumer loss in excess of &#163;100 million...It is
our view, therefore, that the &#163;6 provided in goodwill payments
to just 200,000 of the 2.2 million customers affected is not
sufficient.&#148;</div><a name="10011991000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
investigation covered 2007 and 2008, and the report elaborates on those
data. The report is on the Under-Secretary&#146;s desk, as it is on
mine. To be fair to npower, it denies that it has breached its licence
conditions or its contract with customers. It explains that its promise
not to charge more than 2,572 units a year referred to the tariff year,
which can be different from a calendar year, and that it resets the
clock each time it changes its terms and conditions, as it did in May
and November 2007. The supplier also
said:</div><a name="10011991000272"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
completely reject any suggestion that our gas customers are each owed
&#163;47 and have seen no calculations to support this
figure.&#148;</div><a name="10011991000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is, therefore, a dispute.</div>
<a name="10011991000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">As well as
the proposal that in the future there is a five-year period, we seek to
ensure that where there is a breach that could otherwise be
investigated, but where the clock might tick and time might run out
before the change is made, the investigation is able to continue. It
does not, it seems to me, break the principle that the supplier should
not be liable for something they were not aware of. If there is a
breach they are in breach. In the past they would only have been
time-barred because the investigation could not continue.</div>
<a name="10011991000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we are to
give Ofgem some credibility in the future&#151;I will not repeat my
concern about its past failure of credibility from the
consumer&#146;s point of view&#151;we should allow it to carry on
investigations where there are major issues of complaint. I hope the
Minister will be sympathetic if not to the specific wording, at least
to the proposition behind these amendments.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011991000354"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> These amendments relate to slightly different
aspects of the coming into force of the new five-year time limit for
Ofgem to impose financial penalties for breaches of licence conditions.
Amendment 23 would ensure that this new time limit came into force on 1
June this year. As it stands the amendment would only affect the
penalty provisions under the Gas Act 1986; it would not apply to the
provisions under the Electricity Act 1989. Clause 36 already provides
that the penalty provisions will come into force at the end of the
period of two months beginning with the day on which it is passed, so
we believe it is quite unnecessary to specify a commencement date
within clause 26 itself. I agree there should not be a long delay, but
this has clearly been addressed in the Bill, so the amendment is not
necessary.</div><a name="10011991000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
5 would mean that the new five-year time limit for the imposition of
penalties by Ofgem would apply retrospectively. I know the hon.
Gentleman has argued that it is retroactive but that does not mean it
is not retrospective. It is. Legislation does not usually have a
retrospective effect. The prospect of doing this can create legal
uncertainty for businesses and inhibit investment in markets. There are
also potential human 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column349" />Column number: 349</div>rights implications. Although it is probably true that many businesses
will already retain some relevant information for five years or more,
it is likely that they will only keep some information for up to 12
months because that is all that is required to comply with any Ofgem
investigations under the current time
limit.</div><a name="10011991000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand why the hon. Gentleman feels so passionately about this. I
share his passion because undoubtedly customers have had very bad
treatment and it has not been possible to compensate them for that. Two
examples that I sought to have explained to me clearly needed to be
addressed. One was the &#163;2 million penalty that Ofgem
recently imposed on EDF for very poor performance in providing
electricity connection quotations. Ofgem identified more than
100 breaches of the time limits for providing quotations,
but was only able to impose a penalty for 47 of those breaches because
they had not come to its notice in time and had therefore occurred more
than a year previously when this was reported. Obviously in this case
we have a company being fined and penalised for behaving badly, but not
to the full extent because of the one-year time
limit.</div><a name="10011991000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
npower, the hon. Gentleman has quoted extensively from records and the
experiences that individuals have had of restarting the tariff year, so
that they had to build up again to get back on to the cheaper rate.
While Ofgem was able to secure compensation for some
customers&#151;obviously, the one to whom the hon. Gentleman referred
was one of those&#151;it was constrained by the one-year time limit
regarding the amount that it could achieve and the number of people who
could be compensated.</div>
<a name="10011991000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have no
doubt that this is a pressing problem. The Government have sought to
find a solution through the clause, which was tabled as a consequence
of Ofgem having experienced difficulties and having come to the
Government saying, &#147;We need a means of being able to address the
problems.&#148; As I have indicated, at the moment we must allow for
the fact that companies might be keeping the required information for
one year only, as that is all that is needed to comply with any Ofgem
investigation.</div>
<a name="10011991000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would not
be fair to make the new time limit retrospective because many licensees
might not have the evidence to defend themselves adequately if Ofgem
decided to investigate an alleged breach of licence condition that is
within the new five-year time limit, but before the legislation came
into force. In other words, at the time of the alleged breach, the
company would not have known that it could be investigated up to five
years later and should therefore keep records accordingly.</div>
<a name="10011991000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not giving
the provision retrospective effect will also give businesses time to
ensure that their systems are suitable to deal with future Ofgem
investigations under the new time limit. Although I sympathise entirely
with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s wish to see the measure brought in
more quickly, for all the reasons I have outlined, it is regrettably
not possible for me to support the amendment.</div>
<a name="10011991000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011991000355"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b><b class="B"> </b>I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s
constructive and sympathetic response. She wins the argument on the
first point&#151;I accept that elsewhere in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column350" />Column number: 350</div>the Bill there is a provision that would bring something into force
immediately&#151;and I will seek leave shortly to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
<a name="10011991000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the second
issue, I reserve my position as to whether we could win the argument
about whether the measure was retrospective or retroactive, and
therefore within proper legal processes. Obviously, we do not legislate
retrospectively, and I buy that. Arguably&#151;but sadly&#151;the
Minister has a good point about the practicality of the measure in
relation to matters that are currently in train. Her argument about the
records being held by the company might mean that it would be
impractical to deliver, which could be a barrier to the change. I will
go away and think about it. Obviously, I am keen to ensure that we do
not allow clear abuse of a supplier&#146;s power to result in the
sort of customer and consumer disadvantage that has clearly taken
place, and which so far can only be remedied in part, it would seem,
and on an ex gratia basis, to customers who remain unhappy that,
bluntly, they have been deceived and not properly informed.</div>
<a name="10011991000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would be
grateful&#151;as I am sure would many others, not least those who
have made complaints&#151;if when the Under-Secretary of State for
Energy and Climate Change goes to the meeting that he spoke about, he
made a report on it to those with an interest in the matter, possibly
including members of the Committee. That report could be used and
passed on to our constituents who have raised the issue, or to other
individuals who have made a complaint and feel disaffected or not
adequately compensated.</div>
<a name="10011991000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">Following his
conversation with Consumer Focus, if the Under-Secretary can do
anything that would get companies to make an appropriate reimbursement
of moneys that people have paid that were over and above what they
expected to pay, that would be a positive advantage, even if it cannot
be done by legal enforcement. I look forward to constructive engagement
with that issue and with the ministerial team when it reports back. For
now, however, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011991000356"></a>Simon

clause 27, page 22, line 6, leave
out &#145;considers&#146; and insert
&#145;discovers&#146;.</div><a name="10011991000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a simple amendment with which we seek to replace one word with
another. This part of the Bill centres on the adjustment of energy
charges and clause 27(1)
reads:</div><a name="10011991000273"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
the Secretary of State considers that some customers of an energy
supplier (the &#147;disadvantaged customers&#148;) are treated less
favourably than other customers of the energy supplier (the
&#147;advantaged customers&#148;) as respects charges for energy,
the Secretary of State may by regulations make a scheme for the
adjustment of charges for energy with a view to eliminating or reducing
the less favourable treatment.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column351" />Column number: 351</div><a name="10011991000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">The mission is a good
one, but I think that the drafting of the clause has omitted the
conventional word that allows the Minister discretion over the matter.
I seek to make it a more objective consideration and a question of fact
so that, if the Secretary of State discovers that there are less
favourably treated customers, the obligation on him to think about
regulations follows on from that. We can then talk about whether he
would have to introduce them or not. I would be grateful if the
Minister could tell me whether I am right in thinking that the drafting
of the Bill could be tighter and whether the amendment would meet that
objective.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011991000357"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> The Under-Secretary says &#147;You&#146;re
wrong&#148; from a sedentary position. I am sure that he will give us
a chance to understand his thinking with greater clarity in a moment.
The hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey has picked up on an
important issue that runs all the way through clause 27. It is a bad
piece of drafting and it will be a bad law if passed as drafted. The
clause is too subjective&#151;we will discuss that during the clause
stand part debate. The fact that, according to its opening sentence,
the Secretary of State can consider something means that he will have a
huge raft of powers. What is missing from the clause is real evidence.
In fact, the word &#147;discovers&#148; is not sufficiently robust;
the word should be &#147;establishes&#148; or
&#147;confirms&#148;. There should be no doubt about the evidence.
It should not be based on the Secretary of State having a slight hunch
or deciding on a whim one morning that something is not quite
right.</div>
<a name="10011991000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want a
much more robust approach and the sort of factual evidence that Ofgem
would be required to have if it was going to exercise the powers. It
does not seem right that the Secretary of State should be able to
operate on a whim and a hunch on a Monday morning when he pops into the
office thinking, &#147;I need a headline today; what shall I do? Oh,
something&#146;s popped up here!&#148; He will then be able to act
on it as if he was dealing with it on the basis of fact. The wording is
sloppy and we look forward to the Under-Secretary trying to reassure us
that it is not as sloppy as it
appears.</div><a name="10011991000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011991000358"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change
(Mr. David Kidney):</b> I will engage with the
amendment. As the hon. Gentleman has said, his point relates to the
clause stand part debate, during which I shall defend the entire clause
to his satisfaction, I
hope.</div><a name="10011991000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
27 will allow the Secretary of State to make schemes to remove any
disadvantage suffered by customers of an energy supplier who are
treated less favourably than other customers of that supplier in terms
of the prices they pay for their energy use. Amendment 24 would allow
the Secretary of State to take such steps where he discovers that some
customers are being treated less favourably rather than where he
considers that to be the
case.</div><a name="10011991000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
very first debate on part 2 of the Bill was introduced by the hon.
Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey and centred on whether we
should change a &#147;may&#148; to a &#147;shall&#148;. There
is a &#147;may&#148; in line 9 of clause 27, but the hon. Gentleman
is not seeking to change it to &#147;shall&#148;. I would therefore
argue that the Secretary of State&#146;s decision whether to make a
scheme remains permissive whether we use either
&#147;discovers&#148; or &#147;considers&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column352" />Column number: 352</div><a name="10011991000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">There must be
some circumstances in which &#147;considers&#148; is a broader and
stronger word than &#147;discovers&#148;, but it might be the other
way around in other situations. For example, if the Secretary of State
is told of a shocking situation, one could say that, having discovered
it by being told, he should do something about it.
&#147;Discovers&#148; might be thought of as a more pressing word
than &#147;considers&#148;. Alternatively, the Secretary of State
might know for a long time that something is terrible and it might be
the length of time that is has carried on being terrible that makes the
Secretary of State feel that something should be done.
&#147;Discovers&#148; would not be the appropriate word then,
because the Secretary of State knew for ages, so
&#147;considers&#148; would be the stronger word. Sometimes one is
better and sometimes the other is.</div>
<a name="10011991000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011991000359"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> The Minister has given us two different versions
of the word &#147;consider&#148;. Does that not show why the word
is inadequate in this circumstance? Will he consider or discover a
better word, which is tougher and clearer, rather than one that can be
interpreted in totally different ways?</div>
<a name="10011991000227"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011991000360"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> No, I do not accept what has just been said. I
gave two different scenarios to show the difference between
&#147;considers&#148; and &#147;discovers&#148; depending on
the circumstances. Consideration is a word that suggests that somebody
has weighed up all the evidence, given thought to it and made a
decision. Judges give consideration to cases and Secretaries of State
give consideration to things. &#147;Consider&#148; is an
appropriate
word.</div><a name="10011991000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would, in practice, make little difference to the clause.
Whether or not the amendment is made, the Secretary of State will still
have to identify a group of customers that is being less favourably
treated and then decide whether to exercise his discretion to make a
scheme. The change would not mean that the Secretary of State must
provide for a scheme whenever he becomes aware that unfair treatment is
happening.</div><a name="10011991000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I explained in an evidence session, these are intended to be back-stop
powers. In the first instance, Ofgem will be expected to act quickly
when it discovers evidence of undue discrimination among customers. If,
however, Ofgem is unable to take appropriate and speedy action to deal
with any such unfairness, the Secretary of State will consider whether
consumers are being disadvantaged and, therefore, whether he needs to
introduce a scheme using the powers. The powers give the Secretary of
State the discretion he needs to make schemes and ensure that consumers
do not suffer harm. I can assure hon. Members that Ministers are ready
to use the powers if it becomes necessary. I hope that the hon. Member
for North Southwark and Bermondsey will agree to withdraw his
amendment.</div>
<a name="10011991000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011991000361"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> The hon. Member for Wealden made absolutely the
right criticism of the clause. This probing amendment sought to deal
with the first of the discretions, and there are others, as the
Minister has pointed out. We have tested the issue before and this
clause stand part debate allows us to test it again. There is
&#147;considers&#148; or the alternative wording, which may need to
be adjusted, and there is the &#147;may&#148; or
&#147;must&#148; option. The hon. Member for Wealden was right in
the points that he made.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column353" />Column number: 353</div><a name="10011991000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand the Minister&#146;s argument; yes, judges do give
consideration to things. The argument gets weaker when he says that the
measure is there as a back-stop and if Ofgem does not intervene, the
Secretary of State is there to pick things up. The history of doing
things when Ofgem has not, has not been a happy one, so that is not an
entirely persuasive argument. We are certainly keen that there should
be back-stop powers because if Ofgem continues to be a relatively
toothless tiger, somebody has to do something. I am happy that there is
a two-stage
operation.</div><a name="10011991000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will reflect on what the Minister has said. This is not about
semantics. There are normal words that parliamentary draftspeople use;
I think that this one comes from the style of the conventional
formulation rather than a more precisely required formulation. I am
sure that we will come back to the wording, either in this House or the
House of Lords. For the time being, I am happy to go away and reflect.
I hope that we can build a consensus on this side of the Committee on
the best way to deal with the clause as a whole, including this word. I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011991000364"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> These are probing amendments to explore whether we
should add the two categories of people who have already featured in
our debates: those who receive liquid petroleum gas for their domestic
heating and those who receive fuel oil. The clause gives Ofgem the
power and the Secretary of State the back-up power to intervene where
there is seen to be differential treatment. There is an attempt to
categorise the sort of people who might be regarded as disadvantaged,
or a combination of whom might be disadvantaged. The list currently
reads: electricity customers, gas customers and dual fuel customers.
The amendment is to explore whether LPG customers and fuel oil
customers should be included.</div>
<a name="10011991000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011991000365"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> I understand what the hon. Gentleman is trying to
do. I think it is similar to what I tried earlier. Clause 30 defines an
energy supplier, and suppliers of LPG or fuel oil do not seem to fall
under it, so his amendment would be
ineffective.</div><a name="10011991000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011991000366"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right. As we have discussed
before, the market means that the suppliers are often the local garage
or local distributor; they are not suppliers in the context of the
Bill. We need to find another formulation. The hon. Gentleman did
indeed try to open up this debate before and we supported his efforts.
There is a will in the Committee to try to deal 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column354" />Column number: 354</div>with the people who are not on the gas mains in large numbers in
Scotland, Wales and England. I want the Minister to tell me how to
include LPG and fuel oil customers within the abilities of Ministers
and Ofgem to consider who is disadvantaged, so that they can have the
disadvantage remedy. This formulation may not be right, but there may
be another that
is.</div><a name="10011991000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second amendment in the group is to do a similar thing later in the
clause, so it would allow both the customer category and the charges
and costs to be taken into account. I look forward to the
Minister&#146;s
reply.</div><a name="10011991000240"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011991000367"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> As I highlighted during our debate on social price
support last Thursday, I fully recognise the difficulties faced by some
people who do not have access to the gas grid and therefore have little
option but to buy heating fuels. Amendments 10 and 11 aim to bring the
heating oil and LPG markets within the parameters of the Secretary of
State&#146;s power to adjust energy charges to help disadvantaged
groups of consumers. They suffer from the legal flaw that the hon.
Member for Angus pointed out: that the scheme relates only to licensed
suppliers and these people are not licensed.</div>
<a name="10011991000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those off-gas
grid consumers, who are likely to be electricity-only customers, are
already some of the potential beneficiaries of the clause as drafted.
The clause gives the Secretary of State powers to address unfair
discrimination between different categories of gas and electricity
customers and provides for the introduction of schemes to adjust
charges accordingly.</div>
<a name="10011991000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of our
main motivations for introducing these powers is for Ministers to have
powers to ensure that people who are off the gas grid will not be
treated unfairly in comparison with those who are on it. Our current
intention with regard to the design of the new social price support
mechanism, for a rebate on electricity bills, will ensure that
consumers who are off the gas grid will receive the benefit. The hon.
Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey asked to hear what I am going
to say about how we can improve the situation. Clearly, the major
option is to introduce some kind of new licensing system.</div>
<a name="10011991000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said
last Thursday, I do not believe that bringing domestic heating oil and
similar fuels under the same type of regulation as the gas and
electricity markets is the right solution. Neither do I think it would
be proportionate as the solution. The Electricity and Gas Acts deal
with markets where there are natural monopolies, which means that
competition cannot be expected on its own to protect consumers from the
risk of unfair exploitation. In contrast, there is no natural monopoly
in the distribution of heating oil, gas oil or liquefied petroleum gas.
Consumer protection legislation such as the Sale of Goods Act 1979
applies to those fuels, and there is competition legislation. As we
debated last week, the Office of Fair Trading, the Competition
Commission and local trading standards all have powers that apply to
those sectors. The Competition Commission has investigated the LPG
market and after five years recommended changes and made orders as a
result.</div><a name="10012024000076"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30
pm</div><a name="10012024000001"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012024000079"></a>Mr.
Willis:</b> We understand the Minister&#146;s point and he
is right to repeat his earlier arguments. However, he has had time to
reflect on last week&#146;s debate and to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column355" />Column number: 355</div>suggest how we bring the suppliers of liquid gas into a scheme in which
the people paying their tariffs get access to some sort of social
tariff from the suppliers. The reality is that, despite getting
something knocked off their electricity bills, people in rural areas in
particular will now pay extraordinarily extortionate prices for a
product that they have no option but to buy. The Minister is proposing
to do absolutely nothing, which is the
frustration.</div><a name="10012024000002"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012024000080"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> That is an unfair characterisation of my position.
I do not think that suppliers can charge extraordinary amounts of money
for their services without any recourse to a remedy. As I mentioned,
the whole of consumer protection legislation is there to protect them,
as is the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition
Commission.</div><a name="10012024000003"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10012024000081"></a><b class="B">Bill
Wiggin</b> (Leominster) (Con): I do not normally intervene if
I can possibly help it but, it would be helpful if the Minister
realised quite how difficult it is in my constituency for customers for
LPG find it. The Competition Commission recommended that the tanks that
people have at their houses do not continue to belong to the companies
that supply them but become exchanged between various suppliers, so to
some extent things have got better. If the Minister saw a contract, he
would find that he has to sign up for two years, irrespective of any
price change. It is not fair to say, therefore, that there is a proper
free market, because he has to bind himself into his supplier because
he is an LPG consumer. Whether they can move the tanks around is no
longer the criterion that holds the customer, giving them no freedom of
choice and no freedom to escape from a contract once they have signed
up to it. I do not think that the Minister was necessarily aware of
that, although I have written to him about it on behalf of my
constituents.</div><a name="10012024000004"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012024000082"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Before the Minister replies&#151;I am
happy for him to do so&#151;we are in danger of repeating a debate
that we have already had in Committee. I hope that hon. Members will
bear that in
mind.</div><a name="10012024000005"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012024000083"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I find it extraordinary that a Labour Minister is
defending the industry and free market operators from the Conservative
and Liberal Democrat parties. Nevertheless, that is my current
position. I am saying that there is a competitive market, subject to
laws about consumer and competition protection, which provides the
protection for those customers. For those in fuel poverty, I have
suggested a route, which, as the Chairman reminded us, we debated for a
long time last
week.</div><a name="10012024000006"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012024000084"></a>Mr.
Willis:</b> The Minister is missing my point. We understand
that there is a market. The reality is that, whether someone is the
wealthiest or the poorest person buying heating oil, for instance, they
pay the same price. The only difference is how much someone pays at a
particular time. The poor buy smaller amounts and therefore pay more
per litre than the wealthy. There is no social tariff whatsoever in
those markets. The Minister is not promising to do anything about it.
The amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for North Southwark
and Bermondsey is attempting to ascertain from the Minister a more
comprehensive response to the issue than simply knocking down the
amendments because they are inappropriate at a particular
time.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column356" />Column number: 356</div><a name="10012024000007"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012024000085"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> The hon. Gentleman and I will never come to one
mind, it appears, because we shall both carry on along parallel lines.
I am saying that people in rural areas off the main gas grid will get
support if they are in fuel poverty or at risk of fuel poverty from a
scheme that gives them money off their electricity bills. I do not see
how he can possibly deny that, whereas I cannot deny his point that I
am not proposing a similar scheme to give them money off their heating
oil, their coal or their LPG. I am not suggesting such a scheme. An
active, caring Government can give people alternatives to dependency on
those energy sources, to make the market even more
competitive.</div>
<a name="10012024000008"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example,
as well as the social price board we can look at energy efficiency
measures that we promote, assist, subsidise, advertise and so on. We
can look at alternative technologies that enable people to find new
ways to heat their homes, so that they are not dependent on the
traditional forms of energy. We can also look at new ways to help
people make their payments, for example through credit
unions.</div>
<a name="10012024000009"></a><div class="hs_Para">To come back
to the point made earlier by the hon. Member for Leominster, of course
the Competition Commission made two orders last year. One was about
transparency of charges and the other one was about enabling people to
switch suppliers. So the points that were made have been
addressed.</div>
<a name="10012024000010"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012024000086"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> Obviously we are listening and we hear what the
Minister says. However, will he accept that, irrespective of the
results of the investigation by the Competition Commission, all the
evidence from consumer organisations is that there are large parts of
the country where there is no choice? If one looks at the country as a
whole, there is choice, but for many people there is no choice in their
county, region, village, town or
community.</div><a name="10012024000011"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012024000087"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> Perhaps this will come as a surprise but, as the
Minister, I do not pretend to have all the solutions. The one point
that I have considered since our debate last week and that I certainly
took to heart is whether it would be valuable for hon. Members if I
were to offer to bring together the appropriate people so that we, as a
Committee, can have a discussion with those people
present.</div><a name="10012024000012"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, we could bring in Consumer Focus, the expert body on the
position of consumers; the Office of Fair Trading, the expert body on
competition law, or Ofgem, the expert body on regulating gas and
electricity markets. If it would be valuable for members of the
Committee to get together with me and those expert bodies to look at
what protection the law presently provides, what those actions last
year by the Competition Commission and Ofgem on the licence conditions
have done, what further powers those bodies have and to investigate
whether they feel that they need more powers, I am happy for us to do
so. We can get together to examine that idea in greater detail, between
now and the Report stage. If that would help hon.
Members&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I am hearing that
people would find it helpful, so I will endeavour to arrange such a
meeting so we can consider all those matters together.</div>
<a name="10012024000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his
amendment.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column357" />Column number: 357</div><a name="10012024000014"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012024000088"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> Those are some of the most helpful and positive
responses we have had.</div>
<a name="10012024000015"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012024000089"></a>Mr.

<a name="10012024000016"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012024000090"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I am not sure whether the Minister will want to
put that comment on his election manifesto, but we will see.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Laughter.</i><i class="I">]</i></div>
<a name="10012024000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister&#146;s words are very helpful. I saw assent from the
Conservative Members as well as from my hon. Friend the Member for
Harrogate and Knaresborough. I am sure that our colleague, the hon.
Member for Angus, would think the same about this suggestion. It is a
helpful way forward. There are clearly people who are disadvantaged. I
hope that, on that basis, there can be progress and I beg to ask leave
to withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="10012024000018"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012024000091"></a>Simon

which the customer pays their energy
bill&#146;.</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel0"><i class="I">This would
allow the Government to take into account differentials in charges
between prepay customers and direct debit customers when considering
the adjustment of charges to help disadvantaged
customers.</i></div><a name="10012024000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is the last of the amendments to this part of the Bill on Ofgem and it
returns to an issue that we have touched on before, so I need not
elaborate on it, other than very briefly.</div>
<a name="10012024000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
is about discrimination in relation to the method by which customers
pay their bill. We seek to amend clause 27 so that when the Secretary
of State comes to use the powers given to him by the clause, subject to
our clause stand part debate shortly, it would read as
follows:</div>
<a name="10012024000067"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State may make such assumptions and calculations as he or
she considers to be appropriate for the purposes of this section,
including assumptions and calculations to enable him or her to take
into account&#151;</div>
<a name="10012024000068"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a) different
charges for the same kind of energy,
or</div><a name="10012024000069"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
charges for different kinds of
energy.&#148;</div><a name="10012024000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
wish to add:</div>
<a name="10012024000070"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;or</div>
<a name="10012024000071"></a><div class="hs_brev">(c) the
method by which the customer pays their energy
bill&#146;.</div><a name="10012024000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the inequities is that there is a differential pricing system
depending on the way that someone pays their bill. Some people have all
the options; some people have some of the options. Those who have more
options have more choice and are less disadvantaged than those who,
because they do not have bank accounts or because they have had a
difficulty in the past and are required to have prepayment meters, have
much more limited options.</div>
<a name="10012024000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should be
grateful if the Minister would indicate whether he is willing to go
further than Ofgem has gone, to ensure that we move to a system whereby
someone&#146;s payment mode would not bring with it a price advantage
or disadvantage.</div>
<a name="10012024000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course, I
know that the utility companies find it easier and, therefore, cheaper
if people pay by direct debit&#151;that is obvious. They find it
easier, although it is more expensive for them, if people use the
prepayment method. It is easier in one sense in that they are
guaranteed the income. They find it more difficult to chase up 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column358" />Column number: 358</div>people who pay quarterly by cheque or by going to the post office or
whatever. It really would be a better system if we all knew that,
however we paid, it would be at the same rate. I should be grateful if
the Minister told us whether the Government are minded to go in that
direction.</div><a name="10012024000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012024000092"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> In preparation for dealing with this amendment I
received a briefing from my top-rate group of officials. They do an
excellent job, but even with all their assistance I still had
difficulty in capturing the argument about how many of those in fuel
poverty use a prepayment meter and how many of those who use prepayment
meters are in fuel poverty. My officials got me the 2007 figures for
England and I thought it would be useful to begin my response to this
amendment by setting them
out.</div><a name="10012024000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
of the people who use prepayment meters how many are in fuel poverty or
at risk of falling into it? Among gas customers, 2.2 million households
use prepayment meters. In the bottom 40 per cent. of income
distribution, 60 per cent. or 1.3 million households use a prepayment
meter and 47 per cent. use standard credit. In the top half of income
distribution, 600,000 households or 27 per cent. use a prepayment meter
and 40 per cent. pay by standard credit. There are not huge differences
between the figures. There were 2.9 million households in 2007 using
prepayment meters for electricity. In the bottom 40 per cent. of income
distribution, 60 per cent. or approximately 1.75 million use
a prepayment meter and 47 per cent. use standard credit. In the top
half income distribution, 29 per cent. or around 870,000 use a
prepayment meter and 43 per cent. pay by standard
credit.</div><a name="10012024000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Coming
at it from the other direction, how many people who are in fuel poverty
use a prepayment meter? Some 2.8 million households were in fuel
poverty in England in 2007. Of the electricity customers within that
2.8 million, 1.1 million paid by direct debit, 1.2 million
paid by standard credit and 500,000 paid by prepayment meter. So the
easy comment that the hon. Gentleman made&#151;I do not mean that as
a criticism because we all fall into this trap of saying that these are
the poorest most vulnerable customers&#151;is not borne out by the
figures.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012024000093"></a>Mr.
Willis:</b> They might
be.</div><a name="10012024000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012024000094"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> Indeed. Who knows which of the 2.8
million are the most severely impoverished? If 500,000 of the 2.8
million use a prepayment meter, clearly more than 2 million
who are fuel poor in this country are not paying by prepayment meter.
Of gas customers 900,000 pay by direct debit, another 900,000 pay by
standard credit and 400,000 pay by prepayment meter. That does not add
up to 2.8 million so 600,000 pay in other ways. I thought that those
two sets of statistics were useful to frame the
debate.</div>
<a name="10012024000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012024000095"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> That is really helpful. I am very grateful.
Obviously this will be in <i class="I">Hansard</i>, but perhaps the Minister
could let us have the tables at some stage. We have all been scribbling
furiously, but that would be helpful. May I ask for one clarification?
Does standard credit mean cheque, postal order or cash? I assume that
it does, but could the Minister confirm
that?</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column359" />Column number: 359</div><a name="10012024000077"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45
pm</div><a name="10012024000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012024000096"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> Standard credits refer to people who get a bill
and pay it. It could be by cheque; it could be that they get their bank
to send the payment; or they could go and pay the bill at the bank or
the post
office.</div><a name="10012024000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have one last statistic. It is not something that my officials got for
me specially; it was in the Ofgem probe. When it was investigating the
reason for the difference in what prepayment meter customers were
charged compared with other customers, and it said that some of the
charges were excessive, it asked what the cost-reflective amount of
prepayment meter was. Roughly, once it had stripped out the things that
it thought were not acceptable, it said that the cost was something
like &#163;88 per year. I do not want to place too much emphasis on a
particular amount because it will vary between customers and over time,
but I thought that a ballpark figure would be useful for our
discussion.</div><a name="10012024000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall now deal with the amendment. It would make it clear that the
powers for the Secretary of State to adjust charges to help
disadvantaged consumers would allow him to take into account payment
methods when calculating the level of disadvantage. In fact, clause 27
is sufficiently wide to enable the Secretary of State to take payment
methods into
account.</div><a name="10012024000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ofgem&#146;s
probe proved that campaigners were right that there had been some
scandalous examples of overcharging of prepayment meter customers in
the past. I count myself as having been one of those campaigners, when
I was a Back Bencher. As a result of Ofgem&#146;s finding and its
decision to act, there has been a transfer of value of &#163;96
million from suppliers to prepayment meter customers, and a new licence
condition that says that in future the only difference permitted by
Ofgem in its role as a regulator will be the actual cost of the payment
method.</div><a name="10012024000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
explanatory statement provided by the hon. Member for North Southwark
and Bermondsey makes it clear that the amendment aims to tackle the
tariff differentials between prepayment meter customers and direct
debit customers. I understand the concerns that have been raised, but I
am hesitant to agree that politicians substitute the view of the
suppliers and Ofgem with their own to that degree. Action has already
been taken to address price differentials that are not cost-reflective.
Ofgem&#146;s probe investigated the differentials that consumers paid
for different gas and electricity payment methods, and rooted out
differentials that did not reflect the differences in cost to the gas
and electricity suppliers of the different payment
methods.</div><a name="10012024000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
September 2009, Ofgem changed licence conditions, to ensure that
differences between payment methods are no more than broadly
cost-reflective, and in a recent report Ofgem stated that tariff
differentials for prepayment meter customers now reflect cost
differences, on average. Five out of the big six energy suppliers have
gone further and have equalised their prepayment tariffs with standard
credit tariffs on both gas and electricity. For example, the average
dual fuel prepayment customer now pays &#163;4 less than the average
standard credit dual fuel customer. That compares with a figure of
&#163;41 more in July 2008. It has been suggested that further action
is needed to equalise direct debit and prepayment meter tariffs. The
motivation is to help fuel-poor customers using prepayment meter
tariffs, which I would support. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column360" />Column number: 360</div>However, equalising tariffs in that way shifts where the costs of the
payment method fall, so that people on standard credit and direct debit
tariffs subsidise prepayment meter customers, as prepayment meters cost
more to provide. That might help the up to 20 per cent. of fuel-poor
people who use prepayment meters, but it would not help the around 80
per cent. of fuel-poor customers who are on standard credit or direct
debit tariffs. Fuel-poor customers on such tariffs&#151;we have
discovered that there are many such households&#151;would end up
subsidising prepayment meter
customers.</div><a name="10012024000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
fully agree that consumers should not suffer unjustified price
differences because of their payment method. I support Ofgem&#146;s
work in putting in place new rules to protect the consumer further, in
particular the proposal to clarify bills and require an annual
statement, and the prompt to switch, which will include a comparison of
the householder&#146;s tariff with the supplier&#146;s base monthly
direct debit tariff. All those moves should help consumers to
understand how to get a better deal on electricity and
gas.</div><a name="10012024000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
need to keep looking for improvements, to make the system work better
for consumers. We are legislating to give Ofgem improved enforcement
powers to strengthen consumer protection, and to make it clear that
Ofgem should address consumer detriment proactively, as and when it is
identified. In the coming years, the national roll-out of smart meters
will also give added impetus to removing all such
differentials.</div><a name="10012024000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
will continue working with Ofgem and the energy companies to ensure
that consumers, particularly the vulnerable, are given a fair deal, and
we will continue to push forward our other measures, such as the
introduction of the new social price support, to tackle more
effectively the wider problems of fuel poverty. Tackling fuel poverty
is not just about energy prices, of course; energy efficiency and
incomes must be addressed too. The Government are doing so through
programmes such as Warm Front and the winter fuel
allowance.</div><a name="10012024000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I said at the outset, the amendment is not necessary to give the
Secretary of State the power to do what the hon. Gentleman urges on me,
but I have explained my hesitation to commit to doing so. I have found
the debate useful in weighing the arguments for and against making the
difference, and I am sure it will remain a live issue if the clause
remains in the Bill when it becomes an Act and when we consult over the
summer on further measures to reach our shared objective of tackling
fuel poverty. In the circumstances, I ask the hon. Gentleman to
withdraw the amendment.</div>

me to answer one of them myself, but it would be helpful to put it on

payments. Will he put that on the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012024000099"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> Secondly, the Minister, in starting his reply and
before he went into the substance of the issue, said that he does not
believe that it is necessary to amend the Bill to give Ministers the
power to deal with differential payments if they want to. Will he
elaborate? I do not doubt what he says, but it would be helpful if he
could put it on the record for me and those who have not seen what
measures in the Bill or existing legislation give that
power.</div><a name="10012024000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012024000100"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> Subsection (6) refers to the customer&#146;s
charges, and the overall impact of subsection (1) and the assumptions
and calculations made in subsection (7) enable the Secretary
of State to determine whether charging people according to their method
of payment makes them disadvantaged
customers.</div>
<a name="10012024000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012024000101"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> That is helpful. Again, I do not doubt what the
Minister says. I will have a look at how the provisions work together.
I read them differently, but if that is the advice given, I am prepared
to accept that it is probably more likely to be right.</div>
<a name="10012024000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
substance, before I accept the Minister&#146;s request, the figures
that he gave were helpful. They are counterintuitive in many ways. I
think that we all started from an assumption about how many people in
lower income groups, or who pay more than 10p in the pound on fuel
bills, pay by forms such as direct debit. He said that it was probably
about 30 per cent. of the total, which is much higher than I expected.
I think that everybody else in the Committee probably had the same
view. The figures are useful, and we can all learn from them in ongoing
debates.</div>
<a name="10012024000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure
that I remember the Minister campaigning on the issue before he became
a Minister. I do not doubt his commitment. I urge him to keep
monitoring the issue to ensure that we minimise disadvantage and give
people the freedom to make and vary their choices without financial
penalty, depending on what works best for them. I am content that we
have made good progress, and I am grateful to him, his officials and
others for helping us. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="10012024000049"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012024000103"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Before I call Mr. Hendry, I
say to the Committee that shortly we will have been sitting for three
hours. I do not know for how long Committee members propose to go
tonight, but if they want to go much beyond 7, I will adjourn the
Committee for an hour for supper. Perhaps Committee members can work
out how they want to play
it.</div><a name="10012024000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012024000104"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> I can think of few more enjoyable ways to spend
your birthday evening, Mr. Atkinson, than by listening to
debate on clause 27 rumble on. There is a modest amount of debate still
to be had on the clause, and I think that significant progress will be
made after that. If you are minded to allow us to sit slightly beyond
7, and if that is the view of other Committee members, we can return
briefly to the subject to finish it on Thursday
morning.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column362" />Column number: 362</div><a name="10012024000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012024000105"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. I
may be wrong, but the advice that I received is that there might be a
vote at 7 in any event. Certainly, for our part, we will be content to
adjourn for today at 7 pm. I do not put pressure on the hon.
Member for Wealden. I am content for him to make the points that he
wants to make, if the Labour Whip is content, and I am sure that we can
co-operate fully for the beginning of the next
sitting.</div><a name="10012024000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012024000106"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> I am more than happy to proceed on that basis. I
may even finish before we reach 7 o&#146;clock, and it may be the
hon. Gentleman who is cut off in his prime as we debate clause stand
part.</div>
<a name="10012024000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
touched on some of the aspects of the clause which cause concern, and
on the fact that it does not seem to be good drafting, but a recipe for
confusion. The Government have not set out the groups that they
consider to be disadvantaged, which we should help in the Bill. It is
not clear whether that might be by geographical location, although it
could be. Therefore, it could relate to people who live in Scotland,
the north-west or other parts of the UK&#151;for example, in the
Minister&#146;s constituency&#151;who he could decide are
disadvantaged. It could relate to people who have waited nearly three
months before being advised that their tariff was being
changed&#151;there is a whole range of different categories of people
who could be helped by the clause, but it is so far from clear who the
Minister has in mind that it is rather difficult to work out what is
intended.</div><a name="10012024000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Also, the
whole background to the clause is rather inadequate. When the Ministers
before us were  giving evidence to the Committee, the Minister
of State
said:</div><a name="10012024000072"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
hope that when members of this Committee say, as they have been doing,
&#145;Let us have this and that and something else in the
Bill,&#146; they will have in mind the realities of this
parliamentary Session. It is important that the Bill&#146;s measures
get through, because they are real priorities and I believe that they
are shared priorities across the political
spectrum.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Energy

as a backstop for those kinds of
situations.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Energy

there is no urgency on the matter. The other power has been there since
2000, but it has never been used, and so far we have not been given a
compelling reason why this power needs to be introduced at this
stage.</div><a name="10012024000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
I think it is the nature of the clause that causes the greatest
concern, particularly that of subsection (7), which allows
the Secretary of State
to</div><a name="10012024000074"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;make
such assumptions and calculations as he or she considers to be
appropriate&#148;.</div><a name="10012024000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
the evidence sessions, Rupert Steele from ScottishPower told us
that</div><a name="10012024000075"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;there
is a clause that says that if the Secretary of State does not know any
data, he can make it up...It is clause

<div class="Column"><a name="Column363" />Column number: 363</div><a name="10012024000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, the nature of that aspect, the
immense amount of discretion and the way in which it is phrased simply
show that if there is no absolutely compelling evidence or a completely
factual basis, action can be taken in whichever way the Minister
considers
appropriate.</div><a name="10012024000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
were treated over Christmas, Mr. Atkinson&#151;I do not
know whether you saw it&#151;to a revival of many television
programmes, foremost among them being &#147;Not The Nine
O&#146;Clock News, 30 Years On&#148;. There was a wonderful moment
where Rowan Atkinson was berating a police officer for arresting
someone for being in possession of an offensive wife. He further went
on to charge him for walking through a built-up area wearing a loud
shirt. The ministerial approach is the same sort as the &#147;Not The
Nine O&#146;Clock News&#148;&#151;people are arrested for reasons
that could never be clarified. If we are going to have such powers put
into law, there has to be much greater clarity as to why they should be
used, and the basis on which they are going to be adopted 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column364" />Column number: 364</div>and developed. If we are not going to have institutionalised confusion,
we need to have a re-think of the
approach.</div><a name="10012024000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sarah
Harrison from Ofgem made it completely clear in her evidence that the
regulator could not act on such powers. It has to be evidence-based,
and it has to work on that basis, or else it simply cannot take action.
My great concern about the clause is that it gives Ministers the
ability to have draconian powers, having confusion between what their
powers are and what those of Ofgem are, and to act on the basis of
supposition and potential prejudice, rather than on the basis of fact.
I think we need much greater assurances from the Minister as to why the
approach should be
taken.</div><a name="10012024000065"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Ordered,</i>
