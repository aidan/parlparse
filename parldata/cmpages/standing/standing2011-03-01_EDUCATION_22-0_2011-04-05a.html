have had a good lunch and are raring to go for the final sitting of

                           <em>]</em> Some people
know how to make an entrance. I fully appreciate the eagerness of the
hon. Gentleman and the Committee to see the revised code. I acknowledge
that, ideally, it would have been better for the consultation to have
begun. However, our aim on the revision of the codes is to get them
right, and a huge amount of work has gone into revising, drafting and
slimming down the codes. But I will make a concession to the hon.
Gentleman that goes further than his
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000051">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause will bring objections to admission arrangements for academies
within the remit of the schools adjudicator. In so doing, the intention
is to ensure parity and consistency between the objections processed in
relation to admissions to maintained schools and academies. I am
certain that the provision enjoys broad support inside and outside the
House.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000052">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment seeks to prescribe the range of potential objectors to the
admission arrangements for academies in primary legislation. We touched
on that during our debate on clause 34, and I am happy to reiterate and
expand on what I said then to the Committee. I can reassure the hon.
Gentleman on our intentions about who can object to schools’
admissions policies. The purpose behind the clause is to ensure parity
in the complaints system between maintained schools and academies, and
to provide consistency for parents. Therefore, the range of objectors
will be the same for both maintained

			Column number: 932<a class="bkMark" name="Column932">&#160;</a>
                           </div>schools and academies, and the clause will give us the power to make the
appropriate regulations to achieve
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000053">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
are two issues to deal with on the amendment. First, should the
objectors be set out in the Bill? We do not believe that that is
necessary; it can be better done through regulations. Secondly, on the
specific groups named by the hon. Gentleman, we strongly agree with the
spirit of the amendment and that those listed should be able to object
to admission arrangements for academies, as they should to those for
maintained schools. I assure him that those groups will be included in
the regulations. Indeed, we intend to go further than his amendment and
to broaden the range of potential objectors to admissions arrangements
at both maintained schools and academies. We are currently considering
how wide to go in the
regulations.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000054">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for moving the amendment and for
helping us to find common ground on what is quite a contentious issue
over admissions. With those assurances and given that we intend to go
further than his amendment, I hope that he will withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000055">&#160;</a>

Mr Walker. I hope that you enjoyed your baked potato with tuna as much

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
thank the Minister for his response. As I said in my earlier remarks,
it is welcome that the Government will introduce the measure for
academies. What he said in his remarks about parity is also welcome. I
reiterate that, if we are to have such an approach on academies, an
across-the-board level playing field is probably sensible. If it were
possible to amend the Bill in a holistic way that achieved that parity
and that level playing field across the piece for all academies, it
would be better, where it is the intention of the Government to make
provisions in the funding agreements, to have them in the Bill. That
would be a much tidier way of achieving a genuinely level playing field
without there being any doubt about it, but it is welcome that
admissions are coming in in this way in the
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000057">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister referred back to clause 34. I will not repeat the debate we
had on clause 34 except to say that we are still concerned about the
watering down of the school adjudicator’s role in relation to
admissions and, as I said earlier, that is something to which we might
return later. I am glad that the Minister said he strongly agreed with
the spirit of our amendment and that he wanted to achieve it in
regulation and perhaps even go further. That is a welcome concession,
if he wants to call it that; certainly a welcome observation on his
part.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000058">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Good afternoon to you, Mr Walker, and to the rest
of the Committee. We now come to the abolition of the Young
People’s Learning Agency for England. As I see it—the
Minister may want to clarify matters for me—the new education
funding agency, which is taking in a number of functions from various
organisations, including the YPLA, will be responsible for three broad
things that the YPLA used to be responsible for. The first is providing
money for the 16 to 19 sector. The second is administering financial
support for students; this was previously in the form of education
maintenance allowance, but that is no longer the case, because we have
had a massive reduction in funding for that and we now have the much
reduced bursary scheme. The third, which is something which will be
growing with increased corporate attention, is support for
academies.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000066">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Within
this last category—again, the Minister can contradict me if I am
incorrect—the new agency will be responsible for calculating the
grant to academies, will undertake a performance management and
monitoring role and provide a more general supporting role for
academies. Given the expansion in the academies programme that this
Government want to see, that is a massive ask for the new agency. I
very much question the capability and capacity of the Department and,
through the Department, the new agency, to do this without substantial
increases in
resources.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000067">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
reaching this conclusion I cite two points from the Public Accounts
Committee’s investigation of the academies programme, which, if
I were the Minister, would give me huge cause for concern. First, as
the academies programme expands there is an increased risk to value for
money and the proper use of public money, and secondly, there is the
YPLA’s struggle with administration and monitoring for the
relatively small number of academies to date. It may also be worth
putting on the record what the Public Accounts Committee said about the
differences between this Government’s approach and the previous
Government’s attitude to academies. It
said:<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000068">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
overall success of the sponsored academies partly reflects the earlier
Programme’s clear objective to ‘raise standards of
education in some of the toughest, most difficult areas in the

original objectives and measures of success no longer fully reflect its
aims.”<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000524">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
our oral evidence session, the chief executive of the YPLA admitted the
difficulties that the new agency will face given the expansion of the
academies programme. In response to a question asked by my hon. Friend
the Member for Cardiff West, the chief executive, in classic Sir
Humphrey language,
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000069">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p>The
impact assessment accompanying the White Paper acknowledged that the
YPLA had had an efficient delivery model. Of its budget of £9.5
billion, £48 million was used on administration. That is 0.505%
of the total budget, indicating remarkable efficiency. Some efficient
private sector organisations would give its eye teeth for a similar
percentage on administration. Will the Minister guarantee that the new
executive agency will match those figures, which show unparalleled
excellent value for money? If so, will he tell us how he will do it?
The impact assessment is incredibly vague, concluding by
saying:<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000070">&#160;</a>

the growing academies programme. As the model is a new one, how does
the Minister suppose that the agency will acquire the expertise for
dealing with the model? Will he buy it in? How on earth will he make
sure? The amendments seek to probe the Minister’s thinking on
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000073">&#160;</a>

require the Secretary of State to produce a report for Parliament
before he commences the provisions in the Bill to abolish the Young
People’s Learning Agency. It might be helpful if I begin by
briefly setting out our approach to the education funding system and
our proposed changes. In doing so, I hope to provide the hon. Gentleman
with the reassurance on the issues that his amendment
raises.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000075">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
the White Paper, we said that we will replace the YPLA and set up a new
education funding agency as an executive agency within the Department
for Education. From April 2012, the EFA will bring together the

			Column number: 935<a class="bkMark" name="Column935">&#160;</a>
                           </div>Department’s existing responsibilities for funding maintained
primary and secondary schools via local authorities with the
YPLA’s responsibilities for funding 16 to 19 education,
academies and free schools. All that will be brought together under the
EFA. We will have a single body responsible for distributing around
£50 billion of education funding for three to
19-year-olds. It will continue the key funding functions that are
currently the responsibilities of the Department and the YPLA. Also, as
an executive agency within the Department, it will be directly
accountable to Ministers and Parliament.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000076">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman’s amendment suggests that he is concerned that we do
not lose the skills, expertise and effective practices of the YPLA in
making those changes. I share those concerns and can offer him the
reassurance that, in replacing the YPLA, we are not throwing the baby
out with the bath water. Indeed, let me put it on the record that we
are very grateful to the YPLA’s staff, its chief executive, its
chair and its board for their hard work over the past twelve months.
The YPLA has played an important role in supporting the expansion of
our academies programme and in the provision of 16-19 education. We
believe, as the hon. Gentleman said, that the YPLA is an efficient
organisation, but, like any arm’s length body, it requires its
own back office functions—for example, human resources, finance
and legal advice. By bringing all the arm’s length
bodies—those that conduct policy or administrative
functions—into the Department, there will be access to those
shared
services.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000077">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
64 and schedule 16 of the Bill enable the transfer of YPLA staff and
property to the Department—to the new executive agency, the
education funding agency. We anticipate that the large majority of YPLA
staff will take the opportunity to transfer and will
work alongside their departmental colleagues in the new single agency.
I hope that reassures the hon. Gentleman that we have taken adequate
steps to ensure that the EFA has both the capacity and expertise to
carry out its important functions. With this resource in place, the EFA
will be in a strong position to hit the ground running, building on the
best practices of its predecessors so that we have an effective and
efficient funding system that is fully accountable.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000078">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman’s amendment probes the arrangements for the funding,
commissioning and maintenance of standards of 16 to 19 education and
funding for academies. Let me briefly set out our position on each of
those. On funding, I can confirm that the EFA is likely to operate a
system close to the current one, with an annual 16 to 19 funding
statement and accompanying guidance. For academies, the EFA will
continue with the current arrangements that require an individual
funding agreement between the Secretary of State and each academy.
Members of the Committee will be aware that the Government do not share
our predecessors’ enthusiasm to oversee commissioning
arrangements for 16-19 education. As such, we withdrew the national
commissioning framework last year, and we are clear that identifying
and meeting need in local areas is a matter for local authorities and
their partners rather than for central Government.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000080">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Similarly, on
standards, the White Paper describes a successful education system as
one in which schools and colleges have a strong degree of autonomy
alongside clear lines of accountability. As we set out in the White
Paper, the role for national Government is to look at ways of
publishing data in a more transparent way to allow parents and students
to compare the different 16 to 19
providers.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000081">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Hartlepool asked about performance management of
academies. We are clear that the focus of the education funding agency
must be on its core purpose of funding and finance. It will not be
responsible for issues such as school improvement or monitoring failing
schools. That function will take place within the Department itself. I
hope that I have reassured the hon. Gentleman and that he will
therefore withdraw his
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000082">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister has not reassured me on the central
point that I tried to raise when I spoke to the amendments. The YPLA
does excellent work, and I echo what the Minister said about the
fantastic professionalism of all the staff, the board, the chairman and
the chief executive. But given the new role in which, as the Minister
said, there will be individual funding agreements not only for a couple
of hundred academies but potentially thousands, that is a major
administrative and logistical nightmare. He has not really said
anything about how we will have the expertise and capability to be able
to fulfil that role efficiently and responsibly. I hope that he will be
able to provide me with that reassurance, because it is an important
point. The Public Accounts Committee had already criticised to some
extent the body’s ability to be able to manage and monitor the
academies programme. When it is increased severalfold, it will be a
major plank of the Government’s education policy and it will
fail if it is not put in place
effectively.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000083">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am happy to respond to the hon. Gentleman’s
points. Under his Administration’s direction of travel, the YPLA
would have been the body that not only administered the funding
arrangements of the academies but it would also have conducted
monitoring and other functions. Nevertheless, the previous Government
also intended to expand the academies programme, and all the issues
that he raises would have applied to that policy, albeit that they went
at a slightly slower pace than this Government are proceeding at. We
have ensured that the education funding agency is a specialist agency
relating to accountancy and funding, so it will take all the expertise
in that area from the YPLA and it will become a specialist body full of
people with the best qualifications in the world, as he and I
know—accountants. I hope that we will have a number of
accountants working for the education funding agency, who will then be
able to require a level of expertise in delivering funding for the
whole of education from 3 to 19. Having expertise is how we deliver
efficiencies.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000084">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
will also be consulting on arrangements to replace the complex
calculations of academies’ grants, which are not sustainable, as
the hon. Gentleman hinted, with the expanding number of academies. That
is something on which we will be consulting shortly. With those two
issues together, it will be an efficient way of dealing with what could
be a very complex issue.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000085">&#160;</a>

evolution in future, if large numbers of primaries take up academy
status and were not to become parts of chains or firm federations?
Perhaps there might be bodies between the Secretary of State and those
primary schools. Will he say a little more on that, as Peter Lauener,
the chief executive of the Young People’s Learning Agency, was
cut off by the bell when I was questioning him about it during the
witness

                           </strong> As I mentioned earlier, we will be consulting on
arrangements to replace the complex calculation of academies’
funding, which will deal with the funding arrangements. I understand my
hon. Friend’s point. When there are many hundreds, if not
thousands, of schools that have become academies, simply administering
the funding arrangements will be complex. Simplifying the formula is a
key component of trying to introduce streamlined efficiencies into that
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11040670000009">&#160;</a>

oversight is concerned, even now the Department will be monitoring any
school that falls below the floor standards. School improvement
processes within the Department existed before the election and will
continue to do so under this Administration. We will keep all these
matters under review. Section 11 of the Academies Act 2010 asks us to
report annually on the academies programme. The kind of issues raised
by my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness will be
addressed in the report. That is something that we are keeping under
review, to see whether we can continue to administer, oversee and
distribute the funding in an efficient way when the number of academies
increases beyond 500. My hon. Friend is right to raise the issues but I
am confident that we will be able to handle that challenge. If not, we
will keep the matter under
review.<a class="bkMark" name="11040670000010">&#160;</a>

extraordinarily effective and efficient organisation. The Minister has
not provided me with any reassurance. I will give notice that I do not
intend to divide the Committee on the amendment, but I think I share
the concern of the Chair of the Select Committee, whose body language
indicates that he is not convinced either. We have an efficient
organisation. Frankly, the Secretary of State and his ministerial team
will have to throw money at the new system to ensure that it works.

                        <p>That
is not “may” or “should consider”, but
“must”. That is a level of centralisation. Why is that
the case? Why must a local authority have regard? Given what the
Minister said earlier, about local authorities and local people making
local decisions according to their circumstances, how does this
schedule coincide with the rhetoric of localism? Will the Minister
concede that such definitive language may place a burden on the local
authority that cannot be realised, whether that be financially,
practically or some other way, which then leaves the local authority
exposed to a legal challenge?<a class="bkMark" name="11040670000021">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I am not
unreasonable; it is fair that a local authority, as a matter of course,
would routinely consider guidance from the Secretary of State, to
assist with local decision making and to have some consistency with
national policies and priorities. I would question, however, whether
they must be obliged to. That is the context of amendment 236, which
would remove that requirement from the schedule. I hope that the
Minister will provide a reassuring explanation as to why the schedule
is part of the

2 amends the 1996 Act to reflect that change of responsibilities. It
does not impose any additional bureaucracy or regulatory requirements
on local authorities; it simply takes account of the fact that from
April 2012, the guidance will be the responsibility of the EFA.
“Must have regard” is the usual statutory phrasing, but
it does not mean that local authorities must follow the guidance
slavishly. They can depart from it if they have good, justifiable
reason to do so. The current guidance was published by the YPLA in
December 2010 and is available to the Committee on the web. With those
few words of reassurance, I hope the hon. Gentleman will be persuaded
to withdraw the amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11040670000024">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I want briefly to ask a number of questions. I can
understand fully the Government’s intentions behind this
particular aspect of the Bill. I have found E101 very helpful in
setting out further detail.<a class="bkMark" name="11040670000041">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Could the
Minister provide a little more detail? I think he will share our
intention on this side of the House to ensure that young people have
the best possible start to their career, in terms of training and
skills and access to the job market. How does the ending of this
apprenticeship offer help encourage that? Youth unemployment is at an
all-time high as a result of the global recession; young people find it
difficult to get

                           </div>access to the job market when there is an available pool of experienced
former employees. What further help will the Government be providing? I
understand the Minister’s commitment to
apprenticeships—that is not in doubt. However, I am concerned
that the prospects for young people of getting a job are as bleak as
they have been for a generation. We must avoid the prospect of a lost
generation. How does this clause help to do
that?<a class="bkMark" name="11040670000042">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Member for Hartlepool will know that the
difference between what is being proposed and what existed previously
is that we are not withdrawing the offer; we are amending it. The offer
we are making is that anyone who secures an apprenticeship will be
funded—hence amendment 65 tabled by my hon. Friend the Member
for Beverley and Holderness, to which I spoke when I rose
last.<a class="bkMark" name="11040670000043">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We think that
that offer is realistic. For the sake of brevity and clarity I will not
say much more, other than that the offer as it stood was less
realistic. To say that everyone is entitled to an apprenticeship
ignores the salient fact that, if they are anything, apprenticeships
are jobs. Employers must be engaged and must offer a job: if an
apprenticeship is less than that, it is not worthy of its name. We are
determined that apprenticeship should be properly linked to employment.
So we wanted to recreate an offer that was real and deliverable, and
did what it said on the label.<a class="bkMark" name="11040670000044">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I accept the
argument put by the hon. Member for Cardiff West that the existing
offer gave a bit of a poke to the system. Not his most elegant phrase,
but none the less it made the point. I take the argument that by
raising the profile of apprenticeships, as the last Government did,
they assisted the business of establishing apprenticeships as pivotal
to skills. I think the hon. Gentleman would want to acknowledge, in
similar vein, that we have not only taken up that baton but run with it
pretty hard since our election, in terms of funding, advocacy and
engagement.<a class="bkMark" name="11040670000045">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We are
looking to build the number of apprenticeships and of employers
involved with them, and the number of opportunities at all levels and
ages. I hope to be able to report to the House accordingly. So I think
it is about making the offer real, rather than in any way diminishing
the significance of apprenticeships. I think that everything else we
have done makes that
clear.<a class="bkMark" name="11040670000046">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I understand fully where the Minister is coming
from. I agree with a lot of what he says. However, in terms of ensuring
that the apprenticeship offer is a real and valid one, one of the
levers at the Minister’s disposal in a way that the private
sector might not be, is public sector apprenticeships. He has been
curiously silent on the possibility of such apprenticeships. There was
nothing about that in the Budget a couple of weeks ago.<a class="bkMark" name="11040670000047">&#160;</a>

work that my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff West did on public

good foundation on which the Minister could build. Given the
difficulties in the job market at the moment, could not the public
sector step up to the plate here?<a class="bkMark" name="11040670000048">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Yes. The hon. Gentleman is right. It would be wrong
if we did not emphasise the important part that public sector
apprenticeships have to play in achieving the ambitions that I
described. The ambition is straightforward: I want there to be more
apprenticeships in Britain than we have ever had before. That will
include apprenticeships in small businesses, in large organisations and
in the public and private sectors. The hon. Gentleman will understand
that at times of restraint, things are quite tough in parts of the
public sector. None of us hides from that. Nevertheless, there is more
that can be done.<a class="bkMark" name="11040670000049">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I have
written to all Government Departments asking them what they are doing.
I have pushed the idea—I do not claim it is new and I think the
previous Government took a similar view—that every Department
should have an apprenticeship champion. I have written to all Members
of Parliament saying that they should play their part. Indeed, many of
them have either taken on an apprentice or are looking to do so. The
changes to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority
rules—one of the few bright lights emerging from
IPSA—have made that more straightforward. Lots of things are
happening around public apprenticeships. The Department of Health has
allocated £10 million to NHS apprenticeship programmes to create
6,000 new NHS apprenticeships. Even in these tough times, we are not
neglecting the public
sector.<a class="bkMark" name="11040670000050">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful to the Minister for mentioning the
NHS. I have to pay tribute to my right hon. Friend the Member for Leigh
(Andy Burnham). When he was Secretary of State for Health he really
pushed the prospect of apprenticeships in the health service and that
was very welcome. My question is simple: how many additional public
sector apprenticeships does the Minister think will be in place this
time next
year?<a class="bkMark" name="11040670000051">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> As a former Minister, the hon. Gentleman will know
that it would be inappropriate for me to set a target on the hoof, or
even to set a target at all in those terms. Apprenticeships are a
feature of economic change. They are a feature of employer engagement.
Employers in the public sector need to be encouraged. We need to look
at the burdens and barriers. We need to look at the bureaucracy that
surrounds apprenticeships. We need to facilitate the process. We need
to market apprenticeships. We need to encourage learners. We need to do
so much. That is why the Government have committed to the resources
necessary to fund the training. We are working closely with the
National Apprenticeship Service to market the product. We are
delivering a firm and enthusiastic message to colleges and private
training providers.<a class="bkMark" name="11040670000052">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am putting
in place all the necessary measures, the ingredients to grow
apprenticeships to record levels. I do not want to be in the business
of dictating how many apprenticeships there should be across each
Department. That would be out of step with the Government’s
approach. We have a more organic view of these things. Get the
components right, remove the obstacles and I am confident the system
will grow and the hon. Gentleman will be able to judge me on that. When
the figures come to the House he will say—he will be the first
in the queue because he is a very assiduous shadow Minister, and long
may he remain so—“Has the Minister delivered

considered and purposeful application of work and encouragement in this
sector? Although I recognise that the belief of Opposition Members is
genuine, it was only in the last spluttering hours of the 13 years of
the Labour Government that the number of apprenticeships in the public
sector started to rise. The record of apprenticeships in the public
sector was dire until very near the end, when there was a late push. We
need consistency if we are to ensure that every sector—from
small businesses right through to the public sector—plays a part
in ensuring that we do not have a lost generation, members of which
were inherited by this Government in record numbers when they came to
power.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000135">&#160;</a>

closed-minded at all about the levers that we might be able to use to

memorandum E 99 on clause 66 incredibly helpful, so I thank the

macro-economic policy: to deal with deficit; and to invest in
infrastructure. Infrastructure and investment are often characterised
as being about plant and machinery, but they are also about human

are in agreement with the need to provide guidance. We propose that the
directions and guidance will recommend a maximum of 10 days from the
receipt of an application for an apprenticeship certificate being
issued. It is also intended that there will be a process for handling
complaints relating to those matters. We chose not to set out such
detail as duties under the Bill for obvious reasons: we wanted to allow
sufficient flexibility in the instance of unforeseen circumstances. The
Committee will understand that such detail would not be appropriate. As
my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness has recognised in
his amendment, however, it would be sensible to change official
guidance to cover such matters, and we shall do so. On that basis, I
hope that he will not press his amendment to a Division. Perhaps I can
persuade him absolutely of that, without equivocation, by dealing with
his points about a competitive apprenticeship market. The Secretary of
State will designate one body as a certifying authority, so there will
not be a competitive market for issuing apprenticeship certificates,
which I know was the worry that lay behind his
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000158">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
certificating authority will be required to issue a certificate if an
apprentice meets all the completion criteria set out in the framework.
There will be one English apprentice certificate of high quality, with
strong and consistent branding. The branding of apprenticeships is
critical to their aesthetic, and their aesthetic is at the heart of our
determination to drive up the appreciation of practical and craft
skills. I want the branding of 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 948<a class="bkMark" name="Column948">&#160;</a>
                           </div>apprenticeships to be much more in those terms. Like the branding of
academic qualifications, I want it to enjoy all the riches of the
academic aesthetic. To that end, the amendments are useful in giving us
the opportunity to make that clear. Fees for issuing the certificates
and copy certificates will operate on a non-profit basis that will be
set down in
regulations.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000159">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
the point that the hon. Member for Hartlepool made about sectors, and
sector skills councils in particular, I know that the Opposition and I
share a deep passion for ensuring standards across the whole gamut of
the programme. The hon. Gentleman will see that the measures that have
been taken by the Government—I have already mentioned standards
and prestige, as well as money and numbers—are about all that.
It is not only about quantity but about quality. That quality must be
seen to be what it is: the highest kind of competencies conferred on
people with the right kind of aesthetic. Part of that is about
standards and the specification of apprenticeship standards.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000160">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There are
those who say that it is impossible to grow the numbers and improve the
standards, but I disagree fundamentally. I agree with the TUC about
this. It said that there could never be a guarantee of an
apprenticeship for young people because apprenticeships are jobs. The
Government cannot create jobs or tell employers whom to recruit as
apprentices. Unless the standards are high enough, employers will not
engage, because they will not think that this is a qualification of
merit, and learners will not engage either.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000161">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is right
that we channel this through the conduit of sectors, and sector skills
councils in particular. The Government have contributed to the work of
raising standards with the help of the sector skills councils by
issuing a new statutory document, but we have also crowned it with
other measures to boost the status and aesthetic of apprenticeships. We
already have a good record on the emphasis that we have placed on
apprenticeships, but I suspect that the hon. Gentleman and others will
require greater assurance. I have set out some of the topics that we
intend to be covered in the certification directions and guidance to be
issued by the Secretary of State, but I am happy to say on record that
all certificates, no matter what body issues them, will have to contain
specific and standardised features. That is a requirement of section 11
of the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009, as the
hon. Gentleman knows. We will not in any sense dilute or diminish the
standards to which he is alluding, and I guess that the determination
to maintain standards lies behind amendment 237.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000162">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If hon.
Members will allow me the privilege of going further still, there is a
threat, which I am sure was not the Opposition’s intention, that
that amendment could limit the full range of issues that the guidance
could cover. We are interested not only in certificates but in the
process of certification, which we intend that the guidance will deal
with. If the Bill stated that the guidance would focus on standards,
other elements that the guidance could cover such as time scale,
timeliness and the complaints procedure that I have mentioned could be
ignored.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000163">&#160;</a>

maintaining the provision of standards as set out in section 11 of the
2009 Act is welcome, as is his commitment to provide guidance. He might
have said this already, in which case I apologise to the Committee, but
do we know when the guidance will be issued? Is it imminent? Will that
be soon—perhaps spring? It would be useful to find that
out.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000166">&#160;</a>

notion that standards in apprenticeships have to be maintained? The
brand needs to be of extremely high quality to provide reassurance for
employers, parents and learners. It would be useful if we could work
together on that particular point. I do not think that the Minister is
receiving any inspiration at the moment, but it would be useful if he
could tell us, as soon as possible, when he thinks guidance could be

but I think that he will recognise—regardless of which side of
the Committee he is on—that the Bill does centralise an awful
lot of power into the hands of the Secretary of State. Some 50-odd
powers are being transferred—or centralised, or whatever we want
to call it—to a single authority, which is a matter of concern.
Given the concerns that there have been about parliamentary scrutiny on
a whole range of issues, including holding the Executive to account
through written parliamentary questions and Ministers’ responses
to letters, it is right that the Opposition should voice their concern.
Will the Minister set out the safeguards that he will put in place to
monitor what happens under the clause in practice?<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000179">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We also have
concerns that giving the Secretary of State power to direct the chief
executive to consult with specific people effectively means that the
Secretary of State can decide who to include and who to exclude, which
risks injecting political bias into the process. What safeguards will
be put in place to prevent that, and how will the decisions be
scrutinised? In theory, the clause does not stop chief executives
carrying out other forms of consultation in addition to those that they
are directed to carry out by the Secretary of State. Have I interpreted
that correctly? How does the Minister think that will work in practice?
Will the majority of those consulted be involved as a result of
directions by the Secretary of State, or will the Secretary of State
only use the power in exceptional circumstances, with the chief
executive picking the majority of those consulted, on the majority of
occasions? Some clarity on whether and when the Secretary of State
would use the power would be helpful. I hope that the Minister can
respond
reassuringly.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000180">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I think that I can deal with that very quickly. The
hon. Gentleman is right that the clause provides a power for the
Secretary of State to direct the chief executive of the Skills Funding
Agency to consult specified people on matters associated with the
exercise of the chief executive’s function. That builds on the
Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009. The clause
does not prohibit current consultation, or any consultation that the
chief executive of the Skills Funding Agency might think appropriate,
but it adds powers to encourage wider consultation. It is not a
prohibitive power; it is permissive, and should be
welcomed.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000181">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I shall explain
why. The chief executive of the Skills Funding Agency exercises a
number of important functions, as the hon. Gentleman will understand.
This is as good an occasion as any on which to make a case for
politicians, and for Ministers, who are answerable to Committees such
as this one, and to Parliament. Ministers, accountable to their
electorate and to the House, hold the key to representing the
people’s interests. I would not want the people who run agencies
not to be encouraged by Ministers, when appropriate, to consult more
widely than they otherwise might do. I am not suggesting that the chief
executive of the Skills Funding Agency does not currently
consult—of course he does—but the extra emphasis on
consultation implicit in this part of the Bill is surely welcome,
particularly when it comes from an elected Minister, rather than an
official. I see this as a chance to champion the role of politicians in
the process. I believe in politics and politicians, and I believe that
they add
value.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000182">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">A
Secretary of State might feel that a consultation should be widened
because of its sensitivity and the circumstances associated with it.
Ministers should be in a position to make a decision on the basis of
either their judgment or information that they receive from a Member of
the House, a Select Committee or a shadow Minister. All those groups
and individuals have a right to suggest to a Minister that a
consultation should be widened, and this part of the Bill allows that
opportunity.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000183">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Is there anything in current legislation to stop
that happening now? I always ask myself when scrutinising the Bill:
what added value is this clause providing? The Minister pointed out
that the chief executive of the Skills Funding Agency already consults.
Has he noticed anything negative in the 11 months that he has been a
Minister to warrant the inclusion of such a clause? I do not see why it
is necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000184">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I think it is important that stakeholders feel that
they could approach Ministers with a view about consultation, which
Ministers could then pass on to the chief executive of the Skills
Funding Agency through a direction. The provision does not create an
additional burden on the chief executive. The purpose is merely to
provide legislative backing to ensure that proper and regular
consultation with stakeholders does take place, and to enable the
Secretary of State to offer a steer on that. It is not that I have
particular concerns; it is just a matter of principle. As I have said,
through Ministers, the House and the Government should be able to
exercise a role in encouraging the widest possible consultation when
and where
appropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000185">&#160;</a>

88 of the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009, and
brings into effect the proposals in the Minister’s skills
strategy document, so that the entitlement to fee remission for a first
full vocational qualification at level 2 and a specified qualification
at level 3 is restricted to those aged over 19 and under 24. The
purpose of amendments 238 and 239 is to stop those

concerns that the Bill discriminates against disabled
learners:<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000191">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“Too
often disabled learners take longer than their non-disabled peers to
gain qualifications if they are able to pass. First, disabled learners
may want to leave education earlier than their non-disabled peers in
order to train for employment. Disabled learners often leave school
because they find school more challenging than others, either because
of the level of work required or because their learning needs are not
always consistently
met”.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000534">&#160;</a>

the Minister address those concerns, and will the Government consider

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman is right to point out that the
subject was rehearsed in the Government’s skills strategy,
published last November. I recommend it to anyone who has not studied
it in detail, as I have been obliged to do. The essence of the
amendments—indeed, of this part of the Bill—is to look
again at entitlements. The truth, as he knows, is that we are in a very
different place from the one that we were in when the entitlements were
introduced. The simple fact is that in the skills strategy, we have to
address the financial circumstances implicit in the comprehensive
spending review, which took place in parallel with the development of
our skills strategy. I was absolutely determined that the skills
strategy should be not merely a response to changed economic and
financial circumstances, but a fresh look at how we manage and fund
skills, and who pays for
what.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000194">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
question of who pays for what has pervaded the debate about skills for
as long as I have been interested in the subject, and no satisfactory
answer has really been provided. I wanted to begin to provide an
answer. The debate about entitlements needs to be seen in that context.
The fact is that in the current fiscal climate we simply cannot fund
everything that, in ideal terms,  we would like to. We had to
look hard at priorities, and it is critical, in our view, that public
investment is 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 953<a class="bkMark" name="Column953">&#160;</a>
                           </div>focused where its impact can be maximised—on individuals who
would not otherwise have training, and where the market failures are
strongest. Those individuals are young adults and those with poor
levels of literacy and numeracy. If we are to fund fully those who need
it most, as well as support sustainable levels of adult participation,
there needs to be a change in the balance between what Government fully
funds, and where costs are shared between Government and other
agencies, particularly business and
learners.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000195">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
is why we have said that we will fully fund a first specified
vocational qualification at level 2 for learners who are 19 or over but
under 24, and co-fund those for learners who are 24 years old or over.
Sharing costs in that way enables us to retain capacity for learner
places at level 2 despite an overall budget reduction. We considered
carefully at what point we should maintain full funding at level 3,
bearing in mind that that is where returns to the learner, in terms of
the subsequent income premium that they might enjoy as a result of
their acquisition of skill, is higher.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000196">&#160;</a>

aged 25 and over are already expected to contribute more towards the
cost of their training; we propose lowering that to those aged 24 and
over. That change is necessary to support our wider package of changes,
in which we will move away from grant-funded provision for learners
aged 24 and over who are undertaking a level 3 qualification to a more
progressive free loan system, which will provide up-front support to
enable learners to continue to undertake advanced and higher-level
training.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000197">&#160;</a>

19 to 24 years old will continue to be entitled to full fee remission
for their first specified level 3 qualification, in line
with our commitment to focus funding on young adults and the
low-skilled. We had to make a judgment on where we focused the
available funding. Level 3 learners should enjoy the same circumstances
as students in higher education over the age of 25, on the basis that
we know that the income premium that a level 3 apprentice enjoys once
they have gained their apprenticeship is roughly equivalent to that of
a graduate. Similarly, in terms of getting and keeping a job, they are
as well off as a graduate. The return on their investment of time seems
to be the
greatest.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000198">&#160;</a>

it is not strictly relevant to the amendments, it is important to say
that I wanted to protect basic skills provision and adult and community
learning, as I believe that they in particular support learners who are
most disadvantaged, and provide important bridges into further learning
and acquisition of skills. To do that, we needed to look at the
entitlement that previously existed. That is the essence of what we
tried to do. It can be justified and legitimised in the circumstances
that we now face. I appreciate that there may be differences of nuance
between those on either side of the Committee on the issue, but I think
the shadow Ministers would acknowledge that, had they been returned to
Government, they would have faced similar circumstances and would have
had to look at the entitlements carefully themselves.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000199">&#160;</a>

straitened financial times in which the Department is operating; that

to fund and manage skills through a sectoral mechanism of the kind we
talked about a few moments ago, and those who see the management of
funding skills on a more spatial basis. The origins of some of the
specified bodies dealt with in the amendment formed around a view of
skills that I do not share. Skills should be funded and managed
sectorally. Of course, that is not to say that there is no geographical
dimension. Clearly, local authorities, through their economic
development function, will have an absolute need to engage with skills
systems. Similarly, we would want to encourage local enterprise
partnerships to do so. However, the funding and management of skills
should not be out of step with the structure, form and character of the
economy, which is essentially sectoral rather than geographical. That
is not to say that different areas do not have different economic
profiles; of course, they do. In essence, however, skills in an economy
need to be transportable and defined around purpose rather than around
where they are gained and
used.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000208">&#160;</a>

dominated by intermediary bodies, formed around the idea—I do
not accuse the hon. Gentleman of thinking this—that they might
command and control the supply of and demand for skills. I am talking
about a much more skeletal arrangement for funding and management that
is more dynamic and responsive. Some of the bodies that would be
retained if we accepted the amendment—it is an allusion to the
employment and skills boards and other intermediate bodies in London
and elsewhere that previously prevailed—would create clutter and
bureaucracy, making the system less responsive and
dynamic.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000210">&#160;</a>

Bill will free providers and trading organisations to respond with what
employers and learners want, without some of that bureaucracy. In
essence, formal powers of control are not necessary; they add to the
bureaucratic burden. Although I understand the intention behind the
amendment, the experience of recent years has been that those bodies,
while well intentioned and not without some value, in the end, in net
terms, created a bureaucratic system that bemused employers and
confused
learners.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000211">&#160;</a>

deals with raising the participation age, which is one of the most
historic educational initiatives in this country over the past century.
Ensuring that people stay on in training or education until the age of
18 has been mooted since the Lloyd George coalition. It took a Labour
Government to put it in place. What concerns me about the clause is
that, in terms of enforcement, which is probably the wrong
word—rather, in terms of compliance, or ensuring that raising
the participation age is complied with—it is being watered down
dramatically.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000220">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 241
would halt that watering down by allowing for a number of provisions to
be brought into force by order of the Secretary of State. Those include
provisions covering duties on schools and local authorities to support
the rise in the participation age, and on creating a duty to provide
information to ensure compliance and attendance—for example, the
duty on an institution to notify the local authority when it has
evidence that a young person is not complying with their duty to
participate. There are provisions creating an obligation on employers
to make appropriate arrangements for young people to continue attending
courses while in employment, and provisions allowing parenting orders
or contracts to be put in place where a young person is not
compliant.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000221">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I can name
many organisations—Barnardo’s, in particular—that
welcome the increase in the participation age for education and
training because they feel that that will help to develop technical and
vocational expertise to ensure that the future skills requirements of
this country’s economy are met. I have real concerns that the
clause waters down the provisions on raising the participation age, so
I ask the Minister to consider accepting the

raising the participation age to 17 in 2013, and to 18 in 2015. Members
of the Committee know as well as I do that continuing in education or
training past the age of 16 means that young people are more likely to
obtain higher qualifications, have increased earnings over their
lifetime, be in better health and have improved social skills. In turn,
it contributes to a more highly-skilled, productive and internationally
competitive work
force.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000223">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Through
clause 39, we are returning some sections of the Education and Skills
Act 2008 to the more usual position, whereby they can be commenced at a
time to be decided by the Secretary of State, rather than at a date set
out in statute. That will allow us to delay commencement of the
enforcement process associated with raising the participation age. We
are determined to avoid young people and parents being subject to that
process when it is not appropriate. The hon. Member for Hartlepool
initially referred to it as an enforcement process, then changed the
word to “compliance”, which sounds softer and gentler.
Actually, it is rigorous, and it involves enforcement through severe
processes.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000224">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
are committed to reviewing the need for the enforcement process for
pupils and parents annually. If, at a later date, we consider it
appropriate to commence those powers, we will, but enforcement will
always be the very last resort. It is our intention to commence, by
order, the duties on local authorities and employers in 2013 and in
2015.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000225">&#160;</a>

Criminalising young people for failure of engagement and acting against

bear that in mind. We must encourage and enthuse people to carry on in

enforcement mechanisms, unless all else had

pithily than I did. He is right. We aspire to achieve full
participation, but without enforcement. We want young people to
participate because they recognise the benefits that it will bring and
because our reforms to education and training will create a system that
caters for the needs and aspirations of every young person, not only
most of them.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000227">&#160;</a>

frankly not had the publicity that I thought that it would. I imagine
that that is because it is tagged, somewhat incongruously, on to an
education Bill, and I will discuss whether that is the appropriate
legislative vehicle in a moment. With your permission, Mr Walker, I
want to speak to new clause 14 first, because that sets the scene for
the problems that the Government have placed themselves in. In so
doing, and with your advice and guidance, I hope that we might be able
to dispense with the clause stand part, but I will accept your judgment

70 amends the powers given to the Secretary of State in the Teaching
and Higher Education Act 1998 to make regulations setting interest
rates. As the legislation stands, section 22 of the 1998 Act provides
that the interest rates set must be no higher than the rate required to
maintain the value of the loan in real terms and must not exceed the
specified rate for low-interest loans. Clause 70 gives the Secretary of
State wide and substantial powers to set interest rates. It moves the
policy of the Government away from zero rates of real interest to one
where the real interest rate would be 3% above RPI. I alluded to this
earlier, but quite what that has to do with a Bill that makes
provisions about education, child care, apprenticeships and training is
beyond me. The Minister can perhaps let us know—either here, or
if you are so inclined, Mr Walker, in a clause stand part
debate—why these provisions are contained in a Bill that is
predominantly about schools and pre-19

me, think that perhaps the Government hope to sneak the measure through
quietly without the publicity that he mentioned? On a day when the
vice-chancellor of the university of Central Lancashire rang me to say
that it, along with many other universities up and down the country,
would be charging the maximum of £9,000 a year in fees, does
this not fly in the face of the £6,000 that was discussed? It

                           </strong> My hon. Friend makes an extremely good point. The
Government are trying to sweep this under the carpet and do it with as
little fuss as possible. Understandably, the trebling of tuition fees
from the current level up to £9,000 has received more coverage
than the interest rates set on the loans, but I still think that the
real rate of interest will act as a barrier for bright kids from
poorer backgrounds contemplating
university.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000238">&#160;</a>

we need to. Under the new system, the monthly payment will be lower and
the lowest-earning 25% will pay less. In terms of progressiveness, the
new initiative is better than the previous system. Whatever the
political benefits of the shadow Minister saying the opposite and
talking about tripled fees when most people will not even pay it all
back, I would urge him to see that this is a more progressive
system—whether it is affordable is a different matter—and
there is no reason why it should put off anyone from a lower-income
background from going into higher education. I wish that people like
him would stop saying so, stop scaring people off and stop delivering
precisely the ill that he says that the scheme does when it is actually
the scaremongering of people like
him.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000239">&#160;</a>

got that off his chest, but he is wrong. It is not progressive, it will
put people off and I am not scaremongering. It will be a high level of
debt, which will be repaid over a longer period of 25 to 30 years and
the interest paid will not be kept at a steady level to maintain the
real value and to ensure that it would essentially be a zero rate of
interest. Instead, it will be 3 percentage points above the
RPI, which is currently running incredibly high. Surely the Chair of
the Select Committee believes that that will act as a massive
disincentive to people who are contemplating going to university in the
next year or
so.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000240">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It is a strange kind of debt that is written off
at the end of 30 years or if someone ceases to work, and where they do
not have to pay anything if they earn less than £21,000 or if
they have children and they are not working. It is debt, but not as we
know it. It is an undergraduate tax on earnings above £21,000.
Only higher earners pay it. If someone starts as a new teacher earning
an average £21,500 starting salary, they will pay some £4
a month. The message that the hon. Gentleman is sending out to young
people, putting them off with scaremongering, is irresponsible and not

that, as it stands, those who get into debt and negotiate an individual
voluntary arrangement, as a way of managing their debts, are
increasingly unable to include those debts in those IVAs? One of the
consequences of increasing the interest rate will be that more people
will face unsustainable repayments, which will impact on their other
debts. As we are seeing an explosion in personal debt, that could be a

point, in regard to not only clause 70, but the whole business model of
higher education funding that the Department for Business, Innovation
and Skills is putting in place. There is a strong relationship between
the level of fees charged, the interest rate on loans, as in clause 70,
the amount of money that is available from the Government to higher
education for research funding and student numbers.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000250">&#160;</a>

would agree that incorrect assumptions about any particular aspect of
that business model will have huge implications for other parts of that
model, to the detriment of social mobility—as I said
earlier—to the viability of the university sector and to this
country’s ability to exploit the knowledge economy of the 21st
century and to be a leading economic power in the globalised world,
which we all want to see. Get one aspect wrong or one assumption of the
model incorrect, such as average fee levels, and the whole system comes
crashing down. It has become increasingly apparent that the Government
have their sums wrong. The policy, which the Minister might
acknowledge, is in complete and utter disarray.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000251">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In doing their
sums for HE funding, implicit in which is the level of real interest
that will be charged on the loan, the Government made a clear
assumption that average fee levels would be £7,500 per annum.
However, we all know now that that assumption is widely out of kilter.

Doncaster North (Edward Miliband), when questioning the Prime Minister
last Wednesday, stated that 78% of higher education
institutions—18 out of 23—have announced that their
proposed tuition fees will not be £6,000, not the average

                           </div>assumption of £7,500, but the maximum possible of £9,000.
The latest universities to announce their fee levels for 2012 in the
past few days include the university of Central Lancashire, located in
the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Preston, the Royal
Agricultural college and Kent university, all of which plan to charge
£9,000. It seems clear that the highest possible level for fees,
£9,000, is not the exception, as the Government suggested, but
the norm. That makes the Government’s model, including the
points in clause 70 about interest rates, completely and
utterly unsustainable.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000252">&#160;</a>

going to charge because the amount that a university charges depends on
its satisfying the access requirements. That has not been done. The

made exactly that point. Until that matter is resolved, we cannot

It is my understanding that the access tsar, or whatever one wants to
call him, said that he does not have the power to say to higher
education institutions that want to charge £9,000, “I am
not happy with what you have said on widening access, so I demand that
you reduce your fees in accordance to what I think.” Is that
correct? Has he got the power to do

                           </strong> I acknowledge that universities are independent
institutions, but the reform of student finance that follows the
recommendations of the Browne report makes it clear that there is a
relationship between fees and access. Browne’s terms of
reference, about which I shall talk at length later, stipulated that
the considerations around the funding of universities should be tied to
considerations around widening participation. It has been made clear
that assumptions about that will be built into the issues that the hon.

universities made to me is that they cannot simply, particularly in the
case of Sheffield Hallam, afford to look cavalierly at not charging
£9,000. They are looking at it carefully, because if they do
not, with the withdrawal by the Government of the teaching fund, they
will simply lose thousands of pounds, which will mean that they cannot
keep their world-class
status.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000261">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is a fair point. Universities are under two
pressures. The first, as my hon. Friend states quite rightly, is the
dramatic cut in public funding to higher education institutions as a
result of the business model. The second is the perception of the
quality of the brand. If a university—Sheffield Hallam,
Sheffield university or whatever—charges £6,000 and its
rival in the city charges £9,000, does that send a message to
potential undergraduates that that university is inferior to others
elsewhere? Universities have to grapple with

                        <p class="tabbed">Let me go on
to the business model, because I want to explore the accounting
techniques—I can hear the groans as I speak. The Government pay
student tuition fees to the institution and then recoup the money from
the students once they have graduated and are earning more than
£21,000. In Government accounting terms, the so-called resource
accounting and budgeting, or RAB, classes the subsidy element as the
face value of loans in any one year, less the present value of future
repayments. That is known as the RAB charge.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000265">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Government
think they have played a rather clever trick by looking as if they have
reduced DEL—the so-called departmental expenditure
limit—by keeping only the RAB charge in that DEL. In so doing,
BIS Ministers can look like very good boys with the Treasury, everyone
gets promoted and everyone feels better about themselves. However, the
model fails to take into account the assumption we discussed regarding
average fee levels.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000266">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The higher the
average fee level, the higher the average fee loan, and that increases
public spending in two fundamental ways. First, rather obviously, as
the face value of loans rises, the total value increases. Secondly,
with a larger loan, the likelihood that graduates repay the debt in
full is reduced, so the present value of future 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 963<a class="bkMark" name="Column963">&#160;</a>
                           </div>repayments goes down. The Department’s exposure and the risk of
higher public spending are therefore dramatically increased.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000267">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If the average
fee is higher than the Government assumed in their calculation, as it
clearly seems to be, that will have a number of consequences, and the
clause will make matters worse in the wake of that chaos. In the medium
term, a higher average fee might mean—the Minister might provide
a degree of clarity on this—that that the real rate of interest
charged to graduates will have to rise quite sharply, and the clause
allows that to happen. More immediately, it might mean that student
numbers will have to be cut still further, on top of the 10,000
reduction in places that the Government have already announced.
Equally, it might result in a cut in research funding, which would mean
that this country would find it difficult to compete with the best
research institutions in the world. As I said, I hope that the Minister
will give an indication of which options—whether a rise in the
interest rate, cuts in student numbers or cuts to the research
budget—are being
considered.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000268">&#160;</a>

                        <p>There is a massive hole
in the higher education budget as a result of the Government’s
assumptions. What is interesting is that in its revised outlook in
March 2011, just a few weeks ago in the run-up to the Budget, the OBR
did not revise its assumptions. I think that is for two reasons. First,
it thinks that institutions which propose £9,000 fees are the
exception. We can now conclude fairly decisively that that is an
unrealistic assumption. Secondly, it assumes that the DEL will be held.
That means that if the Department’s calculations are
wrong—they seem to be very wrong—the effects will have to
be either rises in interest rates charged to students, or cuts to
student numbers, or reductions in the research grant, or a combination
of all three. Which is it going to
be?<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000272">&#160;</a>

obtained from the Library by my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow West
(Mr Thomas), who shadows the Government on universities, show what
these options will mean. To keep on track with public spending targets
the Library calculates that an assumed fee loan of £8,500, which
is now looking increasingly likely, would place additional pressure on
the public finances of about £870 million. This would require a
real interest rate of 4.1% to keep public spending constant.
Clause 70 allows that to happen. For an assumed fee loan of
the maximum permitted—£9,000—real interest rates
would

			Column number: 964<a class="bkMark" name="Column964">&#160;</a>
                           </div>have to be 5.2%. Given the current high rate of RPI, this is bound to
provide an additional important and very often overlooked barrier to
many students who wish to go to university.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000273">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In the context
of all that, new clause 14 would allow Parliament to consider these
matters fully and to express an opinion as to the suitability of the
Government’s plans, the assumptions and the policy decisions.
The report proposed in the new clause would include important
information relating to the cost of student loans and the impact to
public finances of the financial support as set out in the revised
section 22 of the 1998 Act. That brings me to the other amendments in
the
group.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000274">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am sure the Minister will agree that for something as important and
fundamental as this it is vital that we have effective and close
parliamentary scrutiny of the Secretary of State’s plans for
interest rates. Amendment 244 amends section 42 of the Teaching and
Higher Education Act 1998 to ensure that parliamentary scrutiny cannot
take place for any changes to interest rates by the Secretary of State
without consideration in and resolution by both Houses of Parliament. I
hope the Minister will look favourably on this matter. In doing so,
will he give a commitment to ensure that such a resolution is taken on
the Floor of the House with the entire House as the Committee? That
seems fair, given the precedent for fee levels that we had last
November or December and given the huge importance of the issue and the
obvious interest that hon. Members across the House will have on the
matter.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000275">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
245 would make it clear that those from more privileged backgrounds
cannot jump the queue by paying off loans early. The amendment would
insert an additional subsection into the 1998 Act and impose on a
borrower conditions on which an outstanding amount can be repaid in
advance of the due date. In responding to the publication of the Browne
review, the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills said
that he was minded to impose a charge for early repayments but this has
not been included in the Bill. The Bill’s equalities impact
assessment does not mention the provisions relating to student loans
and tuition fees at all, which I think is a disgrace. It would be
helpful if the Minister would tell us why that is the case. It is a
probing amendment to test the Government’s current thinking on
the matter given what the Secretary of State said then.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000276">&#160;</a>

debates that we had in the House on the very broad principles, except
to say that it is appropriate to do so, as the hon. Gentleman did, to
set the amendments in their proper place. To that end, there is now
broad acceptance that Governments of any persuasion would need to
consider how to fund higher education. That was certainly the case for
the previous Government, which is why they established the Browne
review. Lord Mandelson, who was the Minister responsible, said that the
review<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000281">&#160;</a>

                        <p>In
establishing the Browne review, it was clear that the previous
Government anticipated the change in contribution made by learners that
Browne ultimately recommended. Lord Mandelson hinted at a tuition fee
rise five months before the review was launched in July 2009. He told
vice-chancellors that excellence in education was “not
cheap” and that the country had

                        <p>As
I said, the review had its genesis in the period before we came to
power. The terms of reference make it absolutely clear that the review
should
analyse<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000285">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p>The
review was explicit about the fact that that balance needed to be
reconsidered in the light of changing circumstances. I am sure the hon.
Gentleman, with his customary diligence, will draw the
Committee’s attention to the matter if I do not, so perhaps I
should say that, like him, I had my doubts when tuition fees were first
considered by Parliament. I wondered, as he wonders now, whether it was
likely that the advent of tuition fees would have an effect on
participation by under-represented groups in higher education. I
wondered whether working class aspirant students might be deterred from
engagement in higher education. Indeed, I was a member of the shadow
Cabinet when it was Conservative party policy to oppose fees, but the
events that have since occurred demonstrate that my fears have been
unrealised and prove that they were probably as exaggerated as his are
now.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000286">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
understand the instincts that lead the hon. Gentleman to his
conclusion. I understand the sentiment that informs those instincts. I
understand the passion that he brings to these matters, as he, like me,
believes in widening participation in higher education. Indeed, among
Browne’s terms of reference was an explicit consideration of the
need to ensure that participation was broadened to those who do not
typically enjoy the benefits of higher education that he and I and
others Committee members have
enjoyed.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000287">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
context is one of a general acknowledgement that we need to look at
these things afresh; an assumption that that fresh thinking will lead
to a change in the balance of payments from individuals, graduates and
others, and Government. It is a context in which a review was conducted
at length, drawing on expertise from across the sector. No one would
deny that the

                           </div>Browne review was a thorough piece of work by an
eminent gentleman that provides the context of a measured and
considered response from the Government, which
balances the progressive instincts that I have attributed to the hon.
Gentleman and, with appropriate humility, attribute to myself, and
which the Chairman of the Select Committee championed in typically
robust style in his contribution, with the need to ensure that
universities are adequately funded if they are to continue to compete
with the best universities in the world. Few would deny that that is
the context. The hon. Gentleman’s amendments,
properly argued, need to be debated
against that
background.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000288">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman is right in this sense: that the
scale of the problem is rather different. It may be also true that the
detail—we should look at the measure in some detail, as the
helpful amendments allow us to do so—may be different. However,
the principle is not different, and it was established once we took the
view—and I was a sceptic—that the contribution of
graduates was a key component of the way in which we funded higher
education. The previous Government took that view. We established an
important precedent for what has subsequently
happened.<a class="bkMark" name="11040675000001">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We now find ourselves in a
situation in which universities need more funds if they are to continue
to develop and to excel. Government is faced with economic difficulties
of a broader kind, partly as a result of the poisonous legacy of the
previous regime. The Browne review reported against that backdrop; we
did not commission Lord Browne to carry out his work. It is
likely—and I said this in respect of another matter—that
had the party of which the hon. Gentleman is a
member formed a Government who faced the Browne recommendations, it
would have to make tough decisions about what universities charged,
what students paid, and what interest rates prevailed. Those matters
are not peculiar to this Government. They concern a broader set of
considerations which affect all those interested in measured and
reasonable public
policy.<a class="bkMark" name="">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank the Minister for his generosity in
giving way again. I remember that my vice-chancellor and the president
of my local student union were opposed to the £3,000 increase at
the time, even though that was additional investment, on top of an
increased grant from central Government. The aim of the charges is not
to increase investment or to improve the quality of teaching. I heard
from my vice-chancellor this morning that the £9,000 is just to
provide the same quality of service that would have been there had the
teaching grant not been reduced. The context under the previous
Government was about increasing the quality of provision, not just
cutting Government
spending.<a class="bkMark" name="11040675000002">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> There are two caveats to make. The first is that,
inevitably, as students become more like—I will not say

                           </div>importance of learning; learning is not like buying baked
beans—but certainly as they become more consumeriste, if I can
put it in those terms, it is likely that they will make appropriate
judgments about the quality of the teaching and learning in which they
are investing. I hope that that different dynamic will encourage a new
concentration on the quality of teaching and learning in our
institutions of higher education. Indeed, my right hon. Friend the
Minister for Universities and Science shares my view. It is something
that we have discussed many times. We are determined that the student
experience and the nature of the learning experience that people in
higher education enjoy should be refreshed by the changes in finance
that we are now debating. We will happily consider those matters when
we publish our White Paper which will, of course, address some of those
important
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11040675000003">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> No, no; the hon. Member for Hartlepool has moved
from a poke to a prompt, gracefully and seamlessly, and I will address
the points that he made. Amendment 244 seeks to make any and all
regulations made by the Secretary of State under section 22 of the
Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998 subject to affirmative
procedure—the hon. Gentleman spoke to that. I understand his
concerns about the Secretary of State’s regulation-making power
with regard to interest rates on education loans. That is a sensitive
subject and one which the Government have considered very
carefully.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000295">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
the hon. Gentleman knows, negative procedures provide Parliament with
the opportunity to scrutinise regulations, should it wish to do so.
That has always been the case with higher education and, I believe,
provides a clear and suitable level of parliamentary scrutiny. The hon.
Gentleman may feel that this is a fallback debating point, but none the
less, it needs to be made. The previous Government considered these
matters in very similar circumstances, and took the same view that I
have just articulated. If it was good enough 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 968<a class="bkMark" name="Column968">&#160;</a>
                           </div>previously, it is arguably good enough now, given what I said about the
principle that was established on student
finance.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000296">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman will, however, seek further assurances about the
Government’s intentions on transparent scrutiny as a result of
our action to bring indicative regulations to the Committee. He
mentioned that they were circulated last week. They clearly show our
intentions on charging real rates of interest, and they informed part
of his contribution. However, this amendment goes further by imposing a
requirement for an affirmative procedure for interest rates, extending
it to all regulations made by the Secretary of State with regard to
financial support to students in further and higher education. In my
view, that is pretty excessive, and it puts further pressures on time
and resources to which I do not think that previous Governments would
have been happy to accede. In giving clarity about our intentions and
following the procedures adopted by the previous Government, and in our
approach to setting out our broader vision in the higher education
White Paper, which will clearly be subject to the scrutiny of the House
when it is published, we will provide maximum opportunity for
consideration of such matters by Parliament. The amendment should
therefore be
resisted.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000297">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
have a few other things to say because, to use his phrase, given his
body language, the hon. Gentleman clearly does not look impressed. I
want to go into some detail about whether the system is financially
robust and can stand up to the effect on overall Government finances.
However, before I do so, I want say a little about amendment 245, which
would give the Secretary of State a power to impose conditions on
student loan repayments made in advance of the term date. I again
understand why the hon. Gentleman expressed such worries and I
sympathise with the intent of the amendment, but it is not the right
time to introduce conditions on loan
borrowers.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000298">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have made it clear that it is our intention to consult on repayment
mechanisms for student loan borrowers in due course, and it is right
that we conclude the consultation and take account of the views of all
concerned before we conclude whether or not any charge will apply and,
if so, how that charge may be calculated and applied. I give the hon.
Gentleman a commitment that there will indeed be proper consultation
before a decision is made on that subject. It will be a balanced and
open-minded process because, like him, I consider that that matter must
be made absolutely clear for all sorts of reasons that I do not need to
rehearse, but which are implicit. Given what I have said, I hope that I

open and transparent, but in most cases, the information that he
seeks—and much more—has already been published in several

reports by the Government of all the items suggested in the proposal

finances should be reviewed independently by the Office for Budget
Responsibility. Indeed, that office is independent, as the hon.
Gentleman knows, and it will offer its own analysis, which will again
add to the panoply of sources of information that will meet the
requirement that his amendment would elicit. The proposal seeks reports
on the lifetime costs to borrowers of student loans. We can report
fully on the lifetime costs of loans only after they have been fully
repaid because, by its nature, that is a retrospective process. Before
that, we could rely only on models and forecasts of graduate earnings,
which depend on assumptions about the character of what graduates might
do, what they might earn, and on earnings more
generally.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000301">&#160;</a>

the cost of student loans to people considering higher education to be

since no one receives a student loan unless they have already applied

much value would be added by the hon. Gentleman’s amendment. He
made a number of other specific points, and I want to do them justice.
His core point was about the net effect of the kind of fees that
universities might charge. I shall say two things about that. I can

substantially, I think that the hon. Member for Hartlepool ignores the
effect on unit costs of where, how and when people study. Mr Walker,
you will remember as your memory is elephantine, that Lord Mandelson,
the then Minister responsible for these matters, flirted with the idea
of different models for degree courses: modular degrees, shorter degree
programmes, an emphasis on different access points and modes of
learning. I have two responses to that. Those who study my work closely

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 970<a class="bkMark" name="Column970">&#160;</a>
                           </div>will know that it has long been my contention that by far the best way
of widening access to higher education is by exploring those kinds of
possibilities. Access is far more likely to be widened by making the
patterns and rhythms of study match the patterns and rhythms of more
people’s lives than by any other means. That is why what Lord
Browne said about part-time study was welcomed across the House. If we
can change orthodox assumptions about where, how and when people engage
in higher education, we can broaden access significantly and relatively
quickly.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000308">&#160;</a>

Paper will explore those matters. I am determined—and I commit
my right hon. Friend the Minister for Universities and Science to this,
too—that the White Paper should explore in depth the provision
of higher education in further education, which has been a
preoccupation of mine for a long time, and the growth of which has been
inhibited by all kinds of factors. It is absolutely right that we
should celebrate the work already done by further education, but we
should look at ways in which that can be grown, enabling many more
people to take advantage of the opportunities that higher learning
provides.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000309">&#160;</a>

of the part-time schemes, but they have been around a long time,
through accumulation, access and transfer schemes, in universities such
as the Open university. They have offered a valid route into higher
education for many students, albeit mainly older or returning
students—those who are 25-plus. Our concern, which I am sure the
Minister shares, is for younger students from poorer
families—those who are 18, losing EMAs and facing massive
increases in tuition fees. We are concerned that those students now
have much less of a route into higher
education.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000310">&#160;</a>

intervention which, as ever, was thoughtful and based on experience. I
was not restricting my remarks about different kinds of provision and
points of access to mature students, although I agree with her implicit
support for engaging more older learners. A growth of mature students
would be welcome, given the need to upskill and reskill, which the hon.
Member for Cardiff West identified in a different part of our
consideration. Higher learning is very much a part of that.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000311">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Finding other
ways for younger students to engage, however, would provide an
opportunity for those who typically do not carry their learning on into
HE. Frankly, the existing system, despite the well-intentioned policies
of successive Governments, has not been as effective as it might have
been in widening access. Whatever we might want to think and hope to
claim, we have not made enough progress on providing the breadth of
access to higher education that I—and the hon. Lady, I am
sure—would like. Alan Milburn makes the point in his report that
if learning is one of the key tools to deliver social mobility and,
ultimately, social justice, we have singularly failed to take advantage
of it by engineering a better future for many of our fellow
countrymen.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000312">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I was not
thinking only of mature learners in relation to changing assumptions
around modes of learning and access points to learning; I was thinking
about all learners. In a nutshell, the experiences of Birkbeck and the

get accustomed to using that word in something other than a pejorative
sense now that we are tied up, but it does not come easily to
me—in our approach to viewing such matters.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000313">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">That
determination changes some of the assumptions around unit costs, too. I
am not sure that the previous Government considered that, which is why
there is demand for all these kinds of kites. The hon. Member for
Hartlepool has talked about part-time degrees, shorter degree courses
and modular degrees. I am sure that he did so because he was starting
to think about some of the costs associated with HE, as well as the
driving ambition to broaden its scope and
reach.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000314">&#160;</a>

me say something about some of the other details that the hon.
Gentleman raised. I do not go only as far as people expect me to; I go
one stage further in my desire to be regarded as the most responsive
Minister in the Government—I do not mean to be unkind to the
Minister of State, Department for Education, my hon. Friend the Member
for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. In addition, therefore, to what I
have said about early repayment, we will make a full impact assessment
available when we have considered the matter on the back of the
consultation that I have described. When we have drawn more
conclusions, we will happily look at the matter with the kind of
piercing empiricism that lies at the heart of the hon.
Gentleman’s scrutiny of such matters.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000315">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I want to draw
the hon. Gentleman’s attention to the Business, Innovation and
Skills Committee inquiry into the future of higher education, which is
considering many of the issues that he has raised. The Bill, in the
end, is about legislation—Bills, by their nature, are about
legislation; that is why we are here—but the broader canvass
that he painted will be for the consideration of the Select
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000316">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman made the assumption not only that the unit cost of
higher education was not affected by some of the things that I said do
affect it—namely its form and character, its place, and where
and when it is taught—but, implicitly, that there was a direct
relationship between the cost and the headline price published by a
university. We know that not all students take up the full loan, and we
have no reason to assume that that will not continue to be the case.
Many universities have said that they plan to offer fee waivers,
discounts and/or bursaries to a significant number of students, in
particular those from lower income backgrounds. That was precisely why
I intervened on the hon. Gentleman with a caveat about the relationship
between fees and access, not only for individual students, but in
respect of the impact of the entire package. The balance of the
relationship changes the assumptions about the total costs to the
Exchequer of the extent of participation that he and we seek. One needs
to be careful about making an assumption about a direct relationship
between headline price and cost, because that changes the average cost.
Once the average cost changes, the cost to the Department is changed in
the way that has been
described.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000317">&#160;</a>

course the two things have a correlation, which the hon. Lady is right

described—surely she recognises that. If a number of
institutions choose to charge different amounts because of the detail
of what they offer—I began to explore some of those details
earlier—and/or to recycle some of the funds in the way in which
I also described, the relationship that might ostensibly be seen as a
direct one becomes rather less direct. That was my

the provision of HE in different places and forms, but the other thing
at which we need to look is new entrants to the market and what effect
they will have on price and cost. The hon. Gentleman is right to say
that the state of the market at the beginning will not necessarily
characterise the state of the market as it matures, and we could have a

considerations that I described, and on getting the fees signed off, as
the Deputy Prime Minister said today. However, he is ignoring all the
other variables that I tried to introduce into the debate. Those
variables will have a profound effect on the character of the overall

we want higher education to continue to play the important part it
plays in so many ways—socially, economically and so on—we
need to look at new ways of funding it, which is precisely why we began
to look at such matters alongside the then Government. It was why the

do and the average emerges, however, it is hard to come to any
definitive judgments about the scale of that gap and how it might be
filled. The provisions in the Bill that we are debating are part of a
package. The first part of the package was to look at the tuition fee
changes, which we did last December, as the hon. Lady will recall. The
second part is to introduce progressive rates of interest, which is
what we are now doing. The third part is to contextualise that in a
White Paper that will begin to explore and give rise to the
implementation of broader changes to the character and nature of higher
education. There is no secret about that. The shape and character of
our education will change, but I do not think that that is just about

£9,000. The Minister is obviously well aware of that, yet he
still insists on not knowing until the last university has announced
its price. Is he implying that the Minister for Universities and

what they will charge. A minority have published so far, but hon.
Members should not forget that that is a self-selecting minority. The
universities that have already made clear what they will charge include
those that one might expect to be at the upper end of the charging
regime, so in addition to those universities being a minority, they are
not necessarily a representative sample. It would be hard to reach
definitive conclusions about the effect that that would have
collectively on the state of public finances, and rather irresponsible
to do so. It is absolutely right that we should give those matters due
consideration, but only when we have all the data before us, and that
is not what the Bill is about. That is not what the Bill asks the
Committee to do and it is not what it asks Parliament to do. That is
not its purpose, and I am only setting this in context for the
following reasons: it is important that we do so as part of proper
scrutiny; I enjoy these important debates, as do you, Mr Walker; and

about the second part of my question? Is it a consideration that the

broadcast the fact that the fees charged will perhaps relate to the
quality of the product offered. That is why I said very clearly that
there has to be a relationship between what those who become
consumeriste pay and what they get. That is a message that I am very
happy to amplify here, and I know that the Minister for Universities
and Science and the Secretary of State will want to amplify that too.
It is right that what is charged needs to be legitimised. Furthermore,
there is an issue about how we assess the proper requirements that were
set in motion by the Browne review as regards access and what people
charge. Again, the Deputy PM—this is the third time that I have
said it—made it clear today that it is right that we do not
ignore that aspect of Browne. As the hon. Gentleman will know, it was
in Browne’s terms of reference that we should do just that. Lord
Browne was told that his consideration should include broadening
access. I refer the hon. Gentleman to the terms of reference, which
referred to the<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000338">&#160;</a>

in saying that we should not see fees outside that context. I certainly
would not want that, and I would use any influence I could bring to
bear on my Department or university to make that clear. I am just as
passionate as the hon. Gentleman about ensuring that all those who have
the aspiration and ability to benefit from higher education should have

the present Government, which was that the new Government “are

small repayments did not see the balance of their loan increase. But
the Government are not putting that in place. They are ensuring that we
have a free-for-all when it comes to the real interest rate. The

Durkan</strong> (Foyle) (SDLP):<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000731">&#160;</a>
                           </span> I listened carefully to the
Minister’s discourse on the clause and the amendments, and find
myself in total agreement with what the shadow Minister said. It was
interesting to hear the Minister talk about
“consumeriste”; I thought it was a new constituency. It
was also interesting to hear him profess his belief in ministerial
bigamy as a two-Department man, and give us the imagery of Lord
Mandelson flirting with different models, which was another interesting
image to the mind.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000349">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On the
substantive concerns, the Minister seems to be saying,
“Don’t worry about it,” and that we will not know
about the questions that we are asking ourselves until it happens, and
therefore we may be reassured. However, that is no basis on which
legislators can pass legislation. We cannot simply rely on what Lord
Browne said in his report when it comes to discharging our
responsibilities on what we put or do not put into law and on the
public finances. In an earlier intervention, the Chair of the Education
Committee made the argument that no one was going to have to pay any
serious amounts of money, and yet somehow all sorts of money would get
into universities. In a revealing point, he said that the question
whether it is affordable is an entirely different one.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000350">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">When the
chickens come home to roost and the question of affordability confronts
people in the future, what is going to give? Will it be the commitments
and implied guarantees that people will not have to pay serious amounts
of money back, or the case that no university is able to charge high
fees? Will the quality of student support and reliefs and waivers in
repayments go, as a way of meeting the question of
affordability?<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000351">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Earlier
in the Bill’s proceedings, there were questions about
institutions and religious education. In my constituency, a famous
priest who was visiting one of the Catholic schools in his area one day
regaled a class with a key point on Catholic doctrine. The priest,
Father Desmond Mullan, had serious chest and throat difficulties and a
bit of a rural accent, and spoke in an indistinct manner. When he had
finished his treatise on that particular aspect of Catholic doctrine,
one brave student put up his hand and said, “Father, I could not
understand that. Could you just repeat that again?” Father
Mullan said, “You’re not supposed to understand;
it’s a mystery.” Certainly, I feel that the way in which
the Minister has tried to deal with these amendments is very much in
the realms of “You’re not supposed to understand;
it’s a mystery.” I am not assured at all, and I do not
think that the worries of hon. Members have been
dispelled.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000352">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I want to bring light out of darkness. I cannot
resist that challenge. This is not about the mystery of faith; it is
about the certainty of a Bill that sets out certain powers. The powers
do not determine the rate of interest so they do not relate to the gap
that the hon. Member for Walthamstow has spoken about or to the overall
budgetary impact. They simply give powers to set those matters
according to regulations in which the details that the shadow Minister,
the hon. Member for Hartlepool, has described, and that the hon. Member

                           </strong> I thank the Minister for that effort, but it does
nothing to mitigate any of the basic concerns or questions about the
impact of the financial implications on students and their families. It
does not address the key questions that have been asked regarding the
higher education finance model and the impact on public finances into
the future. As legislators, hon. Members are right to pursue these
sorts of amendments to frisk the Government for something more solid by
way of reliable plans and assurances. Bland assurances that the changes
will not seriously cost people in real-life terms simply do not add
up.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000354">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I have said enough. If that can ever be so, it is
so now. I repeat that we are not voting for a particular rate of
interest, but for a facility by which Government would make that rate
of interest clear by regulation according to circumstances. That would
be the inevitable path that any Government that was dealing with such
matters would pursue. On that basis, even at this late stage the hon.
Member for Hartlepool should think again about his
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000355">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I shall be brief. As I understand it, the clause
allows the Secretary of State to cap the amount that higher education
institutions can charge part-time students in fees, as is now possible
in relation to full-time courses. The Secretary of State will be able
to specify the amounts that can be charged for part-time courses in
regulations. I have only one question: when the Secretary of State
wishes to bring forward regulations on part-time fees, will the
Minister commit to him doing this on the Floor of the House, by an
affirmative resolution, as was the case with full-time fees in December
last year? He admitted that this is an important consideration that
demands the full attention of the House. It would be useful for this to
be done through the affirmative procedure, on the Floor of the
House.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000399">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I have a few brief questions and points in relation
to part-time students. First, I know that there are reasons why
regulations are not yet available for universities and colleges that
will be offering part-time students the opportunity to take up loans,
because this is obviously not legislation. However, there is a real
concern among institutions that provide part-time courses that they
will not have the information available for students at an early point
in order to tell them what they can expect. This is enormously
important, because by their very nature part-time students are often
working people, or people with family commitments, and they need to
know what the arrangements are at an early point in order to identify
whether they will be able to afford to go ahead with study. So, while
acknowledging that this will not be legislation for some time, can I
press the Minister on whether it is possible for draft regulations to
be put out so that universities and colleges that have part-time
students can at least begin to talk to prospective students about
it?<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000400">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
I am concerned that without the detailed regulations being available,
or at least an idea of what they will look like, the Student Loans
Company may also struggle to provide loans, which we know would not be
the first time. I am sure that the Government want to avoid the
situation students found themselves in but a short time ago. On that
basis I also hope that the Minister will be able to firm up his
commitment that part-time students will be eligible for student loans
alongside the full-time students going into the new
system.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000401">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
final concern is one I raised with the Minister for Universities and
Science in a couple of Parliamentary written questions, which were
responded to yesterday. Unfortunately I do not think that the Minister
who responded quite understood the point that I was getting at. I am
concerned that part-time students inevitably have to begin repaying
their loans before they finish their course; they have to start
repaying after three years if their income is above the required level,
but no full-time student is liable to start repaying before finishing
the course, regardless of whether it is three or four
years.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000402">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Will
the Minister consider the matter again? It is particularly likely to
impact on women students who are thinking of studying part time. The
majority of part-time students are female, are likely to be that bit
older and are more likely to have other commitments. Many will be
working, and if they are in high-wage areas such as London and the
south-east they could well have to start repaying before they have
finished the course. That could be particularly devastating not only
because of the extra pressure that it puts on the family income but in
enabling part-time students to complete the course. I ask the Minister
to think carefully about this, because I have a real concern that what
should be a welcome advance could turn out not to be
so.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000403">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I have made clear already this afternoon my belief
that the proposals on part-time provision that resulted from the Browne
review, which have been accepted by the Government, are highly
significant and most welcome. I agree with the hon. Member for
Sheffield, Heeley that it is important that we have clarity on the
exact circumstances that face part-time students. To that
end—this is not in my notes, but it is important to respond to
questions asked by the Committee—I believe that it would be
appropriate to issue draft regulations. It would be a useful way of
ensuring further progress as described by the hon. Lady. I can deal
with the matter in very short order by agreeing with her. We will do
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000404">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Having
satisfied the hon. Lady, I am not certain that my answer will be quite
so satisfactory to the hon. Member for Hartlepool—at least, not
from his perspective. It will be done under the negative resolution
procedure, and it will not be taken on the Floor of the
House.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000405">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We have set
out our policy proposals, but perhaps I can make a further concession.
As we are coming to the end of our scrutiny of the Bill, I wonder
whether we might agree to a rather fuller debate on the White Paper on
higher education once it is published, given all that has been said
this afternoon. The House deserves a chance to explore these HE matters
in a broader context and on a bigger canvas. As a result of overtures
that were made this afternoon, I shall ask my ministerial colleagues to

                        <p class="tabbed">Moreover, I
recognise what was said about part-time students and more broadly about
the impact of these changes, and the hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley
made the point well. I further commit the Department—I am on a
roll now—to updating the original impact assessment, because I
believe that things have moved on. A good case can be made for a
further impact assessment, or at least an updated version of the
original. Generosity is my middle name. It is partly the result of the
energy and rigour with which I have been pressed by Members on all
sides of the Committee that I have been able to go further than we
might originally have envisaged. On that basis, I hope that we can make
further progress and that the hon. Gentleman will, with some
enthusiasm, support clause 71.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000407">&#160;</a>

Cardiff West, who has risen manfully to the challenge of facing two of
the most formidable Ministers in the Government. He will now find some
peace as Yeats did, because “peace comes dropping slow”.
When he leaves the Committee we will all find

                           </strong> May I thank the Minister for the commitments he made
to me and may I also pay tribute to the two shadow Ministers? Just to
demonstrate that targets work: we were working on targets for speaking
time today and until the Minister got involved we were well ahead. May
I suggest that in future the Government should also think about targets
for speaking on clauses because we might have made a little more
progress a little more
quickly?<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000409">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> These things have to be addressed with the
thoroughness that they deserve. Having checked out that the hon. Member
for Hartlepool was a bookmaker, I had a quick look at the runners and
riders this afternoon. There is a nag at Kemptown that he can still put
a bet on called Avalon Bay. Avalon was the resting place of King Arthur
and I think the hon. Gentleman would be well advised to put a few
shillings on the nose—he clearly takes an interest in these
things. With that round-robin summary, I hope that he will support
clause
71.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000410">&#160;</a>

South. His concession has been encouraging. I thank him for the tip on
Avalon Bay. When I think of Avalon I think of Roxy Music, which
probably shows my age. Could I ask three questions before I decide to
test the opinion of the Committee on this? I would still like to see an
affirmative resolution on the Floor of the House. When will the full
debate on the White Paper take place? Will it be in Government time so
it does not take up Opposition or Back-Bench time? Will the House be
able to vote on a substantive motion with regard to this? If he can
answer encouragingly on those points we possibly have a
deal.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000411">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman is like a charming but
avaricious schoolboy who, given access to the pantry, wants to eat all
the sweets. Yes, of course there will be a proper debate. I would not
be permitted to say that it should be in Back Bench time as that is
outside my power and purview. He is absolutely right that it should be
considered by the House. I made that clear. There would not be a
substantive motion necessarily of the kind he described, because a
White Paper is not a legislative proposal. Yes, there will be a proper
debate on higher education around the White Paper with adequate time to
explore the issues that were discussed today. To go further would be to
feed the appetite of the hon. Gentleman—I would not go so far as
to call him my protégé, but he is someone who looks to me
for advice and guidance—to a point where he might become
gluttonous.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000412">&#160;</a>

part of the Bill. Hon. Members will have seen amendment 215,
which stands in my name and which would remove the clause from the

intention, following last month’s referendum on the powers of
the National Assembly for Wales, to speak against the clause standing

5 to the Government of Wales Act 2006 sets out the current powers of
the Assembly to pass Assembly measures. Clause 72 would amend that
schedule to confer legislative competence on the Assembly in relation
to professional standards and regulations for teachers and the wider
education work force and to the recruitment and training of the
education work force. Following the yes vote in the referendum, the
Assembly approved an order that will bring its enhanced law-making
powers into force on 5
May.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000437">&#160;</a>

that date, the schedule will no longer have effect and the Assembly
will be able to pass Assembly Acts in the 20 subject areas set out in
schedule 7 to the 2006 Act. One of those areas is education and
training, including the professional standards and recruitment of
teachers. As the Assembly will have the powers it needs to make
Assembly Acts in that area, the framework provisions in the clause are
no longer needed. I therefore ask the Committee to agree that clause 72
not stand part of the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000438">&#160;</a>

PSHE—personal, social and health education. There are maintained
programmes of study and attainment targets for two non-national
curriculum subjects—religious education, and personal, social
and health education—and the new clause is a way of probing
whether the Government intend to maintain the curriculum frameworks,
which have generally been welcomed, or whether they intend to remove
them or let them wither away.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000465">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The position
of religious education is different from that of PSHE. Religious
education is part of the school curriculum and is statutory, except
that the framework is decided locally at the religious education agreed
syllabus conference. The national framework has been of assistance to
local authorities and their agreed syllabus conferences in devising
local
syllabuses.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000466">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> As I understand the new clause, it would impose an
obligation on the Secretary of State to continue the work undertaken by
the QCDA in developing non-statutory programmes of study for RE and
PSHE. I understand the rationale behind the new clause, but I do not
think it is appropriate. It is important to distinguish between the
national curriculum and the wider school curriculum. If we are to free
teachers to use their professional judgment so as best to support their
pupils, we must get away from the idea that everything that is
important for children to learn must be included in the national
curriculum.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000468">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
national curriculum should set out only the essential knowledge that
all children need to acquire to progress with their education. Beyond
that, it is for individual schools and teachers to decide what should
be taught. We believe there are a number of important components to a
broad and balanced school curriculum, and that it would be
inappropriate to prescribe the more narrowly defined national
programmes of study. That applied to RE, for example, where what is
taught needs to reflect local circumstances. RE is a statutory part of
the basic curriculum, not a subject in the national curriculum. By law,
all maintained schools must provide RE for all children attending
school. RE will not therefore be considered part of the review of the
national
curriculum.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000469">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government do not intend to make any changes to the statutory basis for
RE. It is long-established and well-regarded practice that local
authorities, working through standing advisory councils on religious
education, design RE provision that is appropriate to their school
communities. They are close to their communities and understand their
needs, as well as being accountable to them for the RE taught in
maintained schools. They are best placed to design an RE curriculum
that is relevant and valued by their
community.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000470">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
PSHE, the schools White Paper announced our intention to conduct an
internal review and we are scoping that review now. The aim is to
determine how we can support schools to improve the quality of all PSHE
teaching, including giving teachers the flexibility to use their
judgment on how best to deliver PSHE education. It is vital that PSHE
education reflects the local context. Schools are the best place to
plan, organise and teach a curriculum that works for them, using
whatever resources they judge appropriate. Existing resources will
continue to be available as part of the national archive, if schools
choose to use them. I hope that I have responded fully to the comments
made by the hon. Member for Cardiff West, but if I have missed
something out, I am sure he will come back to me on
it.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000471">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The new clause
would introduce a provision to increase the number
of apprenticeship places that are made available in
the UK, particularly with regard to the public sector. In earlier
deliberations, we touched on that, and I pay tribute to the Minister,
whom I know is committed to it and who has spent some time with me and
my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne North (Catherine
McKinnell) to discuss these matters. I also pay tribute to my hon.
Friend, who has championed the issue since being elected to the House
11 months ago. She has made a passionate commitment to increase the
skills levels and training opportunities that are available,
particularly for young people in the north-east, but also further
afield.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000476">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
new clause would not force the public sector to have apprenticeships.
Instead, it would introduce a requirement that contracts awarded by
public authorities should include provision such that successful
bidders demonstrated a firm commitment to skills, training and
apprenticeships. In effect, it would enshrine in statute a requirement
to comply with the 2009 Office of Government Commerce guidance,
“Promoting skills through public procurement”. That is
the subject of a private Member’s Bill from my hon. Friend,
which has a number of important backers, such as the Federation of
Small Businesses, the TUC, the north-east chamber of commerce, the
Association of Colleges, the Federation of Master Builders and the
Electrical Contractors Association. I hope that the Minister will look
favourably on the new clause, as he said he would in meetings that my
hon. Friend and I have had with him.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000477">&#160;</a>

would not force firms to take on apprentices through the procurement of
public sector contracts, but it is one lever that the Minister has at
his disposal to ensure that we can increase the number of
apprenticeships and ensure that we have a culture of skills and
training, which we all so badly
need.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000478">&#160;</a>

hon. Gentleman’s amendment, tabled with his hon. Friend, would
create a set of statutory requirements to do that. Previous Governments
have looked at such a measure. The right hon. Member for Southampton,
Itchen (Mr Denham), when the Secretary of State responsible for such
matters, received similar overtures but, in the end, stopped short of
introducing a blanket requirement of that sort—I suspect, on
advice.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000480">&#160;</a>

kitemark suppliers to the Government who are
committed to the apprenticeship programme. Fourthly, I am looking at
what can be done in respect of tenders, although I must issue a caveat:
it would need to be consistent with regulatory constraints and European
law—every time I hear “Europe” I shudder, not
because I dislike Europe but because I fear Europeanism. We have,
however, been mindful of the legal framework in which such matters are
considered. Finally, I am determined to create appropriate pressure on
Departments to ensure that they give the priority to apprenticeships
that the hon. Gentleman wishes us to give and which he knows I wish to
give.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000482">&#160;</a>

package of five measures are all, I accept, non-legislative but they
can have just as great an effect. With the right kind of will, they
will be able to deliver the kind of outcomes that the hon. Members for
Hartlepool and for Northampton upon Tyne North want.

means by which the measure can be manoeuvred so that it is not in

therefore, to look at the matter closely to ensure that we can pull as
many levers as possible to get what we all want—a higher number
of apprenticeships in the public sector using the vehicle of
procurement as a means of doing so. On the basis of the

time. I will try to brief and I hope that we can
discuss the issue before the close of play. The new clause relates to a
subject on which we have probably received the most submissions. It is
not often that a Government get the chance to make a decision that can
simply, easily and cheaply save lives, but they have the opportunity to
do so now.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000490">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Every year,
150,000 people die in situations in which first aid could have made a
difference. Each year in the UK, 30,000 people have a cardiac arrest
outside the hospital environment, less than 10% of whom survive to be
discharged from hospital. Emergency life support is a set of actions
needed to keep someone alive  until professional help arrives.
It includes performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation, putting an
unconscious person into the recovery position, dealing with choking and
serious bleeding, and helping someone who may be having a heart attack.
Those skills are particularly crucial at the time of cardiac arrest.
Children are often present at accidents and emergencies and if they are
properly trained, they can be as effective as any adult in
administering first aid.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000492">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Our curriculum
states that children should be taught many things, but, frankly,
learning the names of the six wives of Henry VIII is unlikely to save a
person’s life, whereas emergency life support can. We know that
the Government want to slim down the national curriculum, but surely
learning emergency life support skills should be as important as
learning the times table. The Government have stated that they want the
national curriculum to reflect the<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000493">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Surely
knowing how to save the life of a family member or a member of the
public would enable children to have an impact on the health of
society. One of my local schools, Smithills, runs a British Heart
Foundation Heartstart UK scheme. The teacher who is responsible, Adrian
Hamilton, told me that learning how to save a life in an emergency
really engages kids at Smithills. He believes that it goes a long way
towards helping them to become better citizens and that it should be an
expected part of what happens in schools.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000494">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Government
talk about wanting to compare themselves internationally, but in
France, Denmark and Norway, ELS is already a compulsory part of the
curriculum; a number of the states in Australia include it; and in
America, it is part of the curriculum in 36 of the 50
states.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000495">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Schools
deliver ELS in a variety of ways and settings, but commonly pupils
enjoy the lessons, which increase confidence and self-esteem and are
particularly important for children with special educational needs.
Sheringham Woodfields, a school for children with complex needs, told
us about the enormous sense of achievement that  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 990<a class="bkMark" name="Column990">&#160;</a>
                           </div>its pupils feel when they realise that they can save a life. One of its
pupils received a bravery award when he saved someone in the Norfolk
broads. One of our most telling submissions was from Archbishop Ilsley
Catholic Technology College in Birmingham, which told us that it
decided to teach ELS after one parent died from a heart attack in front
of his family. It felt that something positive should come from that
tragedy. I do not have time to list all the things that people have
told us, but a common theme was that children who were taught these
skills went on to practise them and saved the lives of family members
or helped in serious situations.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000496">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I will end

                        <p class="hs_brev">“A lot
of our children are brought up in an extremely deprived area and are
not always adequately supervised. ELS gives them the confidence to deal
with an emergency, should one arise, and no adult was around…The
silence in the room when the children are watching the DVD from the
resource pack is remarkable! They watch it avidly and are always keen
to take part in the sessions. They are also very impressed when we get
the dolls out to practise resuscitation and can’t believe they
get to have a go on a ‘real live’
doll!”<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000552">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I agree that emergency life support skills can have
an immensely positive impact on pupils’ families as well as
schools and the wider community. It is encouraging to hear about the
excellent work in schools, particularly those that have written to the
Committee. I have seen the submission from the British Heart
Foundation. However, I take issue with the hon. Lady when she says that
this is more important than learning about the six wives of Henry VIII.
If Anne Boleyn had known more about Henry VIII, it might have saved her
life.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000499">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am also
aware of the invaluable support that organisations such as the British
Heart Foundation and St John Ambulance offer individual schools or
groups of schools to enrich curriculum work. I applaud them for their
important work, but I do not agree that making emergency life support
skills a statutory part of the curriculum is the right approach. Our
aim, as set out in the White Paper, is to reduce unnecessary
prescription throughout the education system. That means taking a new
approach towards the curriculum that affirms the importance of teaching
and creates scope for teachers to inspire students. That will give
teachers and head teachers the freedom and flexibility to incorporate
initiatives such as Heartstart in their school
programmes.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000500">&#160;</a>

are clear that the national curriculum should set out the essential
knowledge and understanding that all children should be expected to
acquire in the course of their school lives. It is for teachers to
design the wider curriculum in the way that meets the needs of their
pupils, taking account of the views of parents, the wider community and
local circumstances. I therefore urge the hon. Lady to withdraw the new

(which refers to Article 1(2) of Directive 98/34/EC of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure
for the provision of information in the field of technical standards
and regulations), and</p>
                        <p class="hs_AmendmentLevel4">(b) is
summarised in recital 17 of the E-Commerce Directive as covering
“any service normally provided for remuneration, at a distance,
by means of electronic equipment for the processing (including digital
compression) and storage of data, and at the individual request of a
recipient of a
service”;</p>
                        <p class="hs_AmendmentLevel3">“recipient”,
in relation to a service, means any person who, for professional ends
or otherwise, uses an information society service, in particular for
the purposes of seeking information or making it
accessible;</p>
                        <p class="hs_AmendmentLevel3">“service
provider” means a person providing an information society

England and Wales, or in that EEA state, for an indefinite period,

providing an information society service does not, of itself,
constitute the establishment of a service

                           </strong> On a point of order. Do I have to stop by six? I
am sure that is not the case. I understood that when we had disposed of
everything we could do the usual formalities at the end of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000505">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Thank
you, Mr Walker, and Mr Williams for your chairmanship. I also thank the
Government and Opposition Whips for the orderly way they have organised
our business. I know that they got on so well together that they are
planning a holiday, and I am sure that they will have a wonderful time.
I also thank the Clerks, the officials, the Doorkeepers, the police
and—not to forget them—the cleaners. I have told the
Committee that my mother was a school dinner lady, but her other job
was as a cleaner in the local council offices. When I became a local
councillor and took her to the marble hall in Cardiff’s splendid
city hall for the first mayor making, she took one look at the
splendour of the magnificent building and said, “Imagine having
to clean all this.” I thought that if I could maintain the eye
of the cleaner during my political career, it might stand me in good
stead, so we should all thank the cleaners who clear up the mess that
we leave behind us every
evening.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000506">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
thank the Ministers for the way that they have conducted themselves and
the business during the course of the Bill. I do not agree with the
Minister with responsibility for schools on many things, but he always
deals with disputes in a courteous way, and he certainly dealt with our
amendments in that fashion. I congratulate him on the magnificent job
that he is doing in training his PPS, the hon. Member for Grantham and
Stamford. He is looking very smart at the moment, and I am sure that he
will have his tie and his top button done up in future, just as the
Minister recommended during his visit to a local school
yesterday.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000507">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Then
there is the Minister for Further Education, Skills and Lifelong
Learning. What can one say about him? Charming, erudite, generous,
modest and humble are just a few of the things that he told us about
himself during the course of our deliberations. As ever, we have
enjoyed his contributions. At one stage, he said that he regarded his
speeches as rather like Wagnerian operas. I always thought that he was
a slightly more baroque

                           </div>figure, but he was perhaps referring to their length. The fat lady did
finally sing—despite the rather unkind remarks of my hon. Friend
the Member for Hartlepool about the Minister’s tailor—but
we thank him for his
contributions.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000508">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
has been a bit of a kitchen-sink Bill, so we are looking forward to
everything in it, and we are looking forward to it coming back on
Report after we have an opportunity to think about the proceedings in
Committee. We have attempted to give it a thorough and proper scrutiny
in the proper spirit of scrutinising a Bill line-by-line, and I hope
that, even though we have not won any real concessions, it has been a
worthwhile exercise. The Minister for Further Education, Skills and
Lifelong Learning often quotes Yeats, who also said, “Life is a
big preparation for something that never happens.” I am afraid
that, in our case, that was certainly true of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000509">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Further to that point of order, Mr Walker, I thank
you and your co-Chair, Mr Williams, for your fair and human chairing of
the Committee proceedings. This has been a good-humoured and
good-natured Committee stage, but there has nevertheless been thorough
scrutiny of the Bill’s 79 clauses. There were some
245 amendments, of which only a couple of dozen were
Government amendments. Overall, we have had 22 sittings,
which is more than we had for the mammoth Apprenticeships, Skills,
Children and Learning Act 2009, which had 270
clauses.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000510">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
someone with 13 years in Opposition, I know at first hand how much of
the heavy lifting of a Bill’s Committee stage rests with
Opposition spokesmen. I want to thank the hon. Members for Hartlepool
and for Cardiff West for the thorough approach that they have taken to
their responsibilities as Opposition spokesmen and also as sons and
colleagues in wishing mothers and the hon. Member for Walthamstow happy
birthdays.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000511">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am grateful to the Minister of State, my hon. Friend the Member for
South Holland and The Deepings for his succinct responses to concerns
raised by Committee members. He would never use a sledgehammer to crack
a nut, but we have appreciated his use of quotes. If I may, I would
like to quote something back, from Oscar
Wilde:<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000512">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p>I think that the
Committee will agree that my hon. Friend is often charming and only
occasionally tedious.

                        <p class="tabbed">I
would like to thank the Clerks and the Doorkeepers, who have ensured
that the Committee has run smoothly. I also pay tribute to the
excellent work of <em>Hansard </em>staff, who have miraculously managed
to interpret my garbled responses, and the garbled responses of my hon.
Friend.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000514">&#160;</a>

to thank the Bill manager and departmental officials for their
professionalism and the many hours of hard work and preparation that
lay behind the moments of inspiration during our proceedings. I also
thank, of course, the lawyers, who ensure that what we say is above
board.<a class="bkMark" name="1104067000515">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I would also
like to thank the Whips on both sides, particularly my hon. Friend the
Member for Rochford and Southend East for his cool competence. The hon.
Member for Preston has taken an active role on the Committee, with his
experience of the FE college sector.
