<a name="09071454000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09071454000253"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Richard Benyon</b> (Newbury) (Con): Good morning,
Mr. Gale. I suspect that this may be the final sitting of
this glee club, and it falls to me to tidy up various points that have
been raised. My hon. Friend the Member for East Devon tabled some
amendments that are due to be debated today, but he has fallen prey to
the lurgy; we hope that he has not been in close association with a
Mexican pig farmer. He is unable to be with us today, but I think that
I know the intention behind his amendments, so I want to probe the
Minister on various points in relation to the impact that the coastal
path will have on landowners or people with an interest in
land.</div><a name="09071454000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will start by painting a picture of a particular case that has been put
to me. I have had informal discussions about the issue with some of the
Minister&#146;s officials, but it is important to put on record how
the Government believe Natural England and local authorities should
treat the legislation. My example relates to a privately owned,
semi-permanent caravan park on the coast. The landowner, at his own
expense, has created a footpath along the coast. The footpath goes to
the rear of the caravan park and up a cliff, and it affords walkers a
safe path and enhanced views compared with those from sea level. It is
a better option in every sense&#151;from the public&#146;s point of
view, as well as from that of the landowner&#146;s business. If the
letter of the law were followed by the local authority and Natural
England, they might state that the footpath must be driven across the
front of the caravans in the park. That would impact on the
landowner&#146;s business; there would be potential safety
consequences for some of the caravans&#146; owners; and there would
be a diminished amenity value. I hope that the Minister will say that,
in such circumstances, it is right and proper that the footpath goes
along the existing route. It is the logical and best route; it has been
enhanced and paid for by the landowner; and it affords a better option
for every conceivable interest in the
proposal.</div><a name="09071454000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for East Devon wanted to press the Minister on
the pecuniary cost to coastal interests affected by the provision. I am
sure that many  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column298" />Column number: 298</div>members of the Committee have received case studies in relation to the
impact on certain businesses. It would be useful if the Minister were
to explain whether he appreciates the concerns of those with affected
interests. In the south-west, for example, there is a tourism business
dependent on what it considers to be exclusive access to a beach area.
The business claims that the loss of private beach access to a hotel or
holiday home development will result in a minimum depreciation of the
capital value of the business of 16 per cent. That is a reduction of
&#163;500,000 in the value of that
business.</div><a name="09071454000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
south-west business is a hotel that is also dependent on coastal
access. The business contributes &#163;1.5 million per annum to the
local economy and preserves a key landmark in the form of the hotel.
The business believes that the loss of its unique selling
point&#151;privacy&#151;would result in the depreciation in the
capital value of least &#163;3 million. Those figures could be
tested, but half that figure would still be a substantial impact. We
talk about the value of the coastal path in terms of
tourism&#151;people wanting to walk a coastal path&#151;and its
many benefits to local communities and local businesses, which I
entirely accept, but we must also accept that there is already a lot of
activity in coastal Britain today. There are many companies providing
jobs and enormous benefit to those communities, and sometimes those
businesses will be at odds with what is proposed in this part of
the
Bill.</div><a name="09071454000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
business that drew my attention is in Northumberland, where the
landowner owns a large area of coast well known for its bird life. Much
of the area consists of vegetated dunes and is a site of special
scientific interest. The business has always permitted public access to
the beach. Its focus is on holiday cottages. It had planned to expand
by developing wildlife safaris, with hides and other facilities, along
the coast, but those plans have now been put on hold until the coastal
access situation is clear. I hope that the Minister&#146;s remarks
will provide that clarity.</div>
<a name="09071454000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The business
believes that, with a lack of compensation, the changes will have an
impact on nesting birds, safety and management issues. Natural England
notices ask people not to pass due to nesting birds, obviously at a
particular time of year. The sign
states:</div><a name="09071454000212"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Ground-nesting
birds, including terns and ringed plover breed here. Disturbance from
people walking with or without dogs can cause nesting birds to abandon
their nests and expose eggs or young birds to predators. To protect
wildlife on this site there is currently no access beyond here. It is
illegal to disturb schedule 1 breeding
birds.&#148;</div><a name="09071454000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a potential conflict between what Natural England wants to see in
certain areas of our coast and the coastal access we demand that it
delivers. It would be very helpful if the Minister were to address some
of those concerns in his remarks, particularly regarding the potential
impact on a number of existing rural businesses that provide great
benefit to the economy of local areas.</div>
<a name="09071454000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09071454000254"></a><b class="B">Andrew
George</b> (St. Ives) (LD): As the hon. Member for Newbury has
said, I suspect we are in our final sitting. It is a great pity that
the hon. Member for East Devon is not here. The hon. Member for Newbury
has done a good job of setting out the basis for what I am sure that
the Minister will acknowledge is a substantial issue. However, I had
hoped that the hon. Member for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column299" />Column number: 299</div>East Devon would set out the argument with examples from his
constituency and add to some of the scenarios painted by the hon.
Member for Newbury.</div>
<a name="09071454000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even after
the coastal path has been identified and agreed, coastal erosion will
inevitably result in a further requirement to decide its route in
coming decades. The implication for landowners&#151;in my
constituency, for example, there is a non-profit distributing trust
that runs a recreational facility, including a golf club&#151;is that
where there will be a substantial amount of coastal erosion over the
next 20 or 30 years, the coastal path will inevitably take up sections
of what is currently well-used land. That may result in significant
compromises to the facilities that the golf club can offer. Clearly
that issue needs to be considered further.</div>
<a name="09071454000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
debate on compensation is needed fully to understand the consequences
for businesses whose viability will be adversely affected by the
coastal path. Where the issue of compensation is raised, it may help
the process of negotiation. Natural England might be prepared to
compromise a little more reasonably over a reasonable request for a
diversion in an area where a business would be significantly affected
by a coastal path driving its way through an area of quiet
tranquillity, where people could otherwise enjoy a private holiday
experience. The spectre of compensation itself may ensure that Natural
England is prepared to make a reasonable compromise in those
circumstances. If compensation were not available I suspect that
Natural England might not be prepared to do that. I shall certainly be
interested to hear what the Minister has to
say.</div><a name="09071454000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09071454000255"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs (Huw Irranca-Davies):</b> It may be helpful if as well
as responding to the stand part debate, I also respond to the substance
of the amendments, which were not moved but which are pertinent to the
schedule. I appreciate the concerns that the hon. Members for Newbury
and for St. Ives have raised. We have articulated them on several
occasions in Committee. I make it clear once again that I fully expect
that in its determination of the route, Natural England will engage
fully with all landowners, businesses, the national parks authorities,
local authorities and local access forums to make sure that it is the
right route and that local sensitivities are taken into
account.</div><a name="09071454000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am very familiar with the caravan park issues, both from my visits
around the coast of the east of England and from back home, where I
live on the Gower. The Gower was the first designated area of
outstanding natural beauty, and there are also caravan parks right on
the beach and on the cliff heads. How do we reconcile that? The way to
do it is through proper local engagement, taking into account local
concerns. The hon. Member for Newbury described a case where an
existing path goes slightly inland and up on to the headland, where
greater views are afforded of the spectacular coast. It might well be
that in discussion with the landowner, Natural England said,
&#147;That&#146;s a darn fine route. Let&#146;s keep it as
that.&#148; On the other hand, there might be a significant amount of
shore frontage or spreading room at the front. I know of caravan parks
where there is less than a metre between the caravan and the shoreline.
There are others with immense spreading room out to the front. It comes
to down to very good local engagement 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column300" />Column number: 300</div>and input, and discussions with the landowners to find the most
appropriate route. That is what I expect to see
happening.</div><a name="09071454000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman talked about restrictions in relation to nesting birds.
Again, the flexibility that is provided in the Bill means that the best
solution can be found. He is right to say, curiously, that it might be
an occasion where a local business will say that it does not want the
area closed, because it wants the public to come along and spend money
in, for example, a caf√(c) or a bed and breakfast. That is where
the environmental aspect comes in. We do not want to see nesting
grounds of birds
disturbed.</div><a name="09071454000227"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div><a name="09071454000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is why the Bill&#146;s approach of local determination and
flexibility is right, rather than having the man in Whitehall or even
the Natural England adviser sitting in London making a determination.
That is not the way it should work. It should be about walking the
route and engaging with landowners, conservation groups and shooting
and angling interests that say they must have protection for a nesting
ground during certain months. That is where this approach can really
work. The hon. Member for St. Ives is right to say that if the hon.
Member for East Devon had been here he would have painted lots of
pictures of his local examples. Local examples can include the
exceptions where difficulties have to be worked through, or the
numerous cases where the process already works successfully. They paint
a picture of how it can work and where the difficulties can be
overcome.</div>
<a name="09071454000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think I
know the local golf club mentioned by the hon. Member for St. Ives. I
am not a golfer but I have visited his constituency on holiday and I am
pretty sure I know the one he referred to. That will undoubtedly be in
one of those areas where these challenges are most acute, where there
is coastal squeeze&#151;not only from a coastal path but from coastal
erosion, increased storminess, floods and rising sea levels. At the
same time there are restrictions causing coastal squeeze on the other
side, such as highways and the location of roads. When dealing with
these issues, there is an ask, as I have said before, for local
authorities to engage their planning powers to ensure that the caravan
park, golf course or anything else has a valuable future when
confronted with the coastal path and other pressures, both seaward and
landward.</div><a name="09071454000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09071454000256"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> Will the Minister address the concerns of some
coastal businesses about liability? For example, I have heard of a
landholding where, for a variety of geomorphological reasons, there are
quickly shifting dunes. The landholder has been able to restrict access
on the basis of safety concerns. Other coastal areas also pose a risk
of accidents on rocks and cliffs. Will the Minister say a little more
about how liability issues will be raised? I hope he will say that he
understands the concerns of businesses that are important to the local
economy but stand to lose considerable percentages of capital
value.</div>
<a name="09071454000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09071454000257"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I will turn to liability, as it is an
important issue. Landowners&#146; liability for people on their
ground was significantly reduced by CROW legislation following the
articulation of the same 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column301" />Column number: 301</div>concerns. When the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 introduced a
right of access to open country and registered common land mapped as
access land, provision was made about occupiers&#146; liability under
the Occupiers&#146; Liability Acts 1957 and 1984. That has reduced
the liability of occupiers, such as landowners, towards members of the
public who are exercising the right of access on CROW access land. For
example, if someone sustains an injury on CROW land due to a natural
feature of the landscape, reduced liability means that there will be no
scope to sue the occupier. In addition, if someone sustains an injury
climbing over a wall or fence, reduced liability means that there will
be no scope to sue the occupier unless the injury was sustained through
the proper use of the gate or stile&#151;if it was dangerous through
the direct fault of the landowner. I declare an interest here, although
not in respect of coastal access; I have rights of way and stiles on my
property in the upper Swansea valley. They have been well installed,
and were paid for by the Countryside Council for Wales and others. I
thank them for that because they installed proper ones, which are not
like my makeshift ones. I take part in ensuring that the stiles are
adequately maintained.</div>
<a name="09071454000047"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09071454000258"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Roger Williams</b> (Brecon and Radnorshire) (LD):
Landowners&#146; reduced liability on CROW land was welcomed by my
constituents and landowners throughout the country. Does the Minister
agree that there is a difference between the CROW right to roam on
mountain, moor and heath, where people can choose where to go and keep
away from dangerous areas, and the right to roam on coastal access
paths, where the routes are laid down? There is a huge duty on
everybody to ensure that the route is safe to begin
with.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09071454000259"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> There is indeed. The hon. Gentleman makes
a good point, which I will come to later. I remark that there are some
perilous walks within his constituency on top of some of those high
crags along the Fan Hir ridge, which has a 200 ft drop on one side and
not much scope for walking away on the other. I shall finish my point
and then come directly on to the point that he raises.</div>
<a name="09071454000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
responses to the consultation on improving access to the coasts
supported the extension of the reduced liability provisions in the CROW
Act to coastal land and, recognising the complexity of the coastal
environment, they further supported the extension of reduced liability
to include other, non-natural, features. We considered the matter and
agreed that reduced liabilities should apply both to natural features
and to non-natural features on the land, subject to some
safeguards.</div><a name="09071454000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
safeguards are, in essence, to ensure that the occupier has not acted
intentionally or recklessly, which I think we all agree is right. If,
for example, a landowner or an occupier has installed steps to a beach
that was previously private and for their own use, they will not,
subject to the safeguards already mentioned, be liable if a user of the
right of access is injured using those steps. In the end, it is for
users of the new coastal access rights to keep themselves, their
children and others in their care safe within what can be a
dangerous environment. The reduced liability will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column302" />Column number: 302</div>benefit occupiers of coastal land where there is already access and will
minimise the burden where new access is created.</div>
<a name="09071454000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall now
address the issue raised by the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire.
The rationale for reducing occupiers&#146; liability further on the
coast, as opposed to in open country or on registered common land, is
that there may be more hazardous structures, which we do not want a
landowner to be liable to maintain as a result of the proposals. The
existing provisions under CROW have worked well, but there are more
man-made features on the coast and we do not want the proposals to
burden landowners. The message to people using the coast is that they
must be responsible for their own safety by avoiding dangerous or
hazardous-looking features, either man-made or natural.</div>
<a name="09071454000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Newbury raised the issue of private beaches. Natural England
proposed that the vast majority of beaches be included within the
coastal access corridor and the responses to the consultation supported
that view. Therefore, we propose that beaches be included within the
new right of access, as they will lie seaward of the route and the CROW
section 3A order will say that all land seaward of the route will be
coastal margin. A beach will, therefore, be included in the margin and
be access land, unless there is a restriction or exclusion for nature
conservation, for example. Decisions on which beaches will be included
will be made as part of the detailed alignment of the corridor and be
determined
locally.</div><a name="09071454000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for East Devon is not here to move his amendment himself
and we send him our best wishes, but the thrust of the amendments that
he tabled is that the English coastal route should, wherever possible,
be implemented following close work with landowners. Schedule 20 to the
Bill enables Natural England to work closely with owners and occupiers
in making sure that the route is accessible to the public on the
ground.</div><a name="09071454000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
I would like to make it clear that Natural England will pay for the
implementation of the route. That has always been the clear intention
and nothing in the schedule is intended to change that position.
However, there may be situations in which the landowner wishes work to
be done in a particular way because it benefits him or her as the
landowner. Natural England may agree to put in a fence to keep walkers
from straying on to non-access land, but the landowner may want a
particular, more expensive type of fence than that required for the
purpose, or a particular wall for his or her own reasons. In that case,
Natural England and the landowner might agree to share the costs of the
work.</div><a name="09071454000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
schedule provides for that flexibility, enabling the work to be carried
out in a way that is beneficial to the landowner without undue call on
public funds. That is good practice in terms of what currently happens;
we are not reinventing the wheel. There can be agreement, for example,
when the optimum siting for the route requires an obstruction to be
cleared or removed to make the route accessible. Agreement for carrying
out any of the establishment works listed in paragraph 2 of the
schedule, including drainage and the levelling of land, might be
reached by Natural England or the access authority with landowners and
occupiers. I reiterate what Lord Taylor of Holbeach said in the other
place:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column303" />Column number: 303</div><a name="09071454000213"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
have been trying to construct this path, if one may put it that way, on
the basis of consensus and the hope that there will be a buy-in
locally.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 21
April 2009; Vol. 709, c.
1476.]</div><a name="09071454000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I fully
endorse those
sentiments.</div><a name="09071454000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
powers to ensure that Natural England and access authorities are able
to carry out the coastal access duty as required by clause 290 are set
out in schedule 20. We consider it more appropriate to set them out in
a schedule rather than in a clause. Natural England will develop its
proposals for improved access to every stretch of the coast, liaising
closely with each of the access authorities concerned as to the likely
management and maintenance requirements of the trail along that length.
It will also take account of all relevant factors, including
topography, surface, rate of coastal change, prevalence of sensitive
features, likely levels and types of use, and any special factors that
might
apply.</div><a name="09071454000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is also important to note my final few comments. Natural England will
indicate in its reports to the Secretary of State, under section 51 of
the Coast Protection Act 1949, the standards for maintenance and
management that it considers should apply to each stretch of coast.
Once the report has been approved by the Secretary of State, Natural
England will use it as the basis for ongoing funding and
prioritisation. There is some clarity there. Natural England will put
in place a funding agreement with the relevant access authority for
both the establishment measures and an initial maintenance and
management programme spanning several years. In some cases, the latter
might involve several authorities working collaboratively. Those
agreements, and the underpinning assessments of need and priority, will
be intended to provide the necessary measure of stability and
confidence across financial years. They will be reviewed and renewed
periodically, in the light of monitoring and
experience.</div><a name="09071454000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would require Natural England or the access authority to
meet expenditure incurred by the owner or occupier in carrying out
agreed works to implement or maintain the route. The Bill provides
powers for meeting such costs and also includes&#151;I keep on saying
this&#151;the flexibility to contribute to the costs rather than to
meet them in full, if the case determines that that is the right
approach. I have described in detail the sort of circumstances in which
that might be appropriate. The details of the payments should be a
matter for agreement between the contracting authority and the
landowner or occupier, taking into account the local circumstances. I
therefore consider that the approach set out in schedule 20 provides
the flexibility to make reasonable agreements with landowners and
occupiers. It also ensures that any necessary works can be carried out
when, for whatever reason, such agreements are not possible. The
provisions are similar to those in the CROW
Act.</div><a name="09071454000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, the Bill states in paragraphs 5, 6(4) and 8(4) of schedule
20 that Natural England may meet or contribute towards the cost of an
agreement under paragraph 2 of the schedule or section 35 of the CROW
Act. When an agreement is made between Natural England and the owner or
occupier, we would like there to be the flexibility to allow a
contribution from the owner or occupier when appropriate. We are not
saying that Natural England will never meet all the costs,
but  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column304" />Column number: 304</div>in particular cases, as I have explained, there might be a reason why it
should not do so. We want to retain the flexibility that we have
provided in the
Bill.</div><a name="09071454000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thank the hon. Members for St. Ives and for Newbury for the opportunity
to debate the matter at some length. It is important to give
reassurance, and to show that we have in the Bill the flexibility to
deal with circumstances on the ground in a locally determined
way.</div><a name="09071454000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09071454000260"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for putting those
facts on the record; that will give a lot of comfort to many people.
However, he has sidestepped one of the points that I raised: the impact
that this could have on the capital value or the revenue income of
businesses. Is he telling those businesses,
&#147;Tough&#151;that&#146;s just the way it is,&#148; or can
he give them the comfort of knowing that they could take their case to
the relevant authority and have it reflected in the path&#146;s
route?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09071454000261"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I can give the Committee some comfort, but
I reiterate that this is a coastal path with spreading room that will
be worked out over a period of 10 years. The local determination, which
I have stressed repeatedly and which is also stressed by Natural
England&#146;s documents, mitigates the need for any compensation. I
think that all members of the Committee would agree that we do not want
a coastal path that is dogged&#151;we have had this debate in the
other place&#151;with endless claims and counter-claims over
compensation. We are not going
there.</div><a name="09071454000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have already discussed how the coastal path could operate to the
economic benefit of many landowners in many respects. However, in
exceptional circumstances where a coastal path route is needed, but,
despite the best dialogue and consultation, there is no alternative
route, and where it could be shown that there would be a material
impact to a landowner&#146;s economic disadvantage, Natural England
may come to a financial arrangement with landowners under the powers of
the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006. I stress that
such circumstances would be exceptional and that the power is not one
of compensation in the terms of the Bill. Where there are truly
exceptional circumstances, where it is recognised that there is going
to be an impact and that there is no other way of routing the coastal
path, a provision exists under the 2006 Act for a discussion to be
held. I give that element of comfort on a truly exceptional
basis.</div><a name="09071454000065"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09071454000262"></a>Andrew
George:</b> I rise to raise a few issues in relation to the
Isles of Scilly clause. Such a clause often appears in many Bills
because the Isles of Scilly have to be included in primary legislation.
The Isles of Scilly are within the St. Ives constituency and lie
approximately 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column305" />Column number: 305</div>40 miles off the west coast of Cornwall. They comprise five inhabited
islands. The primary island, where the bulk of the Isles of
Scilly&#146;s population lives, is St. Mary&#146;s, and
the four other islands are St. Agnes, Bryher, Tresco and St.
Martin&#146;s, but there are many other rocky outcrops and islands
besides. I am sure that many members of the Committee have visited the
Isles of
Scilly.</div><a name="09071454000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister has decided not to apply certain clauses to the Isles of
Scilly. To what extent has his Department consulted with the council of
the Isles of Scilly in that regard? Having spoken to the Isles of
Scilly&#146;s chief executive and to the council itself about the
provisions, they are pretty content with the proposal not to include
the Isles of Scilly. In fact, I think that it is fair to say that the
Isles of Scilly already have a level of coastal access that goes far
beyond what the Bill provides for, so I do not believe that there is a
substantial requirement to extend the legislation to the Isles of
Scilly.</div><a name="09071454000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Equally,
the council of the Isles of Scilly was particularly interested in the
Minister&#146;s explanation of the boundaries of the inshore
fisheries and conservation authorities, which we debated last Tuesday,
as that is important to the future development and management of the
seas around the Isles of Scilly, as well as the coastline. It wants to
maintain the integrity of the Isles of Scilly because it believes that
they have a first-class track record in the management of their inshore
fisheries. An official statement has yet to be made, but the Minister
gave a clear indication that he respected, and wished to respect in
future, the arrangements of the council of the Isles of Scilly in
relation to IFCAs.</div>
<a name="09071454000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">I draw the
Minister&#146;s attention to the explanatory notes. Paragraph 777
states:</div><a name="09071454000214"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Part
4 of the 1949 Act applies to the Isles of Scilly, but an order under
section 111 of that Act can provide for it to apply as if those Isles
were a separate county (and not part of Cornwall).&#148;
</div><a name="09071454000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Isles of
Scilly are not part of Cornwall and are a separate county. In fact,
they were a unitary authority before unitary authorities were invented.
I hope that that reassures the Minister. To what extent does the
Minister&#146;s approach to the Isles of Scilly mirror his approach
to the Isle of Wight? He rose without prompting when we reached clause
294, which applies to the Isle of Wight, to make it clear that he and
his Department intended to ensure that this part of the Bill would
extend to the Isle of Wight. I shall be interested to know what factors
lay behind the decision not to extend the provisions of the Bill to the
Isles of Scilly.</div>
<a name="09071454000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">In many ways,
the Isles of Scilly are already well established in terms of coastal
access, but we must consider the &#147;what if&#148; scenario. What
if the council of the Isles of Scilly made a request to a future
Secretary of State that this part of the Bill should apply to the Isles
of Scilly because it feared that it would lose coastal access because
of the attitudes of landowners&#151;primarily and predominantly the
Duchy of Cornwall? What provisions are in place to ensure that that
could be acted on quickly? Equally, if the Secretary of State proposed
such a measure and the Isles of Scilly resisted it, what arrangement
would
apply?</div><a name="09071454000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have an interesting conundrum in respect of the Isles of Scilly.
Members often refer to the West Lothian question. If we apply the
Conservative view that only those Members who represent the area to
which any 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column306" />Column number: 306</div>legislation under consideration applies may express a view on the issue,
when it comes to the Isles of Scilly clause only one Member of
Parliament would be entitled to decide the outcome. That would give me
absolute power. I could be persuaded that there is a future for
benevolent tyranny after
all.</div><a name="09071454000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09071454000263"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> I had been quietly kipping there when something
exploded. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the Isles of Scilly are not

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09071454000264"></a>The

Member for Newbury, a lot of people in Cornwall see the Isles of Scilly
as England beyond Cornwall. I am sure that they are quite content with
their arrangements, but I would leave it to them to define and decide
their own identity. I would be interested in the Minister&#146;s
response to the questions that have been
raised.</div><a name="09071454000079"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09071454000266"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I can confirm that the Isles of Scilly are
definitely not part of Wales. The clause, as it stands, makes it clear
that the coastal access duty and other matters relating to it that are
provided for in part 9 of the Bill do not, as has been said, apply to
the Isles of Scilly. It goes on to say, however, that the Secretary of
State may make an order providing for the application of any of the
provisions to the Isles of Scilly and may, in any such order, specify
modifications to the provisions in respect of the Isles of Scilly.
Before making such an order, the Secretary of State must consult the
council of the Isles of Scilly.</div>
<a name="09071454000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">To return to
the first point made by the hon. Member for St. Ives, if the Isles of
Scilly were to beg&#151;I cannot imagine them begging us, but they
may come to us at some point in future and say that they would like to
be taken into account in the provisions, the clause allows us to do
that. The clause makes provision for an order to be made under part 4
of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, applying
that part of the 1949 Act as amended by the Bill to the Isles of Scilly
as if they were a separate county. That arrangement mirrors provisions,
both in the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 and in the 1949 Act.
Rather than rewrite those Acts, we are mirroring them to achieve the
same effect. The clause also provides that an order may be made under
CROW, applying part 1 as amended by the Bill, to the Isles of Scilly.
If they were to beg or ask politely to come within the provisions, that
can be done.</div>
<a name="09071454000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
hypothetical problem posed by the hon. Member for St. Ives was about
whether we would decide to force them, in a draconian old-style
colonial Government manner, to be included. As I said, before making
such an order, the Secretary of State must consult the council of the
Isles of Scilly and I challenge any future Secretary of State to go
against the will of the council of the Isles of Scilly. I confirm that
in the process of introducing the clause&#151;and the wider parts of
the Bill as well&#151;we have regularly been in touch with the
council of the Isles of Scilly. As the hon. Gentleman 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column307" />Column number: 307</div>mentioned, it is content with the way in which the Bill has been
drafted. It does not wish the Isles of Scilly to be included in the
legislation at the present time, but the clause holds out the
possibility of doing so if things were to change in the future. To
reiterate, we are following the precedents, in respect of the Isles of
Scilly, that were set out in CROW under the National Parks and Access
to the Countryside Act 1949. They are similar to the provisions that we
have introduced for the Isle of Wight as
well.</div><a name="09071454000082"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09071454000268"></a>Andrew
George:</b>Briefly, once again, I simply wish to probe the
Minister on the advice he has received on subsection (2) (c) in
relation to the Duchy of Cornwall. There are a number of constitutional
issues that apply to the Duchy of Cornwall and I am interested to know
what advice he has received in drafting the clause. There is currently
a debate, which I am sure he is well aware of, about the duchy&#146;s
relationship to the Crown. I am sure that defining the duchy as Crown
land for the purposes of the Bill is legitimate. However, what advice
did he seek on the duchy&#146;s constitutional status? Since the
duchy was established by charters in 1337 to 1338, the Duke of Cornwall
has owned the foreshore around Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. In
England&#151;the hon. Member for Newbury might be interested in
staying awake for this bit&#151;the foreshore is primarily owned by
the Crown. There are also other very interesting constitutional issues
relating to the Duchy of Cornwall. If one dies intestate in Cornwall,
it is quite different from dying intestate on the other side of the
frontier in England. The Duchy of Lancaster, as I understand it, is
much more accountable to Parliament than the Duchy of
Cornwall.</div><a name="09071454000229"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="09071454000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
fact that the UK is without a codified constitution gives rise to a
number of constitutional conundrums, given the accretions to the
English and later British monarchy from 1066. Although I do not wish to
go back over the whole history of the issue, what is interesting in
relation to this matter is the constitutional basis on which the duchy
is incorporated. Those who debate the role of the duchy and its
relationship to the Crown point out that the duchy often defines itself
at the same time in its constitutional role and as a distinct private
estate. I would be interested in any clarification or light the
Minister might be able to throw on the issue in relation to the
clause.</div><a name="09071454000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09071454000269"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Once again, I thank the hon. Member for
St. Ives for raising the issue. I am not a constitutional expert beyond
the fact that it is my role 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column308" />Column number: 308</div>as a legislator to have some knowledge of constitutional issues. The
clause has been drafted by, and included on the advice of,
parliamentary counsel, taking into account the issues raised by the
hon. Gentleman, and they are content with it. Representatives of the
Crown estate and the duchies have been fully involved and consulted and
are content with the Bill constitutionally. It is worth reiterating
that we have a clause that says that the provisions for creating an
English coastal route and access to coastal land apply to the Crown and
all Crown land, as they do to any other land. That includes land
belonging to the Crown and Her Majesty&#146;s private estates, the
Duchy of Lancaster, the Duchy of Cornwall and Government Departments.
It sets out the appropriate authorities that may act on behalf of the
Crown in respect of those different categories of Crown land. We
believe that Crown land should be included in the same way that any
other land will be. For example, the Crown estate owns about half of
the foreshore around the English coast and has traditionally permitted
public access. Under the provisions in the Bill, once fully implemented
through the order under section 3A of the CROW Act and the procedures
set out in the 1949 Act, there is likely to be public access as of
right to the foreshore and to other coastal Crown land, other than
where it is excepted or excluded. I might earlier have said
&#147;Crown estate&#148; when I should have said &#147;Crown
land&#148;.</div>

David Jones</b> (Clwyd, West) (Con): I want to speak briefly
on the clause, which confers primary legislative competence on the
Welsh Assembly by inserting two new provisions&#151;matters 16.2 and
16.3&#151;in field 16, which deals with sport and recreation, of the
Government of Wales Act 2006. Under matter 16.2, the Assembly would be
empowered effectively to create a coastal route in Wales. Matter 16.3,
to which I propose to return, would empower it to secure public access
to relevant land on the coast. The Assembly provided a memorandum on
the background to its application for the powers contained in clause
304 and an indication of how it proposes to exercise them. Will the
Minister comment on the indication given in the Assembly&#146;s
memorandum that, while the Bill provides for the English coastal access
provisions to be binding on the Crown, any provisions in equivalent
Assembly legislation would similarly bind the Crown? The memorandum
stated:</div>
<a name="09071454000215"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;However,
it is not the Assembly Government&#146;s intention that any Assembly
measure&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09071454000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">the

permit the alteration of, the position with regard to access to land
used for purposes within the responsibility of the UK Government
without the agreement of the relevant Secretary of State. In this
context, land at the coast used for railways, airports...docks,
telecommunications, gas, electricity and for military purposes is
particularly
relevant.&#148;</div><a name="09071454000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
memorandum was prepared relatively recently, in June 2009, but I would
appreciate the Minister&#146;s confirmation on the record that his
understanding is that that intention of the Assembly Government
prevails. What would the position be if, for example, a UK Secretary of
State wished to withdraw or amend the consent given to the Assembly
Government for the preparation of the path? In such circumstances,
would the Assembly Government be bound to reconsider and divert the
route of the
path?</div><a name="09071454000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also wish to raise briefly an issue about the interpretation of clause
304. &#147;Coast&#148; in that clause is defined
as</div><a name="09071454000217"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
coast of Wales adjacent to the sea, including the coast of any island
(in the sea) comprised in
Wales&#148;.</div><a name="09071454000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is similar to the definition in clause 294, but there is a subtle
difference. In clause 294, the English
coast</div><a name="09071454000218"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;means
the coast of England adjacent to the sea, including the coast of any
island (in the sea) comprised in England (other than an excluded
island).&#148;</div><a name="09071454000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
excluded island is defined as one
that</div><a name="09071454000219"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is
neither&#151;</div><a name="09071454000220"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
an accessible island,
nor</div><a name="09071454000221"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
an island specified by the Secretary of State by order for the purposes
of this
paragraph.&#148;</div><a name="09071454000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems curious that inaccessible islands appear to be included in the
definition of &#147;coast&#148; in clause 304. There are many
inaccessible islands around the coast of Wales. If I climb to the top
of the hill behind my house I can see Puffin island, which is entirely
inaccessible. Perhaps of more significance are islands such as Ynys
Elli&#151;Bardsey island&#151;which is much larger but equally
inaccessible. Why is there a difference in definition in the Welsh and
English provisions in clauses 304 and
294?</div><a name="09071454000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09071454000272"></a>Mr.
Williams:</b> I rise briefly, out of interest.
Clause 304 includes an amendment to the Government of Wales
Act 2006 to include a new matter under the competence of the Welsh
Assembly, and yet when I proposed a similar amendment, the Minister
said that it was inappropriate in a Bill of this sort to add to the
Welsh Assembly&#146;s powers. It seems that the Government are now
attempting to do just that. Why is this an appropriate place to achieve
what I believe would be a good
result?</div><a name="09071454000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09071454000273"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> If I can start at the end, the hon. Member
for Brecon and Radnorshire has asked about the difference between this
discussion and one that we had previously. The difference is that the
powers for the inclusion of matters were placed in the Bill after
consultation with, and at the request of, the Welsh Assembly
Government, who see this as a possibly useful way
forward.</div><a name="09071454000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will turn to the detailed points in a moment, because some of them
refer to how the Welsh Assembly Government will introduce the necessary
measures that underpin the matters inserted into the fields under the
2006 Act. Again, I risk reverting to my previous role, because the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column310" />Column number: 310</div>clause confers important new legislative competences&#151;in
parliamentary counsel terminology&#151;on the National Assembly for
Wales in relation to public access to and routes for the Welsh coast.
It will add two new matters to field 16, sport and recreation, under
schedule 5(1) to the Government of Wales Act
2006.</div><a name="09071454000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first matter enables the National Assembly for Wales to bring forward a
measure or measures for the establishment or maintenance of a route or
routes on the coast of Wales to enable the public to make recreational
journeys. The second matter enables the Assembly to make a measure or
measures securing public access to relevant land for recreational
purposes. Land will be &#147;relevant&#148; if it is at the coast
or can be used in association with either land at the coast or a
coastal route. I shall come on to the points raised by the hon. Member
for Clwyd, West in a
moment.</div><a name="09071454000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
provisions are intended to add value to the Welsh Assembly
Government&#146;s existing coastal access improvement programme,
which has worked well, by enabling the Assembly to clarify the extent
of public access rights to the Welsh coast and secure new areas of land
for public access, neither of which they can deliver through the
existing coastal access improvement programme due to limitations on
their powers.</div>
<a name="09071454000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can confirm
for the hon. Member for Clwyd, West that the Welsh Assembly Government
briefing to which he referred, dated June 2009, is still valid and the
issues still hold. That is a straight, &#147;Yes&#148;, in response
to his query. As I mentioned in my preamble, the provisions are
enabling powers that allow the WAG to decide the appropriate way to
deal with islands. They may decide to limit access to islands, for
example, but, under the Government of Wales Act 2006, we insert matters
in the fields to allow the Assembly Government to bring forward
measures, subject to consultation, so that they have the flexibility to
take issues forward and that they are comfortable with that
position.</div>
<a name="09071454000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman also raised the issue of railways and so on in list in the
same document. I confirm that defence, railways and so on are reserved
matters, so the briefing is still
correct.</div><a name="09071454000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09071454000274"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> I am grateful for the indication that the Minister
has just put on the record. There is one matter that perturbs me
however. There are installations around the coast of Wales connected
with reserved matters. If, for the sake of argument, the relevant
Secretary of State, having consented to the creation of a path that
affected one of those installations, decided later that the path needed
to be diverted, would it be possible to go back to the Assembly and
say, &#147;I would like you to divert your path
please.&#148;?</div><a name="09071454000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09071454000275"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> The question is whether the Secretary of
State can decide to change the route. If the WAG used their enabling
powers to pass legislation, it would be primary legislation, as the
hon. Gentleman knows. The Secretary of State could repeal it, but only
through primary legislation or an order under the Government of Wales
Act 2006. There is a route, but it is not
easy.</div>
<a name="09071454000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09071454000276"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> It is not an easy route; it is a draconian route.
The impression given in the memorandum furnished to the Committee is
that the Assembly Government 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column311" />Column number: 311</div>would not create a route that affected an installation that was subject
to the sway of a UK Minister without the consent of that Minister.
Circumstances might subsequently change, in which case if the Secretary
of State went back to the Assembly Government and said,
&#147;I&#146;m sorry, but I&#146;m afraid that that route is
going to have to be diverted,&#148; is it the Minister&#146;s
understanding that the Assembly Government would acquiesce and divert
the
route?</div><a name="09071454000230"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="09071454000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09071454000277"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b><b class="B"> </b>The hon. Gentleman makes a good
point. If the route changed and the Secretary of State indicated that
it then impinged upon reserved matters, such as defence, he would make
his views known to the Welsh Assembly Government Minister and would
expect those views to be taken into account. As with the original use
of the powers given to WAG to develop a route, the way in which the
provision is set up means that the Secretary of State would have to be
engaged with on reserved matters in relation to any subsequent
alteration of the route. If the Secretary of State indicated that the
alteration impinged upon reserved matters, WAG would need to take note
and, where necessary, alter the route
accordingly.</div><a name="09071454000112"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09071454000278"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> I am sorry to labour the point, but this is a
matter of some importance. The clear impression given by the memorandum
is that WAG would not create a coastal route that affected land that is
the subject of reserved powers, if the Secretary of State withheld
consent. The clarification that I am seeking, which I think the
Minister is giving, is that if the Secretary of State decided, for
whatever reason, that a route was no longer convenient, WAG would
acquiesce and change the path&#146;s
route.</div><a name="09071454000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09071454000279"></a>Huw

to which the hon. Gentleman has referred. As he has said, on the
initial implementation of any proposals and on any subsequent
proposals, WAG need to pay heed to, and work with, the Secretary of
State when he states that developments impinge upon reserved matters,
such as defence. That would have to be taken into account and an
alternative route would have to be found. I will write to the hon.
Gentleman and other members of the Committee to clarify precisely that
point, because it is an important issue and we want to ensure that the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09071454000282"></a>Andrew
George:</b> That is right; I am a mainlander. The new schedule
would ensure that Natural England is consulted by a local authority
that wishes to implement a dog control order on coastal paths. I urge
the Committee not to be prejudiced by the totally unacceptable way in
which a minority of dog owners allow their dogs to behave in public
spaces or by their failure to clean up after them, although such issues
cannot be
ignored.</div><a name="09071454000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Kennel Club and other dog-owner organisations are understandably eager
for as full access as possible to the coastal path, but they are
concerned about the frequency, as they see it, with which local
authorities implement control orders, often without proper
consultation. There are 8 million pet dogs in the UK cared for by an
estimated 15 million people, which is an average of almost 12,400
resident dogs per parliamentary constituency. Government statistics
show that dog walkers represent between one third and one half of all
walkers. Dog walkers also represent a cross-section of society, drawn
from across all socio-economic
backgrounds.</div><a name="09071454000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Research
by Hampshire county council shows that the biggest factor influencing
where dog walkers exercise their dogs is whether they can exercise
their dogs off-lead. If it is not possible to do that within the local
area, more than 40 per cent. say that they would drive further away
from where they live. However, dog owners&#146; ability to comply
with their obligations under the Animal Welfare Act 2006, to provide
their dogs off-leash exercise, has sometimes been compromised by the
introduction of another parliamentary measure that restricts their
activities&#151;dog control orders under the Clean Neighbourhoods and
Environment Act 2005&#151;especially where no alternative provision
is made. In effect, two Acts are crashing on dog owners and appear to
be in
conflict.</div><a name="09071454000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">DEFRA
guidance accompanying the 2005 Act states that local authorities should
show that dog control orders
are</div><a name="09071454000222"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
necessary and proportionate response to problems caused by the
activities of dogs and those in charge of
them&#148;</div><a name="09071454000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
should</div><a name="09071454000223"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;balance
the interests of those in charge of dogs against the interests of those
affected by the activities of
dogs&#148;.</div><a name="09071454000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Kennel Club believes that in practice the guidance has been widely
ignored and many local authorities are taking a more restrictive
approach&#151;I use &#147;believes&#148;, because I do not go
along entirely with the club&#146;s approach in every respect.
Furthermore, while local authorities are required to notify Natural
England of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column313" />Column number: 313</div>any proposed dog control orders on access land, the club claims that few
appear to have done so. The lack of any appeals process has, according
to the club, allowed some local authorities to ignore the
guidance.</div><a name="09071454000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
date, at least 120 councils in England have implemented dog control
orders, sometimes issuing as many as 100 in the local area, although
there could well be more. The Kennel Club believes that approximately
75 authorities already exclude or restrict dogs on their beaches. The
effect of the increasing reduction of access to public open space is
making dog ownership less viable and may therefore negate the many
health, social and economic
benefits.</div><a name="09071454000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
balance the issue, the Government should reflect on the potential for
the increased role of Natural England in respect of the introduction of
dog control orders because, in many areas, restrictions on dog access
to the coast has been flouted by dog owners. I give an example from my
constituency. On the north coast, near Hayle, there are between 3.5 and
4 miles of towans or sand dunes. A large section was sold yesterday for
&#163;80,000, and it was on the national news. The towans are planted
predominantly with marram grass and other vegetation such as bracken
heath. The owner of that land thankfully cannot do a lot with it due to
restrictions. There are ground-nesting birds in the area, particularly
at this time of year. Currently, dogs are entitled to exercise off the
lead throughout the year in the area. If Natural England was more
involved in the setting of dog control orders, that might have resulted
in seasonal restrictions on the ability of dog owners to allow their
dogs to exercise off the lead. Over the past decade or more, as the
exercising of dogs in the area has increased, the preponderance of
ground-nesting birds has decreased significantly because of the
disturbance caused by dog owners. The Kennel Club is arguing that
Natural England should be involved, because it believes that local
authorities are not doing a good job. It thinks that that would be a
means by which to appeal to Natural England&#146;s better nature and
achieve a more acceptable dog-control order than that implemented by
local authorities. My argument is that there would be the additional
benefit of flora and fauna protection. I therefore hope that the
Minister will reflect on the need at least to allow the advice of
Natural England to be considered properly when the dog-control orders
are implemented.</div>
<a name="09071454000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09071454000283"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> There was great debate in another place about the
wording used under the Bill about the control of dogs; it came down to
the effective control of dogs. Like many people, I was concerned about
a farmer having to pay &#163;10,000 to a dog walker who was injured
by a herd of cows. The actions of cattle are often centred not on
individuals, but on the dog walking beside them, so a rule restricting
the type of dog access, such as an order requiring dogs to be on a
lead, is not always the best answer. In an incident, someone&#146;s
immediate action would be to let go of the dog and he find himself in
contravention of a byelaw.</div>
<a name="09071454000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">I just hope
that such legislation will not drive a coach and horses through
established local byelaws. We can all think of areas of coastal Britain
where, after local consultation, town councils, parish councils or
large authorities designate an area a dog-free beach and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column314" />Column number: 314</div>make other areas available for dog walking. The matter is all about
balance. Such issues should not be controlled from Whitehall. There
should be understanding. The Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act
2005 was designed principally with urban areas in mind. I am
sympathetic to the new schedule tabled by the hon. Member for St. Ives,
but I want to make sure that legislative creep will not impose
adversely on local communities, make decisions made on their behalf and
impinge on the liability of landowners or the rights of dog
walkers.</div><a name="09071454000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09071454000284"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Ann
McKechin):</b> I welcome the debate. The key point made by the
hon. Members for St. Ives and for Newbury is about balance, which is
the principle that we need to bear in mind. As the hon. Member for St.
Ives rightly said, there is a small minority of irresponsible owners. A
number of them might not be aware of the dangers that sometimes occur
in coastal areas. An official from DEFRA recently visited Pembrokeshire
where, in the months since access has been extended, there has been a
number of cases of dogs falling off cliffs because they had seen
something attractive and had gone after it. In such cases, people end
up either with a dead dog or with a rescue situation that involves
considerable expense with the use of coastguards, the Royal National
Lifeboat Institution and so on. It is important that we bear in mind
safety as well as the welfare of livestock, which is a particular
worry.</div><a name="09071454000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
couple of weeks ago, I read an article about problems that have been
experienced in Iona, which is one of our great cultural assets.
Unfortunately, the increasing number of visitors and the increasing
number of dogs that are with them have caused several problems for the
croft owners in that small geographical area. Likewise, we need to
consider the protection of crops. Along the east coast in particular,
some valuable crops, such as asparagus, run almost right into the sea.
As they are not fenced off, it is important that appropriate
protections are put in place concerning people&#146;s domestic pets.
I do not object to the sentiments raised by the hon. Member for St.
Ives but, as the hon. Member for Newbury pointed out, it is a question
of where the rules are best placed, and I would argue that it is not in
primary
legislation.</div><a name="09071454000231"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="09071454000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
was extensive discussion in the other place on the question of dogs and
the impact on land management and nature conservation. Lord Tyler
helpfully informed the other place that there are about 7.3 million
dogs in the UK, and 15 million dog owners. In the same debate, Lord
Hunt acknowledged the importance to land managers, people accompanied
by a dog, other users and responsible organisations such as the Kennel
Club and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, of a common
understanding of the sort of behaviour that we should expect from a
person in charge of a
dog.</div><a name="09071454000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord
Hunt noted the Government&#146;s intention to consult on proposals to
amend the restrictions in schedule 2 of CROW for the purpose of coastal
access to require dogs to be kept under effective control. We propose
that the keeper of a dog should keep it on relevant access land, and
keep it on a lead or keep it in sight and remain aware of its actions.
A person should have reason to be confident that his or her dog will
return reliably and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column315" />Column number: 315</div>promptly on command. We have also listened to the concerns that the
National Farmers Union expressed about the walking of dogs near
livestock. In view of that, we do not propose to make any change to the
current position on open country that a person should keep his dog on a
short lead in the vicinity of livestock and that they should comply
with any other relevant restrictions made under chapter II of the CROW
Act.</div>
<a name="09071454000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
schedule tabled by the hon. Member for St. Ives seeks to
make an amendment to the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005.
As he pointed out, that Act provides for an appropriate authority to
make a dog control order for land in its area and to consult with
persons specified in regulations before doing so. He mentioned that the
Kennel Club had expressed concern about the lack of consultation. We
are aware of that, although it has not provided any specific examples.
To be fair, if people present specific examples, it gives more validity
to the allegations that are
made.</div><a name="09071454000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are provisions in the regulations with respect to consultation about
orders that would affect CROW access land, and the new schedule would
require the appropriate authority to consult Natural England where a
proposed order would affect the English coastal route. We have made it
clear that we want local authorities to be involved, where appropriate
and where they are willing to do so, in proposals for the
implementation of coastal access. That was a point well made by the
hon. Member for Newbury. It is a decision most effectively made at
local level, where local knowledge is available and councils are
locally and democratically accountable to residents. That is what the
Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 enables the local
authority to
do.</div><a name="09071454000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
regulations already provide for the sort of consultation that the hon.
Member for St. Ives is seeking in the new schedule. Where an order
would affect access land under CROW, the authority is required
specifically to consult the access authority for that land; the local
access forum; and, in respect of any land that is not situated in a
national park, Natural England. When the Bill receives Royal Assent, we
will consider whether the regulations should be amended to require
consultation with Natural England in all cases regarding coastal
margin, including land within national parks, but we do not need to
make such a provision in the
Bill.</div><a name="09071454000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09071454000285"></a>Andrew
George:</b> I just wanted to check that what I heard was
right. Did the Minister say that there is a requirement to consult
Natural England, but only in circumstances where it affects only
national parks? In the cases I cited earlier, there are areas outside
national parks where it is very clear that Natural England should be
consulted, because it has the expertise.</div>
<a name="09071454000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09071454000286"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> At present, there is a requirement to consult
Natural England unless the land is part of a national park. We are
considering further regulations when the Bill receives Royal Assent to
include all land, including national parks, so we would extend the
measure.</div><a name="09071454000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Newbury raised a question about established local
byelaws. I am pleased to confirm that the provisions in the Bill do not
affect local byelaws and we fully intend that that system should remain
in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column316" />Column number: 316</div>place. Our aim for the coastal route is that it should be continuous as
far as reasonably practicable for dog walkers, and I am sympathetic to
the view that we should try to do everything possible within reason to
allow that to be facilitated. However, we also recognise that
restrictions are needed. The hon. Member for St. Ives said
that he was accompanied by his dog when he unveiled a mid-way marker
along the south-west coast path in Cornwall recently, and I am happy to
tell him that we will review the need for any changes to the
regulations once the Bill has completed its passage through Parliament.
On that basis I urge him not to press his new
schedule.</div>
<a name="09071454000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09071454000287"></a>Andrew
George:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for her response.
Although I have much sympathy for the Kennel Club&#146;s concerns in
this regard, I thought there was a sufficiently substantive issue for
us to have a debate and to clarify some of the points that have
emerged. As the Minister rightly pointed out, we need to strike a fair
balance between the desires of those who walk their dogs and other
users of coastal paths and beaches. I agree that the most appropriate
place to resolve those potential conflicts is at local level through
democratically elected local authorities. Local control orders are
clearly the best vehicle to achieve that.</div>
<a name="09071454000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">However&#151;and
I think the Minister took this on board&#151;there is a requirement
to balance the interests of those who want to exercise their dogs off
the lead and the protection of coastal fauna. In some parts of coastal
areas, local authorities still do not seem to have quite got the
balance right. I mentioned ground-nesting birds, but there are other
seasons when the intrusion of dogs exercising off the lead can be
detrimental to fauna on the coast. We have to get the balance right.
Having heard the Minister&#146;s response to the debate, I think the
balance is absolutely right: if in doubt, the decision should be taken
at a local level, but in consultation with the experts. I believe that
Natural England has a substantial body of expertise on which local
authorities can draw, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
motion.</div><a name="09071454000142"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Schedule,

Salter</b> (Reading, West) (Lab): I rise in the hope of
teasing some response out of the Minister about the functions of
Natural England. Before I do so, I should point out that last week I
all but accused the Countryside Alliance of not lobbying us on a
cross-party basis and of being the Tory party at prayer and field. That
was monstrous of me. The Countryside Alliance did lobby me, but I
completely failed to read its e-mails. I should like to put that on the
record as a matter of good
grace.</div><a name="09071454000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am worried that we could be about to over-complicate the process for
designating sites of special scientific interest or national nature
reserves. The current arrangements with Natural England being the
notifying authority have worked well for years, yet in the Bill we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column317" />Column number: 317</div>are bringing in a new power for the Secretary of State to intervene and
call in these notifications in sub-tidal areas. I am confused about how
that process would work in practice. The Minister needs to explain that
to the Committee and possibly to return to it on
Report.</div><a name="09071454000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are already more than 60,000 hectares of sub-tidal SSSIs, and the power
we envisage will apply only to new or renotified SSSIs. However, the
power runs the risk of confusing landowners and land managers, because
it introduces an additional stage in the decision-making process. The
Secretary of State is already a statutory consultee, which is a crucial
point. The clause appears to take little account of the existing
notification process, and we know that within its duties and functions,
Natural England has a duty to notify a site of special scientific
interest if it forms the opinion that the site is of special interest.
Special interest relates solely to scientific questions or to
biological or geological features, as laid down in the United
Kingdom&#146;s sites of special scientific interest guidelines. Legal
precedent has confirmed that that decision can be challenged only on
the grounds of special interest, but I, Natural England and others are
unclear as to the basis on which the Secretary of State can intervene
if the grounds for the notification process are so clearly laid out. We
could end up with a slightly absurd merry-go-round of
notification, denotification as a result of the Secretary of
State&#146;s intervention, then renotification, because whatever has
been put in the Bill does not absolve Natural England of the
responsibility to notify sites of special interest. I am not entirely
sure that the Government have thought that
through.</div><a name="09071454000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is also uncertainty about how the time scale is affected. Currently,
landowners, land mangers and land users have nine months from the date
of notification to know whether an SSSI designation will be put in
place. Does the Secretary of State who is calling in the process stop
the clock, and if so, for how long? I can see a calling-in procedure
locking a process in the bowels of the Department for Environment, Food
and Rural Affairs for months, and possible years, while it is
considered. There is also the issue of what to do with the site, what
can be done with it, and how it affects land values and future usage.
The Minister was clear and helpful about marine conservation zones, and
a 12-month timetable was put on the designation process.</div>
<a name="09071454000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
think that this issue can be dealt with today. It requires further
consideration and thought on Report, because we need to be assured that
there is some purpose in what the Government intend, and that they are
not effectively driving a coach and horses through a system that works
well, and that we will not build in unintended consequences purely
because the Minister wants to be a backstop in the designation of SSSIs
in tidal
areas.</div><a name="09071454000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
area of confusion&#151;and this is another reason why I do not think
that this issue can be resolved this morning&#151;stems from the fact
that the powers apply only to SSSIs in sub-tidal areas. There are many
SSSIs that span non-tidal and tidal areas. Are we going to have one
process for designation and notification when the tide is in and
another when the tide is out? That has not been clearly thought through
but, hopefully with the Committee&#146;s support, we have picked up a
potential 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column318" />Column number: 318</div>glitch in the system. I am sure that the Minister will have the good
grace to enable us to bottom out the issue and resolve it on
Report.</div><a name="09071454000232"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09071454000289"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> This is a good example of a Committee
really adding value to legislative scrutiny, and I thank my hon. Friend
for raising his point. He is absolutely right that it is imperative
that the Bill&#146;s provisions provide an effective and efficient
means of delivering our shared policy
aims.</div><a name="09071454000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is not clear to me whether there are any flaws in schedule 13, but I
recognise my hon. Friend&#146;s concerns and will look at the
schedule&#146;s provisions and engage with Natural England to ensure
that we have got it right. We all want clarity and a Bill that
functions well, and I will therefore take a further look. In light both
of my hon. Friend&#146;s comments and of similar comments made to us
by Natural England about the clarity of the process of designating
sites of special scientific interest and marine conservation zones in a
sub-tidal area, we are currently engaged in a process called
&#147;process mapping&#148;&#151;by and large, I strenuously try
to avoid jargon, and I promise that that is the one piece of jargon
that I will
use.</div><a name="09071454000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
I strip out the jargon, that means working with Natural England to try
to see&#151;on the rare occasions where this may overlap in
decision-making&#151;exactly where we can give clarity about how it
holds together. Having said that, I am happy to look at this again
between now and on Report to see whether it needs clarification or
something else.</div>
<a name="09071454000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09071454000290"></a>Martin
Salter:</b> Does the Minister agree that neither the
Government nor his Department intended to introduce two entirely
different regimes for the notification of SSSIs, depending on whether
they are above or below the tide limit? If the Minister wants to get
rid of jargon, I see no purpose in the word &#147;sub-tidal&#148;.
It is either tidal or it is
not.</div><a name="09071454000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09071454000291"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> It may help if I expand on what we intend
this part of the Bill to do. The Secretary of State is responsible in
England for contributing to the network of marine protected areas,
which will include all relevant areas. That means, in addition to
marine conservation zones, sites of special scientific interest, among
others. We must give the Secretary of State the ability to select sites
that will form the network for which he is responsible. It would be
wrong to make him accountable for a network and then deny him the right
to designate the sites for it. There is no argument that the Secretary
of State should be responsible for selecting the other marine protected
areas in the network&#151;marine conservation zones, special areas of
conservation, special protection areas and Ramsar sites for important
wetlands. On that basis, it would be odd to legislate for the Secretary
of State not to have that power for the marine aspects of
SSSIs.</div>
<a name="09071454000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have to
take account of the fact that biology, ecology and the vast variety of
wildlife do not recognise those administrative boundaries. The problem
is that habitats do not always fall neatly into terrestrial or marine
areas, which is precisely what schedule 13 is about. We need to provide
clarity and an administrative way to deal with that overlap. On the
marine side, the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column319" />Column number: 319</div>Secretary of State is responsible for delivery; on the land side,
Natural England is. I am a little concerned about one potential way
forward. If we were to strip out the Secretary of State&#146;s role
so that he does not have the power of direction, a non-elected public
body would be placed higher in the pecking order of decision making in
the marine area than the elected Minister of the Crown, whom Parliament
had made responsible for delivery.</div>
<a name="09071454000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09071454000292"></a>Martin
Salter:</b> I am sorry but I am struggling with the logic of
this. We have already given Natural England that power under previous
legislation on land. What is the
difference?</div><a name="09071454000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09071454000293"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> This is about clarity and my willingness
to look at it to see that it actually works. I do not want to create
the impression that this power will be used at every
opportunity&#151;we have to recognise that. We also have to recognise
that the Government and Natural England will be working extremely
closely together to create the marine network in partnership. Natural
England and the Government will be working hand in hand on the marine
aspects, while Natural England will work separately on the development
of future potential SSSI sites. Those bodies will have to engage
closely, through the necessity of the Bill and other legislation. As
Natural England is intimately involved in both the land-based and the
marine protected area regimes, I seriously doubt there will be any
places where we will not be able to agree whether an area should be a
site of special scientific interest or a marine conservation
zone.</div>
<a name="09071454000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also
worth noting that the Secretary of State has a duty in the Bill to
report to Parliament in 2012 on progress in designating the network. We
have to make the two processes work together. I am willing to have a
look at the provision in the light of my hon. Friend&#146;s comments
to see what we can do. I also want to look at the process
mapping&#151;sorry for the strange jargon&#151;on how the provision
will work, so that we can achieve some
clarity.</div><a name="09071454000159"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09071454000296"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> A very quick question for the Minister regarding
subsection (2)(a) which refers to the Marine Management Organisation.
When will the Minister bring forward details of the board and the chief
executive of this new organisation? Can he tell us how many members of
the Marine and Fisheries Agency have indicated that they are prepared
to move to the new headquarters in Tyneside? Has a building been
identified in
Tyneside?</div><a name="09071454000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09071454000297"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I have already put some clarity&#151;as
much as I can at the moment&#151;on the record regarding the
appointment of board members, the chief executive and the designate
chairman who is now in place. I refer the hon. Gentleman back to the
part of the debate where I put that on record.</div>
<a name="09071454000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
transfer of existing Marine and Fisheries Agency staff to the MMO, we
have already indicated that Tyneside will be the home of the new MMO,
but we have not yet finalised the accommodation. We are still in
discussion with MFA staff. In any significant relocation of that type,
there is always a significant loss of headquarters staff due to family
reasons and so on. I have previously made it clear that we are working
very effectively with the MFA, its unions and its staff, and we will
continue to do so. The chief executive post, as I previously mentioned,
has already been advertised. The board members will follow on behind
that. I am happy to write to the hon. Gentleman, if he would like
further clarification. It is also worth saying that we are on target.
The building that will be the home of the MMO will be chosen
imminently, and we are still finalising the staff numbers to
relocate.</div>
<a name="09071454000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09071454000298"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> I suspect that the Minister&#146;s contentment
in thinking that the Government are on target is a very optimistic
state of affairs indeed. The MFA has very serious morale problems. My
understanding is that very few staff have indicated thus far that they
are willing to go. My concern is not only for them, but for the
integrity of the new organisation, which must hit the ground running.
We have a short time scale, and it is important that we transfer as
much expertise as possible from the MFA to the MMO. It is a worry if we
cannot 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column321" />Column number: 321</div>guarantee that we can get there. Will the Minister give us more
assurances that he will engage with those people and give the ones whom
we want to transfer an incentive to join the new
organisation?</div><a name="09071454000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09071454000299"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. We are going very wide of the clause, but
the Minister may respond, if he
wishes.</div><a name="09071454000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09071454000300"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Only in short, Mr. Gale. The
level of engagement and consultation that we have had with the work
force and the representative bodies is significant, intensive and
ongoing. We have always recognised that in the relocation, there would
be those who would choose not to relocate for either family or
professional reasons. However, it is wrong for the hon. Member for
Newbury wildly to suggest that we are not adequately ensuring that the
transfer of ability and knowledge in the process through the MFA and
the other organisations that will form part of the MMO is not being
properly
addressed.</div><a name="09071454000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can
I give the hon. Gentleman an assurance that we are on target? Yes, I
can. Despite the time scale being one of the toughest and most
challenging for the vesting of a new organisation, we are adhering to
it. Can I assure him that the existing expertise, not only in terms of
marine science, but fisheries, is adequately addressed? Yes, I can.
That is not to say that it is not challenging. However, there could not
have been a greater level of engagement than we have had and are
continuing to have. We recognise that the existing expertise in the MFA
will need to be transferred effectively, and that new expertise will
need to be brought in. It is important to remember that the MMO is not
the MFA; it is not even the MFA-plus or a super MFA. It is a new
organisation that builds on the expertise in the MFA, and significantly
augments and expands the expertise into a range of areas. Within its
new home, the organisation will expand and reach out to all the areas
of expertise that we will need, not least in marine
science.</div><a name="09071454000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that the hon. Gentleman wants to represent the concerns of
those who did not want to move, or did not want to move to that
location, but I urge him not to undermine what has been a strong,
concerted and thorough process to engage with the affected individuals.
Those who have chosen not to move have been at the forefront of our
concerns to ensure that their careers are looked after and that their
expertise is not lost to the wider DEFRA family or
elsewhere.</div><a name="09071454000181"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

McKechin:</b> The amendments provide for the early
commencement of the provisions in part 3 on marine planning relating to
the preparation and publication of a statement of public participation
concerning the involvement of interested parties in the development of
the marine policy statement. The amendments will enable us to publish
the statement of public participation as soon as we have Royal Assent,
rather than waiting for a further two
months.</div><a name="09071454000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
Members will be aware, the marine policy statement will be the first
stage of the new marine planning system. Marine plans have to be in
conformity with it, so as to ensure a joined-up, UK-wide approach. We
wish to publish an MPS as soon as possible, and to be able to consult
on it by early spring of 2010. To do so, we need to ensure that the
formal consultation procedures set out in the Bill can be carried out
as soon as
possible.</div><a name="09071454000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
we can issue the MPS for consultation, we need to issue a statement of
public participation, which will set out how we propose to involve
interested persons throughout the UK in preparation of the MPS,
including a proposed timetable for consultation. It is important that
we allow a reasonable period between the issue of the statement of
public participation and the consultation draft of the MPS. We wish to
give interested parties as much notice as possible of when and how we
will consult on the draft MPS, which will enable them to plan ahead for
making representations and attending any public meetings about the
consultation
draft.</div><a name="09071454000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">Currently,
part 3 of the Bill is not commenced until two months after Royal

Therefore, subject to parliamentary approval, Royal Assent is not
expected before the end of October at the earliest. That means that the

days of Lord Kingsland, who was a significant contributor to

I also take this opportunity to thank the Under-Secretary of State for

been a sterling effort. I also thank my hon. Friend the Member for

particularly thank the hon. Members for Newbury and for St. Ives for
their significant
contributions.</div><a name="09071454000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
worth recording the efforts of the expert, dedicated and enthusiastic
Bill team who support me when I get into trouble, which is quite often.
I also want to pass on my regards to those described by what the hon.
Member for Newbury refers to as a horrible S-word&#151;stakeholders,
not socialism&#151;who have lobbied us, and will continue to do so,
for their energetic engagement with both the marine and coastal access
parts of the Bill. One person whom I have not previously mentioned, but
who is worth recalling, is the former chair of Natural England, Sir
Martin Doughty, who was a committed advocate of the Bill. I think he
will be gently smiling down on
us.</div><a name="09071454000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thank
you also to the Committee Clerks for their work and to the Serjeant at
Arms and the police for maintaining order on this riotous Bill over the
past few weeks. Not least, Mr. Gale, I thank you and your
colleague, Mr. Pope, for your careful stewardship of what, I
think, has been a very good Committee on a Bill that was very good when
it entered here and that leaves even
better.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09071454000306"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> Further to that point of order, Mr.
Gale. I am grateful to the Minister for his kind words about Lord
Kingsland, who, as he has said, was very active in moving amendments in
another place. The Minister has been generous in his thanks, and I can
only echo them and thank all members of the Committee. We have worked
well on a cross-party basis to improve the Bill. There is more work to
be done, which, no doubt, we will do with a similar co-operative
attitude. I thank the Minister&#146;s Bill team, who have kept us
informed at every step in a very professional way. I am grateful to the
Minister and, of course, to the Committee Clerks, who have steered us
along.</div><a name="09071454000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is really
important legislation, and I look forward to its getting Royal Assent
as soon as possible. I think that I speak for all Opposition Members
when I say how grateful we are to the many organisations
that have lobbied us, and we hope to continue to
work with them when the Bill is implemented. The legislation
has excited much more interest from a greater number of people than
many pieces of legislation do, and I hope that we can represent as many
of their views as possible in the final legislation. Thank you,
Mr.
Gale.</div><a name="09071454000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09071454000307"></a>Andrew
George:</b> Further to that point of order, Mr.
Gale. I thank you and Mr. Pope. I also associate myself with
the thanks and appreciation that the Minister and the hon. Member for
Newbury have expressed to all those involved in the preparation
and guiding of the process, which we have frankly simply
been fronting? Many organisations have been passionately campaigning
for and supporting the process. I also associate myself with the views
expressed about the late Lord
Kingsland.</div><a name="09071454000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">During the
proceedings, I have not sought to enforce the favour that I believe the
Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs still
owes me, but I thank and congratulate him and the Under-Secretary of
State for Scotland on the manner in which they have conducted
themselves, which has made the proceedings a great deal more
constructive and has been beneficial to the
legislation.</div><a name="09071454000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final
point is to repeat that this is a very important piece of legislation.
We have merely completed the Committee debates. I urge the
Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, in
speaking to business managers and on Report, to remember that a number
of issues raised during these debates still remain. They
concern local accountability and ensuring that the MMO and
Natural England do not micro-manage local circumstances and also that
the local authorities have a role in this and that we get, and test
that we have, the right and fair balance between conservation and
socio-economic consequences. There are also still the issues of
ensuring that the Bill has a real impact beyond the six-mile limit and
of compensation on the coastal margins, which needs teasing
out still
further.</div><a name="09071454000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once
the announcement has been made during the summer recess about the
boundaries of the IFCAs and the new authorities, residual issues may
well arise. We may need to come back to consider those issues on
Report, when I hope that there will be sufficient time to debate those,
and other, issues as well.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09071454000308"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I add my thanks to the Committee for the
courteous and exemplary manner in which these affairs have been
effectively conducted. It always occurs to me that it is a great pity
that more members of the public do not see the real work of the House
of Commons in Committee. If people saw these kinds of proceedings, they
might take a rather different view of the House. It is a sad fact that
there is no controversy here and not a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column326" />Column number: 326</div>television camera in sight. I also add my thanks to the Officers of the
House, without whose assistance our proceedings would quite simply be
impossible.</div><a name="09071454000209"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
