<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Good morning, gentlemen. I am not sure whether we are reaching the peak or are on the lower slopes on the way down. I sense a desire to make progress and, on that basis, I propose to allow a fairly wide-ranging debate on the opening amendment on clause 193.

<H4><center>Clause 193</center></H4>
<H4><center>Functions relating to Board's property</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lawrie Quinn </B>(Scarborough and Whitby): I beg to move amendment No. 853, in page 108, line 27, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`in furtherance of its purpose and strategies.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
This amendment is to probe and tease out the Government's long-term view of the duties and responsibilities for the land base that the SRA will acquire. With your permission, Mr. Gale, may I allude again to my previous existence in the railway industry? One of my periodic duties and responsibilities was to liaise directly with the British Railways Board about the sale of its land assets. My responsibility was to judge the effect of any proposed sale on the safety of the operational railway. That was my responsibility as a chartered civil engineer, but as I had wider interests in the development of the rail infrastructure, it occurred to me that those resources could be utilised when the rail renaissance, to which all members of the Committee have alluded, came about. At some time, purely for short-term financial gain, the British Railways Board might be encouraged by another party to sell off land that could be used to provide useful transport infrastructure.

<P>
Some years ago, in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Mr. Leslie)-who, I am sorry to say, is not here-when his predecessor, Sir Marcus Fox, was the local Member of Parliament, a developer asked to purchase some adjacent railway land that was not being used for operational purposes. As the engineer responsible, I had to consider the proposed sale and decide its impact on the future safe running of the railway. The developer wanted to build a deep swimming pool. The land was above a deep railway cutting. The proposal was to excavate the land, which would have had a serious impact on the stability of the cutting slope.

<P>
I had a good deal of correspondence and many telephone conversations with the former Member for Shipley, who was doing his duty as a constituency Member should in advocating the purchase of the land by the proposed developer. At the time, Sir Marcus did not recognise my political position-I merely applied my professional responsibilities-and did not appreciate not only that the development of the railway land might have a detrimental effect on the stability of the cutting slope, but that the land might be of considerable use in the future.

<P>
That was the conundrum. I had to justify the professional decision that I was taking to my immediate bosses-and to theirs. After much to-ing and fro-ing, it was decided that it was not in the best interests of the railway industry for the land to be sold, not simply from the point of view of short-term safety, but also because the local passenger transport executive might want to use it if, say, a new railway station was required in the location.

<P>
During our debate, it would be useful if we could clarify whether the new responsibilities of the SRA, as set out in clauses 180 to 181, will include consideration of strategies to take account of the long-term potential of railway infrastructure. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will be able to explain how long-term purposes and strategies will be considered. Through the amendment, I want to tease out some views on that issue.

<P>
<B>Dr. Gavin Strang </B>(Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh): I congratulate my hon. Friend for tabling the amendment. It deals with an important issue and he spoke on the basis of his great knowledge and experience of the industry. He does the Committee and the House a service by focusing attention on it.

<P>
At the time of privatisation, important assets were sold and then resold shortly after at three times the price that had been obtained for the state. We shall not see a repeat of that, but railway land has been sold off unwisely in other circumstances, particularly against the background of a welcome upturn in the traffic on the railways. Not only has the number of passengers increased, but the Government also deserve credit for encouraging more freight to go by rail. As I am sure that the Committee knows, within the first year after taking power, we doubled the grants paid to encourage private operators to invest in rail freight depots and other facilities and equipment. There are some things about which all Members of the House agree, regardless of their political persuasion, and one is the desirability of encouraging more rail freight.

<P>
My hon. Friend is asking that we ensure that the new set-up on the railways is not under pressure always to take the short-term view. Public Departments have been under pressure to sell assets to realise money in the short term over the years. We do not want that to apply to the railways, in particular against the background of the welcome increase in trade and the increased role that the railways can play in our economy in the decades ahead.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Keith Hill):</B> I fully understand the concerns that led my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh (Dr. Strang) and my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Quinn) to table amendment No. 853. I hope to be able to reassure them that the amendment is not needed for technical reasons. I will respond more fully on railway land matters on amendments Nos. 854 and 804 in the names of my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby and the hon. Members for Bath (Mr. Foster) and for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Mr. Moore).

<P>
I have heard the arguments made by my right hon. and hon. Friends and we have heard a good deal about the land bank. Perhaps they will be content if we put their arguments in the debate bank and I return to them in a moment.

<P>
Amendment No. 853 would require the SRA to dispose of or otherwise deal with former British Rail property, rights and liabilities in a way that appears to the authority to be the most economic and efficient and that furthers its purposes and strategies. I fully understand the objective behind the amendment and sympathise with it, but it is superfluous. I said in response to earlier amendments that clause 193(2) is explicitly about property and rights
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>which are  not required by the Authority for the discharge of any of its other functions<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If land has the prospect of railway use, it will be dealt with in accordance with the SRA's overall purposes, strategies and functions.

<P>
In the light of that explanation and assurance, I hope that my right hon. and hon. Friends will agree to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Quinn:</B> I thank my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary for pointing out that we shall be moving on to a more extensive debate on the next two amendments. With due respect, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Moore </B>(Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale): I beg to move amendment No. 804, in page 108, line 34, leave out subsection (4) and insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4) Provided that before disposing of any land the Authority shall, in consultation with the local transport authority and other interested parties, consider what potential for rail or other sustainable transport related uses such land might offer, and protect the land accordingly.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 854, in page 108, line 34, leave out subsection (4) and insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4) In exercising its functions under subsections (2) and (3), the Authority shall use its best endeavours to identify land in its ownership or in the ownership of the Board which may be required for exercising its functions under section 182(2) and (3). In identifying land and in particular prior to disposal of any land it shall consult-

<P>
(a) relevant local planning authorities;

<P>
(b) relevant local transport authorities;

<P>
(c) relevant regional development agencies;

<P>
(d) relevant regional planning bodies;

<P>
(e) relevant rail passengers committees;

<P>
(f) bodies representing the interests of rail freight users;

<P>
(g) the National Assembly for Wales for sites in or affecting Wales;

<P>
(h) the Scottish National Parliament for sites in or affecting Scotland;

<P>
(i) the Greater London Authority for sites in or affecting the Greater London area.

<P>
(5) If as a result of consultation under subsection (4) a potential transport interest is identified in any land which the Authority might otherwise dispose of under subsections (2) and (3), the Authority shall retain and manage that land or shall dispose of it only subject to the potential transport interest being, in its view, fully safeguarded.

<P>
(6) Where a holder of a licence to operate railway assets under section 8 of the Railways Act 1993 wishes to dispose of land in its ownership which has been used for railway purposes in the period since 1st January 1994, the licence holder shall first offer the land to the Authority which shall use the procedures and consultation under subsection (4) to identify any potential transport interest in that land.

<P>
(7) Where under subsection (6) the Authority identifies a potential transport interest in land to be disposed of by a licence holder the Authority shall have the right of first refusal to purchase that land at a valuation to be agreed but reflecting the use of the land for transport purposes.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> We have reached an important part of this section of the Bill, which deals with an issue that has been exercising people throughout the country for a considerable time. The amendment in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Bath would bolster the SRA's consultation process when it is disposing of land to take account of the rail use and other sustainable transport options that are available and would introduce a duty to protect that land if, after consultation, it has been identified that any of it should be kept for future rail applications.

<P>
Clause 180 sets out the purpose of the SRA, including the need for it
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to secure the development of the railway network,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
whereas clause 193 allows the SRA to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>develop land with a view to disposing of it.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a contradictory notion and clause 193 is contrary to the spirit and stated aim of clause 182, which sets out the manner in which the SRA must exercise its functions. Subsection (2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Authority shall act in the way best calaculated- 

<P>
(f) to enable persons providing railway services to plan the future of their businesses with a reasonable degree of assurance.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That requirement for a reasonable degree of assurance requires some confidence that strategically held land assets will be available for that development.

<P>
Opponents of the proposals in the Bill have lined up in considerable numbers. The Railway Development Society said in its briefing that the SRA is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>free to behave just like any other developer or speculator.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Paragraph 99 of the Select Committee's 21st report in the 1998-99 session, which was published on 4 November 1999, states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Several of our witnesses were alarmed that the clause-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which was previously in the Railways Bill but has now been brought forward into this Bill-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>requires that ``any property  not required by the Authority  shall be disposed of or otherwise dealt with.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Paragraph 100 records the views of the different rail freight interests:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Rail Freight Group interpreted clause 14-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
of the then Bill-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>as an instruction ``to sell-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
land-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>off as soon as possible, with no possibility to retain any of it for future freight (and passenger) use''. The Freight Transport Association said that the Authority ``would be able to operate in the same way as the much-criticised British Railways Board, its main responsibility being to sell the land in an `economic and efficient' way''.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Great concern is reported in that all-party Select Committee report, which is still causing great anxiety to different groups in the rail industry.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Committee members will be familiar with the process that was instituted for land sales at the time of the White Paper, which put a stop to the marketing of the land holdings, which were then held by the British Railways Board. Last September, however, the sales were resumed. Procedures were put in place to allow limited consultation with those who might be interested-rail interests, local authorities and other transport operators-giving two months' notice before the formal marketing process was to get under way, with a further two months to be allowed for the bids to be worked up. The critical thinking was not that-quite rightly-some form of consultation was taking place, but that the sales process was under way and therefore everything that was there to be marketed could and should be marketed.

<P>
The only way to prevent the acquisition of potentially significant strategic land holdings would be for any of the rail operators-Railtrack, local transport authorities, local authorities and so on-to come up with a fully funded project that might get a look-in in the sales process. That is a big responsibility and a real problem given the present time scale for re-franchising for the train operators and the fact that the local transport plans for England and Wales are being developed and that similar processes are under way in Scotland and Wales-not least when there is no funding to ensure that those strategic land pockets can be held for future use.

<P>
Transport 2000 has recently been in correspondence with Sir Alastair Morton, the chair of the shadow Strategic Rail Authority and also of the British Railways Board. It highlighted that a number of things are on-going that the sales process threatens to cut across, not least the development of the local transport plans and various model studies and integrated transport initiatives, such as the journey solutions project. Transport 2000 says in its letter that it is concerned that the marketing process will undermine the ability of all those parties to make the most of the new transport philosophy of integration that the Government are proposing-something that we support and that the Bill would broadly deliver.

<P>
In a previous debate, I reported a meeting in my constituency with Chris Austin of the shadow SRA. He talked about land holdings being retained so long as they were not simply for projects that were a gleam in the eye of well-meaning individuals and which might take 20 years to realise. I expressed my alarm at that concept and said that it was shared by many people. It is truly the wrong approach and the wrong attitude for the SRA. It is important that through the Bill, and also through the guidance that it will give the SRA, Ministers make it clear that the SRA has a real duty to identify land that is important for further development and to protect it from development for the wrong purposes.

<P>
May I briefly give some examples from different parts of the United Kingdom? I confess that the first two came from hon. Friends. My hon. Friend the Member for Lewes (Mr. Baker), to whom the Minister kindly referred the other day, has highlighted the fact that land that is being offered for sale and is listed in the British Railways Board catalogue as Newhaven land at North quay in Town harbour, is vital. Newhaven is on the trans-European rail network. Connex is interested in amalgamating the three railway stations in Newhaven, for which this land is potentially important, and English, Welsh and Scottish Railway is interested in developing rail freight in Newhaven, for which the land is also important. The fact that cash will have to be found from local authorities and other sources to prevent the sale of that land is causing great alarm.

<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) has highlighted the Tweedmouth goods yard in his constituency as another example of a land holding that is important, not least because it is under active consideration for a rail freight terminal. My right hon. Friend-and many others in that part of the world-believe that it should not be released under the sales process unless another site in Berwick is identified for the terminal.

<P>
To avoid running the risk of being partial, I will give an example from the constituency of the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh, the Abbeyhill loop. Clearly, that is of close constituency interest to the right hon. Member, but it is strategically important to all of us because of the significance of Waverley station and the overcrowding in Edinburgh at a time when we are hoping that the east coast main line and freight and other services can be developed. We hoped that the Abbeyhill loop would become more significant. We find, however, that local interested parties are having to react to a sales process whereby the land associated with the loop could be sold off. A bid has already been received from a housing developer, which poses a real threat to the land.

<P>
Without naming him, for fear of embarrassing him, I cite a Labour member of Edinburgh City council. He wrote recently to the Scottish Executive's Transport Minister, Sarah Boyack MSP, saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I find it incredible that, having consulted widely  the DETR have gone ahead and put all sites up for sale  It is simply unacceptable for the Government to flog off land which could contribute to a sustainable and integrated transport system for the future  we need to concentrate on the big picture here!<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The whole east coast line is now in danger. If the Abbeyhill loop land is sold off, potential growth around Edinburgh-from all parts of the United Kingdom-could be seriously stunted. That does not fit in with the Government's good philosophy of developing integrated public transport systems. Given that Edinburgh is well into the 60-day notice period for the marketing process and has problems in obtaining funding, it would be simpler for the Under-Secretary, by tabling an amendment himself, to acknowledge and accept what is possible and to stop the process that threatens to undermine the rail system.

<P>
A number of questions remain unanswered. In his reponse to an earlier amendment, the Under-Secretary said that there was no intention to flog off the land or to undermine the rail authority's ability to plan strategically. That is not how people see it. If it were so, why is this widespread marketing process going on? If Transport 2000, the rail operators and different groups think that clause 193 is a bad clause, who could be in favour? It is not for me to speculate that the Treasury is behind it: it sees a nice land bank and the potential to realise gians. The example of the Abbeyhill loop is common wherever there are serious development opportunities.

<P>
I hope that the Under-Secretary will acknowledge that all parts of the country and all political parties are seriously concerned about the proposal and that he will suggest ways to improve it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Snape </B>(West Bromwich, East): The Committee will be grateful to the hon. Members for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale and for Bath for the opportunity to debate these important amendments.

<P>
We are not dealing with a new problem. My right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh, in debating the previous amendments, spoke about the impact of privatisation and the sale of railway land. The problem goes back a long way. I recall going to see Sir Robert Lawrence, then chairman of the British Rail Property Board, about 20 years ago about a similar problem in various parts of the country. Land that would have been useful for future railway development was being sold.

<P>
Bobby Lawrence, as he was universally known, was highly respected. His job at the property board was the culmination of a long and distinguished career on both the operating and commercial sides of the old British Rail. When we spoke then about the amount of land owned by the property board, he pointed out that it had thousands of acres on paper, but much of it was in fairly thin strips in country areas and was not worth very much. The land worth the most money was in and around our major cities-former marshalling yards, carriage sidings and so forth-and was viewed as surplus to railway requirements, even in the 1970s. That shows, as I said, that we are not dealing with a new problem.

<P>
The hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale referred to Edinburgh and the east coast main line. My right hon. Friend should not think that Edinburgh is being singled out, but he will be aware that the A7 trunk road affects not only the east coast main line but the proposals to reopen part of the Waverley route for commuter traffic. It provides another example of the short-sighted land sales that took place in the past. Of course, we should not be using the past tense; they are still going on now.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman pointed out the views of the Railway Development Society and Transport 2000. I have the honour of being honorary vice-president of the Railway Development Society, which writes to me and other interested hon. Members about proposed land sales. I mention ``honorary'' in case the hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin), who is not present in Committee at the moment, bursts through the door and shouts, ``Ah, yet another lucrative job for the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East''.

<P>
In the 1970s, the then freight-only line from Stratford to Cheltenham via Honeybourne was closed. I recently wrote to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary about proposals for a supermarket chain to build a large bridge on the outskirts of Cheltenham which, in the opinion of the Railway Development Society, would have a considerable adverse impact if the line were ever reopened. I received the customary courteous response from my hon. Friend, but I hope that he will forgive me for saying that the matter has not been resolved to the satisfaction of myself or of the Railway Development Society. The issues are not new.

<P>
I am not certain what my hon. Friend can do to reassure the Committee. We have to weigh the future needs of the railway industry with the commercial opportunities that land sales present to those taking the decisions. However, few of us would have thought 20 years ago, when we objected to land sales, that we would see the railway renaissance-an overworked phrase-developing as it is presently. I hope that my hon. Friend will respond to the amendments and assure us that the mistakes of the past will not be repeated.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Quinn:</B> Anendment No. 854 seeks to broaden discussion and consultation on the disposal or otherwise of the land bank that will become the responsibility of the SRA. I will give two recent examples in my constituency.

<P>
Mention has been made of the renewal of the Waverley line, but so far we have not heard about the aspirations of the people of Whitby to be reconnected to the trans-Pennine route by providing a five and a half mile extension from Pickering to Rillington junction at the southern end of what is currently the North Yorkshire Moors Railway-of which I am pleased to be honorary vice president. That link would save something of the order of two and a half hours of tedious travel on the tortuous route via Teesside and Middlesbrough from the wonderful port of Whitby. It would not only benefit passengers but, perhaps more significantly, help to open up the port to rail freight traffic. Any members of the Committee who have had to sit behind a heavy goods vehicle as it tries to battle its way over those very steep hills in the vicinity of Filingdales Early Warning Station, particularly in the height of the summer, will know what I am talking about. The link would generate renaissance both of rail and economic development in the important community of Whitby that, like many other peripheral communities, has been beleaguered and cut off.

<P>
North Yorkshire county council, in considering a proposed supermarket development at Pickering, had regard to the fact that it would sever the potential opportunity for the five and a half mile rail extension. It funded a £40,000 feasibility study as the result of a great public outcry about reducing the potential for this important strategic route to the north-eastern part of my constituency.

<P>
I welcome the local implications of a Strategic Rail Authority that will examine the possibility of future links for communities such as Whitby to the rail network. I also endorse the proposals for the Waverley line, which offer great opportunities for freight traffic from the lumber industry. There is a parallel between that and the proposed link between Pickering and Rillington junction in terms of the lumber industry in the Dolby forest. In a national park, the prospect of extra heavy goods on the roads does not help to meet the requirements of a sustainable tourism industry or the local community. Those two proposals are good news for the future.

<P>
However, this is a tale of two towns. In Scarborough, unfortunately, a supermarket development actually went ahead; it was located directly on the route that formerly linked Scarborough directly with Whitby and, as a consequence, it has severed the potential connection. That is history, but it is an indication of where the wider community aspirations for transport development are neglected. As my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape) said, the failure to recognise the potential is short sighted. I would commend the organisation of which my hon. Friend is-a trustee?

<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> Vice president.

<P>
<B>Mr. Quinn:</B> Vice president. I have been invited to attend its conference in Hull in September, probably to talk about this work. We are looking for an opportunity for wider consultation and for more regard for the wider community interests. Unfortunately, the only way of attaining this would be through the list solution. There will be great disappointment to the people of Scarborough and Whitby, and communities around the country, if we do not consider the long-term potential. We must focus on the priorities of establishing the SRA and hope for a renaissance in our railways. We must deliver a renewal and a re-linking of our railways for communities, particularly Whitby.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> First, I express my gratitute to my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby for giving us the opportunity to debate these important matters. I am also grateful to other hon. Members for tabling amendments that enable us to discuss an issue that has always been very close to my heart. In response to my guru, my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East, I hope to do a great deal to reassure the Committee that the Government do not intend to repeat past mistakes, which, over the years, my hon. Friend and I have fought shoulder to shoulder to rectify. I hope that he will convey my reassurances to the Railway Development Society to allay the anxieties of its members.

<P>
I understand the concerns of hon. Members to ensure that surplus land, that may have transport potential, is not lost by default. It may assist the Committee if I set the issue in context. British Rail's programme for disposing of surplus land has been going on for many years. Furthermore, when the previous Government created Railtrack out of British Rail in 1994, Railtrack took over not only the operational land of BR, but also those closed sites and lines that were thought then to have a realistic prospect of re-opening for passenger or freight use. British Rail retained only the sites that were judged then not to have such potential.

<P>
The previous Government ordered British Rail to sell off its property as quickly as possible. Some of the land, however, is still needed for transport. Transport interests and local authorities told us that important sites were being lost because they did not know what was available and, when they learned, they had insufficient opportunity to bid. That is why we announced, in July 1998, a suspension of sales of remaining BR property. We then asked the British Railways Board to undertake a review of its land holdings, which was completed in September last year.

<P>
The BRB assessment paid particular attention to: large sites available for inter-modal or other freight terminals; land adjacent to passenger stations that might be used for improved access, interchange facilities and car parking; land already identified by transport operators and local authorities as having a specific transport use in the foreseeable future; land adjacent to already identified pinch points in the network; and, land for which the infrastructure for the former transport use remained in situ.

<P>
The BRB took into account the physical suitability of the site for transport use and whether that use was in keeping with local planning policies objectives and plans. The BRB's consideration encompassed all types of transport and allowed for imaginative ideas, provided that they were well thought out, took account of key industry players' plans for the future and had a realistic chance of funding and implementation in the foreseeable future. I shall come back to that concept of foreseeable future.

<P>
The review identified some 1,400 sites, of which only 200 were considered to have transport potential. In identifying sites with such potential, it was decided to identify all sites that, in the board's opinion, had supply-side transport characteristics rather than try to anticipate whether there would be transport demand for a given site. In some cases, there may well be no actual demand for transport purposes.

<P>
As pointed out by my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East, the remaining properties were small, disparate sites or ones with development problems of poor access or land contamination. I absolutely understand my hon. Friend's concerns-his record of struggle speaks for itself. Clearly, we cannot legislate to cover every individual case. We make a statutory framework within which individual judgments have to be made. However, I certainly recognise my hon. Friend's concerns about the Stratford-Honeybourne-Cheltenham route and other routes have been mentioned. The framework created by the Bill will enable such cases to be tackled in a sensible, strategic way.

<P>
This measure should ensure that what occurred after the closure of the Dumfries to Stranraer route does not happen again. My hon. Friend mentioned struggles around Stratford in the 1970s. In a previous incarnation, he and I worked long and hard with the campaigning people in Galloway to secure the restoration of that line. It is very much in the province of the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale, but I suspect that it was before he was born.

<P>
Those who go back a long way on the subject will recall the aftermath of the closure of that line in the 1960s. By the mid to late 1970s the line had already been parcelled out into about 500 separate plots of land, many of them allotments, and we began to wonder whether a plot of a rather larger nature might be involved. Within a matter of 10 to 15 years, there was a strong and plausible local campaign for the re-opening of the line. My hon. Friend and I put our weight behind it-in his case, not inconsiderable weight, in a metaphorical sense of course-but by then, re-opening had become impossible. We must avoid that happening in future and the SRA will be anxious to avoid it too.

<P>
I emphasise that much of British Rail's remaining portfolio of sites is of small areas of land, remote from the operational railway-small urban sites, lock-up shops and so on.

<P>
In the light of the British Rail review, the Government have agreed with the Chairman of BRB new marketing procedures giving priority to transport use. By the time that the SRA is established, there will be less BR land, but we expect the SRA to adopt similar procedures when dealing with any land inherited from BR.

<P>
Railways are a vital part of our integrated transport policy. It is of the utmost importance that operators have the opportunity to acquire land that they could use to improve our transport system. We introduced new procedures in September-

<P>

<B>Mr. Quinn:</B> On the old BRB and the property
 board, the regional development agencies are new players in regional transport strategies. Every regional development agency has compiled a strategic transport plan. How will those plans fit in with the new arrangements mentioned by my hon. Friend?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Let me assure my hon. Friend that we expect the SRA to respond to representations from the regional development agencies, which as he pointed out now have significant transport responsibilities.

<P>
The new procedures that we introduced in September, and which the SRA will follow, more than respond to the valid concerns that were expressed to us at the time. They provide an opportunity to safeguard essential transport needs.

<P>
The new arrangements provide for the rail industry, local authorities and other transport industries to be informed of all available BR properties, not just those judged to be of future transport potential. Interested parties will be given at least two months' notice of the intention to market all sites, with the opportunity to seek a further two months' delay to work up a bid. There is provision in the new marketing procedures for parties to appeal to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State in the event that the BR board refuses a request for a time extension.

<P>
The notification procedure allows transport organisations to express their views on the transport potential of BR sites and permits parties to bid for them. Ultimately, all BR land belongs to the taxpayer and the new process will ensure that we get full value for all property that is sold and that transport needs are safeguarded. The shadow SRA is considering case by case all sites in which interest is registered.

<P>
The amendments would encourage the creation of a land bank of property held in case it is needed for a future, as yet unidentified, transport use. That would impose a cost on the public sector without guaranteeing that private sector operators would introduce any scheme at all. It would also leave derelict land that might serve a useful alternative purpose.

<P>
We are clear that all sites must be sold at open market value. We do not wish to distort decisions on location or offer additional subsidies to the industry in the form of cheap land sold at less than market value at taxpayers' expense. Financial assistance using the SRA's broad powers is a more appropriate and transparent form of support for the rail industry.

<P>
Before turning to amendment No. 804, which was tabled by the hon. Members for Bath and for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale, I shall tackle issues raised by the latter in his passionate contribution. First, on the apparent contradiction between clauses 182 and 192, the hon. Gentleman asked why clause 193(3) disapplies the duties under clause 182. The SRA general duties under clause 182 are disapplied because clause 193 deals with property rights and liabilities of the BRB that are not needed by the SRA for the exercise of its other functions-that is to say, they do not apply to land that is required for the purposes of the SRA.


<P>
In response to the remarks of the hon. Gentleman, generally account has to be taken of the concerns of various bodies, but the simple fact that they are expressed does not mean that they are justified. In all candour, I simply do not believe his assertion that the clause is regarded as a bad one by the rail operators. We have no evidence or indications to sustain that. On the gleam-in-the-eye dismissal apparently offered by the shadow SRA official, Chris Austin, I am sure that the point being made was that the proposed project has to have a realistic prospect of coming to pass-not that there was no opportunity to retain land for future rail use.

<P>
On the contrary, in response to the general point as to whether the SRA will hang on to the land it inherits from BR if there is no railway buyer but the site is of strategic rail use, the answer is that it will, provided that there is a realistic prospect in the foreseeable future. Otherwise, the land would fall into blight and legitimate alternative uses would be denied. It may reassure the hon. Gentleman to know that we would concede that ``the foreseeable future'' could apply to a period up to 20 years. It is arguable that, in the case of the reinstatement of the famous Waverley line, there is comfort and hope in that regard. On the other cases cited by the hon. Gentleman, having listened carefully to what he had to say, my strong impression was that all would be likely to be caught by the precautionary arrangements that the Government have put in place. I hope that that will, up to a point, reassure the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): How can the hon. Gentleman say that the precautionary process protects the sites, when they are being sold?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> If that is the case, they are obviously not caught and I perhaps was not listening as carefully as I ought to have been. It appeared to me that the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale was reporting the responsibility that such sites could come on to the market for sale when there was apparently rail use potential for them. If that is not the case, I shall consult the record in detail again and consider how we might respond accordingly. On the face of it, the hon. Gentleman appeared to be describing situations in which there was rail potential that ought not to be dismissed.

<P>
In response to amendment No. 804 and its reference to protecting land, I also remind the Committee that there are already opportunities for local authorities to protect sites with transport potential. Under current planning guidance on development plans-known by the planners as PPG12, dated December 1999-local authorities are required to consider the potential for disused railway trackbeds and routes for future transport schemes and to protect the land where justified. The guidance explains how local authorities should safeguard land for future transport use and requires them to consult the appropriate transport infrastructure authorities, including the SRA.
 
<P>
The Government have also published revised draft planning guidance on transport-PPG13, dated October 1999-that requires local authorities to ensure that disused transport sites and routes are not unnecessarily severed by buildings and non-transport land uses, and also requires them to identify and, where appropriate, protect sites and routes that could help widen choices for freight and passengers. Had such planning guidance been in place in yesteryear, the situation that my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby described as a potential line being severed by the construction of a supermarket might well have been avoided.

<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I am sorry to interrupt my hon.Friend, but this is a comparatively recent application. One of the objections to the proposals made by the Railway Development Society, among others, is that it contradicts PPG13.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> This is the Stratford and Honeybourne development. Quite clearly we will have to have a further careful look at that case and I give my hon. Friend the undertaking that I shall do so.

<P>
Draft PPG13 also calls for:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>alternative uses related to sustainable transport to be considered first for sites now surplus to transport requirements;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>local authorities to consider protection for rail connections to existing manufacturing, distribution and warehousing sites close to the rail network; and<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>local authorities to allocate sites for suitable new developments which can be served by rail.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I turn now to some of the issues raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby. In doing so, can I say that I was grateful for his positive view of the potential role of the SRA in developing and re-developing lines with serious potential. He mentioned the reconnection of Whitby to the trans-Pennine route by a new five-and-a-half-mile extension to Pickering. He will be aware that the rail passenger partnership fund is aimed at such opportunities if a detailed case can be made. I am pleased to note that local authorities are taking into account the implications of this development for re-opening. My hon. Friend has been assiduous in raising this issue, but it was also brought home to me when I met Dr. Paul Salveson and colleagues from the Eskdale support group, with whom we also discussed the possibility of PP applications. We shall watch that space with interest.

<P>
I turn now to the part of amendment No. 854 that would require licence holders to give the SRA first refusal to purchase land at a price reflecting its transport use. While I sympathise with the spirit of the amendment, which was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby, I believe that it is not necessary for the reasons that I shall explain.

<P>
Under the Railways Act 1993 and this Bill, proposed railway closures are required to go through detailed statutory closure procedures which involve widespread consultation. Railtrack's powers of disposal are limited. Only when land or a stretch of trackbed has not been used in the previous five years is it regarded as non-operational. It is then for Railtrack to consider alternative options, including disposal on the open market.

<P>
Railtrack's code of practice for freight commits it to discussing in advance with the rail freight industry, local authorities and other interested parties any proposed changes to the existing Railtrack land holdings suitable for rail freight. I understand that wherever there is a realistic possibility of future freight demand, Railtrack will either preserve the existing facility for future freight use or provide a suitable equivalent. Moreover, I understand that the Rail Regulator is considering a new licence condition that, subject to consultation, would impose on Railtrack controls on the disposal of relevant assets that would include the disposal of land.

<P>
The amendment is also potentially burdensome in that it would apply to any parcel of land, however insignificant, and require both notification to the SRA and statutory consultation by the SRA.

<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Investment in land by the SRA would impose a cost on the public sector without any guarantee of its future railway use by the private sector. It could leave land derelict that could serve some alternative useful purpose and/or meet local planning objectives.

<P>
Valuation of land on the basis of continuing transport use might in some cases fail to recompense the owner for the full realisable value of the land, which I do not think is a reasonable position.

<P>
The processes and safeguards that I have outlined strike the right balance between disposing of surplus land and ensuring that key sites for future transport use are identified. I believe that it can be fairly said that the Government have gone a long way, certainly further that the previous Administration, to ensure that the disposal of BR's surplus land does not jeopardise our integrated transport policy. I hope that, in the light of this explanation and assurance, the hon. Gentlemen will withdraw their amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Moore:</B> The hon. Gentleman just made a very interesting observation about what was inherited from the previous Government. It is not a defence that he has used very much in this debate. It is interesting that no official Opposition spokesman has sought to speak on a very important strategic matter. They probably have nothing to say. That is very strange. No doubt they will make up for it when we discuss later clauses.

<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson </B>(Hexam): The hon. Gentleman is tempting us to speak at great length on later clauses and I am sure that my hon. Friend and I will be more than delighted to do so.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> I shall not take any more interventions of that kind. I do not wish to be blamed for any filibustering that may occur. The important point is that, for all the Under-Secretary's charm and flattery-a great technique; we have seen it over many months-he has not nailed the issues that are causing much concern. I take his point about the technical nature of the matters in the Bill, but other people, too, think that there is scope for confusion and for the wrong signals to be sent to the Strategic Rail Authority. Even more important, although it is slightly surreal, a shadow Strategic Rail Authority is already in existence and acting under the legal auspices of the British Railways Board. We have a sales process ongoing at present. That is the key issue that we have not seen tackled.

<P>
The hon. Genteleman suggested that the examples that I offered earlier were of a strategic nature and would be protected under that process. He is misled in that respect. There is already an active marketing process going on for the most significant one that I have mentioned-at Abbeyhill in the constituency of the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh.

<P>
I quote from a letter sent from Rail Property Limited on 13 March this year, written by Mr. Alan Pett, the estate manager in charge of privatisation and adressed to Edinburgh City Council. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We have recorded a notification of interest that your organisation would like to acquire or promote the acquisition of the site(s) listed in the attached Schedule''-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which lists all the relevant sites, including the Abbeyhill loop-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>All the transport interests which have been expressed are being reviewed before a decision is made on the timescale and method of marketing affecting sites for sale.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is no hint there that there might be any hold back. All it says is that the process is on-going. It continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>When sales particulars are published, a copy will be sent to you. You will, of course, be given not less than the required period of notice of the closing date for offers to accord with the sales marketing process.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
With respect to the Under-Secretary, that marketing is a serious part of the strategic land holding round Edinburgh. As far as we can see, it is not caught up by any of the protective measures that he said were in the Bill.

<P>
We are deeply concerned that the British Railways Board-and, in due course, the SRA-will be judge and jury over the process. I do not understand how that can be seen as the best way forward, although I accept what the hon. Gentleman said about the appeal to the Secretary of State. Will he clarify that if the Secretary of State receives an appeal to a decision made by the SRA, at that point the sales process will be put on hold and there will be an opportunity to draw breath while the matter is considered? Under the proposals, will the Secretary of State be able to order a piece of land to be withdrawn from sale instead of the plot being given as an option to the group of rail or transport interests that are most interested in it?

<P>
The Under-Secretary talked up the purposes of the Bill and its integrated nature. In an eloquent historical lesson, he has sought to show his campaigning credentials. None of that is in doubt, but as the Bill stands in one important part of the United Kingdom-and, I am sure, if I had better information, around the whole of the United Kingdom-land that is of strategic importance for the future of the railway industry is being sold. Nothing in the Bill protects it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The hon. Gentleman made a number of points and asked two key questions. First, after any current sale, is the shadow strategic rail authority able to appeal to the Secretary of State? The answer is yes. I give an assurance that the Secretary of State will have powers in relation to the appeal, one of which will be to put a hold on the sale of the land, if appropriate. I hope that, with those reassurances, the hon. Gentleman will seek leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> There will still be a great deal of nervousness. Hon. Members will need to look carefully at the record to see what the Minister has said and how it applies to specific cases and more generally. We have had a good debate on the issues, but we may return to the subject as matters unfold and the Bill passes to another place. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
No. 945, in schedule 20, page 225, line 31, after ``property'', insert `right or liability'.

<P>
No. 946, in schedule 20, page 226, line 5, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`12A. The transferor shall indemnify the transferee in respect of any liability of the transferor arising out of anything done by or in relation to the transferor in connection with anything transferred by a transfer scheme, unless a corresponding right which provides sufficient funding to cover such liability has been transferred by that transfer scheme.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Government amendment No. 826.

<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> Schedule 18 provides for the transfer of property to the SRA. Amendment No. 934 would insert ``right or liability'' after ``property'' in page 221, line 6. Rights and liabilities sometimes come with the transfer of property. Our concern is that the authority should not be left to pick up the tab for what the Secretary of State has done. Unless properly funded, the Secretary of State should be obliged to provide funding for liabilities transferred. It is not a situation that I and my hon. Friends sitting around and behind me anticipate, but it is worthy of a full explanation from the Minister.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The amendments deal with provisions for the transfer of residual property rights and liabilities from the British Railways Board and the SRA and from the SRA to other bodies. I shall explain how those powers may be used and offer the hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) the reassurance that he seeks.

<P>
We have made it clear that we intend to wind up the residual British Railways Board. Since privatisation, the board has simply had a caretaking role in relation to outstanding property rights and liabilities, but has not had an active role in the railways industry. Lately, of course, we revitalised the board to support the franchising director and act as the shadow SRA. That purpose will be superseded by the creation of the SRA proper, when the BRB will no longer have a useful function. We therefore intend to wind up the board as soon as possible after the creation of the SRA. However, some residual property rights and liabilities remain. As they relate to railways, it is appropriate to transfer them to the SRA.

<P>
Schedule 20 is designed to enable the SRA to carry out its functions and business in the most efficient manner possible. It may well wish to create subsidiary companies-perhaps if acting as operator of last resort-or to hold property. Crucially, it may also need to transfer property to a franchise when a franchise is relet and property is transferred to a new company.

<P>
Schedule 20 is the replacement for part II of the Railways Act 1993, which is being repealed as privatisation is complete. The schedule contains important provisions on franchising, which are preserved, for example, from section 86 of the 1993 Act. If property is being moved into a franchise company as a precursor to franchising, a full indemnity may not be appropriate. The position on any rights and liabilities would be dealt with through the franchise in commercial negotiations.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 934 and 945 are therefore unhelpful. The schedules deal specifically with the transfer of property, not other rights and liabilities-indeed, the latter are a separate matter.

<P>
The amendments requiring liabilities to be underwritten are unnecessary. I can offer the hon. Member for Poole assurance, as transfers from the BRB to the SRA and from the SRA to its subsidiaries are all public sector transfers. In the case of the BRB, the Government would commit themselves to ensuring that adequate funds continue to be made avialable to meet future liabilities arising from past transactions, events and circumstances. There would be no benefit or purpose in the Secretary of State giving guarantees.

<P>
The SRA will use those powers mainly for internal reorganisation. When it does not and transfers to a franchise company, what is transferred and what guarantees are given will be a matter for negotiation. A blanket guarantee would be inappropriate. Given that explanation, I trust that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): I beg to move amendment No. 849, in page 109, line 8, leave out paragraph (f) and insert-

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(f) for regulating the passage of bicycles and other vehicles and pedestrians on-<P>
</UL></FONT>
(i) premises intended for the use of vehicular traffic whether moving, stationary or parked; and
(ii) footways and premises intended for the use of those on foot.'.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendment No. 1015.

<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Train operating companies have responsibility for traffic management operations but, unlike highways authorities, have no statutory powers to facilitate that by passing byelaws. The amendment would give such power to the SRA.

<P>
There are no byelaws for regulating the passage of vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians on railway land intended for vehicular traffic. The amendment would give the SRA the power to make byelaws to regulate the forecourt, bridges, kiss and drop zones-as they are called in Croydon-parking areas and station roads. It is not about areas that are not for public use, but about the station environment where there are conflicting pedestrian and vehicular movements. Cyclists and pedestrians are exposed to unnecessary risks and are therefore deterred. We want the SRA to have a properly balanced, integrated interface with the local transport plan and the highway authority's arrangements.

<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The amendment would provide the SRA with powers to alter on-road traffic arrangements to make the environment safer and more convenient for all users. First, it would allow the rail industry, through the SRA, to introduce innovative traffic management changes to enable integrated transport at that interface without the need for further legislation. Secondly, it would encourage walking and cycling to stations. As I have mentioned, in Holland most people choose to cycle to the station, and a great many would do so here if they were allowed. It respects the needs for both pedestrian and vehicular activity around station roads, which would be properly managed in the interests of all. Vehicles would be regulated in pedestrian-only areas to make the space in and around stations safer for cyclists and pedestrians.

<P>
The original BRB byelaws regulating railway land predate planning policy guidance 13, which aims to reduce the need to travel and to promote walking, cycling and public transport. The byelaws also predate the transport White Paper in which the code of practice expects rail operators to allow cyclists access to stations. The amendment would give the SRA the power to fulfil the aspirations of the White Paper and PPG13.

<P>
The Government are urging local authorities to work towards integrated transport and the amendment would help the rail industry to work with the highway authority to provide seamless door-to-door transport. It also fits in with the project ``Safe routes to stations'' which is akin to ``Safe routes to schools'' and seeks to provide good quality and safe access to and from stations. I know from what he has said previously that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary is interested in safer routes to stations that involve the development of cycle and pedestrian routes. The amendment would help to achieve that by improving safety at stations and giving the SRA greater opportunity to provide a properly integrated, seamless system in and around stations.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The Bill will transfer the ability to make railway byelaws from the independent railway companies to the SRA. The Bill clearly states the powers of the authority to make byelaws and will give it the power to make byelaws regulating travel on the railway, the maintenance of order on the railway and the conduct of persons on railway property. That will give the SRA sufficient powers to regulate the conduct and behaviour of all those using the railway, whether travelling by foot or in vehicles. These powers duplicate those provided in previous Acts. They have proved sufficient for many years.

<P>
The amendment proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Davies) does not provide any new powers for the SRA to make byelaws and neither does it restrict the powers of the SRA. It goes without saying that I appreciate my hon. Friend's concerns, but the matters that he raised relate more to the wider issue of integrated transport than to the making of byelaws. We hope that local authorities and rail companies will work together on, for example, the interchange facilities that he mentioned and safe routes to stations. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising these matters. He is a passionate spokesman on behalf of vulnerable transport users, as is attested by the large number of amendments that he has tabled. I make no complaint about that.

<P>
However, the amendment provides no useful purpose. The appropriate place to deal with these concerns will be in the byelaws themselves. They will govern the behaviour of individuals whether on foot or travelling in vehicles. The SRA will be required to undertake wide consultation on any new byelaws that it proposes and that will be the time to ensure that they deal comprehensively with the movement of people and vehicles. Traffic regulation orders may be more appropriate than byelaws to deal with the public's access to land around stations. I hope that my hon. Friend will consider that a sufficiently reassuring explanation and will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment No. 1015 is a minor drafting amendment to tidy up clause 194(2)(f) as it relates to railway byelaws.

<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am pleased to hear my hon. Friend's reassurance about the aspirations implicit in my amendment. As I expected, he welcomes an approach to integrated transport that respects the needs of all and is part of joined-up government. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and such organisations representative of rail passengers and others likely to be affected by such bye-laws as may be appropriate.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Schedule 19 sets out that the authority shall consult the operator of railway assets to which the byelaws relate. Our amendment aims to ensure that there is the widest possible consultation. It is better to consult these people at the earliest stage, rather than publish and allow them to send their comments after the consultation has taken place.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I sympathise with the hon. Gentleman's intentions. I hope that he will not take this too much amiss, but the amendment is defective both in wording and effect. It provides an open-ended requirement for the SRA to consult organisations representing anyone affected by the byelaws. That would encompass every passenger group and rail society in Great Britain. It would result in the SRA undertaking a massive bureaucratic operation to contact the many such groups in the country.

<P>
The Bill already includes a minimum period when any person or organisation affected by the new byelaws can make representations to the Secretary of State. It also includes a requirement for the Secretary of State to agree beforehand how the draft byelaws are advertised. These organisations are therefore already provided with an opportunity to comment on proposed byelaws if they want to. The amendment would cause unnecessary bureaucracy at the taxpayers' expense. I hope that that explanation reassures the hon. Gentleman and that he will agree to withdraw it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I shall, but the Under-Secretary is over-egging things a little. I did not think that the amendment was that defective. We simply want the widest possible consultation, as we are a very democratic party. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 828 to 830.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The Bill will transfer the ability to make railway byelaws from the independent railway companies to the SRA. This will ensure that a uniform set applies to the whole network. The amendments will allow the authority to designate which stations shall hold copies of the byelaws. The authority will be required to consult the operators that use that station before it is designated. Without the amendments, the authority would be required to place made and confirmed byelaws at all stations on the national network-some 2,500 in total. These proposals have the support of the railway industry. I hope that the Committee will accept them.

Amendment agreed to.

<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 947, in page 226, line 19, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, provided that nothing contained in this paragraph shall oblige such person to disclose information that is price sensitive or otherwise of a confidential nature.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
This is small amendment designed to protect commercial confidentiality. It appears that the SRA can demand all sorts of information from private companies. One can imagine circumstances in which such information would be price sensitive. We talked earlier about property developments on and around railway property. The amendment aims to protect such interests.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The amendment would affect the ability of the SRA when making a transfer of property rights or liabilities from itself or a wholly owned company to direct that information is to be provided. The amendment would mean that price-sensitive or otherwise confidential information need not be provided.

<P>
I can reassure the Committee that we are aware of the need to protect information that might be price sensitive or confidential and we have sympathy with the aims set out by the hon. Member for Hexham. However, it would not be appropriate to require such a bar on disclosure in this case and I will explain why.

<P>
Schedule 20 deals with the transfer of assets that are wholly within the SRA's domain and the power is tightly defined. It is perfectly proper in these cases for the SRA to have all the information it needs. The transfers are from the SRA itself or from a wholly-owned company belonging to the SRA. The transfers are to the SRA, a wholly-owned company, the Secretary of State or a franchise company. The SRA is being given the power either to reorganise itself into wholly-owned companies or to transfer assets to a franchise company, perhaps where it has acquired those assets at the end of a franchise and wishes to pass them on to a new franchisee. In such a case, the new franchisee would be a willing partner to the transfer. I can reassure the Committee that this is not a power to acquire commercial information where the SRA has no proper locus. I hope that with that explanation, the hon. Gentleman will agree to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> I beg to move, amendment No. 948, in page 109, line 22, leave out from ``may'' to end and insert ``, if it considers it''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 950, in page 109, leave out line 26.

<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> One of the problems of being thrust into the limelight in Committee is that one is occasionally faced with amendments that are written by people far cleverer than oneself. This is a case in point. The amendment makes a rather narrow legal point that I fail to understand. It would trim the powers of the Strategic Rail Authority. The way that the clause is drafted at present appears to give the SRA an open-ended power to do more or less what it wishes in the context of the clause. Our amendment proposes in legalistic terms to soften that. It puts an obligation on the authority, if it takes such action, to consider it as necessary. Will the Under-Secretary give us an explanation of that?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Let me protest that the Committee is delighted that the hon. Member for Hexham has been thrust into the limelight, where he performs with such distinction.

<P>
The Strategic Rail Authority will be a non-departmental public body set up with specific purposes and functions, which the Committee has already debated in relation to other clauses and amendments. Those purposes and functions define the extent of the SRA's functions. It will not be empowered to do anything else.

<P>
However, to carry out those functions, the SRA will need to be able to undertake a range of incidental activities. As a matter of long-established practice, certain ancillary activities are usually specified on the face of a Bill as permitted activities of an NDPB, to the extent that their omission tends to exercise our learned friends, the legal profession, when it comes to the body's transactions.

<P>
In clause 197(2) we have picked up some of the old favourites: acquisition of land, entering into agreements, investing and so on. My mind goes back to clause 59, in the first part of the Bill, which provides for a right of reverter, a right of pre-emption and, not least, a right of irritancy, so we have already been here before. We do not pretend that acquisition of land, entering into agreements and investing are the only ancillary activities that the authority will need to undertake in the course of its business and so we cannot accommodate the Opposition's amendments, but neither will we extend the list, for fear of falling foul of argument C.

<P>
The amendments would unduly restrict the authority and I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> I will happily beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Government amendment No. 992.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> As we enter chapter II of part IV of the Bill it may be useful to the Committee if I briefly say something about its general thrust. The title of the chapter is ``Other Provisions about Railways'', which sounds alarmingly miscellaneous. It is true that there are some miscellaneous provisions here, to amend various pieces of railways legislation that have been found to be unsatisfactory or have simply fallen out of date. We can deal with those when we come to them and I shall not test your patience, Mr. Gale, or that of the Committee by anticipating that discussion.

<P>
None-the-less, one or two common threads run through the chapter. In chapter I, we dealt with setting up the Strategic Rail Authority, its purposes and functions and the basis on which it will carry those out. In chapter II we are concerned with some of the wider consequences of the creation of the SRA. Those include changes in the regulatory structure for the railway and we are taking the opportunity to introduce some other, broadly related, regulatory changes.

<P>
The framework for these regulatory changes is established by clause 199, which is designed to ensure that both the Rail Regulator and the SRA work to achieve the same broad strategic goals. Although their responsibilities will be distinct, it is obviously important that they should not conflict. They will in each case be expected to work with the grain of Government policy and, to that end, we are seeking to renew a power for the Secretary of State to give general guidance to the regulator-a power that was included in the 1993 Act, but has since lapsed.

<P>
The regulator and the SRA need to be effective in their respective new roles and, to that end, clauses 200 and 201 set out an improved enforcement regime. Clauses 205 to 207 then make a number of changes designed to bring greater clarity to the regulatory framework and to remove some unnecessary bureaucracy.

<P>
Clauses 208 to 212 deal with closures. The main change here is to reflect in the Bill what is already de facto the case, namely that it is the Secretary of State who in practice has responsibility for deciding major closures. At present it is the regulator who has this role, but objectors invariably exercise their right of appeal from the regulator to the Secretary of State and that practice should be formalised. Other changes are designed to remove the unnecessary bureaucracy that has crept into the system. No doubt the Committee will want to test that our intention to provide a more streamlined procedure without losing any necessary protections is delivered by the clauses.

<P>
Setting up the SRA also requires some institutional changes. These are provided for in clauses 213 and 214, which deal with winding-up the British Railways Board and in clauses 202 to 204, which transfer responsibility for the rail users' consultative committees from the regulator to the SRA. This is in line with the transfer under schedule 16 of consumer protection responsibilities. We are proposing to rename the consultative committees the Rail Passengers' Council and committees and to make other changes that will give them a more effective voice on the passengers' behalf.

<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Hear, hear!

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I welcome the sedentary support expressed by my hon. Friend.

<P>
Clause 215 deals with the role of the passenger transport executives in relation to franchising. The aim is again to give proper effect to the strategic national role that we intend for the SRA, without undermining the ability of the PTEs to specify their requirements for passenger transport in their areas. I am aware that several members of the Committee are concerned about that. We have tabled several amendments to tackle their concerns.

<P>
I return to clause 198 and this set of amendments. The clause carries forward the theme of allowing for the strategic development of the railway and giving distinctive roles to both the SRA and the Rail Regulator. It inserts new sections 16A and 16B into the 1993 Act. These new sections confer a new power on the Rail Regulator to give a direction to a person in a position to do so to improve an existing facility or to provide a new facility. That power can be exercised only on an application from the authority, or a third party with the consent of the authority.

<P>
Government amendments Nos. 991 and 992 combine to insert further new sections 16C to 16I, which set out a clear procedure by which the regulator considers applications for directions and gives, notifies and varies directions. The new power for the regulator will ensure that improvements can be made to the network where the authority considers that they are in the public interest. The provisions are not designed to replace the normal commercial judgments and investments of facility owners such as Railtrack or EWS-and they certainly do not preclude voluntary arrangements between a facility owner and someone wishing to agree terms for an enhancement. Clause 198 provides a mechanism for resolving obstructions to development if there is a dispute between the facility owner and the authority as to what constitutes commercial viability or the strategic priority of a particular development.

<P>
There may well be cases in which the SRA considers that there is a strategic need for a new or improved facility, but the person best equipped to provide that facility-whether it be Railtrack, EWS, a freight facility, a station operator or whoever-has other properties. In another case, a facility owner's strategic priorities for development may not match those of the rest of the industry. It those cases, the clause will provide the balance between the interests of facility owners and the long-term strategic needs of the railway.

<P>
An improvement may be sought by a third party, by applying direct to the Rail Regulator, but it must have the consent of the SRA. That will ensure that there is a genuine interest wider than the commercial interest of one party and that it fits with the wider aims of the authority. The person who is to be directed must be consulted, both on the original application and on any proposal to vary or revoke the original direction.
 
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 991 and 992 must be read in conjunction and I wish to speak briefly about their general thrust. We were conscious that the provisions in the Bill on the procedure for applying for, consulting on, giving and varying directions were not fully sufficient. Amendment No. 991 therefore strikes out relevant subsections in proposed new section 16A, and amendment No. 992 replaces them with a comprehensive set of provisions in new sections 16C to 16I. The new procedures are broadly based-with appropriate variations to fit the context-on the procedures that the regulator must follow when he is determining contested access applications. Those are set out in schedule 4 to the Railways Act 1993. I somewhat regret the length of the provisions. Other things being equal, a simple approach is always to be preferred, but in this case, it is desirable to have a clear procedure spelt out in the statute.

<P>
Amendment No. 992 inserts new sections 16C to 16I which deal with: how applications for directions are to be made; the procedure for making directions, involving both the applicant for the direction and the infrastructure provider, who would be the subject of the direction; the need for the infrastructure provider to be adequately rewarded and the considerations to be taken into account; procedures for applications to be modified before directions are made, and for directions to be varied or revoked, including, once again, the need for the infrastructure provider to be adequately rewarded; provision for costs where appropriate, for example, if an applicant withdraws an application after putting the facility owner to the unreasonable expense of an application; and a requirement for the regulator to make a code of practice, setting out in greater detail how he will exercise his functions under the provisions.

<P>
As I said, many of the provisions follow the schedule to the 1993 Act.

<P>
I shall not detain the Committee with detailed descriptions of every point, but a couple are worth highlighting.

<P>
Although an infrastructure provider will have to do everything reasonably practical to carry out the direction, he will not remain liable if he does not have the necessary powers or rights. For example, it may be reasonable for a person directed to use all reasonable endeavours to apply for planning permission or even to promote a Transport and Works Act Order, but it may not be reasonable to say that he had failed to comply with the direction if planning permission were refused.

<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
In all cases, the Rail Regulator must be satisfied that there will be adequate reward for the improvements or new facilities, which will depend on the facts and circumstances of the case. It means that the regulator will take a view that the facility owner will not be out of pocket. That does not mean that the facility owner must be remunerated for the facility in advance. We have made it clear that the regulator can take into account indirect receipts and other benefits that are likely to accrue to the facility owner.

<P>
New section 16F(5), provides for the regulator to direct that either the person making an application to him for a direction, or the person to whom the direction would be issued, should meet all or part of the costs incurred by the various parties-including third parties-in connection with the application. The purpose of the provision is equity in general and, in particular, to discourage speculative applications which impose costs on others. We have not, however, consulted the industry on exactly how it might work and we welcome the views of the Committee and the industry on it.

<P>
We agree that it is normally the duty of the railway industry, facility owners, franchise holders and others to invest sensibly for the development of the railway, but there may be cases in which investment does not occur or is not viable. It is reasonable in those cases for the regulator to have the power to ensure that vital improvements are carried out where there is no voluntary means of securing them.

<P>
The power conferred on the regulator by clause 198 is a power that we would expect the authority to request only as a last resort. As a check, the final decision belongs to the Rail Regulator. He will be operating under his duties in section 4 of the 1993 Act, including the duty to act in a way that he considers will not make it unduly difficult for the holders of network licences to finance their activities.

<P>
I hope that my somewhat lengthy explanations have been helpful to the Committee, which I invite to accept the amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> No doubt the Under-Secretary will expect us to be suspicious of the clause, which gives the regulator wide powers to intervene and interfere with private companies running the railways. He said that the regulator's powers would be used as a check only as a last resort. If so, that will provide some comfort.

<P>
The provisions initially set out by the Government encompassed much of section 16A of the Railways Act, so why have they decided to wipe it out with amendments now? I am intrigued about what changed the Under-Secretary's mind. The Secretary of State's powers to exempt railway companies from the restrictions in the first part of the clause are also important. What sort of railway facilities would be left out of section 16A and why does the Secretary of State need this power?

<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Might the wide-ranging powers, which I welcome, be used to meet the needs of passengers with disabilities? As we move forward and facilities improve, we want all our citizens to make the best use of the rail network. Where facilities are uneven, the regulator or the SRA may choose to intervene. I await the Under-Secretary's guidance.

<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> First, I apologise for missing the Under-Secretary's first few remarks. I left the consistituency on time, for a change.

<P>
The Under-Secretary said a few moments ago that if a direction were given, a company or body would not be compensated in advance. Was he speaking purely of meeting the costs of someone who is so directed or will it be cost plus profit? If a person is directing someone to undertake an activity, are they allowed to say, ``This is costing us £100,000. It is not unreasonable that we should charge £105,000, since it is taking a certain degree of expertise and time''? Or, will the cost be covered?

<P>
The Under-Secretary mentioned indirect receipts. Will he expand a little on what he means? Does he mean that, as more passengers are attracted to a facility that is provided, an operator is taking more money in other ways and how it was provided would be taken into account? My main concern would be whether a company would have reasonable compensation under clause 198, if a direction were given. Since all businesses have shareholders to keep happy and aim to make a profit, will they not only cover their costs but receive a reasonable reward?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Let me deal first with the questions before I turn to the amendments. That will permit me to make an offer to Opposition Members that they may find irresistible.

<P>
I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, Central on the ingenuity with which he wove disability and vulnerable rail users into the amendments. He may not be enticed by my response that disability legislation and regulations will be the main vehicle for their requirements rather than this part of the Bill.

<P>
The hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) mentioned the deletions in section 16A. The material has been re-ordered and amplified in new sections 16A and 16C. I shall deal almost immediately with some of the more substantive points that he raised.

<P>
In response to the question of the hon. Member for Poole about the element of cost or profit in adequate reward, we shall be looking for cost and a reasonable rate of return. I expect to say more about ``adequate reward'' in a moment. I shall therefore confine myself to the amendments on the order paper.

<P>
Amendment No. 951 deals with consultation. It is unnecessary in light of the more comprehensive approach set out in amendment No. 992. There is no need to provide separately for the SRA to be consulted about the post directions or variations of direction. Those directions will reflect a written application for a direction or variation to which the SRA has already consented. The regulator will be required under new section 16A(4) to consult interested parties. Rail passenger committees could be among those that he consults, but it is odd to single them out, especially as they have no interest in the provision of freight facilities, for example. It is better to express the obligation on the regulator to consult on general terms. Not for the first time, argument C applies.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 952 and 953, deal with adequate reward, but do not add anything. Amendment No. 952 prohibits directions being made that would impose any disproportionate disadvantage in any respect on the person directed. This seems unnecessary when set alongside the provisions for adequate reward. It will be open to the infrastructure provider in making representations to the regulator on an application for a direction under new section 16D to draw attention to any disadvantage, disproportionate or otherwise, that the proposed direction would impose. The regulator must take account of any such representations, including where relevant, his assessment of adequate reward. No further safeguard is needed.

<P>
Amendment No. 953 provides for directions to be varied or revoked only if the person directed has already been adequately rewarded for whatever has already been done under the direction or otherwise with their consent. If the Committee agrees to new section 16G inserted by Government amendment No. 992, that will be partly provided for. Where a direction is varied, the regulator will need to be satisfied that the infrastructure provider will be adequately rewarded, in the same way as under the original direction. In this regard, I do not see any reason to insist that the infrastructure provider should have been adequately rewarded for work already done before the variation is made. Part, if not all, of the return in infrastructure investments will come from usage charges after the infrastructure is brought into use. It may not be possible to bring the infrastructure into use until it has been completed in accordance with a possibly varied direction. It is not reasonable to expect full pay back before completion, nor should it be necessary to do so. The adequate reward provisions will continue to apply.

<P>
As for revocation, I have to say to the hon. Member for Hexham-it may come as a surprise to him-that I have a good deal of sympathy with the amendment. The regulator cannot, by definition, act unreasonably. He would not revoke the order if the applicant had not made proper arrangements for rewarding the other person for wasted work that had already been undertaken. I accept, however, that we have spelled out a great deal of detail in the new section and I am therefore happy to consider further the hon. Gentleman's specific point on revocation. I hope that that is agreeable to him.

<P>
There is one remaining amendment-amendment No. 954-with which I need to deal. In some cases, it would be disproportionate for the regulator to have the power conferred under clause 198, for example, in the case of heritage railways, which are not part of the strategic network. New section 16B accordingly gives the Secretary of State the power to exempt certain railway facilities from the scope of directions by the regulator under the provisions. Amendment No. 954 would delete this power of exemption. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept the simple intention behind new section 16B and will not press the amendment to a vote. Indeed, in the light of the assurances and explanations that I have offered and the concession that I have made, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> I am not sure whether to count this as a victory or the reason for a letter home. The terms are a little technical for a letter home. Having heard the Under-Secretary's explanation, I will not press the amendment.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

 `Making of applications
for directions.
{**XR**}{**XH**}16C.-(1) An application for a direction under section 16A above must be made to the Regulator in writing.
(2) The application must-
(a) specify the person to whom the direction would be given;
(b) state what it would require him to do; and
(c) give the applicant's reasons for considering that person to be an appropriate person to do what the direction would require him to do.
(3) The applicant may at any time vary what the direction would require that person to do by giving to the Regulator notice in writing of the variation; but if the applicant is a person other than the Authority such a notice may only be given with the consent of the Authority.
(4) The application or notice of a variation may be accompanied by any written representations which the applicant wishes to make in relation to the direction.

 Procedure for considering applications.
{**XR**}{**XH**}16D.-(1) When the Regulator has received the application or notice of a variation, he must-
(a) send a copy to the person specified in the application, the Authority (if it is not the applicant) and any other persons who the Regulator considers ought to be sent one; and
(b) invite them to make written representations within a period specified in the invitation.
(2) If the person specified in the application makes representations that he is not an appropriate person to do what the direction would require him to do, the Regulator must decide that issue in advance of considering any other matters which may be relevant in deciding whether to give the direction.
(3) If that person makes such representations but the Regulator decides that he is an appropriate person to do what the direction would require him to do, the Regulator must-
(a) notify him of that decision; and
(b) invite him to make written representations within a period specified in the invitation about any other matters which may be relevant in deciding whether to give the direction.
(4) The Regulator must-
(a) send the applicant a copy of any representations received by him in response to any invitation under subsection (1) to (3) above; and
(b) invite him to make further written representations within a period specified in the invitation.


(5) Subject to subsection (6) below, the Regulator may substitute as the applicant any other person if-
(a) the applicant,
(b) the other person, and
(c) the Authority (if it is neither the applicant nor the other person),
consent to the substitution.
(6) The applicant may, by giving notice in writing to the Regulator, withdraw or suspend the application at any time before the Regulator decides whether to give the direction.
(7) The Regulator may direct-
(a) the person specified in the application,
(b) the applicant, or
(c) any other person (apart from the Authority),
to provide him with any information required by him in order to decide whether to give the direction.
(8) If a person fails to comply with a direction under subsection (7) above, the High Court or the Court of Session may, on the application of the Regulator, make such order as it thinks fit for requiring the failure to be made good.
(9) Such an order may provide that all the costs or expenses of and incidental to the application shall be borne by-
(a) the person who failed to comply; or
(b) in the case of a company or other association, any officers who are responsible for the failure to comply.

 Decisions on applications: adequate
reward.
{**XR**}{**XH**}16E.-(1) The Regulator may only give a direction to a person under section 16A above to provide, improve or develop a railway facility if he is satisfied that the person will be adequately rewarded for providing, improving or developing the railway facility in accordance with the direction.
(2) In considering whether he is so satisfied the Regulator shall take into account (in particular)-
(a) any receipts obtained or likely to be obtained by the person (from the Authority, passengers, operators of railway services or any other persons) in connection with, or as a result of, the provision, improvement or development of the railway facility; and
(b) any other benefit obtained or likely to be obtained by him in consequence of its provision, improvement or development.
(3) Representations made by the applicant for a direction-
(a) under section 16C(4) above, or
(b) in response to an invitation under section 16D(4) above,
may, in particular, include representations as to matters which he considers the Regulator should take into account in deciding whether the person to whom the direction would be given would be adequately rewarded for doing what it would require him to do.

 Other
provisions
about
decisions.
{**XR**}{**XH**}16F.-(1) If the Regulator does not consider it right to give a direction under section 16A above in the terms applied for (or to reject the application), he may give a direction under that section in modified terms.

(2) The Regulator may include supplementary provisions in any direction under section 16A above, including (in particular)-
(a) provision adding detail (for instance, as to the time by which, or standard to which, the person to whom it is given is to do anything which it requires him to do); and

<P>

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 30, in page 113, line 6, leave out subsection (6).

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it is convenient to take amendment No. 31, in page 113, line 12, leave out subsection (7).

<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> Our amendments are probing amendments. They would leave out subsections (6) and (7). We want a fuller explanation as to why the Secretary of State has these powers to continue to intervene in this area.

<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The amendments would remove the Secretary of State's power to give general guidance to the Rail Regulator and the consequent requirement to publish such guidance. I understand and share the concern of the hon. Gentlemen to ensure that the Rail Regulator can continue to act as an independent economic regulator. However, this power-similar to the time-limited one in the 1993 Act does not undermine the Rail Regulator's independence.

<P>
The clause does not permit the Secretary of State to dictate to the regulator how he should perform his functions. However, the regulator does not operate in a policy vacuum. It is right, given the extent of public subsidy and the enormous public interest in the railways, that he should have regard to the general direction in which the Secretary of State wants railway policy to develop, as part of an integrated transport system.

<P>
I offer the reassurance that any guidance will be at a general level. This power, together with the Rail Regulator's new duty to facilitate the furtherance by the authority of its strategies, will clarify the relationship between these parties and ensure that they pull in the same overall direction for the public benefit. The amendments would also delete the provision for publication of the general guidance, which will make it transparent and ensure that all players in the industry can see the direction in which the Government wish to go.

<P>
With those reassurances I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I think that with that assurance that any guidance is going to be general. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 955, in page 113, line 21, after ``has'', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`during the preceding six months'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
This amendment effectively covers both the clause and our other amendments to it. They are generally probing amendments.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If it facilitates the debate, I am happy for the hon. Gentleman to cover the entire clause.

<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> That is helpful, Mr. Gale. As these
 are probing amendments, we can explore in greater depth the whole question of penalties, enforcement and the powers of the regulator.

<P>
One aspect of this clause that makes us uneasy is that we do not know what the regulator and the authority are going to do in future. If we say goodbye to this now, the regulator and the authority then have to produce a statement of policy that lists how they will enforce these requirements and contracts; how they will deter breaches, and, in particular, the kind of penalties that will be imposed on the rail companies.

<P>
There is no guidance other than the clause saying that the effect should be proportionate. We have no idea whether these are going to be multi-million pound fines or £10 fines. We have no idea whether we could strip a major rail operating company of its franchise or of the penalties that could be imposed on Railtrack if it failed to do something about the west coast main line, for instance. There will be no opportunity, as far as I can see, for Parliament to give any further scrutiny to this, and that causes us concern.

<P>
Our amendments are designed to obtain from the Under-Secretary fuller and further particulars of what is intended and whether we will have any opportunity to examine the penalties and the severity of punishment that will be dished out by the authority or the regulator. There are also some more detailed points that would tie down the authority and the regulator to be more reasonable and proportionate. Some of the powers are draconian. For instance, under a later amendment, only seven days would be given to produce something in respect of which we thought 21 days would be fairer. Also, either the regulator or the authority could change the goalposts by re-writing policy without reference to Parliament and even without consulting train operators and others who might become subject to punishment. We would like a much fuller explanation so that we can be satisfied that the penalties will be fair and not disproportionate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I echo the words of my hon. Friend. There do not seem to be too many limitations here. The Bill provides that a penalty is payable to the authority
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>of such amount as is reasonable.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The question is: what is reasonable? When you are dealing with life and limb, very large sums can be charged. We are dealing, often, if not always, with commercial cases. The penalty regime should have a substantial effect on the way they operate, but there needs to be greater certainty about the figures. In an extreme case, there could be loss of franchise. If a company had a poor track record, would there be a rolling system of penalties and fines? For example, if over a period of time there are a number of contraventions, would 10 things be taken into account and the penalty multiplied in order to hit very hard? We need a fuller explanation of how this would operate. Will the system act as a deterrent and be fair and be seen to be fair? Any kind of incident or contravention would have to be taken on its merits. Nevertheless, people throughout the industry would expect that if the SRA had a regime of fining for contraventions, it should be fair to everybody in all areas of the country. We do not want a situation where one company feels that it has been fined larger amounts than another company somewhere else. These are the reassurances we seek from the Under-Secretary.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Opposition Members invite me to offer a full explanation of the purposes of this clause and this I am delighted to do. Clause 200 introduces a power for the regulator and the SRA to impose financial penalties on operators for contraventions of their obligations. By obligations, I mean licence conditions, terms of franchise agreements and certain duties relating to closures. A penalty may be imposed in respect of a breach that is continuing or in respect of a breach that has been discontinued by the time the penalty is imposed. The power to impose penalties will help to ensure compliance with licence conditions and other obligations. The amount of the penalty has to be reasonable in all the circumstances of the case. I will refer to the regulator for ease of reference, although of course the same considerations apply to the SRA when it is acting in respect of the contravention of a franchise obligation or a consumer protection condition in a licence.

<P>
This provision fills a gap in the powers of the regulator and the franchising director and gives them a powerful tool for ensuring that companies comply with their obligations. The power is to come into operation alongside existing duty of the authority and the regulator to issue enforcement orders to companies that are in breach of their obligations, but is not to be tied to it. Thus, it will be possible to impose a financial penalty even where no enforcement order has previously been imposed.

<P>
This will be useful, for example, when a contravention has taken place, but has since been discontinued by the company. Such a contravention may have caused considerable harm. However, if it were necessary to issue an enforcement order-which is intended to force the company to rectify a continuing breach, or to take steps to avoid a future breach-before imposing a penalty, it would be impossible to act if the company had already rectified the breach of its obligations.

<P>
The classic example of that was the disruption to South West Trains services immediately after the general election in 1997. Passengers suffered enormously, but the then franchising director and regulator complained that their powers were inadequate. By the time the enforcement procedures had been activated, the company's failings had been rectified and there was no opportunity to impose a penalty, despite the misery that the company had inflicted.

<P>
It might help the Committee to understand why the new powers are needed if I provide some background on how the existing enforcement duties operate. At present, the regulator and franchising director are under a duty to make orders to secure compliance with licence conditions and specified statutory obligations. They must issue an order if it appears to them that an operator is contravening a licence condition or is likely to do so. The regulator or franchising director is not permitted to issue an enforcement order where he is satisfied that the contraventions were, or will be, trivial, where the company is given and is complying with an undertaking to take what appears to him to be all appropriate steps, where his general duties preclude it or where the most appropriate way of proceeding is under the Competition Act 1998.

<P>
Where the Rail Regulator or franchising director makes an order, he has two options. The first is to issue a provisional order, which comes into effect immediately, but lasts only for a limited time. Such an order is intended as a stopgap. It must appear requisite to the regulator, and he must have regard to the extent to which any person is likely to suffer loss or damage due to the contravention and the effect on remedies. When the provisional order expires, the regulator may confirm it. Alternatively, he may proceed directly to a final order, without the interim stage of a provisional order. When he confirms a provisional order or issues a final order, the provisions of the confirmation or final order must be requisite for the purposes of securing compliance with the licence conditions. There are no sanctions for breaching a licence condition until an enforcement order is issued and takes effect. Thereafter, the regulator can seek compliance with the order via civil proceedings, including by injunction.

<P>
The principal difficulty with the current system of enforcement orders is that the regulator is, in practice, always one step behind the company and never comes to grips with the contravention until it is too late; in effect, he is left chasing shadows. The deterrent effect in relation to possible future breaches is, therefore, weak. We do not have the optimum system for ensuring compliance with obligations. The Government have been concerned by instances in which the regulators have not had effective powers to deal with breaches of obligations by operators, and I cited the situation with South West Trains services after the general election.

<P>
The power to impose penalties for current and past breaches of obligations will remedy a defect in the current enforcement system. It will make sure that the regulator and the SRA have powers to ensure compliance and deter future breaches rather than being left one step behind. Clearly, the power will apply only to contraventions that are committed after it comes into effect.

<P>
The hon. Member for Hexham asked about the scale of the penalties. The Bill does not specify a limit on the penalty that can be imposed, but I should dampen down some of the wilder speculation about the likely scale. The clause makes it clear that the penalty must be reasonable in all the circumstances of the case. The penalty could be heavy, but only if the breach is sufficiently serious and has done enough harm to warrant it. In cases where the breach is less serious, the amount would be smaller.

<P>
To ensure transparency, the regulator will be required to publish his policies on calculating the amount of a penalty and to have regard to them when he imposes one. That might include policies on having regard to the need to secure compliance, the consequences of the breach and the deterrence of future breaches.

<P>
There are detailed procedural requirements for the imposition of a penalty, including requirements on the regulator to publicise their intentions, to give notices with prescribed information and to receive and consider comments from interested parties. There are also procedures for modifying the penalty and for notifying the company and interested parties of the final decision on the imposition of a penalty. The company may apply to the regulator and the SRA to pay a penalty in instalments.

<P>
The interests of rail users should be at the heart of regulation. That objective cannot be fulfilled unless the regulatory authorities have the necessary powers to enforce the obligations that companies take on in respect of rail users.

<P>
Clause 200 remedies a significant defect in existing enforcement powers and will provide the regulator and authority with the tools that they need to ensure that companies comply with the obligations that they have accepted. At the same time, the powers that it proposes are appropriately framed by due process, transparency requirements and the right of companies to challenge the imposition of a penalty in the courts.

<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The hon. Member for Hexham asked whether the arrangements would allow the franchising director and the SRA to terminate a franchise. The answer is that the Bill does not alter the terms of the franchise agreement. Termination is provided for under the franchise.

<P>
The hon. Member for Poole asked about rolling penalties. The answer to his question is that penalties would apply to each breach; if a breach was repeated, the process could start again. He also asked what ``reasonable'' meant in the context of penalties. The answer is that it has its normal English meaning, as it does when it is used in English statute. In other words, it means appropriate or suitable in all the circumstances. It also carries within it the idea of proportionality, in the sense that any person who considered what was reasonable in all the circumstances would consider the nature of the breach and its consequences.

<P>
I should perhaps say a word about the amendment that provoked our exchanges. I am pleased to say that it is one of those rare amendments about which we agree with Opposition Members-at least in principle. That is why the amendment paper contains different amendments with the same aim. The Government amendment, which we shall reach later, and the Opposition amendments contain limitation periods beyond which a breach of a franchise or licence may not be penalised.

<P>
We agree that there should be a limitation period to ensure that operators can act within a more certain environment and not be penalised for a past action. The Opposition suggested a six-month time scale, but that might be too short for the railway industry. Railway projects have a long lead time and it might be more than six months or even more than a year before it is apparent that a breach has occurred. Even if a breach became apparent to the regulator or the SRA, they could impose a penalty only if they were satisfied that a contravention had occurred. Time for investigation must, therefore, be factored into the equation.

<P>
Where complicated action is undertaken under section 55 to secure physical compliance with a licence condition of a franchise requirement, the limitation period can be as low as three months. That allows for the time that the regulator or SRA would have spent investigating the contravention before making an order under section 55. Where the regulator or the SRA are working from a standing start, however, a two-year period is fair. It means that companies cannot be penalised for actions long in the past, but allows time for a breach to become apparent and to be investigated.

<P>
In the light of that explanation, I hope that the hon. Gentlemen will agree to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that long explanation, which will be read with close attention by those outside the Committee. This is a matter of considerable importance to those who operate the railway system. It is reassuring-although perhaps also somewhat alarming-that the regulator or the authority can be challenged in the High Court. If the regulator turns out to be somewhat of a maverick, as other regulators have in the past, he or she will spend a lot of time in court, which would be a pity. Legal cases and other actions cost money and the cost ultimately stops with the consumer, which means the travelling public. Therefore, we all hope that we can avoid such confrontations. However, having heard the Minister's remarks, I shall withdraw the amendment. It might be convenient for the Committee if I proposed not to move the other amendments to the clause that stand in my and my hon. Friends' names. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Quinn:</B> Throughout the proceedings of the Committee we have focused considerable attention on the requirements of the passenger railway. I am moving the amendment and the new clause to allow the Committee to focus on that other important part of our national railways, the rail freight section. I want the Committee to recognise that our rail renaissance brings with it a massive challenge, particularly in rail freight. I want to see in the Bill recognition of the fact that a vast part of the railway community has not really established a foothold in the important dialogue that needs to happen between the SRA and the industry-the rail freight users.

<P>
The amendment proposes the establishment of a rail freight users' consultative committee to represent the interests of the customers of rail freight and, I believe, the wider community interest. Throughout its proceedings, the Committee has had full regard to the environmental impact of freight transportation and it might be appropriate at this juncture to allow my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary to tell us the Government's position vis-à-vis rail freight users.

<P>
I commend the Government wholeheartedly for their achievements since coming into power. They have provided not only the stimulus for the renaissance of rail freight but in many instances the resources to allow rail freight to start to flourish. I believe that this is merely the start of green shoots coming through and I hope that the amendment will lead to greater dialogue and a better understanding by the SRA so that this important sector of the railway industry feels that it has an important part to play in the debate on the future of the industry at a national level.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I pay a genuine tribute to my hon. Friend. I can think of no other hon. Member who has so consistently and forcefully made the case for rail freight, at least during the present Parliament. Yet again, he is establishing his concerns for this vital issue. The Committee is grateful to him for allowing us to return to those matters.

<P>
<B>Mr. Quinn:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman allow me to add my thanks to my guru in such matters-the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East? When I was outside Parliament, we were not able to participate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I pause only because I wonder to how many hon. Members my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East can be a guru. Offers are flooding in from various sedentary positions. My hon. Friend has undoubtedly flown the flag for the railway industry over his decades of presence in the House and I gladly join my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby in paying tribute to that tremendous commitment to the industry that my own guru, my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East, has demonstrated.

<P>
After that excursion, I return to the amendment. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby for drawing attention to the Government's excellent record on rail freight. We have doubled the level of grant investment in rail freight that we inherited from the previous Administration and we have gone on to exceed that by leaps and bounds. As my hon. Friend will be perfectly well aware, in the past 12 months we have invested more in rail freight grants than has ever been achieved before in this country. That includes two of the largest single rail freight facility grant investments ever made, so we can all give ourselves a pat on the back.

<P>
I turn again to the amendment. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for tabling amendment No. 855 and for proposing new clause 33. Amendment No. 855 brings to the attention of the Committee-
