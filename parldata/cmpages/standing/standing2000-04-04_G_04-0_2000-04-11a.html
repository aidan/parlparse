<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> We are now moving to a different part of the Bill. Members of the Committee who attended will appreciate that we raised this important matter on Second Reading and I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will recognise that we raised it with serious intent. We have grave concerns that the title chosen by the Government for the new service in this sensitive area, might become the subject of ridicule or mockery. We do not say that lightly or seek in any way to trivialise these issues, but all hon. Members who have had anything to do with it will know that family law, perhaps inevitably, raises strong passions for those involved in sometimes extremely acrimonious debate.
<P>
I was heavily involved over many years with family law cases. In my practice at the bar I sometimes dealt with a number of domestic violence cases in one day and from that experience I know how strongly people feel. It has therefore been no surprise that, since it has become known that we are dealing with this Bill in Committee, other members of the Committee—certainly the hon. Member for Taunton (Jackie Ballard) was among the addressees—and I have been besieged by the expression of many strong views from individuals and organisations dealing with family law.
<P>
I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister, has seen a copy of the letter to which I shall refer. The Lord Chancellor received a letter from no less a person than the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, a copy of which was sent to me by one organisation. The concerns raised in the letter from the Secretary of State about the future of the welfare service chime well with ours.
<P>
In this part of the Bill we shall be raising many different issues, but I want to talk specifically about those dealt with in the amendments. The main change proposed relates to the name of the service and we have deliberately chosen an existing title. There is a strong argument for doing so; we cannot see anything wrong with calling it the Family Court Welfare Service. Not only is the title chosen by the Government unwieldy, but it also raises the spectre of becoming known by an unfortunate acronym. As I said on Second Reading, something called CAFCASS might, by those who feel strongly about the service, too easily be called carcass. Passionate debates have arisen from previous problems in the family law area—including the Child Support Agency. The subsequent issues have plagued this Government, the previous one and all of us in our constituency surgeries week in, week out. There is a strong danger that the title chosen by the Government would cause a problem.
<P>
When new bodies are being set up, Governments have to be particularly careful. In this arena above all it is important to choose a sensible title that describes the purpose of the organisation. My right hon. and hon. Friends and I see no necessity for the proposed lengthy title. Family Court Welfare Service would be adequate and a number of hon. Members from both sides of the House, and outside organisations, have raised similar concerns.
<P>
I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will respond seriously. I do not know whether other hon. Members will take a similar view, but it is certainly something about which we feel extremely strongly. I will leave it there for now.
<P>
Some of my hon. Friends are engaged in the Chamber. You will understand, Mr. Maxton, the conflicts that hon. Members have when trying to be in two places at once. My hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess) is anxious to speak in the Chamber, but he asked me to say that he hopes to rejoin us to speak briefly on later amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): I have just a quick point to make. I hope that I am not out of order, but clause 11(1) talks about the formation of a body corporate. I am not quite clear what that body will be. Will it be a limited company or a company limited by guarantee and will there be any shareholders? This may be a matter for a stand part debate but can the Parliamentary Secretary tell us a little about the entity that will be created? I know that schedule 2 gives us further details about the membership and powers, but can she tell us about the entity that is envisaged?
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (Jane Kennedy):</B> It is a pleasure to serve on the Committee under your chairmanship this afternoon, Mr. Maxton. I hope that I will always seek to answer the questions from hon. Members as courteously as I can. If I address the point that the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) has just raised, we will not have to deal with it on stand part. We consulted on the question of bringing together the three services back in July 1998 and the responses we received welcomed the proposal but stressed the importance of maintaining a separation between the development of family law policy and a service advising the court on the welfare of children. We felt that the establishment of an executive non-departmental public body achieves the necessary separation to maintain the independence of the court advisory service.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard </B>(Taunton): I have a brief question. The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned the consultation. Could she tell us what consultation was carried out with users of the service, the people who have been writing to the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins) and me who are particularly unhappy about certain aspects of the service?
<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> There has been extensive consultation with the three services that we are seeking to amalgamate, but also with the judiciary and local authorities who are obviously involved in the child protection side of the work. I see no problem in providing a list of the organisations that we consulted. Perhaps I can do so in writing. I hope that that will allay any concerns that the hon. Lady may have that the consultation has not been wide enough.
<P>
The hon. Member for Surrey Heath said that some of his hon. Friends were seeking to catch Madam Speaker's eye in the Chamber. It is a great delight with our majority, and long may it remain, to see how thinly stretched the main opposition party is. I have sympathy with them. I have read the Second Reading debate and, although I could not be present for that part of the discussion, I am aware of the concerns that have been raised. May I suggest to him, as gently as I can, that he is displaying the true essence of Conservatism? We are talking now about bringing together three separate services, each with its own culture, its own history, and its own process of development over a long time. The new service that we are creating will involve an amalgamation of those three separate services. Those services, just for the record, are the Family Court Welfare Service, which is currently part of the probation service; the Guardian ad litem and Reporting Officer service, which is run by local authority panels; and the children's branch of the Official Solicitor's Office. It is our intention that this will be a new service encompassing the current roles of all three existing services and building on their strengths.
<P>
We have devised a new name for the service. The hon. Gentleman says that it may be misinterpreted, but the name that we have suggested is the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service. The new name reflects the fact that it will be a new service. We have used the name throughout the consultation over recent months. It has become common currency among stakeholders in the new service and among those who will use its services, for example the judiciary, children and family groups, and the legal profession.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The new name is also descriptive. Perhaps I may suggest, like the well-known DIY products on television, CAFCASS will do ``exactly what it says on the tin''. It will provide advice and support to children and to the family courts. It will not simply replicate existing services. It is important for members of the Committee to understand that our intention is that it should build on the strengths of the existing three services in order to provide a better, more child-„focused and flexible service. It will therefore, as a result, be able to offer a better service to the courts.
<P>
The suggestion in the hon. Gentleman's amendments that the new service should retain the title of Family Court Welfare Service is both retrograde and wrong. The inclusion of the word ``children'' in the title of the new service is vital since we are seeking to create a child-focused service. The amendment would leave both staff and users of the service with the impression that we are not creating a new service. The majority of staff in the new service will not be from the Family Court Welfare Service: they will be from the Guardian ad litem service. We know that they would be opposed to such an amendment as it would appear to place a higher value on one component of the new service than the others.
<P>
I hope, therefore, that the hon. Gentleman will understand when I encourage my hon. Friends to resist his amendment if I have not been able to persuade him to withdraw it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I thank the hon. Lady for her characteristically courteous and thorough response. She has responded in exactly the way in which I hoped she would—taking the matter seriously. I understand that she is not able to accept our proposed alternative and I also recognise the strength of her argument that something new is being proposed and, therefore, that a new name is being chosen. With respect, however, I do not think that the Government have chosen the right one. I ask the hon. Lady to take equally seriously the points that we have made and to consider further with her officials. I remind the Committee of the row that took place over the Government's original proposals to change the name of the probation service. The hon. Lady will recall also the exchanges between her hon. Friend the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow) at a recent Home Office questions where it was hugely welcomed when the Minister finally conceded that the Government had erred in their original proposal for the name of the probation service.
<P>
If the Government table an amendment on Report on in another place, I would be perfectly happy if it incorporated children—I recognise the importance of what she says about that—but it should not run the risk that we are talking about. It was the views of all of those involved with the probation service that caused the Government, quite rightly, to change their mind over the name of that service. I ask the hon. Lady to consider with officials whether a better title might be chosen. It is not too late. I think that even she might concede that the Government's suggested title is a bit of a mouthful. It is a portmanteau—she is trying to incorporate three services into one. I have to be careful, Mr. Maxton, because I do not want to anticipate a later debate, but in responding to what the Parliamentary Secretary said I need to deal with her point about amalgamating three services. She will have noticed that amendment No. 73, tabled by her hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson), deals with the separate nature of the Guardian ad litem service. We shall return to that issue when we reach clause 13. I appreciate that it will be too soon for the hon. Lady to amend the title, but there will be time, on Report and as the Bill proceeds through another place, for the Government to think again.
<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> We are open to suggestions. We have not thus far been able to produce a better title than the one before us today. If the hon. Gentleman were to make further suggestions, other than the one in the amendment, we would be prepared to consider them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> That is an enormously helpful intervention, which I take to heart. We shall attempt to produce an alternative title. The hon. Lady will understand why we chose the title in the amendment—it was one of the existing names and we believed that it covered the range of the new body's activities. I understand the hon. Lady's point, but if our choice is inappropriate, we shall certainly put on our thinking caps and attempt to come up with an alternative. Perhaps the hon. Lady and I could correspond about it.
<P>
We wish to help the Government get the title right. It is too important to run the risk of mockery or ridicule. I accept the hon. Lady's invitation and I shall write to her with further thoughts. Liberal Democrat Members may also wish to propose ideas. It is essential for the title to be right and to stand the test of time. On the basis of the hon. Lady's helpful intervention, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I seek further clarification of the ``body corporate''. I am used to dealing with limited or public companies, so will the Minister clarify whether it is a Government-type body corporate in which there are no shareholders? If it is brought into effect by statute, what structure is involved? Will shareholders or others have power over the body corporate apart from the persons mentioned in schedule 2?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> May I raise a point that has come to light only today? It is a concern raised by the Association of Chief Officers of Probation, which I am sure that the Minister will wish to address. It reached me only today, so it is too late to table further amendments. The Association of Chief Officers of Probation did, however, wish to suggest an amendment to clause 11 in relation to the disbursement and allocation of funds in a timely manner, so that boards could meet their contractual liabilities. It is appropriate for me briefly to mention that in the context of our stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I hope that I can deal with those points briefly. I refer both hon. Gentlemen to schedule 2, which we shall debate more fully later. The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon asked about shareholders, but was thrown by the use of the term ``body corporate''. We are talking about a national, non-departmental public body. There will be no shareholders, but under schedule 2, the Lord Chancellor will appoint a board to be responsible for the oversight of public funds. However, that will not be the company for which the hon. Member for Surrey Heath asked. I hope that he will understand that it is normal practice to set up such an organisation. It will be a public agency, responsible for public funds and overseen by a board appointed by the Lord Chancellor.
<P>
I hope to deal with the issues raised by the hon. Member for Surrey Heath about the allocation of funds in the debate on schedule 2, so I may not have answered all his questions yet.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<B>Mr. Hilton Dawson </B>(Lancaster and Wyre): I beg to move amendment No. 67, in page 44, line 34, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) Two of the members should be the Children's Rights Directors for England and Wales.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 68 in page 45, line 21, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(c) the establishment of a Children's Rights Committee.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to discuss this vital service. It is good to follow my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary, who talked about an amalgamated, child-focused, improved and flexible high-quality service for the large proportion of children who will face the effects of family breakdown in the future. Some commentators say that a third of children may face family breakdown by 2010. The problem affects a large number of children's lives.
<P>
The hon. Member for Surrey Heath referred to the amount of correspondence that Committee members have received from organisations concerned about how the court welfare service functions. Much of that has focused on the involvement of fathers and their rights to contact. That is a serious issue, because many children lose contact with one parent, usually the father, after a relationship has broken down.
<P>
I have received representations about the Bill from the National Youth Advocacy Service, from colleagues involved in child care law with whom I worked when I was a social worker, and from organisations concerned with domestic violence, which are worried that courts do not take a strong enough view of the impact of domestic violence on children's lives when, under section 8 of the Children Act 1989, they decide the crucial issues of contact and residence. In their surgeries, every hon. Member must have met parents, grandparents and even grandchildren who have said that they found the family court difficult and that they thought that the child was not listened to. That is a serious concern.
<P>
The amendments reflect my concern for the need to establish children's rights at the heart of the service. The concept of children's rights directors is fairly new. It is embodied in the Care Standards Bill, which is in another place but will soon reach this House. We should reflect on whether children's rights directors could have a role in CAFCASS. They could certainly have a role in relation to children in this country who are looked after and who live away from home. That includes children who come before the courts in family proceedings anyway.
<P>
<H5>5pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
As we are establishing a committee structure for CAFCASS, it is important to consider also the possibility of establishing a children's rights committee. I do not wish my remarks to be construed as derogatory to the Lord Chancellor's Department, which is a fine, important Department of State, but establishing such a committee would bring children's rights into the heart of a service that has no experience of managing a children's service or a social work service. Given the difficulties involved in bringing children before courts, we would all agree that a court is not the ideal setting in which to resolve many of the issues that affect children. It should be a place of last resort—a point that needs to be emphasised in the new service.
<P>
Part of the background here is the as-yet non-implementation of part II of the Family Law Act 1996. I am sure that there are good reasons for that. There was a debate on the Floor of the House last week to which my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary replied. Research is taking place to consider the implications of the 1996 Act, section 11 of which brings Childrens Act principles firmly into family law. The 1996 Act refers to the necessity for courts to have particular regard to the wishes and feelings of the child in the light of his or her age and understanding. It also lays down the general principle that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the child's welfare is best served by regular contact with whoever has parental responsibility. This is a fluid, complex area of law.
<P>
It is important to recognise that this country has a major commitment to the United Nations convention on the rights of the child, particularly article 9, which gives voice to a child's right to have contact with both parents, provided that this is plainly in his or her interest, and article 12, which gives credibility to the idea of the child's voice being heard. These are extremely important aspects of law. Even if there were not a fluid background to this complex issue, there would, in my view, be sound reasons for putting children's rights at the heart of the new unified service. It needs to be proactive and child-centred rather than reactive and court-led. This is a major opportunity to build on the framework created initially by the Children Act 1975 with the guardians ad litem provision. This would build a preventive, integrated, inter-disciplinary service that is not triggered simply by court proceedings but can develop as a service for children in many and varied circumstances. There is a need to create a service to which a child can have direct access, as an active participant, rather than as the passive subject of remote, strange and often frightening court proceedings.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I now have a slightly clearer understanding of the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre than when I first saw them on the amendment paper. I did not appreciate that he had chosen the terminology from another Government Bill. I hope that he will forgive me for that as I have taken no part in proceedings on the Care Standards Bill, which is currently in another place. I apologise to the hon. Gentleman and now understand the basis of what he is saying. We all recognise the importance of children in matters that come before the family courts. I doubt whether the language of children's rights and references to children's rights directors are appropriate, but I understand why the hon. Gentleman has chosen a set of titles from another Bill. It is only common sense for him to use terms consistently.
<P>
We should seek some recognition of the principle that has been established for many years in decided cases in family law that children's interests should be the first and paramount consideration. As the hon. Gentleman will know from his previous work, that is what the courts have laid down, and it has been repeated in case after case. That is what we are looking for. I do not know which Minister will respond, but I should perhaps say one thing. I shall not often pay a compliment to the Minister of State during our proceedings. However, I noticed that, in addition to his heavy responsibilities in Committee today, he had announced a new domestic violence helpline. I do not know whether he did that first thing this morning or between our two sittings, but he has certainly done valuable work in that regard. All of us who have been involved in domestic violence cases know that helplines are essential. It is, therefore, a pleasure to be able to say that the Government are, as the Minister will recognise, building on work that we tried to do in this difficult area. When debates about family law came up before the last election, many of us spoke about the appalling toll of domestic violence, which I have seen in my professional work. Members of the Committee will be united in saying that it is always the children who suffer.
<P>
I cannot go along with the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre, and I do not know whether the Government will. I rather suspect that the Minister will say, as he often has in our more constructive debates, that he will take the idea away, consider it further and perhaps table Government amendments along a similar line. If that happens, we might be able to achieve cross-party consensus by talking about children's welfare as the paramount consideration, rather than using the terminology chosen by the hon. Gentleman. That is what we are aiming at, and it might be an alternative way of achieving what the hon. Gentleman suggests. He is nodding, and I am grateful for that. That approach would fit in, not only with the Care Standards Bill, but with all the decided cases in family law. On that happy note of some cross-party consensus, I leave my comments there.
<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I welcome the interest and concern shown by my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre. I recognise the experience and knowledge that he brings to the subject, and the constructive nature of the amendment. However, I have reservations about the amendments generally.
<P>
On amendment No. 67, I warmly endorse the implication that CAFCASS should work closely with other agencies in the field of child protection. I hope that we can explore the ideas behind the amendments, put on record the detail of the Government's thinking and thereby perhaps answer some of my hon. Friend's genuine concerns.
<P>
Fundamentally, there are differences between the remits of CAFCASS, the children's rights director and the children's commissioner for Wales, which the Care Standards Bill is introducing.
<P>
The children's rights director in England will be responsible for children in care and other categories, such as disabled children receiving domiciliary care and children in private hospitals.
<P>
The remit of the children's commissioner for Wales will extend across all children in receipt of services to be regulated within the scope of the Care Standards Bill. Again, the remit is slightly different.
<P>
The remit of CAFCASS will normally end when a care order is made. Therefore, only a limited overlap between the roles of CAFCASS, the children's rights director for England and the children's commissioner for Wales is likely. It is important that we do not confuse the role of social workers with that of court officers. The new service is essentially a service for the courts. Its aim is to assist the courts to make appropriate decisions in the best interests of children involved in family proceedings.
<P>
I hear what my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre and the hon. Member for Surrey Heath say about the difficulties of the court process and its alien nature for children, and the fact that children often find it difficult to have their voice heard. In the wider context, the Lord Chancellor's Department is responsible for the court service. Any improvements in the quality or timeliness of the new court welfare service will directly benefit the whole court service, as well as families and children. That does not override the importance of agencies concerned with children's welfare working together and talking to each other, but in the circumstances, I would prefer not to fetter the discretion of the Lord Chancellor to appoint the most suitable candidates to the board of CAFCASS. To be as effective as possible, the board will require people with a range of backgrounds, skills and experience. If we were to earmark places on the board in the way that the amendment suggests, we would run the risk of reducing our ability to get the best people for the job.
<P>
Again, I endorse the intention behind amendment No. 68. However, if CAFCASS is to be successful, it must be a child-centred organisation—that is fundamental. That means that the staff must either have or develop the skills, knowledge and experience to listen to children and represent their interests. It is important that children have a voice in helping to shape CAFCASS—I cannot underline that sufficiently—which is why we have established an advisory group that includes representatives of organisations such as the National Youth Advisory Service children's panel. That group will have the opportunity to comment on the development of CAFCASS leading up to its establishment in April next year.
<P>
In considering future arrangements for monitoring the performance of CAFCASS, we want to find ways of ensuring that groups that represent children have a chance to comment on the services. It may be that a children's committee is the best way of doing that—it is too early to say. It would be better for CAFCASS to have flexibility in that matter. The schedule as drafted would allow the establishment of a children's rights committee. Therefore, the terms of the schedule are sufficient, although my hon. Friend's concerns are valid and very much at the forefront of the Government's thinking as we develop the new service.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> That has been extremely helpful; my hon. Friend has clarified the situation admirably. I do not think that there is any point of dispute between us. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 69, in page 45, line 26, leave out sub-paragraph (2) and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2) All staff working with children and families or in line management responsibility for work with children and families should—
<P>
(a) hold a relevant social work qualification,
<P>
(b) have appropriate in-service training, and
<P>
(c) have opportunities for on-going professional development.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 80, in page 47, line 48, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`20. The Service shall ensure that all officers of the Service and other staff receive appropriate training in respect of the performance of their functions.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> We have already discussed the training and qualifications of the people operating this important service. Amendment No. 69 was tabled because it is important in some way to quantify such training and qualifications.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We have all heard and read serious criticism of the court welfare service as it currently stands. Without going too much into the whys and wherefores, it is important to hear people's concerns about the level of basic and on-going training and about the structures, procedures and manuals available to assist those who work in the court welfare service.
<P>
As we have heard, the new service is an amalgamation. One of the great successes of the Children Acts 1975 and 1989 has been the development of the Guardian ad litem service. Guardians can help courts to take decisions, advocate on behalf of children and find legal representation for children in public proceedings. There is a highly developed level of skill and the new service will be staffed by well qualified and experienced social workers and others.
<P>
It is essential to recognise different roles—reporting to courts and advocacy of children, for example—and to establish a baseline level of social work qualification, which is not a requirement on the probation service these days. We should also recognise the need for in-service training, good managerial support and proper procedures within the service. At a deeper level, we need to recognise the importance of professional development, to equip people coming into the service with the requisite skills and to provide opportunities for development. Ideally, there should be an opportunity to hone skills to the highest level so that staff can intervene properly, advocate on behalf of children, advise courts properly and assess the complex, dynamic and difficult situations that develop in order to serve the best interests of children.

<P>

<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I acknowledge that both amendments are constructive and I understand the principles underlying them. They would, however, insert into the Bill matters that would be dealt with more properly through secondary legislation. It is important to clarify our commitment to training and skills development. If CAFCASS is to provide an outstanding service and meet the needs of children and the courts, it is imperative that its officers have the knowledge and skills appropriate to their particular tasks.
<P>
I shall explain my reservations about the amendments. On amendment No. 69, I recognise that most of the staff who transfer to CAFCASS will have social work qualifications. However, its inclusion in the Bill as a condition of entry would seem a step too far, and would make it difficult to bring together the three services that I outlined in a previous debate. It would exclude the possibility of recruiting staff and equipping them with necessary skills through vocational training or release for social work qualifications. The Family Court Welfare Service has recently introduced such recruitment as a means of widening the pool of potential staff. That is also a means of ensuring that the service's staff reflect the diversity of society.
<P>
I shall give a relevant example from my own background as a residential child care worker for Liverpool social services. A woman with whom I worked took up her post with few formal qualifications. She was in her early forties, had reared four sons, and would soon have been too old to join the social work service and train as a social worker. Nevertheless, there could not have been a better candidate for a social worker. As long as she was given support through in-house service and training, she was capable of being trained and equipped with the necessary skills. If we were to specify formal qualifications in the Bill, people with qualities such as hers would be prevented from joining the service in a trainee or probationary role.
<P>
The amendment would also call into question the position of officers of the Official Solicitor's department. Most officers do not have social work qualifications, yet they have considerable experience in dealing with complex cases in the High Court. Their work is highly regarded by senior members of the judiciary.
<P>
I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre is concerned that CAFCASS should maintain—I would say improve—existing professional standards across the services that it will provide. I share that concern, which is why, as part of the development of CAFCASS, work is being undertaken on training, professional accreditation and professional development. It will be important to ensure that staff who undertake particular tasks are properly equipped to do so.
<P>
Similarly, staff who are receiving training will have to work under supervision, as do Family Court Welfare Service staff. My hon. Friend's amendment would restrict entry to the service, but I do not believe that that is necessary at this stage.
<P>
I turn to paragraph 2(b) and (c) of my hon. Friend's amendment, and the Opposition amendment. Paragraph 5 of the schedule will remit to secondary legislation the provision
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>as to the qualifications, experience or training to be required of officers of the Service.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I know that it is the Opposition's function—and rightly so—to question the need for secondary legislation, but in this case such legislation is the proper way to deal with these issues, and we shall bring forward relevant proposals in due course. It is clear that staff will need appropriate training. The courts, the inspectorate and others will expect nothing less, but to deal with these matters in the broad way proposed in the amendment would add nothing to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I appreciate the thorough way in which the Parliamentary Secretary has responded. Given the comments made by the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre, and given that his amendment is more detailed than ours, there is perhaps no need to cover the same ground again. I recognise that the Parliamentary Secretary accepts the spirit of both amendments, and her approach is helpful. However, can she provide a time scale for the secondary legislation to which she refers? That would help Labour and Opposition members of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I can go no further than to say that it will be introduced in due course. I have used that phrase before and I do not use it lightly. As soon as we are able to do so, we shall bring forward secondary legislation.
<P>
The first amendment would fetter the discretion of CAFCASS to recruit from the widest pool of potential staff, and reduce its capacity to ensure that they reflect the diversity of society. As I have said, it would also call into question the position of case workers for the official solicitor, the majority of whom are not qualified social workers but whose work is nevertheless valued highly. For that reason, if my hon. Friend is satisfied with the spirit of the debate and reassured by my comments, I ask him to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> My hon. Friend is extremely reassuring this afternoon. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 78, in page 47, line 28, leave out ``prescribed person'' and insert ``any person''.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 79, in page 47, line 29, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`15A.(1) The Lord Chancellor shall appoint an independent person to determine any complaints made against the Service made under the scheme referred to in paragraph 15.
<P>
(2) The complainant or the Service may appeal against the decision of the independent person to such tribunal as the Lord Chancellor shall appoint for the purpose of hearing appeals.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> This part of the Bill concerns a subject that was raised this morning—namely, that it is vital to have an independent person dealing with complaints. The Government were not persuaded when we discussed that in relation to probation. However, I strongly urge the Ministers, and all members of the Committee, to accept that it is vital in this part of the Bill above all others.
<P>
The hon. Member for Taunton referred—as did I and the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre—to the volume of paperwork that we are receiving on the subject. There is no doubt about the strength of feeling that is engendered by any proposed changes to the law. The number of people who feel—rightly or wrongly— that they have been hard done by in the past as a result of reports from official solicitors, guardians ad litem, social workers or court welfare of officers is legion.
<P>
Such delicate and serious issues are bound to arouse enormously strong passions. Any case relating to rights of access to children or custody of children is a minefield for the courts. It is never easy to resolve such matters. The Parliamentary Secretary is well aware of people's concerns because of her professional background. I hope that the Government will be persuaded—if not today, at some point of the necessity of an independent role in relation to complaints. Will the Parliamentary Secretary agree that the creation of such an independent complaints body would be valuable?
<P>
Subsection (2) of amendment No. 79 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The complainant or the Service may appeal against the decision of the independent person to such tribunal as the Lord Chancellor shall appoint for the purpose of hearing appeals.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is equally vital. There should be not only an independent person to hear complaints, but a clear appeal's mechanism.
<P>
If the Parliamentary Secretary cannot accept the amendment, I strongly urge her to reconsider the matter in another place or on Report. Given her professional background, I hope that she recognises the importance of a complaints procedure. We feel very strongly about that; these are not simply probing amendments, but matters about which we want serious answers. I therefore hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will respond in a serious way, by correspondence if necessary.
<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I will respond seriously, but I am not sure that I will be able to be as helpful as I tried to be in respect of other amendments.
<P>
I welcome the hon. Gentleman's interest in the complaints system, and he is right that it is important to ensure that the service is required to establish and publicise such a system. However, I have reservations about the amendments. On amendment No. 78, I do not agree that the formula ``prescribed person'', which is in the Bill, should be replaced by ``any person''. That is because the ability to make complaints should be reserved to those who are party to the proceedings. If everyone had a right to complain, as the amendment would allow, there would be a risk of CAFCASS facing vexatious complaints from individuals or organisations that are hostile to CAFCASS or to the policy and legal framework on which it bases its report, I do not make those comments lightly, because I am aware of the deep feelings engendered by those complex personal and deeply felt issues. The schedule provides the best basis for the complaints procedure that the hon. Gentleman wants.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On amendment No. 79, I agree with the importance of establishing an independent safeguard for those who believe that they have cause for complaint against CAFCASS and I draw the Committee's attention to paragraph 17 of schedule 2 which brings CAFCASS into the remit of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that the concern expressed in his amendments and contribution is understood and that the amendments are unnecessary. I hope that he will not press them to a Division, even though I cannot give him the detailed structure of the complaints procedure that he seeks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary, but I hope that she is at least prepared to consider the matter further. I accept what she says about the remit of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration in paragraph 17 of schedule 2, but it would be possible to introduce an independent complaints body along the lines suggested in our amendments that could strike out any frivolous or vexatious complaints. I recognise the force of the Parliamentary Secretary's comment and I referred earlier to the need for vexatious or frivolous complaints to be struck out. We do not want to open the flood gates, but we want the Parliamentary Secretary at least to consider the matter further with her officials and to investigate what could helpfully be added to paragraph 17 of schedule 2. I see her nodding and I am grateful for that indication, so I see no need to press the amendments to a Division. However, it is important for any person to be able to make a complaint. To allow only a limited category of people to complain is too restrictive. I hope that the Hon. Lady will consider introducing a complaints and appeals mechanism which allows anyone to complain but strikes out frivolous or vexatious complaints. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> On amendment No. 77, we thought that it would be helpful to have ``welfare and interests'' in the Bill. ``Welfare'' is already included, but we felt that ``welfare and interests'' came closer to the matter on which I agree with the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre. It is a simple amendment, with which those of the hon. Gentleman are linked and to which he will speak. We are all moving in the same direction and I shall be interested to hear what he says about his amendments. They are undoubtedly well intentioned, but I anticipate that the Minister will be unable to accept them all today. There is no doubt that it would be helpful for members of the Law Society's children's panel to be involved, as the hon. Gentleman suggested. We may not agree with everything that comes from United Nations spokesmen, particularly after the past few days when other UN spokesmen have attacked the Government and the main Opposition party, but the UN convention to which the hon. Gentleman refers in amendment No. 72 is important. Therefore, our amendment and the three amendments tabled by the hon. Gentleman make constructive contributions that we hope the Government Front Bench will listen to seriously and take into consideration. I look forward to hearing not only the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre but the Parliamentary Secretary. I hope that she will accept that the amendments are valuable and constructive suggestions that she will be able to take on board at a later stage, if not now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> I want to speak to amendment No. 77, as well as to the three amendments in my name.
<P>
Amendment No. 70 relates to separate representation. I have already referred to the Family Law Act 1996. Section 64 of that Act, which has not yet been implemented, refers to the Government's ability to enact regulations to provide for separate representation of children in private law proceedings. I have already referred to the success of separate representation and the role of the guardian ad litem in relation to children in public law proceedings; in private law proceedings there must be even more complex and difficult cases where children should be separately represented.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> No doubt the hon. Gentleman found in his previous work, as I have in mine, many cases in which the guardian ad litem's role has been vital in the specific separate representation of the child. Only through that representation has the court had the kind of advice that has enabled the child's interests to be properly safeguarded.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> I am pleased to agree with that point, which backs up my case. I appreciate that it may not be possible to bring section 64 of the Family Law Act 1996 into being as a result of amendment No. 70, but I should be interested to hear my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary reflect on that and on the possibility of doing so in developing the important service that CAFCASS will carry out.
<P>
On amendment No. 71, I have received many representations from organisations such as the National Youth Advocacy Service, from ex-„colleagues who have worked in public child care law or for Lancashire county council and who are now in private practice and from members of the Law Society children's panel. I do not often speak on behalf of lawyers, nor am I speaking on behalf of lawyers now, but it is essential that children have access to advocates who are independent of the CAFCASS services and especially to guardians ad litem. The CAFCASS services may develop in different ways, but people undertaking the role of guardian ad litem have valued their ability to access support from the private sector, and children have benefited from that.
<P>
As recently as February 2000, Judge Nigel Fricker said in Family Law:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It will be important in contested public law proceedings and in a contested private law case in which the child is a party that a lawyer in private practice should undertake advocacy on behalf of the child. This should ensure that CAFCASS keeps within its role as adviser to the court and that forensic presentation of the needs of the child is transparently subject to the independent evaluation of a lawyer in private practice.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am not a lawyer, but that makes sense to me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I appreciate what the hon. Gentleman has said, including the very relevant quotation from the excellent Family Law. Does his experience, like mine, show that many solicitors involved in the field are tremendously dedicated? I am not speaking from my position as a barrister; he made a slightly humorous reference to social workers not speaking on behalf of lawyers. Quite often, we find that there is an enormous reservoir of important relevant expertise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> Again, the hon. Gentleman is helping me to make my point. I am pleased to acknowledge the truth of what he says. I have much sympathy with amendment No. 77, which refers to children's interests, as well as their welfare. That backs up a great deal of what I said about the need to involve children in the process as active participants, rather than passive recipients.
<P>
Amendment No. 72 is in the same spirit. I do not know why we should not add an extra clause, calling on everyone in the service to act in accordance with the UN convention on the rights of the child. The United Kingdom signed up to the convention 10 years ago. The Government recently produced an excellent report illustrating their commitment to the principles of the convention across a broad range of children's services and experiences. The convention is accepted internationally, and only two countries—Somalia and the United States—have not signed up to it. There is no reason to oppose an amendment proposing that we insert that reference into the Bill, thus ensuring that the service knows, from the start, that it is operating within the context of international obligations on children's rights.
<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I appreciate the thinking behind the amendments, and it is proper that we should discuss them in detail. The intention is clear, and I appreciate the thoughtful way in which both hon. Gentlemen the hon. Member for Surrey Heath and my learned Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre have put their case. It has helped me to understand their thinking.
<P>
With reference to the hon. Member for Surrey Heath's amendment, I would say that the intention to represent the interests of children is already clear enough in the clause. The stipulation to safeguard and promote the welfare of children covers their interests, too. Can hon. Members posit a case in which something that was in the interests of children was contrary to their welfare?
<P>
Turning to the other amendments—
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> There is a distinction between the idea of welfare, which is applied by adults—however well intentioned and well qualified, and however right—to children, and the idea of interest, which implies that we listen to children themselves.
<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I will cover that point in a moment, but, first, I shall deal with my hon. Friend's amendments.
<P>
I turn first to the issue of separate representation for children. Separate representation is almost universal practice in care proceedings, but, obviously, not in divorce cases. There are good reasons for that, not least the evidence that children whose parents are divorcing would not, generally, wish to have separate representation.
<P>
I draw the attention of Committee members to an excellent document that was produced by the Rowntree Foundation. It was written by Ann O'Quigley and it is called ``Listening to Children's Views''. On page 39, it contains an enlightening section, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>From the research, it is clear that children want separate legal representation only where circumstances demand it (the children in the research felt that professionals working within the system should be able to identify such cases). By and large, children want to talk to parents or people who will help them to come to a decision.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Perhaps I should give an example to illustrate the issue. I recently visited the Liverpool family court welfare service in preparation for our discussion of the Bill. I was told about a case involving the court welfare officer, in which the children who were involved were seeing their father in a contact centre. The father had made an application for the children to visit him in his home, and the presiding judge sought to establish the children's views. The court welfare officer established that the children found the process of separation extremely distressing one would assume as much— but that they were more distressed when their parents met because they immediately blew up at each other. The children found that experience more distressing than the periods when they were not seeing their father. Young as the children were—they were aged about seven—they explained to the court welfare officer that their mother would bring them to the contact centre where they would be passed over into care of staff. Their father would visit the centre and the children were able to spend valuable time with him and get to know him again without experiencing stressful confrontations between their parents. The role of the court welfare officer meant that the court was able to form a view of the children's interests, although they did not require separate representation. Best practice involves establishing their views and ensuring that the courts are aware of them.
<P>
The document continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>representation for children does not work out like representation for adults. Representatives find it very challenging to follow what children want when the representatives think that this would not be in the child's best interests.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre rightly said that welfare versus interests raises several real issues, and I hope that our debate will clarify some of them.
<P>
Children want their parents to agree and they want their care to be settled in a way that suits them—that approach does not necessarily add a third set of lawyers to the proceedings. The question of representation was considered by the Lord Chancellor's advisory body on family law in 1998 after wide consultation. That body contained eminent people from the field. Although it endorsed the representation of children in public law proceedings as a matter of course, it believed that a report by a competent court welfare officer was a sufficient means of allowing a child's voice to be heard in divorce proceedings. That is not unlike the example that I gave earlier.
<P>
There is provision in the families proceedings rules to allow separate representation when that is considered desirable. I recognise the desire of my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre to ensure that when children are separately represented, that is done by lawyers with an appropriate background and qualifications. I endorse the comments of the hon. Member for Surrey Heath on the expertise of lawyers in this field. The Government want to extend representation in advocacy services for children as part of the modernisation of social services, for example. However, in view of the points that I made in relation to the previous amendment, I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre will understand when I say that I do not think it appropriate for children to be separately represented in all private law cases, as he is suggesting.
<P>
The third amendment tabled by my hon. Friend deals with the UN convention on children's rights. If I may say so without unduly provoking Opposition members, the previous Government ratified the convention in a rare moment of enlightened thinking, and we support that. Thankfully, they seem not to be listening.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Luff </B>(Mid-Worcestershire): I heard what the Parliamentary Secretary said.
<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I believe that CAFCASS will give substantial effect to the values of the convention. Paragraph 2 of article 12 of the convention states that children should have the opportunity to be heard in any judicial or administrative proceedings by which they are affected, either directly or through an appropriate body, consistent with the procedural rules of national law. CAFCASS will work with lawyers when it is right to do so, and guarantee that children's interests will be made clear.
<P>
Provisions in the convention such as the principle underlying the Children Act 1989 have been given effect in UK law. However, the convention itself has not been so enshrined, and it is neither necessary nor desirable to create an anomalous position for CAFCASS. Of course, the European convention on human rights has been enshrined in law. It will come into force in October, and I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre will join me in welcoming that. I believe that that will provide a sufficient safeguard and framework for CAFCASS to operate and achieve what my hon. Friend genuinely and properly seeks through his amendments. I hope that I have satisfied him and the hon. Member for Surrey Heath, and that they feel able not to press their amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for almost all her remarks. She responded in the positive way in which the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre and I hoped she would. I recognise that the Government are taking our points on board, and I hope that they will continue to do so. Given the Parliamentary Secretary's constructive reply, I feel sure that she will continue to keep them in mind. I particularly welcome the attention that she paid to the point that welfare and interests are two separate matters—a point reinforced by the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre. Perhaps the Government will recognise that fact by tabling an amendment at a later stage in our proceedings, or in another place.
<P>
The Parliamentary Secretary joined me in paying tribute to lawyers who specialise in this field. I know that she has worked with many dedicated family law lawyers, because we have discussed the matter on other occasions in other contexts. In this respect, there is no real party political divide between Labour and Opposition members of the Committee—we are trying simply to shape the best possible legislation. I will listen with interest to what the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre has to say about his amendment, but it would not be helpful for me to divide the Committee on ours, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I should point out that, if the hon. Gentleman withdraws his amendment, there can be no more debate on those grouped with it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 73, in page 7 line 3, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, recognising a key distinction between the role of Court Welfare Officer as reporter to the Court and Guardian ad litem as Children's Representative.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is another attempt to draw out my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary. We have heard that this will, quite rightly, be an amalgamated service. It will combine three separate parts—the court welfare service, the Guardian ad litem service and the Official Solicitor service—in a coherent whole. I anticipate that my hon. Friend will say that the amendment goes against the spirit of what she and the Government are trying to do, and I should be interested to hear her response to it. It would recognise that there are key distinctions between a welfare officer's report—which is prepared to give guidance to the court on the background to a case and aims to inform it of certain circumstances or draw its attention to certain elements—and the role of a guardian ad litem, who, certainly in terms of public law, operates as a strong advocate for the child to ensure that its best interests are represented, that its voice is heard and that it is able to participate fully in the court process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I referred briefly to the amendment when we looked forward to clause 13 during an earlier debate, in which we talked about the way in which the new service combines three different existing bodies. The hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre is right to seek to retain the distinction because, although it will be a combined service, the difference between the two roles and their requirements will remain, as I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary recognises.
<P>
If the Government cannot accept the words of the amendment, it would be helpful if they were to incorporate something akin to them in another place or on Report. I do not suppose that the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre would be terribly popular with the hon. Member for Weaver Vale (Mr. Hall) if he proposed to divide the Committee on the amendment, but I should like him to know that he has crossparty support on the matter. I look forward to hearing what the Parliamentary Secretary has to say in response to her hon. Friend's sensible suggestion.
<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> At such moments hon. Friends can quickly become hon. Gentlemen.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre clearly wants to ensure that the staff involved in particular cases have the skills, experience and training to enable them to carry out their roles successfully. I understand the point that he is making, and share his concern.
<P>
However, one of the opportunities that is afforded by developing a unified service is the opportunity for staff to become trained to work across a rather artificial divide between public law and private law cases, and for the current services to learn from each other. Staff who are familiar with their existing roles might prefer to continue to specialise, but in time I would expect staff who join CAFCASS to wish to become trained in working in both areas—indeed, many individuals within the current court welfare and guardian ad litem services have already expressed a wish to do so. That is not to diminish the training that is required, but rather to increase the breadth of skills of existing staff. I should also point out that the officers of the Official Solicitor already work in both public and private law cases, and their work is highly valued by judges.
<P>
We expect that once CAFCASS is established, it will take advantage of different methods of delivering more flexibility—for example, oral evidence, fast-track reports and single-issue reports. CAFCASS and the judiciary will work together to reduce unnecessary delays—for example, by better timetabling and case management. That will be of enormous benefit to the children and families who are the subjects of proceedings. CAFCASS will have a more versatile work force, which can be deployed to greater effect to address peaks and troughs in specific types of workload or respond to an unexpected crisis.
<P>
The new service presents a range of opportunities to staff to improve upon their professional skills, qualifications and experience, and to extend the range of work in which they are involved. For that reason, the requirements of courts in different cases would be spelt out in rules of court. I hope that that and the wish to unify the current service will encourage my hon. Friend not to press the amendment to a Division. I hope that I have clarified the role of the new generic court reporting officer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> The Minister's response was extremely helpful. I shall not risk incurring the wrath of my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Weaver Vale. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>6pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I want a brief clause stand part debate. I received only today a joint paper from the Association of Chief Officers of Probation, which I mentioned earlier, and the Central Probation Council. That paper raised those organisations' concerns about the clause. I received that paper too late to table the amendments that they suggested, but I should at least ventilate their concerns—the views of those important organisations should be considered.
<P>
ACOP and CPC raised issues relating to paragraphs (a) and (b) of clause 13(3). They are concerned about the Government's proposals for
<P>

The issue involves whether to use central or local control. I probe the Minister on this matter because when such organisations raise serious concerns, they have the right to ventilate them.
<P>
ACOP and CPC say that they have not heard convincing arguments from the Home Office
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>as to why central ownership of probation property is helpful.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Whichever party is in government, there is direct liaison between the Home Office and organisations such as ACOP and CPC. I am surprised that, at this late stage, those organisations feel that they have not had a sufficient response from the Home Office. They say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There has been poor consultation over the proposed national strategy and we are extremely concerned about the quality of information that has been gathered to back up the strategy.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am surprised that they expressed their concerns so strongly. They continue:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Home Office should wait to see the Audit Commission Report on the future of local government property before taking any decisions.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>

<P>
The Minister is hardly likely to say this afternoon, ``All right, we shall withdraw the clause.'' However, she and her officials should urgently contact ACOP and CPC to ensure that their views have been fully taken into account. Those bodies feel that consultation so far has been inadequate, so there should be further consultation. The two bodies say that they
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>need assurances that whatever system of ownership comes in, there—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
should
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>be flexible and responsive systems of management. Property use and management must reflect local need and boards must have flexibility.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Pepper v. Hart decision may mean that once they have heard the Minister's response, they will feel greater reassurance—I certainly hope so. They say that they hope that ``boards will remain responsible'' and potentially subject to action in relation to health and safety matters. They must be right to state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This is a vitally important matter for a criminal justice/law enforcement agency.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
They, and all Opposition Members who scrutinise legislation in Standing Committees, want assurances about the fact that the Government's proposals will involve
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>no additional costs to the service—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
from the Government's proposals. They want to know that their operational budgets will not be adversely affected by the method proposed by the Government.
<P>
Finally, in relation to subsection (3)(b), the CPC and ACOP say that it will be essential for the boards to have borrowing powers to ensure cash flow, as local authorities currently do on behalf of the local probation committees. They suggest—I hope that the Minister will consider it a constructive suggestion—that subsection (3)(b) should be phrased in the positive and prescribed by regulation.
<P>
I appreciate that these are not matters with which the Parliamentary Secretary can be expected to deal; they have come to me only today and therefore probably come as even more of a surprise to the Parliamentary Secretary and her officials. Nevertheless, they are important points, and I hope that the hon. Lady will be able to respond to them and will in due course table Government amendments to address some of them.

<P>

<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right to say that these points are as new to me as they were to him. I noted, however, his clear invitation to accept them and to consider further Government regulations. I assume that he is referring to orders. We shall note his enthusiasm for that method of dealing with the issues when he rises on other occasions to complain about unnecessary use of Government orders.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> The smile on the Parliamentary Secretary's face makes it clear that she knows that she is indulging in a little teasing. She knows perfectly well that I am putting these points forward because they have been raised by the two organisations as matters of concern. I have made it clear that that is what I am doing. She knows that I would probably be the last Member of the House to call for further regulation, but she could see that I was specifically quoting the phraseology used by ACOP and the CPC, instead of putting forward Opposition policy. I could not have been clearer.
<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> In all seriousness, both ACOP and the CPC are represented on the CAFCASS project development group, which met today, and are involved in other task teams that report to that group. Therefore, I am a little surprised if they feel that there has not been enough consultation on these issues. Strictly speaking, the other issues that the hon. Gentleman raised on their behalf have nothing to do with the establishment of CAFCASS and the other powers of the service outlined in the clause. The probation boards would have no remit as regards CAFCASS.
<P>
I probably have not adequately answered the points that the hon. Gentleman has raised. I shall have a good look at what he has said and at the comments from ACOP and the CPC and possibly address them by correspondence, if that is the appropriate way.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<H4><center>Provision of staff or services to other organisations</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I should signal now that I want to raise some important points on the next three clauses, especially clause 15.
<P>
I wish to raise a brief point on the clause in relation to the words that the Government have used in subsection (3), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Service may charge for anything done under arrangements under this section.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is extraordinarily wide phraseology. Even the Parliamentary Secretary will recognise that there might need to be an explanation that would help, under the rules of Pepper v. Hart, to set parameters.
<P>
That is the only point that I wish to raise on this stand part debate. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary can reassure me that there are some limitations on the charges that can be made under the clause. Any legislation that says that there may be a charge for anything, without apparently setting any parameters, seems extraordinarily widely drafted.
<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> Just as we want diversity of provision for CAFCASS's own services, we want to give it an opportunity to offer its expertise to others or to take advantage of opportunities for staff to widen their expertise and develop their skills. The clause provides that opportunity. It will enable and encourage professional and managerial development by allowing officers of CAFCASS to be seconded to other agencies, such as a voluntary organisation. That type of cross-fertilisation is an important part of partnership arrangements for those employed by CAFCASS and its partner organisations. Any charging regimes will be subject to appropriate practices and the arrangements that are made at the time.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 14 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 15</center></H4>
<H4><center>Right to conduct litigation and right of audience</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> As I said, I want to raise some more substantive points in relation to this clause. The Parliamentary Secretary will realise that the clause could make a fairly substantial extension to the people who will have rights of audience.
<P>
I declare an interest, particularly in relation to the clause, as somebody who has been a practising barrister. Although I am not currently in practice, I was in the past a member not only of the Bar Council for a number of years but of the Bar Council's inner cabinet, the general management committee. One must be careful, as that is sometimes abbreviated by barristers to GMC, an acronym that is used much more widely for the General Medical Council. The Bar Council has frequently been concerned about issues in relation to who may appear before the courts.
<P>
The Parliamentary Secretary and many other members of the Committee will know that the staff in the Official Solicitor's Department are enormously experienced. Both she and the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre have referred to the expertise that is often shown—universally shown in my experience—by the officials who have regularly conducted litigation. However, many people are bound to be worried that, because no limitation is apparently placed on who in the new service will have the right of audience before the courts, people who have not been properly trained and who come from another constituent part of the service, perhaps through somebody else's ill health or pressure of work, will be given the opportunity to appear before a court, without any fresh legislation.
<P>
My concern arises from my desire to ensure that those who are involved in these sensitive matters should have the appropriate expertise. If they are to have rights of audience on behalf of the service, surely some safeguard should be built in to the effect that only the right kind of people should conduct the cases. It may be more appropriate to deal with that matter by a Government amendment at a later stage. We have not sought in Committee to become involved in the technical complexities of finding a way to fit the clause into all the other Acts that have recently affected rights of audience, not least the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990. It would have been a fantastically complex exercise to interlink them all. I see the Parliamentary Secretary nodding. I think that she understands the point that I am making.
<P>
In this brief stand part debate I want to alert the Parliamentary Secretary to the issue here. It is not a question of demarcation disputes. We are talking about the genuine concerns of those involved in family law that people should have rights of audience only if they have appropriate legal qualifications and expertise. I hope that she will be able to reassure me that she and her officials will consider the point carefully; perhaps they already have it in mind. I do not regard it as a matter of partisan debate. I am seeking to be constructive and to discover what they have in mind. It is a serious matter if any clause extends as widely as the clause does the right to conduct litigation and rights of audience.
<P>
I must again refer to the paper that I received from ACOP and the Central Probation Council today. They suggested an amendment and referred to the need to prepare plans and budgets in relation to the exercise and financing of functions in any given year. They stated that the budget is a critical responsibility of the board and should be recognised as such, but they are anxious to establish the fact that it is incumbent on the Secretary of State to provide the funding and approve the budget and the plan in good time. It is far too late to table amendments to cover that, but as ACOP and the CPC raised the matter in their briefing today, I thought that I should refer to it.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> The hon. Gentleman has raised some wide-ranging issues. I cannot deal with his final point, but I shall deal with management competence. He referred to inappropriately trained and experienced officers being sent into court to perform functions for which they are not equipped. Let us take a moment to describe the structure, which will consist of a small national headquarters with around 20 field offices. There will be no formal regional tier or intermediate tier of management between those offices and headquarters. We intend to promote a flexible and responsive service that does not rely solely on those centres, but is able to respond to local demand and reduce delays.
<P>
Clause 15 gives officers of CAFCASS the same powers in relation to rights of audience and litigation that the Official Solicitor, alone among the current services, has. That goes back to an earlier debate on paragraph 17 of schedule 2 and the training and competence of staff. The new staff will have rights of audience in magistrates courts and county courts and will be able to conduct litigation in any court. The powers will be necessary to ensure that CAFCASS is able to undertake the full range of work for children that the Official Solicitor now does. Without those provisions, CAFCASS would be unable to react urgently to some of the complex cases reaching the High Court and unable to safeguard the interests of children.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I may be able to satisfy the hon. Gentleman on the point that he may be about to make.
<P>
The Official Solicitor's office is currently setting up a scheme to train staff in giving evidence. After that, in the process of establishing CAFCASS, it will be for the management of the service to appoint the appropriate individuals to undertake the work according to their competence and training.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> The hon. Lady is going part of the way towards responding to my point and I am grateful to her for that, but we are not discussing the right to conduct litigation for only those from the Official Solicitor's service. She may be saying that no one will conduct litigation in the foreseeable future other than those from the Official Solicitor's service and she may be referring only to training courses for people appearing as witnesses, but the clause gives rights to conduct litigation to anyone in any of the constituent parts of the service, including some who may never previously have conducted litigation, although many of them may have given evidence as witnesses. I am sure that she understands the distinction.
<P>
I accept that the Parliamentary Secretary said in her opening comments that she would be unable to go all the way today, but I hope that, when she has consulted her officials, she will be able to go a little further, perhaps in correspondence to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> I have forgotten whether that was an intervention.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It was an intervention, which is why I was beginning to get nervy.
<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. I shall carefully consider his comments and representations, and if it is necessary to follow that up in correspondence, I shall do so.
<P>
I cannot deal off the cuff with his final point concerning the briefing note from the lobbying organisations, but I shall respond in detail when I have had a chance to consider it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I am most grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for the way in which she has responded, especially to my rather lengthy intervention, for which I apologise, Mr. Maxton. I wanted to make the point before she sat down in order to give her an opportunity to respond.
<P>
On the point that the Parliamentary Secretary was unable to deal with, when I first looked at the amendment it seemed odd that ACOP and the CPC were referring to budgetary matters in terms of an amendment to clause 15. That may have been what baffled the Parliamentary Secretary; it certainly baffled me initially. However, they had not made a mistake: they were suggesting that an amendment could bring budgets within the scope of subsection (1)(a).
<P>
The Parliamentary Secretary has been very helpful in promising to consider the matter. No doubt she has a similar briefing; if not, I can send her a copy. The question of budgets fits more appropriately within other parts of the Bill, but because ACOP and the CPC suggested it that it should be raised under an amendment to clause 15, I felt that it was right to do so. Otherwise, the logic of their comments might be lost in the context of the stand part debate.
<P>
I welcome the Parliamentary Secretary's constructive response and hope that we will be able to consider these matters further.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 15 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 16</center></H4>
<H4><center>Cross-examination of officers of the Service</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Clause 16 clearly follows on from clause 15 in terms of wishing to draw the distinction that I sought to make in the previous stand part debate between those from the new service who give evidence as witnesses and those who conduct litigation. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will find it helpful, in dealing with my points under the previous stand part debate, to look at the way in which the two roles are divided in subsections (1) and (2).
<P>
I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to clarify, for the purposes of future examination of the Committee's proceedings under Pepper v. Hart, whether it is envisaged that someone who appears in court to conduct litigation could ever be treated as a witness in the course of the same proceedings. As the Parliamentary Secretary will know from her professional expertise, there has always been a clear distinction between those who appear as witnesses and those who conduct litigation. However, given the way in which clause 16 is drafted in relation to cross examination, it is possible to envisage a situation in which someone is conducting litigation and also, to some extent, giving evidence. The clause says that if that were the case, that person could not be open to cross examination, simply by virtue of the fact that they were exercising their right to conduct litigation.
<P>
That is not a big point, but it requires clarification. If the Parliamentary Secretary were able to say to me—if not now, perhaps when she has taken advice from her officials—that there will never be a situation in which the same official of the new service will both conduct litigation and seek to give evidence as a witness, that would probably deal with the point. There should not be too much blurring of the roles, because it would not be difficult for a judge, whether in a county court or on the bench of magistrates, to be confused as to the role in which a particular party is appearing. I hope that that will never happen.
<P>
If the Parliamentary Secretary cannot deal with the question today, perhaps she will respond in writing to me and other members of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. For the record, I make it clear that currently the different approaches to cross examination apply to three different services. At the moment, only the Guardians ad litem reporting officers are able to be cross examined. It is important that we are committed to an open and accountable service. The lack of opportunity to test the assessment made by the other reporting officer practitioners in connection with the full range of children's cases has provoked public unease about the process of determination and an apparent lack of contestability. I am convinced that clauses 15 and 16 will be widely welcomed.
<P>
I offer this point to reassure the hon. Gentleman. If a CAFCASS officer appeared as a witness, it would not be for that person to conduct the case. It would be up to CAFCASS to ensure that it was not the same person. Again, the service would determine that. It is important, however, that we retain the flexibility to use the Official Solicitor in those circumstances.
<P>
I hope that that reassurance will meet the concerns raised by the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 16 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 17</center></H4>
<H4><center>Inspection</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 74, in page 7, line 39, leave out from beginning to `on' and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(a) with the Social Services Inspectorate to jointly inspect and report to the Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Health'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Throughout the past couple of hours, a most eloquent case has been made for CAFCASS. There are justifiably high expectations that it will provide a high-quality amalgamated service for children. It is essential that a service that is operating in the crucial, delicate spheres of private law and is employing people to act as advocates for children in public proceedings meets the highest standards of social work practice. That is confirmed by everything that I have heard this afternoon.
<P>
The Government are clearly committed to the highest standards of practice in social work and to the development and improvement of practice among social workers. The Care Standards Bill will establish a general social services council. It cannot be appropriate that such a vital social service should be inspected only by magistrates court service inspectors, as envisaged in the clause. I mean absolutely no disrespect to that service—clearly, it has an important role to play—but, surely, there is a need to involve the social services inspectorate in the scrutiny of professional practice, standards, training and procedures to ensure that the service meets the high standards to which we all aspire.
<P>
I do not suppose for a moment that the wording of the amendment is entirely acceptable or perfectly correct, but I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will appreciate the spirit behind it. If we are to develop a service that excels far beyond the standards that we have at present, avoids the sort of criticisms that people make about the existing court welfare service and transcends the kind of reproaches that we hear in relation to existing standards of service in social work, we must have well informed, professional arm's length inspection. We need to have people to examine the crucial social work tasks. Such tasks would include assessing a situation, understanding it, reporting it clearly and accurately and dealing with questions of residence and contact and other specific issues, such as where a child will live or whether a child ought to leave the country. The service will deal with a great number of people, and it is crucial that we have a social work inspection of such a crucial social service. It could be as part of a joint inspection with the magistrates court service but, if we are to attain the high standards that we all want, there must be social work inspection of that social work service.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Amess </B>(Southend, West): I do not want to spoil the hon. Gentleman's case—he has more expertise in this context than I have. His arguments were compelling and it is good common sense to involve social services in the way in which he described. The Parliamentary Secretary will advise us about whether the amendment is drafted correctly. If she does not agree to the amendment, I hope that she will at least take on the points that he raised and take appropriate action on Report.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I echo the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West and of the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre. The Parliamentary Secretary will tell us whether the amendment's drafting is perfect, but its phraseology seems to have value.
<P>
The fact that the involvement of the social services inspectorate would be followed by a report to the Secretary of State for Health is a valuable additional factor. The Parliamentary Secretary may say that the approach cannot be adopted because the amendment is defective, but she should recognise that the Opposition agree with the hon. Gentleman. His proposal would provide—to use the fashionable phrase—added value. Additional bureaucracy will not be involved because the inspection will take place anyway. If the inspection involves the social services inspectorate, as the hon. Gentleman suggests, the report will not simply go to one part of government; it will also go to the Secretary of State for Health, which can only be beneficial.
<P>
I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman will try the patience of the hon. Member for Weaver Vale—the hon. Member for Weaver Vale does not appear to think so, because he is temporarily departing from us. If the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre pressed the amendment to a Division, we should support it.
<P>
<B>Jane Kennedy:</B> We carefully considered the options before we decided on Her Majesty's magistrates court service inspectorate. We looked carefully at all the inspectorates that have a role in relation to family court welfare officers, guardians ad litem and the courts. I was impressed by the fact that MCSI has experience of the courts. We recognise that, where necessary, it might need to work closely with the other inspectorates—the social services inspectorate and the inspectorate of probation—and that it could to learn from their experience of handling children and family matters.
<P>
There are pre-existing and clear reporting lines between MCSI and the Lord Chancellor. As the inspectorate for CAFCASS, MCSI could be extremely flexible, which would help it to develop its expertise and to keep up with future developments in CAFCASS. I see MCSI's work almost weekly and I have much respect for the detail that is involved and for the close way in which its collaborates with other bodies.
<P>
I acknowledge the concerns that were raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre but I fully anticipate that MCSI will work closely with the social services inspectorate and with other bodies. It would not help CAFCASS or the people whom we are seeking to serve by introducing the new service if we saddled CAFCASS with a method for inspecting and reporting its work that was unnecessarily cumbersome. I strongly urge my hon. Friend not to press the amendment to a vote. I gave the matter long and careful consideration and I studied the various inspectorates.
<P>
Another complication is that there are two separate social services inspectorates—one for England and one for Wales. We anticipated a plethora of different inspectorates working for a common aim, and it was my view that we should settle on a single inspectorate and require it to work with others where necessary to provide close and detailed inspection. That will be necessary if CAFCASS is to be supported and allowed to develop in a way that will enable it to perform the function that we expect of it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> I shall withdraw my amendment, but I hope that my hon. Friend will reflect on the matter, because if further progress is not made, I shall want to return to it.
<P>
If this is to be a high-quality mainstream service that will not occupy a backwater isolated from modern conceptions of child development and social work, it must be thoroughly inspected by a social work service.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I understand why the hon. Gentleman does not want to press his amendment to a vote, were he to do so, he would not be popular with the Parliamentary Secretary or the hon. Member for Weaver Vale. He and I share an entirely genuine concern that the Parliamentary Secretary should continue to look at the matter. I am glad that he continues to speak forcefully, and I hope he realises that we support his belief that this is an important issue that the Parliamentary Secretary should not forget.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. As other Committee members have intimated, the reason why I am not pressing the amendment to a vote has little to do with my hon. Friend the Member for Weaver Vale. We have had an excellent discussion on what could prove a high-quality service. I want it to succeed, but it needs independent inspection from a social work perspective.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony McWalter </B>(Hemel Hempstead): Does my hon. Friend agree that the matter relates directly to the earlier question of whether one should consider simply the child's welfare or its welfare and interests? If the remit for investigations is widened, his amendment becomes more relevant. In reconsidering the matter, I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will draw on our debate on welfare and interests, rather than welfare alone.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who brings his inimitable philosophical approach to this subject.
<P>
I have little more to say. These are crucial issues that relate to the welfare of children. However good the magistrates court service may be—and I have no reason to doubt that it provides an excellent service—it does not have the professional training or background to assess the quality of social work interventions in those important areas. If the service is to have the credibility that it needs and deserves in the light of the work that has gone into it, it must be scrutinised by an arm's length social work service.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Clause 17 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 18</center></H4>
<H4><center>Definitions</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I refer again to the briefing from ACOP and the Central Probation Council. They raised a small but important point that arose when the hon. Member for Taunton spoke in relation to an earlier proposal, which she and her hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon may not have realised that they were making. The Committee will remember that we had a debate on the right person to consider the matter and the hon. Lady suggested the prisons ombudsman. ACOP and the CPC suggested that clause 18 would be the appropriate place in which to include a requirement that the prisons ombudsman should consider the matter.
<P>
The hon. Lady would not have realised that her proposal had the support of ACOP and the CPC. I see the hon. Member for Taunton shaking her head, so she must have been inspired by a thought similar to that of ACOP and the CPC. No doubt the Minister will want to repeat her earlier response, but I thought it only fair to ACOP and the CPC to say that they support a requirement for an independent person to be available to consider the service, whether it is the prisons ombudsman, another ombudsman or, as the Minister suggested, simply the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration under paragraph 17 of schedule 2. ACOP and the CPC are entitled to have their concern ventilated and their suggestion was that it could have been dealt with by way of an amendment to clause 18.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I do not have the benefit of foresight or crystal-ball gazing, so I did not know what the ACOP briefing that arrived today would say when I tabled my amendments some days ago. I am sure that the Minister's response will be similar to the one she gave this morning, which was positive and helpful and with which ACOP and others will be pleased.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Paul Boateng):</B> I value the advice and contributions of ACOP to the development of policy. I have not had the benefit of the briefing to which the hon. Member for Surrey Heath referred, although I addressed ACOP this very afternoon. I shall reflect on its view, as I shall reflect on our useful debate this morning. I shall return with my more considered response at an appropriate time.
<P>
Question accordingly agreed to.
<P>
Clause 18 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 19</center></H4>
<H4><center>Property</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 66, in page 9, line 5, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) Stamp duty is not chargeable in respect of any transfer or grant to the Service effected by virtue of this section.
<P>
( ) No instrument made or executed under or in pursuance of the scheme for the purposes of such a transfer or grant is to be treated as duly stamped unless—
<P>
(a) it is stamped with the duty to which it would, but for this section, be liable, or
<P>
(b) it has, in accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Stamp Act 1891, been stamped with a particular stamp denoting that it is not chargeable with any duty or that it has been duly stamped.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This new subsection exempts from stamp duty property transferring to the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service and will save unnecessary public expenditure. There was an earlier exchange on the status of CAFCASS, which will be a non-Crown body and because it will be in receipt of property under the Bill it would normally attract stamp duty unless specifically exempted. CAFCASS would have to be funded to pay duty and that would mean an overall increase in public expenditure. The exemption is in line with precedence under this Government and the previous one for stamp duty exemptions on transfers within the public sector under legislation providing for reorganisation of public bodies. It is sensible and has the agreement of the Inland Revenue, and I commend the amendment to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I understand why the Minister was amused when reference was made to Inland Revenue approval. He would be very unpopular with his colleagues in the Treasury if that were not the case, but while he was speaking my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Luff) and I were reflecting that if the matter had been dealt with in the Finance Bill, as stamp duty matters so often are, instead of the Bill before us, the longest Finance Bill on record would have been even longer. Comment has already been made publicly that the Finance Bill is the longest ever after the shortest Budget speech ever, which must be a mistake.
<P>
Nevertheless, the matter was dealt with similarly when previous reorganisations took place under the previous Government and the present one. The Minister and I may cross swords on many Treasury matters, but I do not think that we shall disagree on this small Treasury-related matter in the Bill.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Clause 19 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Schedule 3 agreed to.
<P>
Clauses 20 to 23 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Further consideration adjourned.—[Mr. Mike Hall.]
