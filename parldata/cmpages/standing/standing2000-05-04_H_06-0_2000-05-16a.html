</P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind members of the Committee either to switch off their mobiles or to put them on to silent alert. At our sitting on Thursday, Mr. St. Aubyn diligently drew attention to the fact that the explanatory notes were incomplete. I understand that revised sets of the notes are now available in the Room for those who require them.

<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury </B>(Mr. Stephen Timms): Thank you, Mr. Cook. The explanatory notes that were sent to the Vote Office were complete and accurate. However, those that were delivered to the Room omitted references to clauses 18 to 30, the fault for which lies entirely with the Treasury, and I apologise to the Committee for that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin (West Dorset):</B> On a point of order, Mr. Cook. The Financial Secretary kindly offered to write to the Committee about the Treasury's predictions on interest rates. We have not yet received the letter. Can he offer us any advice in the meantime?

<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Jack (Fylde):</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Cook. It would be pertinent for such information to be made available to the Committee in the light of today's announcement that the headline rate of inflation has now reached 3 per cent.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Documents circulated by the Minister are not a matter for the Chair.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Cook-

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have just said that that matter was not a point of order, but the hon. Gentleman may continue.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am grateful for your indulgence, Mr. Cook. I shall be writing to members of the Committee shortly.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): Further to the point of order about the inadequacy of the explanatory notes, Mr. Cook. The Financial Secretary wrote to us recently saying that the schedule relating to the climate change levy was incomplete and failed to deal with problems of double taxation. He said that various amendments would be tabled in due course. The Government have now tabled an amendment that we could reach today, but it will not take us much further forward, given that it is no good our discussing such amendments unless we know the content of the regulations. The Committee is still in the dark about such matters. The Government said that they created a muddle and that the schedule is incomplete, but obviously the Committee is not to know in detail how the Government intend to deal with the serious problem of potential double taxation for the energy tax.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I understand that further notes have been circulated. The right hon. Gentleman's point is a matter for debate when we reach the appropriate point in the Bill, at which time we shall enjoy the exchanges that will take place. Unless there are any more points of order, let us now continue. I have had a disastrous weekend, so I do not want members of the Committee to add to it.

<H4><center>Clause 19</center></H4>
<H4><center>Changes in exemption from duty</center></H4>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Amendment No. 3 is not moved so we come to amendment No. 31.

<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): I beg to move amendment No. 31, in page 15, line 20, after ``from'', insert ``or arrive at''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 32, in page 15, line 24, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or which comprises an island community which has no other means of public transport to the mainland of the United Kingdom for at least two months during a calendar year.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> Thank you, Mr. Cook. I hope that today's proceedings, and my contribution, will make up for the weekend that you had. I am sure that right hon. and hon. Members will wish to add to your enjoyment of the Committee.

<P>
I welcome the clause, particularly proposed sections (4B) and (4C) and the exemption of the Scottish highlands and islands from air passenger duty. As the Government wish to put the exemption on an objective basis, the highlands and islands are not specifically referred to-but that is the only region that would fulfil the criteria on population density. Hon. Members from all parties have welcomed that much-needed provision, which the amendment seeks to improve. To explain why it is necessary, we need to look at the history of air passenger duty. It was a Tory tax, introduced in 1994 and doubled in 1997. It was one of the 22 tax rises made much of by Labour in the general election. While there were exemptions to the tax, for aircraft weighing less than 10 tonnes, or more than 10 tonnes but with 20 seats or fewer, that did not help many of the aircraft serving the Scottish highlands and islands. Indeed, it was estimated that more than a quarter of the inter-island flights were subject to air passenger duty, as were most of the flights for the mainland.

<P>
As the exemption is so necessary, we wish to extend it. The Treasury estimated in the mid-1990s that air passenger duty would reduce the number of flights by 2.5 per cent. I am told by the highlands and islands airports that in their area the reduction may have been greater. It is difficult to isolate the effect because there is an overall growth in air traffic, but those airports tell me that their projections of the growth in air traffic between the islands, and between the islands and the mainland, has been much slower than expected. They put that down largely to the introduction of air passenger duty. Whether or not one considers that the effect has been significant, there is a key principle involved, which the Government are right to address. There are remote areas in Britain that depend on air services for much of the year-indeed, sometimes all the time. Air passenger duty represents a much greater proportion of the ticket price in those areas because flights tend to be much shorter than others in the UK and abroad.

<P>
The situation is even worse when one looks at the logistics of it because many of the flights between islands and between the islands and the mainland are feeder flights, which connect with on-going flights, meaning that passengers pay even more APD. So it is not surprising that people living in the Scottish highlands and islands were miffed, to say the least, at the introduction of APD.

<P>
Labour Members, and many of my hon. Friends, opposed the introduction of the tax and the way in which it hits the remote areas of our country. In January 1994, when that year's Finance Bill was discussed in Committee on the Floor of the House, my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace), now the acting First Minister of the Scottish Executive, highlighted the communities that he represented by saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>airlines are crucial to livelihoods and island living  There is also much price sensitivity in respect of businesses in the highlands and islands  In addition, flights are very expensive for people who wish to visit the islands as tourists. The duty will be an added  imposition.-[Official Report, 31 January 1994; Vol. 236, c. 649.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He made clear the Liberal Democrat opposition to air passenger duty and the damaging effect of the duty on his constituents. It is not surprising that the 1997 Liberal Democrat manifesto for the highlands and islands stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We will exempt peripheral Highlands and Islands airports from Air Passenger Duty.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs Michie) corresponded a great deal with Ministers at the time, pointing out that air travel was in no way a luxury or even a convenience for her constituents. The campaign has a long history, and I pay tribute to Labour Members who have fought for it in government. That is the reason for the clause.

<P>
The tax has been so pernicious that it is important that the exemption is right. We must consider how it will affect people on a practical level. In many of the communities, there is not a full range of health services as the population density does not warrant it. People taken ill have to use air services to go to hospital for some treatments. The communities often do not have the range of educational services that we enjoy on the mainland, especially in post-16 education, so students are dependent on air passenger services. Such remote areas often suffer from high levels of unemployment, so job search requires air travel. Also, the communities depend on tourism, so the tax can be significant to the economy. There is a strong case for exemption, but the Government's proposal goes only half way, almost literally. It applies only to flights from airports located in the highlands and islands, not flights to them. Amendment No. 31 seeks to put that right.

<P>
Given the strong case that I have outlined, which the Government clearly accept or they would not have put the clause in the Bill, why have they not proposed what amendment No. 31 suggests? The Financial Secretary will explain the Government's position in due course, but let me anticipate his remarks. I believe that their proposals are due to the European Court of Justice judgment that struck down the previous Government's exemption for all United Kingdom domestic return flights. The court found that that exemption went against article 90 of the treaty, which basically stated that one could not discriminate against services or goods from another country.

<P>
Can we read that judgment, and the way in which article 90 is being interpreted by the courts in other cases, to suggest that an exemption to return flights to the Scottish highlands and islands would also be struck down? I do not believe that we can, which is the key legal point. Other countries in the European Union give concessions on flights to some regions on the grounds that those regions are relatively remote, economically deprived or over-dependent on air transport. Those concessions exist elsewhere and have been upheld by both the Commission and the European Court. Other countries within the EU allow passenger duty exemptions or their equivalent to and from islands in remote areas. That is a strong case for the Government to accept the point. They might say ``Well, in other countries only the leg from those regional areas is allowed'', although I do not believe that that is the case. Under clause 19, flights that arrive at those airports could still be exempt.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
I have been looking through commentaries on EU law, such as Weatherill and Beaumont's on EU law 1999, in which article 90 is discussed in some detail. They state-and the Government have clearly taken it on board-that if there is an objective justification for an exemption based not on nationality, but on other objective criteria, the Commission is unlikely to challenge it, and that if it were to be challenged, the European Court would uphold the national exemption. There has been some discussion on the matter but I will not bore the Committee by reading it out in full. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>An objectively justifiable reason that is unconnected with nationality is capable of explaining the selection of the factor that operates indirectly to discriminate on grounds of nationality.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That commentary takes as evidence a 1986 case-the Commission v. Italy. It says that if some objective justification can be found, even if it indirectly discriminates on grounds of nationality but is still objective, it is allowable. That is clearly the Government's route and the amendment would develop that, while keeping within the objective criterion set out in new subsection (4C). That objective criterion is the key point.

<P>
In other areas of EU law, particularly with respect to article 91, the principle of proportionality is being applied. If a Government have a social and economic objective that involves a degree of discrimination and if the tax change is proportional to meeting that objective and does not create a large degree of discrimination to imports or services from other EU countries, it is acceptable. I understand that there are no non-UK EU airports servicing the Scottish highlands and islands airports, which is perhaps not surprising. It would not be out of proportion to introduce an exemption both to and from regional areas. It is certainly along the lines on which EU trade and tax laws have been developed by the Commission and the European Court.

<P>
Amendment No. 32 is similar and complementary to amendment No. 31 and the Government's proposal, but goes a little further using objective criteria. In the explanatory notes on clause 19, the Government explain the reasons for introducing an exemption to the Scottish highlands and islands by saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This exemption has been introduced in recognition of the remoteness of the region and the reliance on air transport.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the rationale behind amendment No. 32. Some island communities that are not in the Scottish highlands and islands are heavily dependent on air services. I am thinking particularly of the Isles of Scilly that are dependent on air services for three, four and sometimes five months a year. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives (Mr. George) for the background information that he has given me to enable me to speak to the amendment. He is a diligent Member of Parliament who represents his community with some distinction.

<P>

<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): A true champion of Cornwall.

<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> As my hon. Friend says, my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives is a true champion of Cornwall. [Hon. Members: ``Where is he?''] He is not a member of the Committee, but he has helped me diligently with the clause. Hon. Members should salute him for that.

<P>
My hon. Friend often travels from the mainland to the Isles of Scilly to talk with his constituents, so he knows about the problems that they experience on that journey, and he explained them to me in detail. There are three ways in which to reach the Isles of Scilly. First, a boat called the Scillonian makes the trip during seven or eight months of the year. Secondly, a small fixed-wing aircraft called the Skybus flies from Land's End. Thirdly, a helicopter operated by British International flies from Penzance. It is estimated that for three or four months in the year, people are reliant on the Skybus or the British International helicopter service.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am listening to the hon. Gentleman's argument with great interest. Does he happen to know how many seats there are in the two aircraft to which he has referred?

<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The Financial Secretary anticipates what I am about to say. Neither of those services is liable for air passenger duty. The service from Penzance, operated by British International, qualifies for exemption because its tonnage is 9.15, which is below the limit of 10 tonnes. The Skybus has up to 19 seats, and so qualifies on the seat exemption. However, the people running those services intend to expand and, as tourism grows and the island communities prosper under the careful representation of my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives, they will wish to invest in and develop larger aircraft.

<P>
I had the privilege to speak to Captain Terry Nelson, who operates the British International service. He said that, in the next two years, the company intended to operate with a larger aircraft that would not qualify for exemptions based on tonnage or seats. If they invested in the larger aircraft, the duty would hit them because the exemptions that they currently enjoy would not apply. Therefore, exemption is acting as a ceiling on investment and a brake to developing services for the islands, which cannot be right. It is a false barrier to developing services, and I am sure that the Financial Secretary would agree that it is not a sensible one. I hope that he will look at it again with the Isles of Scilly in mind.

<P>
Much of what I said about the Scottish highlands and islands applies to the Isles of Scilly. Children in post-16 education are dependent on air services. There is a cottage hospital on St. Mary's, but that cannot deal with all the consultations that the population of the islands requires. First-class mail is dependent on air services, as are family and business visits for much of the year. It cannot be right that the services should suddenly become liable to APD.

<P>
I will describe the possible impact on prices of the imposition of APD. The single fare of £47 for the helicopter service would increase by 21 per cent. in one step. That is equal to three times the increase that British International has made over five years. It would be a huge increase in the cost of flying for the residents of, and visitors to, the islands. That is a clear signal of the barrier in the way of those who run such vital services.

<P>
My final point is related to competition. APD applies only to air services, which are in competition with the boat service, Scillonian. Therefore, if APD applies when it invests in new aircraft, there would be unfair competition with the boat service.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 31 and 32 are completely in line with the Government's thinking. They develop the objective criteria introduced by clause 19, and are relevant to Ministers' concerns, which they also expressed in opposition. They are a logical extension of the Government's position. If the Government will not accept the amendments today, I hope that the Financial Secretary will at least allow further consideration of the amendments, especially with regard to the detailed legal issues that relate to the Scottish highlands and islands. Like him, I would not want to change British law in a way that would contravene EU law. I have reflected on the matter, however, and merely extending the objective criteria should not cause a problem. If the Financial Secretary will not accept the amendments now, I hope that he and his officials will at least reflect on the matter further.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I shall delight the Financial Secretary and the Committee by being brief. The Opposition fully support the burden of the amendments tabled by Liberal Democrat Members.

<P>
Amendment No. 32 relates to a point that I raised, inadvertently, when we were meant to be discussing clause 18. I have no doubt that the current exemption is unfair to a particular part of the United Kingdom, which is as remote, by any rational definition, as the highlands and islands. I am sure that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) will agree that whether that is addressed by amendment No. 32 or by other means is immaterial-it needs to be addressed.

<P>
On amendment No. 31, I should like to develop the hon. Gentleman's remarks on the feasibility of implementing such provisions as his amendment would entail, given the rulings of the European Court of Justice. Before I do so, I should point out that, as currently drafted, the exemption contains an asymmetry, which-I think-is unintended but clearly erroneous. As a result, some flights to the highlands and islands would be exempt on outward and inward journeys, because the journey is from and to places within the region. In other equally remote communities, which have differently configured air routes, only the outward journey from the highlands and islands would be exempt. There is no rational basis in public policy for giving a double exemption to someone who has to go to hospital in one place and a single exemption to someone who has to go to hospital in another place. If that became the law of the land, it could not be challenged in court-although it would be interesting to try to mount a challenge under the Human Rights Act 1998 on grounds of unfair discrimination. The purpose of Parliament is not to enact a Bill that manifestly and unfairly discriminates against one set of people who are exactly in the same position as another set of people. The matter is causing an awful lot of fuss and bother at the moment in the highlands, and clearly needs to be dealt with. I believe that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) would agree that whether that is done through the working in his amendment or otherwise is immaterial.

<P>
To return to the hon. Gentleman's argument, the legal crux of the matter is that either the test in proposed new subsection (4B)-that, in order to gain the exemption,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the flight is to depart from an airport which is in a region  designated by order<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
-is a good and objective test and hence does not fall foul of the ruling of the ECJ, or it is not. So far, so clear. If it is a good and objective test, the fact that the flight's destination is such a place is as good and objective a test and as unlikely to fall foul of the ruling as the test that the flight should originate from such a place would be.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
I am perfectly certain that the wildest imaginations of the judges of the ECJ do not extend to distinguishing between destination and origin as a means of distinguishing between objectivity and subjectivity. There is no rational basis for doing so. Either the provision is workable as it stands, in which case so too is amendment No. 31, or it is not, in which case we need a new provision. Either way, the Financial Secretary should do exactly what the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton suggests, and return on Report with a considered set of amendments that tackle the problem-unless, of course, he is happy to accept the amendments as drafted, which we shall certainly vote in favour of unless he suggests that he will return.

<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): I rise to endorse each and every word of the powerful and compelling speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton. He has researched his subject well, and knows it well. The amendments anticipate and would pre-empt problems that could arise in future, especially involving the Isles of Scilly and Cornwall, a county that I know well: my constituency adjoins it from north to south.

<P>
I draw the Committee's and the Financial Secretary's attention to the fact that, as I said from a sedentary position, Cornwall has, in my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives, a true champion, like my other colleagues from Cornwall. However, it must be remembered that Cornwall recently qualified for objective 1 funding. My constituency and other constituencies in Devon have qualified for objective 2 funding. That is telling. It illustrates a fact that is little known in other parts of Britain-that the gross domestic product per head in Cornwall and parts of Devon is extremely low, and that those areas need the economic assistance of which they have been deprived for many years.

<P>
We are intent on reversing that economic decline. The amendments would go some way to do so, and I hope that the Government will consider them carefully and adopt them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The group contains a third amendment that is similar in purpose to amendment No. 31, which the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton moved. The purpose of both amendments is to ensure that not only flights from the highlands and islands but flights to the region will qualify for the exemption. We have considered the matter carefully. The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton was right to say that many people have called for such a change; my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) has been especially vigorous in pressing the case for it. However, we concluded that the costs of the change would outweigh the benefits, as I shall explain in a moment.

<P>
I shall first explain how the highlands and islands will benefit from the changes in the Bill. At present, duty on a return ticket for flights made within the United Kingdom that involve an airport in the highlands and islands is £10. Following the abolition of the return leg exemption, which is necessary because, as we heard, the legislation that the previous Government introduced was defective, it would have risen to £20. However, the combined effect of the proposed exemption for departures from airports in the highlands and islands and the reduced rate for economy class fares will be to reduce the duty liability on most return tickets on flights between the region and the rest of the European Economic Area to £5.

<P>
As for return journeys within the highlands and islands, there will be no duty to pay. I always enjoy it when the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) alights on something for which he says there is no rational basis. Invariably, he says that when he has found something that has been particularly well designed, which is certainly the case now. He is right: no air passenger duty will have to be paid for flights within the highlands and islands. That is a good feature of the clause. The changes are particularly helpful to the highlands and islands; they recognise the sparsity of the population and the necessary high reliance on air travel.

<P>
To be proof against legal challenge, any exemption must apply equally to any region in the European Economic Area meeting an objective set of criteria. The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton was right about using an objective test and that test is set out in new subsection (4C). Amendments Nos. 3 and 31 are both worded to apply to flights to United Kingdom airports only but, to avoid legal challenge, the exemption would also have to apply to flights to any part of the European Economic Area, thus meeting the sparsity threshold under new subsection (4C). The exemption would need to cover parts of Sweden, Finland, Norway and probably the whole of Iceland. That lack of targeting makes the proposed exemption pretty poor value for money. It is hard to argue that United Kingdom taxpayers should be subsidising flights to Iceland and Norway. It would be an expensive way in which to convey extra help to the highlands and islands because a large chunk of the money would support flights to other parts of the European Economic Area.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> The Minister is arguing that, if amendment No. 31 was accepted and flights that arrived at remote airports were exempt, too, it would cost the UK taxpayer huge amounts of money. Will he give the Committee an estimate of the amount? The types of airports that he has mentioned are not as regularly serviced from this country as he seems to think.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> My off-the-cuff estimate is about £10 million. There are significant numbers of flights from the United Kingdom to Iceland. The whole of Norway could be affected. There is a technical problem because the sparsity parameter that we have used under new subsection (4C), although well defined within the European Union, is not so well defined in other parts of the European Economic Area, including Norway.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Notwithstanding his animadversions on my faith, the Financial Secretary has not explained himself clearly. Is the underlying logic of his argument that, if we were to define flights as being exempt if they arrived at places with such a level of inhabitation, we would also have to exempt those places outside the United Kingdom with such a level? Despite the fact that they would not have been designated by order, why does not the reverse logic apply? Why is it not the case that, by exempting as the point of origin places designated by order as having a low inhabitation, we need to designate places outside the United Kingdom as points of origin with low inhabitation? I do not understand why destination and origin are fundamentally different.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I shall endeavour to explain the position. We would not be allowed to withhold designation by order from areas within the EEA that meet the sparsity threshold-to do so would lay us open to legal challenge- so we would have to designate such areas in addition to the highlands and islands. Air passenger duty is levied only on flights departing from UK airports. That is the reason why the problem that the hon. Gentleman described does not arise. We levy duty on a flight from the UK to the highlands and islands, for example, and would have to treat flights from the UK to Iceland in the same way.

<P>
The duty applies only to flights leaving UK airports. Air passenger duty is not applied to flights leaving other airports, in Iceland or anywhere else. Therefore there is no problem with exempting flights leaving from the highlands and islands. I apologise for that slightly long-winded way of answering the question, but I hope that the point is now clear.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I think that I have understood the gist of what the Financial Secretary is saying; I had missed some of it before. To ensure that I have now understood, I shall recapitulate. Because the only point at which the tax is levied is that of departure at a UK airport, it is not a problem that we do not exempt flights to Iceland, for example, because we can exempt only those flights starting in the highlands and islands, knowing that all flights from there, to whatever destination, will be exempt and hence not fall foul of the EU treaty provisions. So far, so good. I understand the next leg of the Financial Secretary's argument to be that we cannot do the same for flights arriving there because all flights from any UK airport to any place falling under the inhabitation rule would then have to be designated as exempt. That is also so far, so good. However, can the Financial Secretary explain why it would be impossible to solve the problem by having a negative air passenger duty for flights that are, in effect, return flights from the highlands and islands to the nearest point? Specifying only that the flight should have started in the highlands and islands would achieve the same economic effect. That would solve the problem admirably. There may be 13 other such solutions, but is the Financial Secretary not as clear in his mind as are Opposition Members that something needs to be done to address the problem?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am intrigued by the idea of a negative rate of air passenger duty-I have no idea how that would work and I suspect that the airlines would have something to say about such a concept, given the complexity of calculating it.

<P>
To sum up the position in a nutshell, the only area that meets the sparsity threshold in proposed new subsection (4C), and which would therefore be exempt from APD, is the highlands and islands. That is why this measure is sound and proof against legal challenge. It constitutes a substantial improvement on the present position. Flights to, from and within the highlands and islands will bear significantly less duty than at present. Whether an arrangement involving negative duty could be implemented is an interesting speculation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> New subsection (4D) gives the Treasury the ability to define the region referred to in terms of population density. Given that the Treasury has that freedom, will he tell us whether the court has ever questioned definitions of regions made by national Governments, and against which criteria it has done so?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I cannot quote the hon. Gentleman any precedents, but we understand that an arrangement conferred that benefit only on a region in the United Kingdom. Regions with the same characteristics in other parts of the European Economic Area would be liable to European Union challenge.

<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> It is an important point. Most flights from the UK to Iceland, Norway and Sweden are to cities with high population density and large, international airports. There must be few flights from UK airports to airports inside or outside the EU with low population densities, so I question the Financial Secretary's estimate of £10 million. It seems unbelievable.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> We are using an EU definition for population density, which is called NUTS 2-the nomenclature of units of territorial statistics 2. NUTS 2 areas have a population density of not more than 12.5 persons per sq km. That statistic is defined at a regional level. Some regions meet the NUTS 2 figure, but have reasonably sized populations.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Like Stockholm.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> No, Stockholm would not qualify. Northern Sweden, not the whole of Sweden, would meet the sparsity threshold. The whole of Iceland would fall within the category, and it would account for most of the £10 million.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> If the clause were approved by Parliament and an international airport that took individuals to Singapore, Paris, Rome and so forth were constructed on a remote island in Scotland, what would be the levy on those flights so far as the tax is concerned?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Nil.

<P>
On amendment No. 32, as the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton said, planes that weigh less than 10 tonnes or have fewer than 20 seats are exempted from air passenger duty. That applies to flights to and from most UK island communities. I understand that there is only one operator for the Isles of Scilly, which is Skybus. As the hon. Gentleman said, the aircraft that it operates qualify for the exemption from duty.

<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> Just to clarify, there is another operator. British International operates a helicopter service.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am grateful for that information. The hon. Gentleman acknowledged that accepting the amendment would make no practical difference to the current air passenger duty liability of travellers from island communities.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman said that circumstances might change in the next few years, and if larger aircraft were to operate and the Government chose to introduce an exemption, we would need a better trigger than the one proposed in the amendment. He may agree. The amendment would mean that any public transport competitor to an airline-for example, a ferry operator-could ensure that there was no exemption from air passenger duty by running an occasional service so that there was not a two-month gap in availability. If the intent was to do as the hon. Gentleman spelt out, we would need a mechanism other than the one proposed in the amendment, and one that was compatible with EU law. The reaction of the European Commission to that is difficult to assess. It might regard it as consistent with its regional policy, although it might object to a new definition different from that used to justify the exemption to the Scottish highlands and islands under new subsection (4C). In practice, the amendment would not assist smaller island communities. If it were to change, a different way would have to be found if it was thought desirable to introduce some exemption.

<P>
Let me sum up the benefits of the change. We are removing the conflict with European Union requirements-left behind by the previous Government-without increasing the rate on any economy fares; halving the United Kingdom duty for all those people flying from the United Kingdom to other parts of the European Economic Area; halving the rate of duty for single flights within the United Kingdom; halving the duty on flights from the highlands and islands to other parts of the United Kingdom; abolishing the duty within the highlands and islands and forgoing revenue of about £80 million a year. The change is one of the measures in the Budget that will contribute significantly to a reduction in the overall tax burden. It is a great package, and I commend it to the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am sorry to detain the Committee further, but I think that the schoolmasterly verdict from the Financial Secretary and his assistants-

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Member as he is getting into full flow, but it would be helpful if he could speak up because I cannot hear him very well.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I apologise to the hon. Gentleman. In my efforts to be sure of addressing you, Mr. Cook, I failed to convey my remarks to the hon. Gentleman. The schoolmasterly verdict on the Financial Secretary's effects is, ``Good boy, but must try harder'', because what he has described is Euro-madness. It may be that there are substantial intricacies in delivering a rational solution so that people who have to fly to Glasgow, for example, are not to be put at a disadvantage compared with people who have to fly to some other destination within the highlands and islands. It may be that some category of definition that is-with, I presume, unconscious irony-described as the ``NUTS definition'', causes that intricacy to occur. I know not and moreover I care not, in the sense that it must be helpful, within the rules laid down by the European Court of Justice, to devise some rational scheme that delivers the right result. That might be by a process of discussion with the Commission, by a process of more imagination being exercised domestically, or by a combination of those things.

<P>
It cannot be the case that the European Union has so arranged itself that a manifest unfairness is the necessary outcome. If that were the case, it would suggest that the United Kingdom Government, at some opportune moment, should promote some change in the arrangements within the European Union to prevent that from occurring. If it occurs for the United Kingdom, presumably it will do so for other countries. Everyone has an interest in a rational outcome. Therefore, I stick by my verdict that this is not a rational proposition. Nothing that the Financial Secretary has said suggests that it is. He suggested that nobody in Whitehall had yet been able to devise a scheme that created a rational outcome and was coherent with what was understood to be the strict ruling of the European Court of Justice.

<P>
This is a classical case because, by trying to be absolutely sure that we do things in a way that is iron-clad vis-à-vis the European Union, we are needlessly sacrificing a national interest. We should think more flexibly and laterally to achieve the required result.

<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I echo some of the remarks made by the hon. Member for West Dorset. The Financial Secretary is known as a clever man, and Customs and Excise is known to have clever people in it. It is not beyond the wit of the Financial Secretary or his officials to devise a scheme to ensure that we comply with EU law and that all the flights arriving at and departing from the Scottish highlands and islands and other remote areas are exempt from APD. If he thinks that amendment No. 31 does not achieve that, I challenge him to find an alternative.

<P>
I think that amendment No. 31 is sufficient-it is in line with the objective criterion set out. The Financial Secretary's sole argument related to the costs of flights from the UK to Iceland. When knocking on doors in Orkney, Shetland, Caithness, Sutherland, Ross, Skye and so on, I am not sure how concerned they will be about the costs that might occur in relation to flights from UK airports to Iceland. All that they will notice is the cost that they still have to pay. In introducing the exemption, the Financial Secretary clearly wanted to score political brownie points, which is fair game in this world. However, he is almost scoring an own goal, as he is not prepared to go the whole hog. I cannot believe the initial estimate that he gave to the Committee of costs of £10 million. I intend to table parliamentary questions to test that estimate, as I cannot believe that the cost would be so high. I cannot agree with his argument.

<P>
The Financial Secretary's argument against amendment No. 32 seemed to be that it would lead to huge avoidance; that up and down the United Kingdom coastline, aircraft operators would suddenly invest in a boat service to islands to which they were otherwise providing air services. Passengers would not therefore pay air passenger duty. If that is not a Customs and Excise argument par excellence, I do not know what is. It is arrant nonsense to suppose that air service operators would, every so often, invest in or hire ships to try to obtain the exemption.

<P>
To be fair to the Financial Secretary, he was not dismissing the case. I welcome that. When he replies, I hope that he will say that the Government will look favourably on the issue as it affects the Isles of Scilly and other island communities. I hope that he and his officials will examine whether an amendment can be drafted to deal with all the avoidance issues dreamed of by Customs and Excise officials, and that such an amendment will be tabled on Report. I agree that the provision does not currently affect the Isles of Scilly, but it puts a cap on the development of lifeline services that are needed by that community. If the Financial Secretary can provide the necessary assurances, we shall not press the amendment to a vote.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> How does the Treasury intend to define the Scottish highlands and islands? That may seem an odd question, but I understand from my hon. Friends that for different Government Departments and Government functions, the Scottish highlands and islands have different borders assigned to them by the Government. Which airports will be encompassed by the Treasury definition? I should be grateful if the Financial Secretary would give the Committee some idea of the definition that the Treasury intends to use and, perhaps, write to me about the matter in detail later, following the end of our proceedings.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> The Financial Secretary mentioned an off-the-cuff figure of £10 million in our earlier discussion. I am especially anxious to know whether flights to non-EU countries such as Iceland and Norway are included in that £10 million estimate. The Financial Secretary may correct me, but I understand that the competition policy involved is EU competition policy, not competition policy for countries outside the EU.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The intention is that the exemption will apply to the region covered by Highlands and Islands Enterprise. The legal anxieties of the EU relate to activity involving the European Economic Area. That is why Iceland and Norway would feature and why we must ensure that the provision is proof from challenge in respect of those countries as well as countries within the EU. The entire EEA would be affected.

<P>
No. 24, in page 16, line 4, leave out ``1,200'' and insert ``1,400''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> One may wonder why anyone should table an amendment to a measure that will reduce the cost of vehicle excise duty for a particular class of motorist. Page 151 of the Red Book states that the measure will cost £120 million per year.

<P>
I have a long-standing and passionate interest in cars. Engines have improved in efficiency over time, owing to technology and rising fuel prices. In the past year, the Government chose to introduce a discount in VED for vehicles with engines up to 1100 cc. As we said in Committee, some more powerful vehicles have a lower carbon dioxide output than some small-engine sub-1100 cc cars whose drivers gained from the discount. The discount scheme was originally supposed to encourage people to run more economical vehicles. I examined the illogicalities that the scheme had introduced at the time, only to be confronted by a further extension of it this year, in a clause that will move the discount break from 1100 cc to 1200 cc.

<P>
I got in touch with Ford, and received a letter from Madlin Sadler, who is manager of the company's Government affairs department. The letter states that the raising of the discount break point
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>will inevitably cause a distortion in new car sales this year-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and this is the crucial sentence-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It remains our view that engine size cannot be used as a true proxy for fuel efficiency.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I struggle to understand why the Government have almost arbitrarily decided that smaller-engined cars alone should get the discount. If they were genuinely interested in encouraging lower overall fuel usage or reductions in emissions, they might have taken a different approach. The Government prefer using sticks to using carrots; they use that approach not only in clause 20 but in subsequent clauses, and it worries me. However, I will not be tempted into discussing the issue, which will become more relevant when we discuss the four-way banded VED system.

<P>
There is an inconsistency in the Government's approach, if concern with carbon dioxide emissions is supposed to lie at the heart of their proposal. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders provided me with a list of the top 35 cars for low CO2 emissions sold in the United Kingdom. Clearly, low CO2 emissions are a proxy for good fuel economy and the good thermo-dynamic characteristics of the engine and other parts of the car. Eighteen of the 35 models listed with a CO2 output per kilometre of 140 g or less receive no help from the discount arrangement that it is proposed arbitrarily to start at 1200 cc. The logic of the Government's action is lost on me.

<P>
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders kindly provided me with a comprehensive list of carbon dioxide emissions for other cars. It is noticeable that the carbon dioxide emissions of Nissan Micra 93s are 152 g of CO2 per kilometre or above. Their engine size is 998 cc and they gain a discount, whereas the Audi A3 diesel car of 1.8 litre capacity with a CO2 output per kilometre of 138 g receives no gain. Let us consider the Rover 100-an 1120 cc car-of which there are a lot still around and which comes within the Government's proposals. Its CO2 output per kilometer is 157 g. I pray in aid the 1124 cc Citroen Saxo, which has a CO2 output of 159 g of carbon dioxide per kilometre. I say to those manufacturers who may think that I have picked selectively on their cars that those were three out of a long list of inconsistencies that caught my eye.

<P>
I question in some detail the objective of the measures. The Government are being unnecessarily harsh on cars that have an extremely good carbon dioxide emissions record by virtue of an arbitrary move from 1100 to 1200 cc. If their objective is to reduce CO2 emissions and make use of the hydrocarbons expended in moving motor vehicles from A to B, other cars should also benefit if the Government truly believe that that discount will encourage the development and sales of more economical cars. My view, for what it is worth, is that more compelling factors affect people's purchase decision than the VED discount. Any discount is better than no discount and one should, in principle, be in favour of it, but I am struggling to see the logic in the Government's argument, which is why I am rightly questioning it.

<P>
The second part of the amendment deals with liquefied petroleum gas. I am indebted to the Calor company, which clearly has an interest in such matters, for sending me information. Last year, when considering the Finance Bill on Report, we debated LPG in the context of the fact that of all of the fuels currently available as a mass item, as opposed to some of the more esoteric fuels, it has several positive attributes. In fairness, I must say that the Government have recognised that in the context of fuel duty.

<P>
However, the Government have not wholeheartedly and enthusiastically embraced LPG. It is a remarkable fuel; it delivers some clean emissions with good performance characteristics. I wish to take this opportunity to publicly congratulate Vauxhall for the way in which it pioneered the use of LPG in the Vauxhall Vectra car championship by illustrating that, even in the fearsome heat of motor racing, an LPG car can give its petrol-driven rivals an extremely good run for their money, which shows that it is a sensible mainstream fuel. Even the Government car service has moved to dual-fuel cars, so full marks to Ministers for favouring the use of LPG.

<P>
Calor's briefing states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The point is that cars and vans propelled by LPG are not only cleaner on emissions of carbon dioxide, they are significantly cleaner on emissions on benzene, 1,3 butadiene, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, particulates and sulphur dioxide-all major targets of the Air Quality Strategy, for sound reasons of public health and avoiding damage to buildings, crops and the environment.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I refer members of the Committee to my remarks on the Report stage of last year's Finance Bill about the health gains from the use of LPG.

<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
In terms of inner-city air quality, it strikes me as laudable to encourage and make it easier for people to use a fuel that clearly has good emission characteristics but that also, if used on a wider basis, could significantly contribute to cleaning up air in our big cities. Despite benevolent remarks from various sources, LPG cars do not receive any gains under the VED discount scheme. On grounds of consistency, I ask whether the Government are serious about using some of the £120 million to improve efficiency and air quality. If they are, why have they not included LPG cars?

<P>
When one looks back at the first move from leaded to unleaded petrol, it is interesting to see that the fiscal encouragement led to a significant change against the background of provable medical risk. No one objected to the public purse being used to accelerate the uptake of that better quality fuel. LPG seems to exhibit some similar characteristics, yet it receives limited help.

<P>
I shall be interested to hear a logical explanation from the Financial Secretary as to why 1200 cc has been arbitrarily selected and why LPG has not been included in the benefit. If we had a more logical system, it would be better for all, especially those who live in cities and have to breathe the output of the vehicles that I have mentioned.

<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I agree with the comments of the right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack). The Liberal Democrats will support his amendment, which is in many ways a more precisely targeted amendment than our own. He is right to spend some time drawing out its environmental benefits, especially those related to LPG. The Government should encourage as much take-up of them as possible.

<P>
The right hon. Gentleman's amendment and ours bring up another point. In the Committee that considered last year's Finance Bill, we debated the Government's proposal to introduce the reduced rate for vehicles of 1100 cc. Opposition Members explained how absurd that was and how many models would be excluded from that benefit, so it is welcome that the Government have listened to our forceful arguments and have agreed to increase the banding to 1200 cc. Many cars will now benefit from that. We wish that the Government had accepted our ideas last year, so that people could have enjoyed the environmental, fuel efficiency and cost benefits this year.

<P>
The Liberal Democrats have returned to our policy of supporting an increase in the banding to 1400 cc, not only due to the environmental benefits that it could bring. As the right hon. Member for Fylde mentioned, if we focused simply on the environment, we might design the scheme in a different way, as his amendment tries to do.

<P>
The issue of the costs faced by motorists is important. The Liberal Democrats have made great argument about the need to ensure that environmental taxes are popular and not seen as merely tax-raising measures. If not, one does the environmental argument a great disservice. The public then always associate protecting the environment with being hit in the purse and increasingly withdraw their support for the environmental cause. That is why we have always argued that if one ratchets up the costs on what is an environmentally harmful pollutant, one needs to ensure that the public see an off-setting benefit. We have therefore always linked any increase in petrol duty with a reduction in VED. That is what lies behind our amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Leslie </B>(Shipley): My understanding was that the hon. Gentleman opposed increases in fuel duty. How would he pay for the measure, given that the costed document from the Liberal Democrats, which no one has ever seen, has yet to be produced and seems mythical?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Would the hon. Gentleman please speak up? I cannot hear a word he is saying.

<P>
<B>Mr. Leslie:</B> I am happy to repeat my request that the hon. Gentleman tell us where the money to pay for the proposal would come from.

<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> One could have anticipated that question from the hon. Gentleman; he seems to have only one intervention. However, I will answer it. I am surprised that he has not yet taken me up on the offer of receiving copies of the Liberal Democrats' alternative Budget, which are available, published and given to the press. As I have said to him before, Conservative central office sends an individual to our press conferences when we launch such documents and analyses them; I would have thought that Millbank tower is also not beyond that.

<P>
However, I am straying from the hon. Gentleman's point. We said clearly when we opposed the increases in petrol duty that we did so because they have not been linked to a reduction in VED. We therefore advocate such a reduction, which would enable us to vote for the increase in petrol excise duty. As we have said for years, it is very important that the two are linked. We are trying to have a proper linkage in the Bill. If the hon. Gentleman refers to the figures, he will find that the Government's proposal to raise the 1100 cc limit to 1200 cc cost the Exchequer £85 million in 1999-2000. He will also find that the Red Book shows that, on a non-index basis, the revalorisation of hydrocarbon oil duty-petrol excise duty-yields the Exchequer £750 million. An examination of the figures therefore shows how the Government are again this year taking more from motorists. Our proposal, according to Government figures, would cost £410 million: less than the revalorisation. If the two duties were linked, at least ordinary motorists could see that the Government's policy on the environment does not always penalise them.

<P>
I am making a key political point. We share the Government's objective of tackling the environmental problems that the country and the world face. However, we cannot believe that we do that political objective justice by saying that it is a one-way street and that people are always going to have to pay. We can make environmental policies attractive and that is what the amendment seeks to do.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Colman </B>(Putney): I welcome the increase in the limit from 1100 cc to 1200 cc. I have had many complaints from constituents who pointed out that while the log book stated that their car was 1100 cc, they discovered that it was actually 1111 cc or 1120 cc, and felt extremely aggrieved. I contacted the chairman of Ford UK, who, I regret to say, confirmed that the engines exceeded 1100 cc. I am pleased that the change proposed in the Bill will deal with so many of the complainants in my constituency. We are dealing with smaller cars. Labour Members often talk about supporting pensioners, and it is, in particular, pensioners who have traded down to a smaller car who will benefit enormously from the change.

<P>
I declare an interest as the owner of a dual fuel car that runs on petrol and compressed natural gas, which-I am not sure why-the right hon. Member for Fylde has missed out. Two forms of natural gas are used-liquefied petroleum gas and compressed natural gas. Both have the advantage of being a cleaner fuel for the environment. Both are fossil fuels, which the right hon. Member for Fylde may have overlooked. They also result in lower fuel efficiency than is obtained from running a car on petrol. However, the advantage to the motorist is the much lower level of duty that applies to both CNG and LPG, which is about half the cost and therefore significant. I am sure that all my constituents thank the Treasury for the attitude that it takes in ensuring that that fiscal advantage is available to them. Despite the resulting fuel efficiency not being so high, a considerable net gain is achieved.

<P>
The Government help the ordinary motorist convert to LPG or CNG through the powershift programme, which pays for up to two thirds of the cost of converting an existing car or two thirds of the additional cost of buying a new car that runs on either form of natural gas. That is a strong statement from the Government in support of that alternative fuel.

<P>
Neither the right hon. Member for Fylde nor the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton mentioned the two reasons why such cars are dual fuel. First, in order to start the car, it must be in petrol mode. The car must be dual fuel, because a tank of petrol is necessary as well as a tank of gas. In order to take advantage of a possible reduction in vehicle excise duty, people might, therefore, run their cars solely on petrol but carry around an empty gas tank. It is important to recognise that it is not currently possible to have an engine that runs solely on natural gas: both are necessary.

<P>
The second point is a practical one. At the moment, the number of CNG and LPG stations is extremely limited. Lining up behind the dust carts in Merton, I am the only private user who takes advantage. My car was manufactured by the Volvo Corporation, and Europe contains many more CNG stations than this country. The London area contains about eight stations, two of which are within a mile of where I am now standing.

<P>
The action that the Government have already taken to support CNG and LPG is the correct way forward. The Committee should not support the proposal in the amendment to tilt the playing field further in favour of natural gas.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I rise to register that the Opposition support my right hon. Friend's amendment and take the view that more needs to be done for LPG cars. We look forward to the Damascene conversion of the Financial Secretary.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The 1999 Budget was widely hailed as the greenest Budget ever seen in this country. The environmental impact of each Budget is an increasingly important consideration. In the past few days there has been a raft of calls from organisations ranging from the Royal Commission on Environmental Protection to Christian Aid for further action to tackle the problem of climate change. Undoubtedly, the number of calls will increase as the impact of climate change is felt increasingly throughout the world. The Red Book has a chapter on protecting the environment, which reflects the importance of such matters and the Bill enacts several of the key measures that were announced last year. A large proportion of it deals with environmental tax reform, which has not happened under any previous Finance Bill. That reflects the importance that the Government attach to tackling the environmental challenges. We are getting to grips with those challenges and, naturally, it has taken a Labour Government to do that. We argued for such action when we were in opposition and, now that we are in government, we are delivering it.

<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>

<P>
The debate gives me the opportunity to say how excellent the clause is for the environment and the motorist. As the right hon. Member for Fylde said, amendment No. 37 can be split into two parts. It encourages fuel efficient vehicles with low carbon dioxide emissions and gas-powered cars. We heartily agree with both those worthy aims, which is why the Budget included such a wide package of reforms that will encourage fuel-efficient cars and the use of less-polluting fuel. My hon. Friend the Member for Putney is right that the extension of the reduced rate for existing cars to 1200 cc is a popular move.

<P>
We will come later in our proceedings to the graduated vehicle excise duty system for new cars and the reforms to company car tax, both of which are based on CO2 emissions and have added incentives for cars that run on cleaner fuels. They are much in line with what the right hon. Member for Fylde was calling for. The penny-a-litre duty differential for ultra low-sulphur petrol-the new move in the Budget-the freeze on duty on road fuel gases, further increasing the differential between gas and conventional fuels after the 29 per cent. cut that we made in the Budget last year and an allocation of an additional £9 million to help fund the energy saving trust powershift programme will make it easier for people to switch to road fuel gas.

<P>
I cannot accept the amendment. The right hon. Gentleman proposed that we should establish an average carbon dioxide emission figure for all 4 million cars with engines up to 1200 cc. He said that we should then extend the reduced rate to all the other cars on the road below that average. That proposal is completely unworkable. I shall defend for a moment the use of engine size, because there is a correlation between that and emissions. Nine out of the 10 most fuel efficient petrol models on the new car market are below the current reduced rate threshold of 1100 cc, but engine size is not the perfect measure, which is why we are introducing the graduated vehicle excise duty system for new cars from March of next year. That will be based on carbon dioxide emissions as soon as the necessary information is available to the licensing authorities.

<P>
At present, however, we do not know the carbon dioxide emissions from every car. The only way in which the right hon. Gentleman's suggestion could work would be to require the owners of all 22 million cars in the country to submit their vehicles for carbon dioxide emissions testing. That would cost about £100 a time and I should be surprised if right hon. Gentleman would receive the support of his right hon. and hon. Friends for imposing such a significant new burden that could cost £2.5 billion.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Is the Financial Secretary aware that, as I understand it, emissions testing already forms a part of the MOT test?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> We are requiring that, in the future, carbon dioxide emissions of new vehicles must be recorded on the vehicle licensing document, which will allow the introduction of a graduated vehicle excise duty system next year. Currently, that information is not recorded on the licensing document and is not available to the DVLA. No information is therefore currently available to make such a judgment. As I said, we are working to ensure that carbon dioxide emissions data for new cars are included on the licensing authority's database. If the figures that were quoted are right, the Audi A3 will certainly benefit from the new regime that will be introduced next year.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I want to proceed slowly in asking my question, in the hope that the Financial Secretary will find it easier to answer. In relation to his direct answer to the question asked by my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde, is it the case that MOT tests currently record emissions levels?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> No, it is not. The MOT test measures carbon monoxide levels. Until such information is available, engine size will remain the best proxy. It is not perfect, but it is the best indicator of fuel efficiency that we have. I reassure the Committee that the Government do not intend to impose a charge of £100 a time on every car in the land.

<P>
The amendment tabled by the right hon. Member for Fylde proposes that all cars running on gas should qualify for a reduced rate. I am told that it would apply to cars powered solely by gas, which accounts for fewer than 1,000 vehicles currently on the road. Contrary to the hope that might have been raised in the mind of my hon. Friend the Member for Putney, the amendment would not apply to the 10,000 or more environmentally friendly bi-fuel vehicles. If the objective of the amendment is to encourage the use of road fuel gas, the Government agree with that-we froze the duty on road fuel gas, having reduced it dramatically last year.

<P>
The primary purpose of vehicle excise duty reforms introduced in the past two Budgets was to encourage lower carbon dioxide emissions. That is why we propose to graduate vehicle excise duty by engine size for existing cars and carbon dioxide emissions for new cars. Fuel-efficient cars will benefit from those reforms whatever fuel they run on. It would be an anomaly if, by applying a reduced rate to all gas-powered cars, we removed the incentive for individuals to move to cars with lower carbon dioxide emissions. Road fuel gas is not preferable to petrol in terms of carbon dioxide emissions although, in other respects, especially in relation to local air quality, it has significant benefits.

<P>
The new graduated and company car systems offer greater incentives for cars running on alternative fuels the more fuel-efficient they are, and an incentive for gas power and alternative fuels is being built in. That is the best way of achieving environmental objectives coherently. The amendment would muddle what we are trying to achieve.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 23 and 25 would extend the reduced rate threshold for cars with smaller engines up to 1400 cc. The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton paid a compliment to the amendment tabled by the right hon. Member for Fylde, by saying that it was better environmentally targeted than his own. I certainly agree with him about that-his amendment is not well targeted, environmentally or otherwise. It would apply to almost half the cars on the road and cost about £290 million more than the extension of the threshold to 1200 cc.

<P>
I enjoyed the exchange with my hon. Friend the member for Shipley (Mr. Leslie). The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton clearly found that difficult to deal with, but I think that he said that the Liberal Democrats proposed an increase in fuel duty to pay for their proposal. I am sure that people throughout the country will be interested to know that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bill Rammell </B>(Harlow): Like my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary, I was interested in that exchange. Perhaps uniquely among the members of the Committee, I have had the opportunity to read the Liberal Democrats' alternative Budget. I understand that they would propose to increase fuel duty by 5p a litre. That figure is substantially higher that our proposed increase, and the public should know that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I warmly congratulate my hon. Friend on finding a copy of the mysterious document, which it soulds as though we should all read with care and interest. If it proposes a 5p a litre increase in fuel duty, that will astonish many who have hitherto supported the Liberal Democrats.

<P>
We have extended the reduced rate to 1200 cc to include several popular models of car, which strengthens the environmental signal encouraging people to choose smaller, cleaner cars. By contrast, the amendment would extend the reduced rate to almost half of the cars on the road, which would weaken motorists' incentive to move to smaller and more environmentally friendly models.

<P>
As an example, extending the threshold to 1200 cc means a £55 VED cut for the fuel-efficient 1.2 litre Renault Clio, which has carbon dioxide emissions of 146 g per kilometre. By extending the threshold to
1400 cc, the clause would reduce the rate for the less fuel-efficient 1.4 litre Renault Clio, which has emissions of 160 g per kilometre. We would lose the incentive for people to choose cleaner cars.

<P>
The amendment would also create many anomalies when the graduated VED system came into effect next March. People who bought a new 1.4 litre 16-valve Vauxhall Corsa with carbon emissions of 193 g per kilometre would pay £105 if they registered their new car on 28 February but £155 if they did so on 1 March. The amendment would allow several of the least fuel-efficient new cars to qualify for the lowest vehicle excise duty rates. That would defeat the changes that we are introducing, whose intentions we all welcome.

<P>
The clause extends the reduced VED rate for smaller-engined cars to 1200 cc, which means that an extra 2.2 million cars and a total of 4 million will qualify for the reduced rate. That measure will cut the annual tax cost of car ownership by £120 million this year, in addition to the £110 million cost of freezing VED rates until 1 March and the £85 million annual cost of the existing 1100 cc reduced rate. The measures introduced in the past two Budgets have cut £400 million off motorists' VED bills.

<P>
As a result of the clause, we can send an even stronger signal to motorists to encourage them to use smaller, cleaner vehicles by bringing some of the most popular smaller-engined vehicles within the scope of the reduced rate, including several hundred thousand Ford Fiestas and Vauxhall Corsas. The measure will help the environment and reduce the cost of car ownership for millions of people. I urge the Committee to oppose the amendments and support the clause.

<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am most grateful to the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton for his welcome to my amendment, and to the hon. Member for Putney for what I thought was a helpful and well informed contribution to our debate. It was delightfully tempered by comments that tiptoed up towards supporting my proposal, but put the brakes on just before the hon. Member for Putney crossed the magic line that said, ``Thou shalt not, if on the Government Benches, offend the position of the Government''.

<P>
For the limited number of vehicles involved, whether they run on liquefied or compressed natural gas, I would have thought that, given the Financial Secretary's obvious enthusiasm and support for that fuel source, he might have been willing to support the proposed discount, to enable a twin-stream approach of encouraging the development of more environmentally friendly vehicles. I shall have to hope that he would have supported it silently, but, in terms of the record, those words will unfortunately remain unuttered.

<P>
The Financial Secretary's remarks about my amendment can be summed up as ``Technical knock-out, but generally supportive''. I am grateful to him because, inevitably, practical and financial considerations must be properly considered when discussing amendments. I tabled the amendment to find out whether there was logic behind the Government's approach. Perhaps I should have drawn the Committee's attention to page 117 of the Red Book and christened the amendment the Arthur Daley amendment because, in the commentary on the proposal, the Government state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This will provide an incentive for motorists to make their next second-hand car purchase a smaller, more environmentally friendly model.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is the Del Boy approach to car purchase. The only problem with that interesting commentary on the secondhand car business is that it will not achieve the result in terms of those arbitrary 1100 cc or 1200 cc cut-offs. We have illustrated that there are so-called small-engined cars with a carbon dioxide performance worse than that of certain large-engined cars. I understand the Financial Secretary's point that, in official terms, only new cars will have the carbon dioxide output recorded in their logbook. I understand and accept that. Neither the Financial Secretary nor I could quote specific carbon dioxide figures, so why cannot we have an early introduction of a discount for those cars that clearly have good environmental characteristics in terms of their low carbon dioxide output? I accept his point that there may be practical and financial reasons why my stated words would not work. In terms of being able to pick a low carbon dioxide output figure, he could have introduced a discount now for the new cars whose CO2 output is known. It is disappointing that he did not do so, given his warm welcome for liquefied petroleum gas, dual fuel vehicles and their attributes. In its briefing, Calor commented:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This should help the market for road fuel gases to some degree. LPG engines produce 15-20 per cent. less CO2 than petrol engines, and 10-15 per cent. less CO2 than diesel engines.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
They are matters of debate and I do not propose to go into detail now. Calor and LPG fuel providers argue that there are also attributes in their fuel, and the cars to which they are applied, that also play to the Government's tune.

<P>
I understand the Financial Secretary's argument that smaller cars in general may be more fuel efficient, or use less fuel than others, and therefore help as regards CO2 output. However, the Government have ruled out some extremely environmentally friendly cars, whether they be diesel or liquefied petroleum gas, and it is a disappointment that they have not helped the situation. We may discuss other matters connected with that under subsequent clauses. I do not intend to press the amendment to a Division.

<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> It was a rare privilege to hear from the Financial Secretary a genuine practical reason why the amendments would not work. We accept the point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde that led to his decision not to press the amendment. However, I hope that the Financial Secretary will take away from the debate the fact that many Members from all parties agree on one matter-or so I sense although, as my right hon. Friend said, some only tiptoed towards agreement. We consider that there should be some further boost for zero emission, solar-powered, LPG and hybrid vehicles beyond the aid given in fuel duty legislation. I am sure that we shall want to return to that point.

<P>
<B>Mr. Leslie:</B> I am very confused now. Some moments ago, the hon. Gentleman committed Conservative Front Benchers to supporting the amendment. It says something about the imprudent approach of those on the Conservative Front Bench that within the space of 10 minutes they allocate themselves a revenue cost of more than £2 billion-or perhaps they would have handed it on as a burden to the motorist-and then flip flop and make a U-turn on the matter.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that immensely mature contribution to the debate. We are fallible human beings and we made an error, which the Financial Secretary pointed out, so we agreed to change our view. That is a sensible way for politics to go on. It would help if the Government occasionally admitted an error. However, I propose that occasionally the Opposition will do so.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I took my hon. Friend's comments as support for the principles that I was advancing, ahead of the conclusion of the debate-no more, no less.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My right hon. Friend is too kind, and we continue to support the principles. However, I go so far as to admit that we made an error in not spotting a practical point, and we have changed our mind. I hope that the hon. Member for Shipley may feel-if he ever comes to sit on the Front Bench-that it is possible to change one's mind in the face of the facts, and useful to do so.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

Question proposed,  That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following: Amendment No. 33, in Schedule 3, page 124, line 28, leave out ``applies to a'' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`shall come into force on 1st March 2008 and shall apply to any'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Schedule 3 stand part.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I would like to draw the Committee's attention to what I think is a deficiency in schedule 3, although the Financial Secretary may be able to state some practical point that highlights the advantages of his scheme. It seems that the Government have a practical problem-and I have a rational basis for that belief.

<P>
Carbon dioxide is not the only noxious substance with which we must deal; there is common ground on that between the Opposition and the Government and, probably, our friends the Liberal Democrats. Their spokesman is currently absent, but I expect that he would agree. CO2 is important, but it is not unique as a substance to be avoided. My right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde made the point powerfully that engine size is not the only source of CO2 emissions that we are concerned with. I think that it is clear-subject to correction by the Financial Secretary-that older cars are worse than newer cars in respect of emissions.

<P>
Why has schedule 3 not been designed in a way that distinguishes between the pre-Euro I cars-generally pre-1993-and later cars? Why is no reference made to the Euro IV standard, which is likely to be introduced in 2004? Why are we dealing with graduated rates of duty on CO2 rather than standardised rates based on different levels of overall emission? There may be a good, solid, practical reason for that. I do not think that our aims and objectives differ, but it seems likely that graduated rates based on different emission standards of different ages of car would produce a better result than the graduation suggested under schedule 3. At the very least, it would help if the Minister explained why such graduations have been chosen.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I tabled amendment No. 33 to examine in more detail the Government's four-way VED proposal. I am interested in the timing of the proposal's introduction. As the Financial Secretary knows, the European motor vehicle industry, which also includes far east manufacturers, has agreed a voluntary scale of reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, which by 2008 will contribute a net saving of 3.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. If I correctly understood a recent parliamentary answer by the Financial Secretary, the objective of the Government's proposal is to achieve a similar figure over a slightly longer period. A considerable cost of £80 million will be involved in the new VED system in the financial year 2001-02, which will rise to £140 million in the following year.

<P>
I want to know why the taxpayer may face the possible imposition of a dead weight cost. If the majority of cars sold in the United Kingdom are moving towards a carbon dioxide emission regime that parallels what the Government are seeking to do with their complex graduated VED scheme, I am not sure why we are being asked to sanction the expenditure of such money when we shall achieve that objective on autopilot. I have no difficulty with that objective, but the industry will realise the objective itself. If, in some way, the Government's proposals will speed up that process, I should be interested to know how that will be done. To technically achieve the CO2 outputs that are required, the Government will be dependent on the world's motor manufacturers to produce cars that can deliver the goods. Clearly, they have reflected that in the European agreement by virtue of their proposal.

<P>
There are practical problems and the Financial Secretary showed himself to be a keen observer of such matters when he replied to my previous amendment. I shall quote again from the letter of Madlin Sadler, the manager of government affairs at the Ford motor company, in which she points out that the company has severe reservations about a system that relates CO2 directly to VED. Ford would like it to be directly related to the price of cars, because that would be ``more transparent and effective''. Like the Financial Secretary, she points out:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Direct calculations based on specific CO2 output could be easily made as CO2 outputs are already set to be on registration documents.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Ford also supports the line of argument that I advanced about the European agreement, and points out that substantial progress has already been made towards that objective as a result of car manufacturers' proposals.

<P>
My amendment would postpone the introduction of the Government's proposals. Ford is extremely worried about the Government's attitude to the diesel engine, which they have made the villain of the piece, having given a lower discount for diesel-engine cars. According to Ford:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Despite the imposition of significantly more stringent test cycles particulate emissions in diesel are due to be reduced by 75 per cent. from Stage 2 (1996) to Stage 4 (2005). Consequently both diesel and gasoline vehicles will meet extremely high standards in terms of tailpipe emissions. All these emissions standards have been developed considering air quality and health effects and are based on WHO standards. Added to this fuels with sulphur content of sub 10ppm both reduce particulate emissions and will enable introduction of low CO2 emissions technology. Ultra low sulphur diesel will also allow the introduction of advanced technologies to further reduce emissions such as particulate traps and filters.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
All of that is in train now, and does not require such a highly complex system of VED discounts and penalties for diesel to be introduced. Why, therefore, need we introduce complexities in the proposed time scale?

<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I recognise that a problem may be encountered. The industry may not deliver. That is why the amendment would not remove the proposal. I wanted to leave an escape clause so that, in the event of problems, the Government could introduce their particular scheme if they so wished. However, given what the industry is doing, and that it is sometimes better that people are passionately committed to reducing outputs and improving the effectiveness of diesel cars without the need for such complexity, why do the Government perceive the need to spend so much taxpayers' money when they will receive the CO2 dividend almost on autopilot?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am puzzled by the right hon. Gentleman's amendment, because he is one of the Opposition Members who pressed most forcefully for linking VED rates for cars to CO2 emissions. Just a few moments ago he argued, apparently with some conviction, in favour of another amendment, pointing out that engine size is not a perfect proxy and that CO2 emissions should be used to determine the level of VED payable. We have now reached the clause under which the Government are introducing a VED system for new cars that is graduated by their CO2 emissions, and he now wants us to delay its introduction until 2008. At the very least he is arguing a case that is different from and contradictory to the one that he argued a few moments ago.

<P>
Under the amendment, the 2 million new cars bought every year in the United Kingdom would be taxed under the old system based on engine size, and millions of motorists and businesses would be denied the opportunity to enjoy lower rates under the new system. The new system will create real incentives for motorists to buy newer, cleaner, more fuel-efficient cars, and I am unclear why the right hon. Gentleman wants its introduction to be delayed by seven years.

<P>
Friends of the Earth said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Variable road tax is one of the most useful instruments for controlling climate change. It's not only about imposing a penalty on the worst polluters. It's also about rewarding the virtuous car driver or manufacturer.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The industry is currently doing a lot in that regard, and the new system will support the efforts of manufacturers to reduce average CO2 emissions by providing an extra signal that those who choose to buy a new car with lower carbon dioxide emissions will pay a lower rate of vehicle excise duty. Our proposal is consistent with and complementary to the changes being introduced by the industry.

<P>
We have designed the new system and drafted the clause in a flexible way, which gives us scope to alter vehicle excise duty treatment, especially of diesel cars-in relation to what the right hon. Gentleman said about Ford's comments-as their emissions standards improve. We are looking forward to substantial improvements in emissions from diesel engines, as technology improves. In terms of local air quality, diesel engines are currently significantly more polluting than petrol engines. That is the reason for the premium rate for diesel engines in the table in schedule 3. Paragraph 1E(b) allows the Secretary of State to prescribe in regulations those diesel vehicles that may be exempted from the premium rate. If and when those improvements are delivered, and the relatively greater local air quality damage has ceased, we would not continue to apply a premium rate.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Jack:</B> When will the first review of diesel-improved emission outputs be made, and when will such regulations be tabled?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> That depends on how quickly engine improvements can be delivered. The matter will be reviewed each year, in the course of debates such as this. It is too early to say how quickly those improvements will be delivered, but changes will be made as quickly as they are needed.

<P>
It is worth pointing out that the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders stated that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The suggestion that improvements in emissions performance will be recognised<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is ``welcome''. So the industry recognises what we are doing in that respect. Manufacturers would be hugely disappointed if all the hard work that they had engaged in with us to build a new graduated system, which reflects changes in the industry and improvements in technology, were scrapped, as the amendment proposes to do. The British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association, as well as the SMMT, has welcomed the way in which rates set under the new system will encourage the purchase of new cars. The amendment would remove that incentive. All manufacturers have welcomed the improvement that the new system will make to the information supplied to them about vehicle market trends, which they would be denied by the amendment.

<P>
If the amendment were accepted, the real losers would be ordinary motorists and the environment. People will be denied the benefits of the new graduated system, which creates incentives for new cars, more fuel-efficient cars and cars that use less polluting fuels, and sends out a strong environmental signal to motorists and manufacturers. The AA was enthusiastic about the Budget, which it described as the first for many years that motorists could welcome. The AA said about the new system:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We're actually seeing a choice now for motorists. The real good news is real incentives that drivers will understand-to move to cars that produce less emissions and use less fuel.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
If I understood the hon. Member for West Dorset correctly, he was asking for greater complexity in the table. Inevitably, a balance must be struck between simplicity and straightforwardness, which we all want, and the attraction of including some other parameters.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I do not understand why the Financial Secretary believes that it would be more complex to grade vehicles according to their date of production and, hence, their conformity or otherwise with the ascending standards from 1993-96 or 1997-2000 than to grade them as set out under the schedule.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The fact that a car is Euro IV compliant does not necessary mean that it will emit less carbon dioxide than a car that is Euro III compliant. Our key objective is to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I accept that the Government are focusing on CO2. Why do they think that that is the only matter that we should be worrying about?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> We are not saying that, which is why we want the premium rate to reflect the greater local air pollution from diesel engines and a reduced rate for new fuels. The hon. Gentleman referred earlier to solar-powered vehicles. Our primary objective is to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, which is the key way to tackle the problem of climate change. That should be at the centre of the new system. The public want carbon dioxide emissions reduced. They want global warming dealt with, and the new system will help us to achieve that. I hope that the Committee will reject the amendment and, with enthusiasm, support the clause.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> The reason for tabling the amendment was to enable me to voice some reservations that have been put to me by the Ford Motor Company. I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for his clarification about the checks that will be made in due course on the diesel car and for saying that an annual assessment will be made. In its letter, Ford stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Fiscal measures that penalise diesel vehicles will seriously impact the ability of the industry to meet its ACEA agreement of a fleet average of 140g CO2/km by 2008. It also denies the substantial progress that has been made in terms of regulated emissions over comparable vehicles of just a few years ago.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Central to the hon. Gentleman's objective and one that we share, which is reduced CO2 emissions, is the fact that diesel vehicles should not be penalised unfairly. I am concerned whether the expenditure will deliver. Let us suppose that a person buys a 1200 cc Arthur Daley second-hand car. If he keeps it for more than five years, he will save £275. However, someone who was tempted to choose between a reduced rate and a standard rate model under the clause would, over five years, save only £50.

<P>
The actual effect on the purchase decision is questionable, which is why I drew to the Committee's attention Ford's observation that it wanted the arrangements to be more transparent and related to the price of the vehicle. It was not within my powers to devise an amendment that would have added a carrot-a reduction-to the price of the more environmentally friendly cars. I still have reservations about a discount scheme, however much input the motor industry may have had in such a suggestion. My more private conversations lead me to question some of the exchanges behind it, but it would be wrong to break confidences and disclose such views to the Committee. We share the objective of reducing CO2 emissions, but I do not believe that the Government have chosen the right means of doing so. My amendment would allow some breathing space to see what would happen because cars would have improved as a result of voluntary agreements.

I suspect that, as with the landfill tax last year, the Government might be using some environmental taxes as Trojan horses. Having established them on benign grounds, it would be quite easy to adjust the numbers, within the matrix in the schedule-which is the subject of the amendment-to make it not a costly but a tax-earning exercise. My sceptical view is that if the Government are re-elected-I do not think they will be-they might pursue the route of making that a nice little earner. I do not wish motorists to be denied some salvation in terms of what they have to pay in tax-it is bad enough as it is under the Government.

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 19, in page 17, leave out lines 22 to 41.

<P>
I am sorry to interfere with the Government Whip's enthusiastic process through the Bill but I must, alas, alert him to the fact that we now enter terrain that is considerably trickier. I do not want to detain the Committee unduly because we all want to move on to the climate change levy, but the issue is important and I do not want to let the enforcement of duties provisions go through on the nod.

<P>
I tabled the amendment, and amendment No. 20, partly because they raise significant points of substance and partly because they provide a vehicle for commentary on the clause. I incurred the wrath-as always, it was tempered wrath-of the Financial Secretary when I said that the Government had followed the logic of increasing duty differentials to the point of creating a huge incentive for otherwise law-abiding citizens to engage in a bit of something on the side, thereby turning themselves into criminals, and for Customs and Excise to become a body that searches out and clobbers people who have unfortunately engaged in such improper and illegal acts.

<P>
The Opposition agree-the Financial Secretary will no doubt lugubriously enjoin us to do so-that people should not be allowed to commit criminal acts and that the agencies of the law should try to prevent them. Our law enforcement agencies are properly circumscribed in their modes of action. The Financial Secretary's colleagues in the Home Office pay considerable attention to ensuring that our police, the country's primary law enforcement agency, are heavily circumscribed. There is a long tradition dating back through regimes of all colours, enshrined partly in statute law and partly in common law, which circumscribes the police's activities.

<P>
For reasons connected to the previous time that such ludicrous duty differentials opened up, when the trade was largely in smuggled brandy and the like, Customs and Excise has a wide discretion. It has tried to use that reasonably. Those who work for Customs and Excise try to do their job decently, like the rest of us. The provisions fail to insist on proprieties that are normal in the rest of our law enforcement practices. We cannot see why that should be so.

<P>
Amendment No. 19 is a modest little amendment that would omit lines 22 onwards of page 17 and leaves us to fall back on lines 1 to 28 of page 18. The difference between the lines that would be omitted and those on which we would then have to rely is the difference between the writ of assistance and the search warrant. When the police want to enter and apprehend someone, they need a warrant, but Customs and Excise has something handed to it rather in the manner of the civil list at the start of a reign. As I understand the matter, the writ of assistance provides it with all sorts of permissions that the police do not have because they are not given such a writ at the start of each reign. Amendment No. 19 would simply insist that Customs and Excise should be limited by the same restrictions as already apply to the police.

<P>
The explanatory notes on the clause are helpfully lucid, as on many other occasions. They argue that the need for Customs and Excise to have the writ of assistance, and hence the ability to engage in immediate action without a search warrant, has been intensified by recent practices.

<B>Kali Mountford </B>(Colne Valley): The hon. Gentleman says that his proposal is modest, but I find it astonishing. Is he not undoing powers that have been available for centuries? That is surely not modest.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I apologise to the hon. Lady and to the Hansard Committee reporter. I should have put up my little sign saying ``irony'' when I described the proposals as modest. They are of course fundamental. I will alert the hon. Lady in future to the moment at which I descend into irony, as it is clearly not a commodity that she finds readily accessible.

<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> I appreciate the irony of the hon. Gentleman's statement; he clearly does not appreciate the irony of mine. The proposals are not modest, so will he explain why he wants to make such a fundamental change to powers that have been available for centuries to deal with criminal activity?

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I have been trying to explain that and shall continue to do so. It is reasonable that the many terrible crimes with which the police have to deal are governed by the need for them to have search warrants. The hon. Lady may be suggesting that they should be abolished and the police should be allowed to move in on any premises by general writ of assistance at the beginning of each reign, but her colleagues at the Home Office are not. They are right and she is wrong. Why should it remain necessary for such a measure to be available to Customs and Excise when it is not available to the police? However, if the Paymaster General can genuinely point to compelling grounds on which the provision should be retained, I will accept that there is a clear case for that. The explanatory notes state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Government is opposed to total withdrawal of the writ as it could seriously impair Customs effectiveness in tackling smuggling, particularly of excise goods.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
It continues
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The need for the continued use of the writ in urgent circumstances-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
such defensive language suggests that whoever wrote the notes on clauses recognises something rather odd about the writ of assistance-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>is now greater than ever owing to the recent growth in tobacco smuggling.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
That is true. Indeed, there has been a recent growth in tobacco smuggling and there are two ways in which that logic can be pursued. One is to reduce the duty differential, so that the incentive for the growth in tobacco smuggling reduces. When the Paymaster General replies, she will draw our attention yet again to what is largely a canard-the imports of illegal tobacco smuggled from non-duty areas. I say ``largely a canard'', because they come through the European Union to us and are dragged here by the duty differential. However, the duty differential is having a huge impact, not just on the mafiosi but on otherwise law-abiding citizens. The wrong response to that is to provide wide-ranging powers that would not be granted to the police. The right response is to reduce the effect.

<P>
<B>Ms Rosie Winterton </B>(Doncaster, Central): I am a little confused by the hon. Gentleman's argument. Does he believe that the measure will give Customs officers power to tackle the smuggling of drugs, for example, and that taking it away will impede the power to search at short notice, which is often needed because intelligence has been received about goods coming from across the channel? Would not that also have an effect on tackling the drugs problem?

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The hon. Lady may well be right. I suppose that the same argument can be used in relation to the police, who are also involved in apprehending people engaged in illicit trade in drugs.

<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Clapham </B>(Barnsley, West and Penistone): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I will do so in a moment. I want first to answer the hon. Lady. It could be argued, although it is not being so argued by her colleagues in the Home Office, that the police should be endowed with such a right. They have to get a search warrant. When one is balancing civil liberties against effective law enforcement, there is an issue of balance. There is no obvious black and white answer. However, is it appropriate to leave the Customs and Excise with such power, about which the Government themselves are embarrassed, as is evident from the explanatory notes, rather than trying to address the causes of the crime.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clapham:</B> There is clearly a difference. We are talking about goods that are in transition when there needs to be a speedy response. I shall cite an example from my constituency about where and how the police operate. On estates with drug problems, when information regarding certain houses is passed on to the police they have to obtain a search warrant before they can search the house. By the time that they have done that, the drugs have gone on to other addresses. Police have been involved in raiding addresses and I have known well before they have obtained their search warrant that the substance has been moved. There are two distinct situations, one of which is when drugs are smuggled into the country and they are in transition. Customs needs to have the ability to move speedily and the writ is necessary.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's rational point, but how does it lead to a clear distinction between police and Customs and Excise? I am sure that there are differences and I am sure that they are variegated, but he has not advanced an overall compelling argument that one law enforcement agency should have draconian powers that are not available to the other.
