                           </span> It was indeed, Mr
Bayley. It is a pleasure to reconvene under your chairmanship this
afternoon, this evening and for most of the night. I was asking the
hon. Member for Worsley and Eccles South whether she thought that there
was a trade-off between higher thresholds for triggering a referendum
and the obligation on the local authority to call one. Therefore, if
the threshold was set at 10%, as amendment 81 suggests, would she feel
that local authorities are obliged to have a referendum at that
level?<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000040">&#160;</a>

                           </span> I welcome you, Mr
Bayley, and I am pleased to be speaking with you as Chair again. The
difficulty with obliging is that it would be hard to do so without any
consideration of the subject matter and the financial implications of
having a referendum. There is an interplay between such things that is
important for the Committee to consider. I do not know whether I should
replay my last sentence from this morning, but I was discussing the
difficulty at the ward level. If the trigger level for a referendum is
only 5%, that would be 400 signatures only. Many of us know that it is
not difficult to collect 400 signatures, and that might cause a

                        <p>He
added an interesting thought for the Committee, which was that the
Government should contemplate applying the measures to their own
workings before imposing them on a local government. It is, however,
hard to see why the Government feel that there is a need for the
Secretary of State to take a power to set the required percentage of
signatures that would trigger a local
referendum.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000045">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
83 is an alternative, because it would mean that even if we had a
situation where the Secretary of State is taking the power to specify a
different percentage, it would have to be higher. If we are querying
whether 5% is too low, which we are, it does not seem appropriate to
consider measures that would let the Secretary of State make it even
lower. As I said, at ward level, 5% of the local electorate is as low
as 400 signatures, so it hard to see why less than 5% would be
necessary. The amendments are sensible in the context of the current
financial restraints on local government, and I hope that the Committee
can support
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000046">&#160;</a>

I mentioned earlier when I intervened on the hon. Member for Worsley
and Eccles South, amendment 81 seems to be extremely
inconsistent—I would not go as far as hypocritical—given
that the Opposition are suggesting 10% when they, when in Government,
had 5% as the threshold for local referendums for directly elected
mayors. In my constituency, we had a referendum for such a mayor on the
5% threshold. I understand the hon. Lady’s point that, in some
areas, it can be too easy to achieve, and I spoke to people in my area
who signed the petition for that referendum with a complete
misunderstanding of what it was about. It had been put across to them
in a way that was quite different from what it actually means to have a
directly elected mayor in a two-tier authority. That threshold is there
and it was seen as right by the Labour Government that that would be an
appropriate threshold for a local community to consider changing the
way it is governed, so why it should be any different for any other
issue that might be important to a community is beyond me. Indeed,
there are organisations such as Keep Britain Tidy that say that even 5%
is too high a threshold. So there are arguments both ways, but I think
the Government have got it right this time in keeping the
threshold—if there

                           </strong> If I may pick up some
specific points raised in the debate by way of
questioning. I think it was the hon. Member for Worsley and Eccles
South who asked about the cost of ward referendums. Obviously the cost
depends on the number of electors in the ward, and they are of hugely
different sizes across the country, but the evidence we have is that a
referendum held at the same time as a local election can cost 50p per
head, and if not held with an election the cost is around £1.50
per head. Obviously if there were multiple referendums on the same day
you would not have to multiply by £1.50 each
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000050">&#160;</a>

                           </span> The
Minister will recall the evidence we heard from Sir Simon
Milton who quoted figures of a £5 million cost if a Greater
London authority referendum was held on the same day as an election,
and £11 million if it was held separately. That is a different
ratio from the cost figures the Minister has given us of 50p for a ward
election held on the same day as an election and £1.50 if held
separately. Does the Minister have any idea as to why there should be
that discrepancy between the two sets of
figures?<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000051">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I have got a very good idea. There is a
significant fixed cost to having any election, so at a ward level the
number is different from, let us say, that on a GLA basis. That said, I
was going to go on to say that for instance in Salford, the local
authority of the hon. Member for Worsley and Eccles South, the average
ward size is approximately 8,300 so the cost would be over
£4,000 if the referendum was held with an election, and over
£12,000 if held independently. For Birmingham, which has one of
the largest ward sizes in the country with an average of 18,500, the
equivalent costs are £9,000 and
£28,000.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000052">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">A
number of early speakers in the debate talked about the council having
the power to vary the threshold. I want to make it clear that a council
has no power to vary the threshold. The issue under discussion at that
point was whether, having failed to reach the threshold—let us
say 4.9% rather than 5% turning out to be the number—the council
should have the leeway to say fair enough, it was a good attempt, we
will have a referendum on that issue. My hon. Friend the Member for
St Austell and Newquay, in moving amendment 123, asked
whether we need this provision at all, because, as he quite rightly
pointed out, the council—entirely independently of a petition
for a referendum being raised—can determine by majority that it
is going to hold a referendum in any case. That is obviously the case,
but we had in mind a situation where, say 4.9% had been reached but not
5%, there might be scope for argument, even possibly challenge, that
despite the council having a separate power it would be convenient for
them to have this additional power. I would describe it as belt and
braces.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000053">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">So
I say to the my hon. Friend the Member for St Austell and
Newquay that in a sense, whether he is successful in defeating me or I
am successful in defeating him, it makes no difference to the
council’s capacity to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 390<a class="bkMark" name="Column390">&#160;</a>
                           </div>hold a referendum on that issue should it choose to do so. However, we
believed in bringing the Bill forward that it was right to have a
provision that put beyond any doubt the fact that the council, even if
the referendum result had failed by a margin, could still go
ahead.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000054">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Perhaps
I could say to the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich that
the brains behind the scenes tell me that the 50p and £1.50 per
elector figures are based on recent experience of the referendum in
Tower Hamlets, and that is set out in paragraph 32 of the impact
assessment.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000055">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Worsley and Eccles South said that she thought that 10%
would be a safer figure because it would prevent a large number of
potentially vexatious and time-wasting referendums from being called.
That is somewhat in opposition to what she told the Committee last
Thursday:<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000056">&#160;</a>

                        <p>I do not
think that it will be that easy, and I made the point before lunch that
I have no doubt that an alert local authority and alert local elected
representatives will want to indicate to their communities that they do
not have only a referendum through which to get their point across. Our
5% figure, reflecting as it does on exactly the same practice as the
previous Government did, is the right one to
have.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000057">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
83 would limit the Secretary of State’s power in making
variations to the power to make the percentage go up and not down.
Perhaps I should first say something about the Secretary of
State’s powers, because it is important to understand that we
have not included every detail of the procedures, and have made it
clear that there is a subsequent process to establish the criteria,
which has to be carried out in discussion with local authorities and
others who will be directly affected. It seems right, therefore, to
retain in the legislation the Secretary of State’s capacity to
reflect on the consultation, and on the views and experience over time,
and to vary the conditions if that is
appropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000058">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
was also suggested, I think, that we were trying in some way to replace
petitions with referendums, and that that somehow weakened the
relationship between elected members and the communities they
represented. The opposite is the case, and the fact that citizens can
have a referendum does not weaken their relationship with their elected
representatives. In fact, it strengthens it in two ways. First, by
giving people a voice through a referendum there is an incentive for
their elected representatives to listen and to engage, and if an
elected representative was tempted not to give their community the
attention that they should, that community could resort to having their
say through a referendum. The fact that they can do that, will
incentivise representatives to play a full and active part in exactly
what the name says: representative
democracy.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000059">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
a referendum can be an effective vehicle though which a community can
make clear to their representatives their views on a particular issue.
The hon. Member for Worsley and Eccles South and I have both referred
to the referendum on congestion charging in Greater Manchester. She
referred to it as a binding referendum; it was not binding in a legal
sense, but it was in the sense that the authorities that undertook the
referendum undertook to listen to the outcome and  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 391<a class="bkMark" name="Column391">&#160;</a>
                           </div>act on it. A non-binding referendum does not require representatives to
act in a particular way, but it brings the community’s view
loudly and clearly before them,  so that they can take their
decisions in no doubt at  all about the views of the people
they represent. In other words, referendums can enhance, not diminish,
representative
democracy.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000060">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I want to
pick up one of the quite understandable points that the hon. Member for
Lewisham East raised in the earlier debate, on the
applicability and the appropriateness of referendums for all kinds of
issues. We do not see the referendum regime duplicating other regimes
where people in communities can have their say. Orders under clause 44
allow matters to be excluded from the scope of local referendums. We
want to consider carefully what those matters should be.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000061">&#160;</a>

sensible and appropriate suggestions have been made during the course
of today’s debate, and we want to reflect on those. It could
well be the case that there is reason for planning to be treated in a
different way, because there is scope for representations to be made in
a different form. When we get to that part of the Bill and the
neighbourhood planning system, there will be ample scope for local
communities to make their views clear, not only in a non-binding
referendum, but to establish the planning framework for their
communities in a binding
referendum.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000062">&#160;</a>

the Minister’s say-so, without a chance to look at the detail.
That is not acceptable, and I sincerely hope that when they come to

                           </strong> The right hon. Gentleman makes his point
forcefully, but he overlooks the fact that the existing provision,
which allows local councils to have referendums, is not hedged with
many restrictions on their topics. What we are looking at, in the light
of the discussion that we have had, is whether we should simply roll
that provision forward so that local communities can commission a
non-binding referendum, as councils already can, unconditionally, or
broadly unconditionally —or unconditionally in the
context of the discussions that we have had so far; perhaps someone can
find some conditions that do apply. It is now being suggested that we
should look more carefully at whether that unconditional remit should
be available for publicly community-initiated referendums, and we are
taking stock of those
points.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000068">&#160;</a>

important issue of whether the provision will include planning. The
Minister makes the Delphic oracle look like a beacon of clarity by way
of comparison. Can we be absolutely clear about this? First, will
planning be exempt from what is being proposed in respect of
referendums? Secondly, can the Minister give some examples of what he
is talking about? He said that he does not want to give references on
the hoof, but at least a flavour of his thinking would be
helpful.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000069">&#160;</a>

about the evidence that was given to us at the opening of our
Committee’s deliberations, and I am reflecting on the points
that have been made in this debate. I shall not say that, as a matter
of course, all planning decisions will be exempt from referendums.
There will be issues raised by the national planning policy framework
which it would obviously be appropriate for referendums to consider,
and there might be others where it would be important to reflect on the
scale or impact of a development. I do not want to be drawn into that,
but it is right and appropriate to give the matter further
consideration.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000070">&#160;</a>

that I will write to members of the Committee and clear up the
confusion. Let me make it clear that my right hon. Friend the Minister
of State and I are making exactly the same points in questions and
comments today. We want an effective power for local communities to
call non-binding referendums, and for those referendums to be taken
seriously as an important element of democratic accountability. It is
important that we get that precisely right, and these are issues which
I am trying to assure the Committee we shall work on and

and I tabled the amendment, we wanted to challenge the need to have
subsection (2) in the clause. The Minister refers to my defeating him
or his defeating me, but perhaps we can accept a score draw, because it
seems that the belt-and-braces approach to which he alluded might be
entirely correct. However, the subsection does not need to be part of
the clause. Overall—we will come to this under clause
50—I have some worries that the Bill could give an awful lot of
influence to local authorities, allowing them to frame the terms of a
referendum, rather than do what the Minister said—and what I
agree with—and give the powers to local people. With that score
draw, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

making the request include a majority of those members of the authority
who represent the relevant
area.’.<p class="tabbed">We
are still seeking to test and scrutinise the different parts of the
process of introducing local referendums. It was clear from the last
debate that certain aspects still seem a bit ragged, in terms of
understanding the legislation. The community empowerment measures have
not been consulted on and have not had any scrutiny.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000167">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The amendment
would mean that a local referendum would be required in an authority
only if at least 25% of the members of that authority made a request
for it. That must still include a majority of members for the electoral
area, or areas, where the referendum is to take place. The amendment
would increase the level of support necessary for a request from
members to hold a local referendum. Setting the level at one or more
members, as the Bill does, means that a councillor from a single-member
ward, or two or three members from one ward, could make a request for a
local referendum. The amendment aims to ensure that those councillors
also have the support of councillors from other words.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000168">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">This is a
sensible measure aimed at ensuring that the local referendum process is
manageable for local authorities. As the Minister said, the decision on
whether to hold a local referendum in response to a request will be
taken at a full council meeting. However, unless there is some
indication of the level of support needed, local authorities could find
themselves receiving constant requests for local referendums from a
small minority of councillors. As I mentioned earlier, some councils
have the unfortunate difficulty of obstinate minorities, sometimes from
extreme parties. Clearly, a single councillor from such a party, or a
little group of them from one or more wards, could employ the tactic of
constantly putting in referendum requests and then going to the local
population and saying, “They never agree to any of our
requests.” It would require a bit more work, but requiring 25%
of members to support a request for a referendum is
reasonable.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000169">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In the House,
through early-day motions, we try to show that a particular matter,
issue or proposition has a certain level of support by gathering
signatures. The idea is similar to that. The amendment could help make
the process more manageable, so I hope that the Committee can support
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000170">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My hon. Friend almost lost my support by citing
early-day motions as a reason for backing her amendment. I regard
early-day motions with considerable suspicion. They seem to me to be a
form of parliamentary incontinence. Having had an encounter with the
Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, the hon.
Member for Hazel Grove, at a debate on housing in the autumn, I can say
that he probably regrets having signed as many early-day motions as he
clearly did, because such things come back to haunt
one.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000171">&#160;</a>

problems that we identified and discussed in earlier debates. There
could be particular pressure from small areas in a local authority
where the councillors might be pressured unduly by particular interest
groups that are opposed to a scheme or a type of
development—something that is not popular—and where
councillors could easily be pushed into agreeing to put their names to
a request for a local
referendum.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000174">&#160;</a>

threshold seems quite small, leaving the provision wide open to the
abuse already identified. We all know that that is likely. Among the
many submissions of evidence that we have received is one from
RenewableUK, a highly responsible organisation that the Government
ought to support, given their aspiration to be a green Government.
However, the organisation is clearly extremely alarmed at the scope for
local referendums to be used to stop the development of renewable
energy schemes, which are extremely difficult to get through the
planning process because they tend to engender very strong
feelings.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000175">&#160;</a>

have a classic illustration of the Government’s green objectives
and devolutionary objectives potentially being in conflict, with no
evidence whatever of a sensible way to resolve the conflict. That is a
characteristic that we have identified all the way through the Bill,
and we will go on identifying it while we are in
Committee—which, I fear, will be for a long time this evening,
so we might have a great deal more to say on the subject. The
contradictions, and the lack of coherence and detailed thinking on how
such arrangements can best work, are all too
clear.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000176">&#160;</a>

have had a submission from Mr Henry Peterson, to which my hon. Friend
the Member for Worsley and Eccles South has rightly referred on a
couple of occasions. Mr Peterson will be known to many people here; he
has been a distinguished local government officer. He served for a long
period in the London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham—so long
that I was actually the Member of Parliament for that area when he
started his service—and he continued there until 2005. In the
course of a long and distinguished career as director, deputy chief
executive and monitoring officer, he developed a number of extremely
thoughtful and intelligent observations about the success and failures
of various initiatives taken over that long period to try to extend
community empowerment, and some of the tensions and difficulties that
that can create.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000177">&#160;</a>

a sensible paper that sets out some of the difficulties, problems and

                           </div>the Bill that they are promoting is to bring a great deal of business to
m’learned friends. They will benefit because there will be
constant scope for challenge: challenge if the procedures have not been
applied properly; challenge if a local authority is felt to have taken
a decision that is not entirely in keeping with the legislation; and
challenge if a local councillor has or has not failed to act in the way
that a local community group that is keen to promote a particular cause
feels that the councillor should have acted.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000179">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I fear,
therefore, that there is scope for litigation. There is certainly scope
for confusion and ill-feeling, and for undermining the position of
local councillors. The amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member
for Worsley and Eccles South gives a much sounder basis for the
consideration of the process that we are discussing. I am not terribly
wedded to that process; as I have said on previous occasions, it is a
contradiction to say that the Government wish to devolve more say and
scope to local authorities, and then to prescribe, in extraordinary
detail, precisely how one of these referendum processes should operate.
That does not seem to be entirely in line with the spirit of localism.
However, if we are going to do that—the Government seem
determined to do so—we should do it on a much sounder basis than
that set out in clause 42. We should instead be prepared to set a
reasonably tough threshold. The threshold of at least 25% members of an
authority is a real safeguard against an unrepresentative group, who
may be strong in one particular locality of the authority, hijacking
the whole
agenda.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000180">&#160;</a>

makes some valid points, but could I put to him an opposite argument?
He will know that there are many local authorities where the minority
group on the council is less than 25% of the members of the council. Is
there not a danger that if we set the threshold at 25% of the council,
the majority groups could essentially prevent any councillor from a
minority group from pressing for a referendum in their

point, and that is the difficulty about trying to be too prescriptive.
That is why I said, in advance of making these comments, that I doubted
the wisdom of being as prescriptive as the Bill is on something that is
supposed to be devolutionary and to give more say to a local authority.
Having done that, however, I feel that we should have safeguards
against the specific problem that I have identified. I have risen to
speak in support of the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member
for Worsley and Eccles South, which has the figure of 25%. I accept
that that might have a downside in certain circumstances, but I can see
it having an upside in other circumstances, where an unrepresentative

clause 42 unamended. I sincerely hope that those members of the
Committee who are open-minded and want us to do our job of scrutinising
the legislation, rather than leaving Ministers an extraordinary carte
blanche to decide all these things afterwards, after
ruminating—or not—on the debates in Committee but having
evaded proper scrutiny, make the decisions.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000183">&#160;</a>

Member for Worsley and Eccles South herself said that the key point is
not the number of councillors who request a referendum, but that, at
some point, the majority of the council has to agree to it—it
has to be agreed by the full council. Whether it is one local authority
member, 25% of them or 49% of them, what matters is that, when the
final decision is taken, it is 50% plus one of them. From that point of
view, the amendment seems not to achieve any of her objectives, because
the wider support she said was an important component is provided by
the council’s decision, not by somebody—either an
individual or more than an individual—coming forward in the
council.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000184">&#160;</a>

hon. Lady said it was important to ensure that small minorities cannot
take command of the agenda, and the right hon. Member for Greenwich and
Woolwich referred to the agenda being hijacked by a small minority.
When I was first elected to a local authority, in 1979, I was one of a
four-person group on a 60-councillor authority. If I remember, the
Conservatives held 40 of the 60 seats, so one political party had an
overwhelming majority. We were the newcomers, and we were seen as
extremists. <em>[</em>

should to be very careful about advancing an argument in this place
that there should be rules designed to exclude small numbers of
democratically elected councillors, however unpleasant their views may
seem to us. The clause does not do that. A ward councillor in a
district with a single-councillor ward could bring a referendum
forward; if it is a three-person ward, it requires a majority of the
councillors to bring a referendum forward. To initiate a referendum
would require the support of the councillors covering the area in which
it is to be

picked out many things that he thinks are wrong with the provision, all
of which carry exactly the same risks as the petition duty, which we
have just disconnected because it could be hijacked by an endless
procession of referendums being called by a minority group member under
some external influence. How much more is that true of petitions? How

local government will be aware of individual members of councils who,
for their own ends, deliberately try to clog up the system. In the
authority of which I was a member for 27 years, there were one or two
individuals—in fact, there were probably more than that during
that period—who had a bee in their bonnet and, for example,
spuriously referred matters to the ombudsman. It takes up an awful lot
of officer time  to establish, first and foremost, whether
there is a case

it goes directly to ombudsman, an investigation has to be carried out.
In probably about 95% of those cases, the ombudsman reported back to
the authority that there was no case to
answer.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000189">&#160;</a>

a whole range of issues. The local authority would, quite rightly, have
to ensure in each case that the argument for having a referendum or not
was properly investigated. If one, two or three members of an authority
are repeatedly and deliberately attempting to clog up the

seems that every word he has spoken and that the right hon. Member for

criticism as that made for petitions. The fact of the matter is that
minorities in a democracy are a pain in the neck for those in the

Friend the Member for Gateshead described in relation to how mischief

as well as for referendums. The key issue is that referendums will be a
far more complex, time-consuming, costly process. I foresee
circumstances in which referendums disturb the focus of a local
government organisation from its major purpose. It could end up
spending a lot of time dealing with and managing the process of
referendums, when it should be directly focusing on serving the people
it has been elected to serve. Not having the legislation properly

                           </strong> I can absolutely assure my hon. Friend that that
is not right. There are different ways in which a referendum may be
triggered and they are in parallel, not in series. In other words, if
100% sign up to a petition—it is pretty obvious what the result
of the referendum will be—the council does not have the option;
it has to do it. In default of that, it is possible for local
councillors to promote the idea that the council should have such a
referendum. That becomes effective only if a majority of the council
agrees with the ward councillors that that should be the
case.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000197">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have focused on wards. There is nothing here that requires it to be
either the whole council area or an individual ward area. It might be
that it is more than one ward. It might be an area committee area or
some other grouping. Whatever the grouping, if the councillor route for
requesting a referendum was in play, it would need a majority of
councillors in that area. I am sorry, but I have to say to my hon.
Friend the Member for Bradford East that if a minority in a ward wants
a referendum, they have had it unless they can persuade the 5% to sign
up to a public requisition.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000198">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister sets out his argument for the
circumstances that were outlined by the hon. Member for Bradford East
in which 100% of the electorate were in favour of a referendum but two
out of the three councillors were not. I can see that the council would
still be able to treat this as a petition that complied with the
legislation through clause 40, even though it does not comply with
clause 42. Let me put to the Minister a slightly less extreme
illustration where there is sufficient support for a referendum to
generate the numbers above the threshold, but two out of the three
councillors are still opposed. What happens in those circumstances?
Will there still be an automatic referendum, or will there be an
element of
doubt?<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000199">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> There will be an automatic referendum. The public
requisition trumps the other methods of securing such a vote. I said
some time ago—my Whip thinks it was too long ago—that
amendment 84 is of no practical use and actually reduces the capacity
of local representatives to represent their communities in the council.

                           </strong> I will not detain the Committee for too much
longer. A number of points have been made about the objectives of the
amendment. All the Opposition’s amendments are about making the
process of running a referendum more manageable. That is what we are
trying to do. With a piece of legislation that has never been tested,
consulted on or had any form of scrutiny, it is perfectly valid that we
propose ideas that the Minister might not agree with, or that he thinks
are fanciful, because each of these aspects and propositions of the
Bill need to be tested.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000201">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There will be
a divide in this Committee, I think, between people who support
petitions and those who are constantly running down the whole notion of
a petition when the petition is in itself a trigger for a local
referendum. It seems bizarre to be constantly running down the idea of
a petition. We do not have to go back to Greece, but it has an
absolutely honourable tradition. I can say why I think a petition is
better: it is cheap and flexible. It does not need 5% or 10%; it can be
presented with 25, 105 or 100,000 names. We said in the early stages of
debate that a petition is one of the most understood forms of
participation, with the highest rates. When asked, most people will say
that they have signed one in the past 12
months.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000202">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Does the hon. Lady not accept that one of the
problems with a petition as opposed to a referendum is that it
represents only one side of the story? One of the Opposition’s
criticisms has been that, at a 5% threshold, a small group could get a
referendum, but a small group could get a petition stating only one
side of the case. At least with a referendum, both sides are heard and
the case is made for and against.

is saying, rightly, that it depends on the question. Sometimes there
are big questions, such as, “Shall we impose congestion charging
across the whole of Greater Manchester?” which have a big impact
on the people affected; sometimes the questions deal with smaller
subjects, such as “Is the lighting sufficient in the street down
to our day nursery?” which I mentioned in last week’s
sitting. We must have manageable and affordable processes, and
petitions are cheap and

have a mechanism at the heart of local referendums and then talk about
the mischief caused by petitions, which will stay. If there is
confusion, however, it is about centralising and taking powers for the
Secretary of State over the process, and then being unwilling to
consider any sensible amendments to make that process manageable. I
shall continue to say that the Bill creates a new duty and a new
burden. We are the people who are charged with scrutinising its
clauses, so it is right that we consider different aspects and methods.

might have been fulfilled in the district sense, but it certainly might
not have been in the county sense. I know that there is latitude in

same area when it goes forward to the county. It might be only part of
a county division, or it might be several county divisions comprising a
shire district. The measurement is of the area within which the

                           </strong> We have had an interesting discussion about the
provisions that apply where there may be an element of doubt as to
whether an issue for referendum is more appropriately dealt with by the
district council or the county council, but I do not see any provisions
in the Bill that relate to a possible conflict between a London borough
council and the Greater London
authority.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000223">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">When
the Greater London authority was set up, it was very much part of our
thinking that, wherever possible, it should not have an overlap of
responsibilities with the London borough councils. The belief was that
the Greater London authority should be a strategic body and the
councils should remain the bodies charged with delivering services
locally. The purpose was to avoid the kind of conflicts that,
unfortunately, characterised relations between the old Greater London
Council and 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 404<a class="bkMark" name="Column404">&#160;</a>
                           </div>the London boroughs. Generally, that mechanism has worked. As time has
gone on, however, and as Mayors have become more rapacious, seeking
ever greater powers, and as Governments of all persuasions have been
inclined to humour Mayors by giving them greater powers, we are moving
into a world where there will be a greater overlap
between the Mayor’s powers and the powers of the London
boroughs.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000224">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Housing is an
obvious example: in the original provisions for the Greater London
authority, we did not give the Mayor specific housing powers, because
we felt that that was best left for the boroughs. An arrangement was
included for dividing the strategic planning powers from the
boroughs’ local planning powers, but that was as far as it got.
Now, of course, the Mayor has substantial housing powers and
inevitably, there will be conflict between the Mayor and the boroughs.
Into that, one can see a situation where people pushing a cause seek to
advance it through a referendum. It might be a member of the Greater
London authority trying to do so, although in clause 42, I see that
members are precluded from requesting a referendum themselves. That
would not, of course, preclude them from talking to a colleague in a
local authority, who could request a referendum in that authority. Were
that to happen, the Mayor and indeed, the GLA, might feel that that was
an inappropriate use of the referendum power to push a point of view
that was hostile to the policy of the GLA or the Mayor, on the part of
an individual local authority.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000225">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Although the
Bill does not seem to have any mechanism to deal with such
circumstances, I look forward to the Minister’s response, and I
hope that he can assure me that there is such a mechanism. I cannot see
it, however, and in its absence, I feel nervous. There will be
malicious use of these powers to foment disagreement between boroughs
and the GLA, which is not in the interests of good governance in
London. As the Government clearly recognise that there might be a
problem in two-tier areas outside London and a mechanism has been set
in place for resolving that, would it not be appropriate to give
further thought to a mechanism within London to ensure that any such
conflict between London boroughs and the GLA can be resolved? I hope
that inspiration is finding its way rapidly to the Minister, and that
he can give me a
response.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000226">&#160;</a>

report to the right hon. Gentleman that if a borough receives a
petition for a referendum on an issue that is the responsibility of the
GLA, the borough must hold a referendum if it considers that it has
influence on the issue, or if any of its partner authorities have
influence over it—and Transport for London is a partner
authority. In other words, as I understand what I have in front of me,
if there were a request for a petition in the London borough of
Lewisham, or of Greenwich, which was valid in all respects from
residents to, for example, fares in London, it would be right and in
order for that London borough to conduct a non-binding referendum. I
believe that the right hon. Gentleman is right in saying that there is
no direct referral mechanism to the GLA.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000228">&#160;</a>

hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich has made a sensible,
constructive point that needs looking at. Although that may not happen
now, perhaps there will be an opportunity to clarify whether it is only
TfL that is a partner body, or whether other branches of the GLA family
are included. For example, the Bill gives power to the Mayor in
relation to mayoral development corporations. One could envisage a
situation where constituents of London Members petition, or councillors
on a particular local authority wish to have a referendum on such a
proposal, which clearly would be the responsibility of neither the TfL
nor the national partner authority, but the Greater London Authority.
At some point, having a clarification on whether amendments are
required to deal with that, or whether the Bill as drafted takes
account of those issues, will be helpful to the

for Bradford East and I have tabled a similar amendment, but it is
slightly more encompassing given that we are seeking to delete both
subsections (5) and (6) in order to remove the Secretary of

matter. Crucially for me, there is an inference there that he will be
able to determine what might not be considered to be a local

want to paint a scenario that I hope is accurate, and I am sure that
Ministers will correct me if I am wrong. There is a live issue in my
constituency that may well fall within the remit of the Secretary of
State’s intervention. St Dennis is a small village in my
constituency, with a population of about 2,000, smack bang in the
middle of the former clay-mining district. There is a proposal for a
mass-burn incinerator that can take 250,000 tonnes of rubbish each
year. Not only the local parish council, but all the adjoining parish
councils, are against it. The district council, before it was abolished
under local government reorganisation, was also against the proposal,
and Cornwall county council turned down the planning application in
March
2009.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000242">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
as that facility has wider implications for Cornwall, arguably for the
south-west and possibly for the UK’s obligations for climate
change and emissions levels—all arguments that I refute, but
they are arguments that can and have been made—it may be deemed
by the Secretary of State not to be a local issue, but an
other-than-local issue, if I can put it in those terms. I shall give
some other examples.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000243">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Wind farms
could clearly be a matter of concern within the local area but may
arguably be of national concern when it comes to energy security and
provisions to ensure that the lights do not go out. We recently saw the
well-led protests against airport expansion in the south-east, but over
the next couple of decades that will be a problem for most parts of the
country; it undeniably has a local impact, but it is clearly wrapped up
in matters to do with regional economic growth and the national
transport strategy. We can see that sort of complexity in other
areas—for example, in education policy, with the advent of free
schools and the drive for more academies. Whatever one’s view on
that, it affects the local area but is also part of our national
policy.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000244">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I believe
that true localism would allow local people, through their elected
representatives and through local offices, to take a view about local
issues. I find it quite bizarre that the Localism Bill should include a
clause that allows a national politician to determine what those local
issues are—and, more crucially, what those local issues may not
be, and therefore the matters on which people may be denied the chance
to have a referendum. Are we really saying that having an incinerator
in my constituency would not be a legitimate subject for a referendum,
or that the airport expansions in the south-east, wind farms or
whatever else were not legitimate subjects?<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000245">&#160;</a>

probing amendment to see whether these matters have been thought
through by the ministerial team and to help me understand their
thinking on why it should be appropriate for a national politician to
decide what is a local issue, and by implication to be able to decide
what is not one. I hope that the Minister will tell us what further

                           </strong> That is a very good question, and I give the
straightforward answer that I have given on many occasions. In my view,
the general power of competence in the Bill is in a sense a bit of a
fraud. In my view, it is not appropriate for local authorities to
conduct foreign policy matters. That is why I prefer the previous
definition, which was a power to pursue the well-being of the area,
defined broadly to cover its economic, environmental and social
well-being, but without any temptation for authorities to venture into
this territory. I shall not give examples; we all know of celebrated
instances of local authorities indulging in a certain amount of
grandstanding on matters way beyond their area’s interests. I
would not regard that as appropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000251">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There must be
safeguards, and I do not think that the Bill as drafted gets them
right. It dangles the possibility of localism without setting proper
parameters, but then leaves a lot of issues, such as this one, up in
the air and absolutely at the mercy of the Secretary of State’s
decision by order, not Parliament’s decision by statute.

not agree, but I think that localism is important and that clear
parameters must be set for what is and is not acceptable. I have my
view. He may have a different view, but I think that we can both agree
that it is better that it is absolutely clear in statute and is not
subject to the whim of a Secretary of State who may use the
order-making powers at any point to change the ground rules. That does

I was making in response to the hon. Member for Croydon Central: one
needs such things to be clearly defined in statute. I expressed my
preference for the general framework of the power of well-being, which,
as the hon. Gentleman rightly points out, is specifically referred to
in subsection (4)(a)(i). I would be perfectly happy to rest on that. I
do not regard it as acceptable for the Secretary of State to be able to
trump that and say, whatever the local authority thinks,
“I’m coming in with regulations which haven’t been
agreed by Parliament, other than under the statutory instrument
procedure. They are not in statute, simply in a statutory
instrument.” I regard that as an inappropriate use of the
Secretary of State’s power, and I suspect that the hon.
Gentleman and I agree on that. I hope that his friend the hon. Member
for St Austell and Newquay, and possibly the hon. Member for Croydon
Central, will agree as well.

we will debate its relationship to council plans, local plans and
neighbourhood plans at a later stage. We also discussed earlier the
relevance of subjecting factors in the national planning policy to a
referendum. However, I think that my hon. Friend’s broader point
is about what limitations should be placed, either in primary or
secondary legislation, on a local authority’s capacity to decide
what should or should not be subject to a referendum. Bear in mind that
it is for the local authority to decide whether it is a local matter
and whether it is vexatious and so on. They are the people with their
hand on the windpipe of the proposal in terms of what to let
through.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000260">&#160;</a>

local communities to challenge their local authorities and to put their
local representatives on their mettle through the non-binding
referendum procedure. It is absolutely right that Parliament should
decide the exact context for that, and clause 44 sets out what we
believe to be the right context. It is right that we set out the
parameters we expect local authorities to

say to my hon. Friend the Member for St Austell and Newquay and to the

the issue is about making sure that we have a business-like proposition
that will be useful to local communities and that will not be open to
abuse or misuse. As has been rightly pointed out, in earlier times
there was a tendency for certain local authorities to venture into
foreign policy and other matters that were none of their business,
which is exactly why clause 44(4) appears as it does. It is also right
to include subsections (5) and (6) to make sure that, in the light of
what are, at present, unforeseen circumstances—they have
certainly not yet been articulated—it is possible to amend and
vary the

not want to speculate on what they might be. I guess if one had a
nuclear submarine base within the local authority area, there might be
some very important reasons why the Secretary of State might take a
view about that kind of project. I do not want to pre-empt a decision,

Minister can see that it would have helped our debate today if we had
had some view of that framework he talked about. The Minister of State,
Department for Communities and Local Government, the right hon. Member
for Tunbridge Wells did say to us in his contribution to evidence that
he would be prepared to go through the powers one by one and check
whether they are centralising. Yet, whenever we come to this debate,
all the time we are told, “It’s okay because I say
it’s okay. Just wait and see.” We cannot do that. With
regard to comments made earlier, it is rather arrogant of the
Government to say that this Committee, which is meant to be
scrutinising the Bill, should just accept every assurance on every
power. We do not, so I am afraid I will push the amendment to a
vote.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000273">&#160;</a>

and what it will mean to them, and I know of more local authorities
with such concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000302">&#160;</a>

the interpretation provisions helpful. Partner authorities are
mentioned many times, but none of the documentation relating to the
Bill specifies what they are, as far as I can see. They are mentioned,
for example, in clause 44. I looked it up online, and the bodies
alongside the local authority to which local
referendum questions may be directed include primary care trusts, NHS
trusts, foundation trusts, police authorities, transport authorities
and others. The list is longer than that, and it would have helped me
to have such a list when I started thinking about the question. If the
Minister can provide members of the Committee with one, that would be
helpful.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000303">&#160;</a>

debating this in Committee, can the Minister tell us any more about the

around this, and on which there will be consultation. It does not seem
as though this is one of the aspects of the community empowerment part
of the Bill on which the Department has launched a consultation. We are
aware that two consultation documents were launched last Friday, but
they did not seem to cover this question. The Opposition are still
short of

point about the interaction between the Secretary of State and the
local council in determining which of the issues that I have outlined
are local, and which national. I fully accept that the current
Secretary of State is of such largesse that even if there were any
doubt, he would award the benefit of the doubt to the local community
and allow a referendum to take place. When incineration is discussed in
the context of national waste policy; when airports are discussed in
the context of transport policy; and when schools are discussed in the
context of education policy, however, a potential tension arises. The
Secretary of State might decide that something is a non-local matter,
but local people might want to express themselves on the issue through
a referendum. We need more information from Ministers about how some of
those tensions might be resolved.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000305">&#160;</a>

referring to this Secretary of State, but to a future Secretary of
State who might not even be in this place yet, but who will arrive with
an ability to prevent local people from holding a referendum on the
issues that matter to them. I push the Minister a final time on whether
he will undertake to consult the Local Government Association on
bringing forward proposals that would deal with some of the issues that
we have teased
out.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000306">&#160;</a>

appropriate bodies about the matters that should be included or
excluded. For what it is worth, and probably at the risk of my head
being put on a platter somewhere, I want to be inclusive with that, but

the cuts being made, as a consequence of the Government’s
decisions, to 2,400 members of the police service in the west midlands,
1,200 of whom will be police officers. Considerable concern has been
expressed by the police about the consequences, including for their
work with the local authority on issues such as domestic violence and
child protection. Would the impact of those cuts be a possible subject

interventions. I thought that I had covered that point by saying that
matters that are paid for by the council and by central Government
taxation—and by the council tax, in respect of the police
service—would clearly be legitimate matters for a referendum if
a sufficient number of people thought it
appropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000312">&#160;</a>

me give some assurance, if I can. The order-making power is not about
intervention on a case-by-case basis. It is not a question of a
referendum popping up and the Secretary of State getting up in the
morning and saying, “You can’t do that.” It is not
about stopping a council doing what it wants. It is about proscribing a
matter that is not to be treated as a local matter. Hence the council
would not be required to hold a referendum if  it received a
petition that was otherwise in order, if it came under something in the
list of requirements that the Secretary of State produced after
consultation. There would not be a prohibition on a council having a
referendum on something completely different, if it chose to
do so—although I may get a shake of the head from
somewhere—on issues such as the abolition of the monarchy, or
other matters of that
sort.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000313">&#160;</a>

tease out another example, relating to the cuts
being made to the fire service in Birmingham? Once
again, the fire service works in close co-operation with the local
authority on a whole number of fronts—on, among other things,
fire prevention and community safety. Very considerable concern has
been expressed on the cuts to the fire service. Would that possibly be

not? Would that be an appropriate subject for a referendum, and how do

anything that I said was seen to have done that, I apologise to the
Committee. To the hon. Member for Scunthorpe, I say that for all these
examples, Members can look at clause 44(4) and see a clear and
comprehensive definition of what a local matter is. I hope that that
reassures them that there is nothing in the provision that would muzzle
a local community or authority that decided that it wanted a referendum
on those

earlier, but I want to press the Minister further with some other

is the power; trust us. In due course, we will make it clear how that
power might be used.” Inevitably, questions are already being
asked of us, including by our constituents, such as, “What
exactly does that mean? If it is said that we are being empowered, how
are we being empowered? To speak on what?” The Minister has to
come forward with the views that must have been discussed in

clarity on precisely what the Government mean. I want to press the

one more example; it is yet more extraneous, but we need clarity. When
Rover closed in 2005, it was an immense tragedy for the city of
Birmingham. I was deeply involved in the efforts made, with all-party

so desired, could that matter have been the subject

In general, referendums are about giving power to people. Clause 44(4)
supports that general remit, as does subsection (3), which concerns
matters within the remit of a local authority. To start giving out a
centrally controlled list of what can or cannot be done would defeat
the object of localism and of giving people in that area the power to
call a referendum in the first place. Again, there seems to be an
inconsistency between localism and central
control.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000322">&#160;</a>

to exercise one of his 143 Henry VIII powers, says that he will
maintain the right to say what is and is not appropriate. It is said to
us that, subject to how that power is exercised—we have
constantly been given the example of the independent nuclear
deterrent—local communities would be free to decide. The
Minister was then pressed to say on what matters those communities
would be free to decide. We must tease out how the reserve power of the
Secretary of State might be used. I will press the Minister once again.

not just a question of nuclear submarine bases; earlier, my hon. Friend
the Member for Scunthorpe gave the example of the instigation of a free
school. The power to instigate a free school does not rest with the
local authority, but with the Secretary of State for Education. That is
one of the 47 Henry VIII powers that the Secretary of State for
Education is taking in the Bill that is currently being discussed in
the Chamber. Would not a referendum on whether a free school was
established be ultra vires, given that the local authority does not
have the power to block it in any way?<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000326">&#160;</a>

in a poke when there is a complete lack of clarity. Once again, will
the Minister share with the Committee and Parliament the thinking that
has gone on in Government about what is and what is not an appropriate

an observation. The hon. Member for Great Yarmouth had a go at the
Opposition on the grounds that we were adopting some kind of centralist

(6). I must put it to him that subsections (5) and (6) are the most
extraordinarily centralising powers. Subsection (5) states:<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000328">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        <p>In
other words, no referendum. Subsection (6) goes even further. The third
ground for determining that it is not appropriate to hold a referendum
is simply that the

phrased to allow not only principal local authorities but partner
authorities with an influence over the subject to have grounds for
holding the referendum seems elegant, and it seems a pretty
all-embracing definition. But as the Minister will recognise, that is
unfortunately trumped—to use a word that he used in an earlier

may want to hold a referendum; but it could be told, for reasons that
we do not know—the Minister cannot tell us today in

discussing the reasons that we can give local authorities for saying,

may be other areas, some of which we have debated to an extent, where
we will give local authorities the freedom not to hold a referendum on
a particular subject even if, on the face of it, it complies with
subsection (4), because there are good reasons for discounting it and
not holding it. That is not a prohibition on their doing it; it is
simply allowing them the power to rule something out of

we take that as our working example. A local

Secretary of State has ruled to be not a local issue, could still
decide to say, “We know that it is not a local issue, but we are
going to have a referendum anyway.” The Secretary of State is
putting in place a filter that would potentially allow the local
authority to prevent certain referendums from being held. However, a
local authority, under existing legislation, can decide—it would
not be ultra vires—that notwithstanding the Secretary of

I had said before. If a petition was received, perhaps from a
particular ward, to say that it wanted a referendum on whether a free
school should be set up in the area, and if it was valid and came
before the council, the council could decide that that was a local
issue, and it could have a referendum. If some future Secretary of
State had erected a filter or barrier that said that free schools were
not a local matter, the council could still say, “Fine. It is
not a local matter, but we can still conduct a referendum under
existing legislation, and we intend to do so.” That is
established in the Bill as well. I may

minded to let it go ahead because it did not want the nuclear base in
the area, what regard would it have to take of the Secretary of State,
who would doubtless be advised by the Ministry of Defence to say,
“No, you shouldn’t allow that”? I am slightly

an independent nuclear deterrent but where redundant nuclear submarines
should be decommissioned. They have to be decommissioned somewhere, but
it was a deeply controversial matter. Whenever a proposal was made to
use one of those dockyards or the base for that purpose, opinion was
divided, to say the least, with significant opposition from local
communities. Under the powers in the Bill—the new powers, for

                        <p class="tabbed">It
is not inconceivable in such a situation that a local authority that
tried to proceed with a referendum that was seen as threatening to a
particular commercial interest might use the fact that the Secretary of
State had suggested under subsections (5) and (6) that the issue was
not appropriate for a referendum to challenge the validity of the local
authority’s action. Given the lack of clarity about the
Secretary of State’s use of the powers, it is difficult for us
to judge whether that is a serious risk. However, I am not persuaded
that that will not come into play, and if it does, that poses a serious
challenge to the Minister’s assumption that it will still be all
right for a local authority to proceed with its referendum under
different
powers.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000358">&#160;</a>

helpful contribution. I welcome his satisfaction about the

thousands or hundreds of thousands of pounds into a promotional
campaign to support that view? I ask Labour Members to imagine if
Conservative and independent-controlled Cornwall council used all its
resource to stop environmental groups gaining approval for a wind farm,
by allowing a referendum on a policy to allow no more wind farms. Is
not the reality that local authorities should be independent and

necessary condition. I hope that I am wrong, but the clause seems to
give the local authority a ridiculous head start over any local group
with which it disagrees. It can use its resource to publish and promote
the opinions of the side that it wishes to encourage support for, or of
the opposition to the question to be asked in the referendum. The local
authority should be independent and impartial, and it should stand as

the ability to defend its policy on an issue that is pertinent to the
area. That policy would be determined by the democratic process of
correctly elected local councillors coming to a decision on an issue.

agree with their properly established policy, that local authority

involve itself in the argument and to make its case; I suggest that, as
the Bill stands, the local authority would effectively have the winning
card almost all the time. There seems to be no role for balancing the
resource that community groups would have in comparison with the local
authority. For example, the Bill includes no role for the Electoral
Commission.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000387">&#160;</a>

opportunities for a local authority that might be pushing and looking
slightly over the horizon, at an election around the corner. Such an
authority might well choose to promote, with all its resource, a
particular slant in a referendum, with no safeguards for community

advantage.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000391">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting case which
has undoubted merit: an abuse of power by the local authority would be
inappropriate. Having said that, the local authority might well make
decisions not only as an obligation, for example under the Equalities
Act 2010, but with particular regard to the most vulnerable 
<div class="columnNumber">

be affected, from schools reorganisation through housing to how
resources are committed to care for the elderly. In combination with
legal advice about duties under equalities legislation, the local
authority might make such decisions out of noble motives, determined to
give legitimate priority to the most underprivileged and deprived. All
too often the voice of the powerful is heard and not that of the
powerless, and in the event that the powerful were to trigger a
referendum, surely the local authority should have the right to argue
that it is acting in accordance not only with the requirements of
legislation but with the interests of the

though, his amendment would allow no discretion for local authorities
to publish material for or against any referendum question. They would
be required to remain wholly neutral in any campaign, which would be
right in, for example, the case of a change of governance of the
council and the possible establishment of a mayor. Regulations about
mayoral referendums secure that. However, what does not follow is that
the council should always to be neutral, depending on the referendum.
The hon. Members for Gateshead and for Birmingham, Erdington pointed
out a couple of possibilities. I can supply a
third.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000394">&#160;</a>

group of local people might take the view that nothing should be spent
on libraries and that they should all be shut. The group would get a
petition together that meets the 5% threshold for a referendum. In such
cases, it would be appropriate for the council to provide information
and evidence about the benefits that libraries bring. The amendment
would prevent that. That does not mean that councils should engage in
polemical debate. They should not advance tendentious arguments, and
the statements and arguments that councils make should be
objective.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000395">&#160;</a>

want to reassure my hon. Friend the Member for St Austell and Newquay
that that is all made very clear in the revised code of recommended
practice, on which the Government consulted last year and which we
intend to lay before the House shortly. If Parliament approve the
revised code, councils will be legally obliged to have regard to it. It
provides a framework for any publicity that the council issues in
relation to local referendums, or indeed other matters as well. I would
share his concern if there was a partisan intervention by a council.
There have been several references to the campaign on congestion

referendum on a power that affects its area, but is not at discretion
to use its results—with the imposition of a free school, for
example. When must another pubic body, including a Secretary of State,
have regard to the outcome of a local referendum? That is important,
because it brings into question holding a referendum in the first
place. Referendums are not binding and are for an advisory purpose. If
they concern powers being pursued by a Secretary of State for another
Department, or for the Department for Communities and Local Government
itself, surely their whole purpose is to ensure that the appropriate

                           </strong> Local authorities are required to take account of
the decision; they are not required to obey it. The referendums are
non-binding and are advisory, as the hon. Member for Gateshead has
said. It is entirely up to the council what it does. When an authority
makes a decision that relates to the issue at stake in the referendum,
however, it must have regard to it. In other words, it must consider
the result of the referendum when its reaches its conclusion. Such will
be the effect when a non-binding referendum comes to the council.
Clause 52 aims to ensure that the referendum is not simply put on the

publication on the DCLG website that gives members of the public a
confusing picture. I think the average person would consider that
stating that local authorities will be required to take the outcome
into account is much stronger wording. I do not know whether the
Minister has constituents who take what he says or any Government
Department says to the nth degree of interpretation, but I have at
least one. I can envisage the letters because this person will be
pushing and pushing and pushing to the extent of seeking compensation
if the Government do something that he does not think is clear. There
are people out there who do that. This is on

                           </strong> I apologise for inadvertently speaking too
soon, largely because of the rapid rate of progress that we have been
making recently. It seems perfectly reasonable that there should be
provision for the holding of polls or referendums by parish councils.
Indeed, there are existing provisions for parish polls so there is an
obvious question about the interface between the Bill and the existing
provisions. However, two areas are of particular interest to me. The
one that I was beginning to talk about prematurely was the financial
arrangements. As I am sure Members can understand, this could be very
open-ended indeed. One only has to have a cause that gets taken up by
parish councils all over the country. Let me not be too indelicate in
relation to Government Members, but the future of forestry may be of
very real concern to parishes in many parts of the country, and many
people might feel that their parish council could well hold a
referendum on the future of the forest in their parish or in a
neighbouring area.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000420">&#160;</a>

to be a flood of referendums promoted by parish councils, the call on
resources from the Secretary of State to support them might be quite
substantial. So I would welcome some indication from the Minister as to
how this provision, which looks very open-ended, is to be interpreted
and whether the Government have thought about the basis on which
additional expenditure will be
reimbursed.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000421">&#160;</a>

                        <p>which
does not altogether preclude the possibility that the Secretary of

to a principal authority. I am sure that a number of district councils

they would be expected to meet part of the costs of referendums held by
parish councils in their areas. I hope that this is an unworthy
suspicion on my part and that the Minister can assure me that he has
absolutely no intention of interpreting these words in that
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000425">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend has raised a valid point. Given the
open-endedness of the financial commitment to which I have already
referred, and the scope for referendums on an awful lot of issues that
are relevant to parish councils, the Committee is owed an explanation
as to just what the scope of these payments may be, and how they may be
balanced with those made by the Secretary of State on behalf of the
Government or those arranged by another
party.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000426">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">That
does not end my concerns on this clause, because regulations under

wide-ranging powers. Subsection (2)(a)

assumption—that those are enactments relating to parish
councils. There may be a question as to whether any other statutes or
enactments might be modified under this power, because of the way in
which it is worded. That may cause other authorities or bodies concern.

amendments to statute and to<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000429">&#160;</a>

I think—I may be wrong—that we have some comfort in the
provisions of subsection (1), which
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000433">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>We
probably have a safeguard, because it is not open for the Secretary of
State to use this widely, but there can be overlaps. The Minister will
know that, on the issue of forestry, which I have raised, this is of
concern to district councils, and possibly county councils, as well as
parish councils. The potential overlap of these regulation-making
powers with their effect on other authorities is a matter that we
should probe a little.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000434">&#160;</a>

Greenwich and Woolwich and the hon. Member for Gateshead the assurances
that they seek on this clause. The clause empowers the Secretary of
State to apply the scheme to parish councils, with whatever
modifications are necessary. The range of the Henry VIII
powers—as the right hon. Gentleman has described
them—that subsection (2) sets out, are in respect of the changes
that are necessary to make the provisions applicable to parish
councils.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000436">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Part 3 of
schedule 12 to the Local Government Act 1972 already sets out
arrangements for parish meetings and polls. A parish poll can be
demanded on any question arising at the parish meeting. Under current
rules, a poll can be held if the chairman consents, or if it is
demanded by not less than 10, or one third of the electors present at
the meeting—whichever is less. That threshold is very low. Once
a poll has been triggered, it is carried out by the district council
and the costs are met by the parish. There has been a long-standing
recognition in the town and parish world that a review of those rules
is necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000437">&#160;</a>

years, but we think that it is right to modernise the existing regime
to make it fit for purpose in the modern world. We intend to work with
key partners, such as the National Association of Local Councils, and
the Society of Local Council Clerks—and both have indicated
their willingness to participate—to ensure that the new
arrangements are appropriate, proportionate and flexible, and we intend

payments. His fear was that we were going to somehow screw somebody for
it—which is the technical phrase—but in fact, the
opposite is true. At the moment, there is no direct mechanism for the
Secretary of State to give money to parish councils. The wording
enables there  to be a mechanism—for instance, by
passing funds to

                           </div>district councils for onward transmission. In other words, it gives

                           </strong> Thank you, Mr Chairman. I am looking for a
response from Ministers on two points. First, this power, even by Henry
VIII standards, is one at which Henry VIII himself would have
salivated. It is extraordinary in its breadth; it could essentially be
reworded to say,  “I reserve the power to do what I
want, when I want, wherever I want.” It is extraordinarily
broad, and I draw attention to clause 53(2)(b), which states that
regulations may<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000450">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“amend, repeal
or revoke any
enactment”.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000609">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>Will
the Minister clarify whether that is an enactment under this Bill, or
does it refer to any other Act of Parliament or regulation laid by
Parliament?<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000451">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
legitimate concern has been expressed about parish councils. As we said
earlier, parish councils at their best are admirable institutions. All
of us know excellent examples around the country of parish councils
that do outstanding work. The Minister of State said that research
would be made available to us regarding how many parish council
elections had been contested and other matters. On a separate but
related issue, there has been disclosure of some cost-impact
assessments, which were the subject of an earlier debate. However,
following what the Minister said about the anticipated modest cost, and
given that costs relating to councils and referendums have been
assessed, what is the calculation for parish council
referendums?<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000452">&#160;</a>

                              </span>
                           </strong> The power in the clause is limited to the
purposes of holding polls and referendums by parish councils by clause
53(1). The regulations are also, of course, subject to affirmative
procedure in this House; they have to be approved by a resolution of
both Houses of Parliament. I hope that gives the hon. Member for
Birmingham, Erdington the information he sought.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000453">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Regarding the
variability of parish councils, the hon. Gentleman is right that they
are diverse in size, sophistication and operation. A common feature is
the parish poll provision, and any estimate of cost would have to take
account of savings made by any changes. As I tried to indicate earlier,
both sides are going to depend on the work we are doing with the
National Association of Local Councils and the Society of Local Council
Clerks. It is important to ensure that new arrangements are
appropriate, proportionate and flexible. We intend to consult widely
before making any order under the clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000454">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">When we have
developed a scheme that is fit for purpose and the consultation is
complete, we would be in a position to evaluate the likely range of
costs and savings that would result from dispensing with parish polls.
The reform of parish polls is something which the parish sector,
district councils and others have long pressed, and this is an
opportunity to do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000455">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
the drafting of the clause, the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington
asked whether it was solely confined to the Bill, and it is clearly
not, because the clause refers to the altering of other enactments. The
most obvious and relevant of those would be part 3 of schedule 12 to
the Local Government Act 1972, which sets out the arrangements for
parish meetings and polls. In pursuing reform, it may come to light
that other enactments need to be modified, repealed or revoked, and
whatever the other word was, to create a coherent poll scheme. I trust
that that satisfies the hon. Gentleman. I have discussed the clause
before, and I hope that the Committee is ready to approve
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000456">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> No, that does not answer the points that I raised.

                           </strong> I am grateful, and we will perhaps reserve our
comments until we receive that letter. It may be surprising that quite
so much store has been set by parish councils, given that the research
in question is  19 years old. We look forward eagerly to that
evidence.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000459">&#160;</a>

costs, the Under-Secretary said that there would be savings on parish

they will be partly offset by those savings. What is the likely total

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 432<a class="bkMark" name="Column432">&#160;</a>
                           </div>costs have been worked out to almost the last decimal point, but not in
relation to parish councils. I press the Minister to be clearer on that
and to share with the Committee the work that has been done thus far.
When we discuss savings and costs, what does that
mean?<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000460">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
the light of what the Minister has just said, the
point about enactments is profoundly worrying because, on first
reading, it appeared that we were discussing enactments only within the
Bill. Is it the case that the Secretary of State is
taking the power to set aside any other aspect of statute that is
defined as an enactment, including, for example, obligations under the
Equalities Act
2010?<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000461">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> On the cost issue, the impact assessment will
follow the preparation of a scheme. At the moment, we are simply
opening the door to formal discussions with NALC and others to see how
we might shape that. Until that is done, it is not possible to make a
realistic estimate of savings, because we do not know what elements of
parish polling would be retained. For very small parishes, polls might
still be retained—I am speculating. Until we see that and what
the new regime will be, we cannot make a realistic estimate of the
savings. I understand the hon. Gentleman’s impatience, but he
will have to wait for a scheme, which will emerge in a transparent way,
following discussions with the partners who are most directly
concerned.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000462">&#160;</a>

using an example from Plymouth. The council executive decided to site
an incinerator in Plymouth on the basis of a decision made by the South
West Devon waste partnership. What would happen if local people
subsequently applied for a referendum? As I understand it, the
resolution to allow that referendum must be taken by the full council
rather than the executive who made the original decision, which is
slightly odd. If the referendum takes place at the same time as the
planning application, which the executive has authorised, how does that
work? Surely the planning application would have to be delayed. It is a
strange way for a council to do
business.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000467">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Will the
Minister explain the logic behind this rather curious little clause? It
appears to require any decisions regarding the referendum duties to be
made by the whole council, not by the executive. In the case of the
Greater London authority, decisions would be made 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 433<a class="bkMark" name="Column433">&#160;</a>

understand why a decision on a substantive resolution on one of the
points of principle—how, for example, the council decides to
respond to a petition—should be taken by the whole council. This
chapter, however, contains a whole series of duties. In clause 43, the
first duty is to decide whether a referendum is appropriate. In clause
43(4), another decision must be made over whether it is appropriate to
refer the matter to another authority. Under clause 44, if the local
authority does not intend to hold a referendum it must set out its
grounds for not doing so. Clause 46 contains the administrative
arrangements for holding the referendum. Clause 48 concerns the
decision on the question to be asked in the referendum, and clause 52
deals with the decision about what the local authority will do as a
consequence of the outcome of the referendum.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000470">&#160;</a>

understand the latter decision, and possibly the decision on the
question itself, being matters for the council, but is it really
necessary for the whole council to make a decision on referring the
matter from a district council to another tier of Government? That
obligation appears to be imposed by the clause as it stands. If it is
not, I would welcome clarification. Similarly, the arrangements in
clause 46 for holding a referendum are purely administrative, and
surely they do not require a resolution of the whole council. In the
case of the simple matter of a specific arrangement for a referendum,
that could be
delegated.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000471">&#160;</a>

properly. My concern is that the provisions appear to require all

full council. I argue the devolutionist case. Surely it should be left
to the authority to decide the appropriate way to handle things, except
perhaps with respect to the fundamental outcome—what the
authority will do as a result of the referendum—or at an earlier
stage if it decides not to hold a referendum; I can understand that it
might be regarded as appropriate for that question to go to the whole
council, so that the decision is seen to be made by the whole council
and not just a part of it.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000473">&#160;</a>

handle those matters. I may have got things wrong and misinterpreted

that in the nature of these things, those with local authority service

who found his way here but who was not in a majority group, and I think
it is right that there should be safeguards for minority groups on
councils. One of those safeguards is transparency in decision making on
such issues. Specifically, a single-party executive, which is of course
the norm on majority-controlled authorities, would not provide the
level of openness and transparency that would be given by the capacity
to debate and pass a resolution in a full council of all members, of
all persuasions, elected to that authority. I hope that the right hon.
Gentleman will take in good part the fact that those of us who have

the Bill risks undermining elected councils’ ability to flex
local taxes to meet gaps in funding. It is unlikely that electors will

assume that local authorities are struggling to make cuts, which may
mean that they cannot discharge their functions in an “effective
manner”. If children’s services budgets are slashed by
50%, will an authority be able to run its child protection services, or
services for looked-after children? Will it be able to support children
with special educational needs or disabilities? Will an authority be
discharging its functions effectively if it sets the eligibility
criteria for adult social care at “critical”? It would
mean that all those adults with substantial or moderate care needs
would not receive services. In fact, that is what it used to mean.
Councils, including Birmingham city council, now propose a tighter
criterion for eligibility for “critical personal needs”.
Those new criteria exclude some critical needs.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000498">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Is an
authority discharging its functions effectively if it closes all or
nearly all its libraries? Local authorities have a duty under the
Public Libraries and Museums Act 1964 to provide<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000499">&#160;</a>

                        <p>On Saturday, thousands
of protesters throughout the country made it clear that cuts like those
proposed in Oxfordshire, which wants to cut 20 of its 43 libraries, or
in North Yorkshire, which wants to cut funding to 24 of its 43
libraries, would mean that their authorities were not meeting that
duty.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000500">&#160;</a>

in the Chamber that Ministers from other Departments cause confusion by
what they say about protecting the services for which they are
responsible. They believe that councils are not being effective if they
cut services to the levels that I have mentioned today. The
Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport, the
hon. Member for Wantage (Mr Vaizey), who is responsible for
libraries, said that local authorities have a statutory duty to provide
a comprehensive and efficient library service, and he has written to

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister may tell us that the first test to be applied by the Secretary
of State would to be check whether the authority has got rid of its
chief executive, or cut his or her pay, or merged back-office functions
with another authority. The leader of the Local Government Association,
Margaret Eaton, said recently in an article on the impact of the cuts
on local government budgets
that<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000504">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“the
oft-repeated call of cutting chief executive pay to protect frontline
services will not make the slightest dent in the deficit. Even if every
council chief executive took the pay cuts demanded of them, it would
save no more than 0.05% of the funding shortfall local government faces
in the next
year.”<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000618">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>We
can also say that merging back-office functions will not save enough
money in the short term, and that it will not realise the savings that
many councils have to make.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000505">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The second
situation in which the Secretary of State can direct that referendum
provisions are not to apply is if the authority cannot meet its
financial obligations. The Minister will know that a big cause of
concern among local authorities is how they are to meet the cost of
redundancy. The LGA estimates that 140,000 local authority jobs will be
cut next year. Councils will not be able to meet the capital costs of
those redundancies because the £200 million currently set out by
the Government to meet the cost of redundancy is simply not sufficient.
Indeed, if 140,000 jobs are lost, the sum set out by the Government for
councils to meet the cost amounts to less than £1,500 per
redundancy and that is obviously not sufficient. Many, many staff will
need much bigger payments than
£1,500.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000506">&#160;</a>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
has been estimated that councils may need up to  £2
billion in the next year; 10 times more than the provision made by the
Government. When we discussed this in our debate of 6 December the
Minister, the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst, said
only:<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000507">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Although
I understand that councils will inevitably say they want more,
Government must be realistic and set limits to an exception to the

                        </p>
                        <p>That did
not provide us with the answer to how our councils are to meet their
financial obligations. Since then, we have heard that Manchester city
council is to cut 2,000 jobs and Liverpool city council is to cut 1,500
jobs. Will councils such as those and many others facing very large
redundancy payments have problems meeting their financial obligations?
Will that put them into the situation described in proposed new section
52ZR?<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000508">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
understand that the LGA has made proposals on this, including
flexibility to spread the cost of redundancy over more than one year.

                           </strong> There is one thing about schedule 5 as it stands
that is potentially positive for some communities. I spent a lot of the
break this afternoon in a meeting of the all-party parliamentary group
on coastal erosion and one issue that I have been discussing with
colleagues—particularly the hon. Member for North Norfolk
(Norman Lamb) and other Members who suffer from the problem—is
the idea of a solidarity fund. One option that is exciting people in
communities such as those around the coastline of Norfolk and Suffolk
is the potential, linked to the ability to have a referendum, to allow
councils to have what we would call a levy to tackle that kind of local
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000510">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Will
the Minister clarify—perhaps the ministerial team could look at
this and feed back later—whether, if communities in, for
example, Norfolk and Suffolk, particularly Norfolk, come together and
have a referendum and say that they are happy to have a levy, for want
of a better phrase, it will be possible to put something on the council
tax that is specifically for dealing with coastal erosion and measures
to protect our coastline? Would that, if passed—if it has the
required 5 per cent.—protect the county council from a council
tax referendum because that levy puts it over and above the capping
figure? It seems logical for the Secretary of State to be able to use
his power to waive that right in a beneficial way, and that is where
schedule 5 could benefit communities and allow such a development to
happen. In an area such as Norfolk, we would be very excited about
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000511">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Perhaps it would be convenient, in addressing the
three points raised, to set out briefly the purpose of schedule 5,
which is one of the key elements of this part of the Bill. It is worth
bearing in mind that this is, we submit, a liberalising power for local
authorities. The stark point is that it has always been accepted that
it is legitimate for central Government to put measures in place to
protect council tax payers from what are regarded as excessive council
tax increases. That has been common ground between the Labour party and
the Conservative party. Up to now, that has been achieved by
capping.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000512">&#160;</a>
                        </p>The
effect of schedule 5 is to replace the capping provisions with what we
may term the referendum provisions. That is clearly much more localist;
under the current arrangement, the Secretary of State determines
whether a proposed council tax increase is excessive. He can override
the council—in effect without more ado—albeit by an
extremely complex and elaborate mechanism of designations, in-year
designations, and the consequent arrangements for re-billing and so on.
It is a complex mechanism that has been used on several
occasions—I think, in recent years, 36 authorities have been
capped some 43 times in all—but it effectively means that
central Government make the decision in the person of the Secretary of
State. What we say here is that, rather 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 439<a class="bkMark" name="Column439">&#160;</a>
                        </div>than a Minister being the arbiter of what is an acceptable council tax
rise, the community itself is given the power to
decide.<p class="tabbed">The
effect of the proposed new sections—I will not go through them
all in detail, as much of the gist has not been raised—is to
provide that the Secretary of State has the power to set out
principles. Those are principles whereby which he can determine a limit
of excessiveness, but that excessiveness is only a trigger for a
referendum; it is not the end of the matter any
more.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000513">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
great advantage for councils is that if they believe that they have a
case to put to their electorate that they should set a council tax
increase greater than that set as the trigger by the Secretary of
State, they can do so. Councils cannot do that at the moment. Therefore
the council has the opportunity to make its case to the electorate
about whether it should be allowed to impose a council tax increase
above the trigger limit. That is a much more liberal approach from
central
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000514">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
the electorate decide that that is what they wish to do and that is
their informed choice, they choose to trade a higher level of council
tax for what they perceive to be the benefits put forward by the
council. The council can make a case—which it cannot do at the
moment, as the Secretary of State can act arbitrarily—but more
to the point, the residents who pay the council tax make the ultimate
decision.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000515">&#160;</a>

commenting on levels of service provision—we are now dealing
specifically with a binding referendum relating to the level of council
tax. If the local authority believed—in response to what it
assessed as the view of its electorate—that it had an arguable
case that council tax set above the threshold was required to maintain
certain levels of service, it could act. I think it is legitimate that
local authorities should be the initiators since ultimately they are
legally obliged to set the council tax. However, of course, the people
have the chance to make their case during the referendum campaign. I
think that is the right way
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000519">&#160;</a>

refer to the helpful point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Great

much-derided Henry VIII power can be used benignly and advantageously
to local authorities. One should not always condemn such a power as it
can also be used for a deregulatory purpose.

                        </div>On the
specific point, the Government are sympathetic to the idea that my hon.
Friend the Member for Great Yarmouth raised. The whole thrust of this
part of the Bill is that local voters should decide on the level of
taxation that they pay locally, and I shall happily discuss matters
with him to ensure that there are means whereby that objective, when it
genuinely represents the wishes of residents to pay for a level of
service, can be achieved. I hope that he will accept my undertaking to
look at a means to ensure that that can be done, if the current wording
of the Bill does not already permit it. However, I suspect that we are
in a position where it probably
does.<p class="tabbed">I
wish briefly to refer to the operation of proposed new section 52ZR,
raised by the hon. Members for Gateshead, for Worsley and Eccles South
and for Scunthorpe. It is important to consider that in the context of
where we have been before. The capping principles will have been
announced by a report of the Secretary of State to the House of Commons
and will therefore have been voted on by the House, thus bringing about
extra democratic legitimacy. The provision then permits that, in
certain circumstances, there is, in effect, a reserve power under
proposed new section 52ZR to proposed new section 52ZW to cover
circumstances in which the Secretary of State, by direction, can say
that referendum provisions do not
apply.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000520">&#160;</a>

key matters to bear in mind are, first, the test that the authority
will be unable to discharge its functions. The hon. Member for Worsley
and Eccles South made her argument by citing specific examples of
reductions of spend to specific services. That is not the intention of
the Bill. When local authorities have statutory obligations, they are
obliged under legislation outwith the Bill to meet those statutory
functions. In order to set a lawful budget, they will therefore have to
ensure that they have put forward a budget requirement that enables
them to fulfil such functions. However, the level to which they do so,
how they procure those functions and how they provide them is rightly a
matter for those local
authorities.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000521">&#160;</a>

obligations in respect of redundancy costs. Let us stick with that
point for a minute because it is important. I think that Salford city
council will retain its eligibility criteria at
“moderate”. That is certainly what it is seeking to do. I
gave the example of Birmingham city council, which has not only gone to
“critical” in its eligibility criteria, but past that.

service and those that have restricted it to the absolute minimum. If
the Minister does not mind my saying so, that makes nonsense of what he
is saying, because it cannot be okay for such

such as Birmingham are left at the mercy of those decisions, and I

patronising attitude towards local electors. I am surprised that, with
her experience, she adopts such an attitude. The reality is that her
arguments, although genuine matters of political debate, have nothing
to do with the exercise of the Secretary of State’s reserve
power. That relates to the totality of the authority’s
functions. Within any local authority, legitimate debate can take place
about the priorities that are given to
those.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000527">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
accept that there might be a political case made, with people saying,
“What we have received from central Government is not adequate
to fulfil our functions.” I do not accept that that is the case,
because I believe that the current funding settlement to local
authorities is sufficient for them to deliver their purposes. If it
were the case, however, the answer is not to use the Secretary of
State’s reserve power to avoid the referendum, but to make the
case to local voters in the referendum—to say, “We do not
have enough; if we are to maintain certain levels of service, we need
to put council tax up by more than the threshold level.” The
reserve power is not about that; it is there to deal with real issues
of crisis, which can, I suppose, occur. I hope that they never do, and
that we scarcely ever have to use the power, particularly under this
heading. It is intended to be used only very
seldom.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000528">&#160;</a>

brings me to the second test, which is the authority being unable to
meet its financial obligations. This does not refer to a situation
where there are particular cost items such as redundancy, but the power
would enable the Secretary of State to consider the financial position
of each authority on its merits. It is not intended to be exercised
frequently or readily, but it is quite broad so that it can take on
board those sorts of tests if the need ever arises. In the case of
redundancy costs, for example, where one would expect a local authority
first to look at other means, such as the use of reserves, and
capitalisation applications, a Secretary  of State would have
to be convinced that the authority really had no other financial
remedy. Essentially, the second limb is aimed at such
situations.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000529">&#160;</a>

would he apply his definition of crisis to Birmingham city council
where, as my hon. Friend the Member for Worsley and Eccles South said,
care has been reduced, and is given only to those in the most critical
need; where 43 of the 60 youth projects are being closed down; and
where the city council is cutting the grants to all the advice
services, including the citizens advice bureaux, compelling them all to
close, in whole or in part? Is that a crisis?<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000530">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly, on
redundancy costs, exchanges took  place on Second Reading
regarding the Government’s calculations. As my hon. Friend said,

had allowed a cost of £200 million by way of capitalisation.

second is no. We are applying this test: the obvious example is where
the High Court had been appointed a receiver, with the powers of the
authority, because the authority was unable to service its debt. I will
give two other examples. First, some years ago, during the collapse of
Bank of Credit and Commerce International, the then Western Isles
council effectively went broke, because it had virtually invested the
shop in BCCI. That is the sort of circumstance that one could conceive
of. In my part of the world, London, let us say that Transport for
London, as a transport authority, faced a wholly unexpected disaster
that brought London’s transport to a halt for a period of time,
with a complete collapse in fare box revenue. That is the type of
extreme situation envisaged. It has nothing to do with value judgments
about what individual local authorities adopt.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000532">&#160;</a>

point here for council tax payers of an area whose local authority has
been pushed to the limit because it has to service redundancy payments
to 1,500 or 2,000 employees and has no cash. I do not think
that the Minister is saying that any of our local authorities have
themselves the reserves that are not committed  to other things
for which they have to use the money,

with respect, the hon. Lady misses the point. The proposed new section
will give the Secretary of State a reserve power to remove a referendum
in response to the particular needs of individual authorities, so

particular authority and whether those issues are relevant to it at the

they were complex in his introduction. I must put it to him that they
are not only complex, but very long. The Government just got away with
it: the numbering starts with 52ZA and goes right the way through to

Ministers must make provision to apply this Chapter, amended as
appropriate, to relevant authorities in
Wales.’.<p class="tabbed">There
is something of a dichotomy. The principle of the Localism Bill is to
devolve power to communities and individuals. The Welsh Assembly
Government have sought the powers and framework measures to receive the
power that the Bill conveys on them. Yet, the Welsh Assembly Government
are probably the most centralising Administration in the UK. They have
made it clear that they have no intention of devolving the rights for
referendums and other clauses within the Bill. My constituents are
particularly angry that this power will not be used and devolved to
individuals to challenge local authorities on the increase in council
taxes.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000555">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Welsh
Assembly Government have an extremely centralised planning system;
there has been a huge shift to hypothecated funding; and there is
significant distrust between local authorities and the WAG. As a
result, my constituents are pretty irritated that they will not have
the opportunity, the privileges and rights that the Bill in general
will convey, in particular those related to council tax. There is also
a respect agenda with the UK Government and that is the origin of
clause 57, conveying powers on the Welsh Assembly. That respect agenda
needs to go in more than one way. It obviously goes between the UK
Government and the Welsh Assembly Government and vice versa. It also
needs to be between the Welsh Assembly Government and the electorate.
That is why the amendment has been tabled: to insist that my
constituents will have the right to challenge excessive council tax
increases.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000556">&#160;</a>

been shown by the UK Government, to give the framework powers to the
National Assembly for Wales. The Local Government Minister in Wales has
already said that he has absolutely no plans whatsoever to extend the
right of referendums to individuals in

localism, which is accepted in all parts of the House—we have
debated only the implementation of localism. The centralisation of
power in Wales, in the Welsh Assembly Government and away from local
authorities, undermines the whole thrust of localism, which is
supported by all the political
parties.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000557">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Similar
amendments could have been tabled to other chapters and clauses of the
Bill, but I wanted to champion the issue in connection with council tax
increases for good reason. Over the past 13 years, it is reasonable to
compare the tax increases in the north-east of England with those in
Wales. Wales saw council tax bills increase by 36.8% more than in the
north-east of England, which has a similar demographic and industrial
make-up. The north-east saw council tax increase by 190.6%, but in
Wales the increase was 227.4%. That demonstrates the reason for the
anger and
concern.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000558">&#160;</a>

amendment, therefore, champions my constituents’ concerns about
council tax increases and the lack of a Welsh Assembly Government
policy to follow the clause through in
Wales.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000559">&#160;</a>

sympathise with many of my hon. Friend’s points, but we have the
“respect” agreement and the devolution to the Welsh
Assembly, as well as further down, I hope. With local government
finance matters devolved to Wales, the limit to what we can properly do
as a UK Parliament, under the terms of the devolution settlement, is to
give the Welsh Assembly the means whereby it can, if it wishes, adopt
the same principles as in England and give my hon. Friend’s
council tax payers the same protections as in
England.<a class="bkMark" name="11020960000561">&#160;</a>

legitimate political argument must be made in Wales. We simply enable
the tools for that course to be taken, if he can persuade

the referendum that will take place in a month’s time, having

even further. Of course, with that power, will come
