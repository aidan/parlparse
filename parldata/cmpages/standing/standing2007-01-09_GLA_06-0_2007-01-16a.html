						</b> The clauses that we have before us and the new
clause that we were debating are important components of the Bill. That
part of the Bill is about giving the Mayor more responsibility to
ensure that housing and affordable housing needs in London are
delivered in practice. Currently, the Mayor only has the right to block
things and he should be able to support much-needed major strategic
development in the interests of the capital as a whole. It is important
that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column205" />Column number: 206</div>there are safeguards to ensure that the discussion is focused around
those major strategic applications. I will come on to discuss those
because we have set out the order in an attempt to give effect to that
intention.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Greg Hands</b> (Hammersmith and Fulham) (Con): The Minister
talks about the importance of the clauses in delivering affordable

would she deal with
that?</div>

Cooper:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an important point.
Affordable housing is now so central to London that it will always be
of importance to an elected Mayor. However, affordable housing also has
wider repercussions across the country in terms of the impact on the
London economy and the impact on the wider housing market in other
regions. It is an issue that the Secretary of State would always expect
to be dealt with properly in London and in other regions. Affordable
housing has much wider repercussions.If the hon. Gentleman is
arguing that a future Conservative Mayor would not see affordable
housing as such a priority, shame on such a future Conservative
Mayor&#151;he would certainly struggle to be elected on that
basis.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011712000469"></a>Mr.
Hands:
						</b> No, I am certainly not arguing that. I am arguing
that there may be a scenario in which there was a maverick Mayor who
decided that there should be no affordable housing in London, passed a
London plan accordingly, and intervened in the boroughs to try and
prevent affordable housing from being built. He may then say that he is
able to do so because of the Bill as amended here today and that if
people did not like it, they would have to vote him down in the next
election.

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011712000470"></a>Yvette
Cooper:
						</b> I should inform the hon. Gentleman that to achieve
such a scenario, there would have to be, if not a Conservative Mayor,
some kind of maverick right-wing Mayor who was hostile to affordable
housing. There would also, in fact, have to be a Conservative or
right-wing Government in place who were hostile to affordable housing.
We have made clear the importance of affordable housing within the
national policy framework and the planning policies that need to be
picked up as part of the London plan. Therefore, under the current
policy framework, it would simply be impossible to produce a London
plan that could pass the planning process and that did not take
seriously the needs of Londoners for housing, including affordable and
social housing. That is the policy framework in which we
operate.</div>

(Lab): I hate to criticise my hon. Friend, but I support the
hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham because the scenario is perhaps
not as unlikely as she is making out; in fact the new Conservative
council in Hammersmith and Fulham is doing exactly that. It has a

McDonagh</b> (Mitcham and Morden) (Lab): Our debate on
affordable housing ignited my interest in my own borough of Merton
where a Conservative group is now in power with no overall control. I
had a phone call from the leader of the Labour group only an hour ago
who explained to me that currently Presentation housing association is
considering suing the council as a result of the Conservative
group&#146;s decision not to pursue a scheme on which it had already
spent quite a large sum of money. As a result of the sitting of the
overview and scrutiny panel last night, some cases where the
Conservative councillors were trying to get rid of affordable housing
will now be referred to the Standards Board. It would seem that there
may be a pattern here. It may not just be afflicting trendy west
London, but also quieter south London.</div>

Cooper:
						</b> My hon. Friend makes an important point. I do not
know the circumstances of the individual case and obviously there are
limitations on the ability of Ministers to comment on individual cases
that may be going through the panel or the standards procedures.
However, I am aware from reports that have come to us via the Housing
Corporation, which we have asked to look into the current provision of
social housing in London, that Merton has been considering adopting a
policy that identifies particular areas where it does not believe that
there should be additional social housing. Mitcham, for example, is
considered an area where no social housing should be built. Concerns
have also been raised about the approach from Hammersmith and Fulham
council, which my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton and
Shepherd's Bush has mentioned, and Barnet council
too.</div>

							<b class="B">Ms
Karen Buck</b> (Regent's Park and Kensington, North) (Lab):
Further to the points that were being made by Opposition Members on
this very matter, I checked the figures for affordable housing
provision for some of those boroughs and discovered that Barnet, which
the hon. Member for Surrey Heath cited in aid of his argument, produced
only 8 per cent. affordable housing as against the Mayor&#146;s
preferred target of 50 per cent. My own borough of Westminster produced
only 11 per cent.</div>

							<a name="07011712000478"></a>Yvette
Cooper:
						</b> My hon. Friend makes an important point. Certainly
some of the figures that I have picked up included Bromley, which in
2004-05 delivered 14 per cent. affordable housing. The Committee will
be aware that I previously quoted the example of Wandsworth, which in
2005-06 seems to be delivering only nine social homes as supported by
the Housing Corporation. In an area as large as Wandsworth that clearly
raises some concerns.</div>

							<b class="B">Michael
Gove</b> (Surrey Heath) (Con): I entirely share the hon.
Lady&#146;s concern about the lack of provisionof social
housing. Perhaps she could remind the Committee what the figures are
for the delivery of social housing overall nationally since 1997. Is it
not the case that in every year since 1997, the Government have
presided over fewer social housing completions than the preceding 10
Conservative
years?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011712000480"></a>Yvette
Cooper:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman should be rather cautious about
calling on the experience of the early &#146;90s as the defence of
Conservative housing policy. He is certainly right to say that there
was a period in the early &#146;90s when it was rather cheaper to buy
back social housing than it was more recently. The previous Government
and the housing associations decided that in order to step into what
was an extremely shaky housing market, it might be wise to start buying
properties that developers were unable to sell because the housing
market had gone into freefall. We had a devastating housing market
crash and a collapse in land values, triggered by the economic
management of the previous Conservative Government. He will appreciate
that we would not want to follow that approach to bringing down the
costs of delivering more affordable
housing.</div>

							<a name="07011712000481"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for taking us down
memory lane once more. There are two important points to make. First, I
was talking about the completion of new houses, whereas she was talking
about an entirely different process. Secondly, we all agree that there
was a period of economic turbulence in the early &#146;90s, but that
period came about because of our entry into the exchange rate
mechanism.</div>

							<a name="07011712000483"></a>Yvette
Cooper:
						</b> I would point the hon. Member for Surrey Heath to
some of the interest rate decisions and economic management decisions
that were made in the late &#146;80s, in advance of the exchange rate
mechanism, as being contributory factors. Either way, we are agreed
that the economic policy of the previous Conservative Government threw
the housing market into freefall and had a devastating
impact.</div>
					<a name="07011712000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The hon.
Gentleman raised a wider issue about overall house building and housing
delivery. He tried to claim that the Conservative boroughs in London
were doing well. It is certainly true that Wandsworth, Bromley and
Westminster have done better on overall housing than some other
boroughs, although they have done relatively badly on affordable
housing. Kensington and Chelsea delivered 43 per cent. of its housing
target, while Barnet 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column208" />Column number: 209</div>managed 86 per cent. and Redbridge managed only19 per cent.
Before the hon. Gentleman tries to parade the Conservative boroughs, he
should accept that there is a mixed picture among the London boroughs
and that many of his Conservative colleagues are not quite as
enthusiastic about additional housing as he might like them to be.
Indeed, his colleagues on the Conservative Benches are not as
enthusiastic about additional housing as he might wish them to
be.</div>

2003-04 and 2004-05, the boroughs with the weakest performance were
Waltham Forest, with 45 per cent., Merton, with 54 per cent., and
Lewisham, with 55 per cent. Those three boroughs at the bottom of the
league&#151;the Partick Thistle, the Greenock Morton and the Gretna,

Brake</b> (Carshalton and Wallington) (LD):
						The Minister is illustrating the point that it is
risky to cite individual examples. The hon. Member for Ealing, Acton
and Shepherd&#146;s Bush was the leader for Hammersmith and Fulham,
although he does not frequently mention his constituency in his
interventions. He referred to Islington, which has not sold land at nil
value, as Hammersmith and Fulham did when he was the leader, but which
has occasionally sold land at market value, so as to get capital
receipts that can then be spent on new schools, for instance. When the
Minister deals with individual cases, it is important that she should
compare apples with

wish to explain to the hon. Lady that in the &#146;80s and early
&#146;90s, when I used to advise Gosteleradio, the state television

have discussed many times. My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North
was entreating me to speed up and put matters to the vote, so I will
try to accelerate, although I cannot resist the opportunity to respond
to the hon. Member for Surrey Heath, who asked a series of wider
questions about attitudes towards development. As he said, he wants to
champion his party&#146;s credentials in favour of development.
However, such matters involve not only the boroughs, but the attitude
of MPs towards
development.</div>
					<a name="07011712000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
certainly not criticise Conservative MPs who oppose individual planning
applications that may be badly designed or inappropriately sited, and I
am sure that the hon. Gentleman may have taken such action in his
constituency, but several of his hon. Friends&#151;not only those on
the Back Benches, but those in London&#151;are opposing increased
housing overall, especially the shadow Chief Secretary, who has said
that suburbs such as Barnet are under attack from the Deputy Prime
Minister&#146;s excessive targets for new house building. Moreover,
the shadow Minister for London has complained about over-development in
Beckenham.</div>
					<a name="07011712000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Surrey Heath challenged me to come up with a single
incidence of the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron)
arguing against increased housing. I could not resist the temptation to
draw the hon. Gentleman&#146;s attention to the words of his right
hon. Friend, who said:</div>

hon. Gentleman not raised such matters. However, I am happy to furnish
him with a copy of the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s election
manifesto, in which he made those claims. The purpose behind the Bill
is to ensure that the overall strategic issues behind the London plan
can be delivered, regardless of the politics of individual boroughs or
MPs.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column210" />Column number: 211</div>
					<a name="07011712000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 30 deals with local
development schemes, which set out what issues the borough will address
and what the time scale will be. That will not include the content of
the plan, which is an important point, because the clause allows the
Mayor to direct the boroughs on what should be in their work programme.
For example, if a borough is not planning a strategy on waste, it might
be reasonable&#151;given the city&#146;s difficulties in dealing
with waste and its importance under the London plan&#151;for the
Mayor to consider directing a borough to include a waste document in
its planning scheme or to draw up a waste
strategy.</div>
					<a name="07011712000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
will not allow the Mayor to draw up a waste strategy for the borough;
it will simply allow him to direct that the borough should include a
waste strategy in its planning
process.</div>
					<a name="07011712000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
hon. Member for Surrey Heath argued that the mayoral power of direction
duplicates the Secretary of State&#146;s power of direction. I do not
think so. Without the power, the Mayor would have to ask the Secretary
of State to intervene on his behalf to deliver the London plan, and
things would become more bureaucratic and duplicative. The Government
want to devolve to the Mayor and to remove the need for the Secretary
of State to intervene in regional issues. The Secretary of State will
still be able to direct on national policy issues, but regional issues
should be a matter for the
Mayor.</div>
					<a name="07011712000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsections (2)
to (7) of new clause 12 would remove the requirement for borough
unitary development plans to be in general conformity with the spatial
development strategy and replace it with a requirement for them to have
regard to it. In practice, the change would apply to the old system of
unitary development plans, so it would not have much effect as we are
replacing those with local development frameworks. However, I shall
address the intention behind the new clause rather than its practical
effect.</div>
					<a name="07011712000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
think that the new clause does not take the right approach. The
requirement for general conformity has been part of the planning system
for many years, stretching back well before the Greater London
Authority Act 1999. The new clause would effectively reduce the
boroughs&#146; requirement to look beyond their borders and do their
part in meeting new housing and other development challenges faced by
London and the
country.</div>

					<a name="07011712000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a difference between
conformity and general conformity. General conformity does not mean
slavish adherence to individual details of the plan. Only where a

significant harm to the London plan&#146;s implementation should it
be considered not in general conformity. The fact that a borough plan
is inconsistent with one or more of the plan&#146;s detailed
policies, either directly or by omission, does not necessarily mean
that it is not in general conformity. The test is how significant the
inconsistency is to overall delivery of the London

than &#147;general conformity&#148;. Clearly, judgments must be
made about the strength of the relationship for different aspects of
the Bill, the planning process and other development processes. We
think that &#147;general conformity&#148; captures the relationship
that ought to exist between individual borough plans and the London

strengthen its position. Now we are told that that is a rather weaker

that it is right that the Mayor should have regard for the

of &#147;consistency&#148;. There is a series of variables that we

					<a name="07011712000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 12(8) would remove
the power of the Mayor to refuse a planning application that was
contrary to the London plan. It would not be right to remove that
power, which is about dealing with major strategic planning
applications. However, the issue goes to the heart of the disagreement
between us. There are some strategic issues that affect London as a
whole, over which it is important that we take a London-wide view. The
decisions of an individual borough can have an impact not only on
neighbouring boroughs, but on the city as a whole, its housing market
and its prosperity. On that basis, it is right that the Mayor should
continue to have the power to direct that planning applications be
turned

					<a name="07011712000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the past six years, the

three per year. That number is out of an average of about 90,000
planning applications per year. I calculate that0.003 per
cent. of planning applications in London are so directed by the Mayor.
I am sure that a correction will flutter its way toward me if I have
miscalculated my percentages, but 0.003 per cent. seems like a small
proportion of planning applications. Therefore, it is right that the
Mayor continues to have the power of
direction.</div>
					<a name="07011712000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 31
introduces a parallel positive power. The Mayor currently has the power
to block applications&#151;what are effectively negative,
anti-development powers, which can stop things that are important to
the London plan. Those powers should be balanced bythe ability
to support things that are important to the London plan, as against
taking an unbalanced, anti-development
approach.</div>

negative powers mean that about 300 cases a year are over the size
threshold. That is about 0.3 per cent of cases&#151;less than 1 per
cent. of cases. The Mayor has on average used his powers of direction
on three cases a year, because the fact that a case is above the
threshold does not mean that it is necessarily an appropriate one for
intervention. We are also applying the same threshold to the positive
powers on housing, retail and commercial development. We are changing
the thresholds on waste, and I hope that hon. Members will support our

Cooper:
						</b> I do not have the detailed figures to hand. I am
happy to provide the hon. Gentleman with them, if he so chooses. He
raises the kind of issue that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column215" />Column number: 216</div>we can discuss as part of the consultation on the order. As I said, we
are applying the same thresholds to the positive powers on housing,
retail and commercial development. That means that we would not expect
any additional cases in those categories to be referred to the Mayor or
to be passing the thresholds as a result of introducing these new
powers. We are talking not about an increase in the number of cases
referred to the Mayor but about continuing with the existing
thresholds. All of those cases will currently be passing the
thresholds, so we are not causing an
increase.</div>
					<a name="07011712000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
changing the thresholds on waste and our approach on casinos and bus
depots, and there are specific reasons for our doing so in each case.
The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington made a specific point
about casinos. He will be aware that the decision to issue a
casino&#146;s premises licence still rests with the London borough,
as the licensing authority. It would not be possible for the Mayor to
give the go-ahead to a casino and for a casino to start running in a
borough that did not want one, because the borough retains the ability
to license the casino in the first place.</div>
					
					<a name="07011712000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011712000520"></a>Mr.
Hands:
						</b> I think that the Minister omitted tram stops and
depots. Can she confirm whether they are included, as that is of
particular interest in west London, given the Mayor&#146;s
controversial proposal for a west London
tram?</div>
					
					<a name="07011712000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011712000521"></a>Yvette
Cooper:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman will have seen the wording of
the draft Town and Country Planning (Mayor of London) Order 2007. We
have added the specific reference to bus depots, because the Mayor has
a concern that bus depots might be under pressure from housing or
retail development and they are desperately needed to provide for the
increase in buses and transport in the capital. If I may, I shall wait
for the detailed clarification on trams to spring into my mind. As the
hon. Gentleman will know, the order is not specifically being debated
in this Committee. We will consult more widely on it, and I am happy to
get back to him on that
matter.</div>
					<a name="07011712000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">I return to
the core issue of the number of cases to be decided by the Mayor. We
are not increasing the number of cases that will pass the threshold. We
are making it clear that there are additional tests in the order. The
Mayor will need to demonstrate that a development
is</div>
					<a name="07011712000416"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;of such a nature or
scale that there would be a significant impact on the implementation of
the spatial development
strategy.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011712000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">He must also
take into account how far the council is delivering on the
&#147;relevant targets&#148;. &#147;Relevant&#148; is
important, because if the application were a housing application and
the borough were meeting its housing target, that would be something
that one would expect the Mayor to take into account&#151;rather than
him simply saying that there were grounds for intervention because the
borough was not meeting its waste targets, for example. If a borough is
delivering well on both affordable and overall housing, the application
may be less significant to the London plan than if the borough is
persistently failing to deliver the homes that are needed. That is the
kind of territory around which the Mayor will need to make the
case.</div>

							<a name="07011712000522"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> On Second Reading, the Minister said that the Mayor
would be able to exercise his powers only over planning applications
that went to the heart of the London plan, whereas in the order a new
form of words is used that covers applications with a
&#147;significant impact.&#148; As we all know, going to the heart
of the London plan would mean tearing it apart, or propping it up.
Significant impact is a lesser threshold. Will the Minister say why the
threshold was weakened between Second Reading and the
order?</div>
					
					<a name="07011712000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011712000523"></a>Yvette
Cooper:
						</b> As the hon. Gentleman will know, we have consulted
extensively across and beyond London on a series of different possible
tests, and we will consult further as part of the order. We are
attempting to find a workable form of words that will allow some kind
of clarity for developers, for the boroughs and for the Mayor as well.
We are open to responses during the consultation, and we shall continue
to consider. For example, we looked at whether there should be a
geographic test&#151;that was one of the issues on which we consulted
as part of the earlier review. I think that there are still significant
merits to that test, but London First argued that it would lead to
greater uncertainty, and it was uneasy about it. Nevertheless, we will
listen to the consultation response. Our clear intention is for the
Mayor to decide on a small handful of cases&#151;the same as for the
negative powers, and the order should properly support that. The cases
should be the right ones, and the right strategic focus should be
delivered, but we shall continue to listen. After representations from
London Councils and from London First, we have also changed the process
so that the Mayor does not take over cases at the beginning, and can
intervene only after the borough has dealt with the case in the normal
way.</div>
					<a name="07011712000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Carshalton and Wallington asked some questions on the schedule, and
there was an issue about whether category 3B included a wider category
of cases. The provision simply transposes the thresholds and categories
that were in place for the negative power. I recognise the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point, and I do not want the order to end up
covering cases in which&#151;simply coincidentally&#151;there is a
development in the same area as one that is completely unrelated yet
happens to have occurred in the previous five years. The hon. Gentleman
will appreciate, however, that there are also cases in which the
planning applications for major developments are submitted in phases.
Individual applications concentrate on a section of the plan, but the
overall development may be extremely significant, so that overall
strategic importance needs to be considered.</div>
					<a name="07011712000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We believe
that the existing definition of negative powers has not caused problems
and we are therefore inclined to retain it, particularly as people are
used to working with it, but I have asked officials to consider that
and examine the cases that are emerging in practice. I am happy to
examine further representations from boroughs if problems are being
caused in
practice.</div>
					<a name="07011712000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington also asked some broader
questions about the schedules. May I say to hon. Members that as far as
possible we have replicated the criteria for the negative powers,
because that allows for consistency and a simple standard, and tends to
simplify the planning process? However, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column217" />Column number: 218</div>we recognise that in some areas the categories have been designed around
the negative powers and therefore might not apply as appropriately to
the positive ones. So we envisage certain adjustments and changes and
will listen to the consultation responses to ensure that we give best
effect to our policy intention, rather than produce confusing or
perverse consequences owing to the way in which we have replicated the
approach to the negative
powers.</div>

					<a name="07011712000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members
asked about propriety, which is important. The Mayor will indeed be an
individual decision maker and we have made it clear that he cannot
delegate his powers to someone else if, for example, he has a conflict
of interest, financial interest or development conflict. He will be the
decision maker in the same way as a Secretary of State, but there will
be some applications on which he should not and cannot make a decision,
such as those on certain Olympic developments because he has clearly
championed the Olympics. That is one of the reasons that the Olympic
Development Agency&#146;s powers will not be one of the areas in
which he can take control of decision making&#151;clearly he cannot
play both roles. That is
important.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011712000524"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way and for
that clarification. As well as championing the Olympics, the Mayor has
championed tall buildings. Yet the Bill contains a provision for him to
intervene on planning applications for buildings more than 30 m
high&#151;10 storeys. If the Mayor cannot intervene in Olympic
planning applications because he has, in technical terms, a
predetermined view, why on earth should he be given the freedom to
interfere in tall building applications when he has, in planning terms,
an explicitly predetermined
view?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011712000525"></a>Yvette
Cooper:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman will be aware that the process
contains a series of safeguards, which I shall spell out to Opposition
Members. It is important that decisions be taken fairly, that people do
not take them on matters in which they have a personal or financial
interest, where they have not considered all the evidence or where they
could be said to have prejudged the application. In the current
process, those safeguards apply to planning committees and the
Secretary of State and are in common law as well as codes of
practice&#151;they are not in primary legislation. The Mayor must
abide by that common law in precisely the same way as Secretaries of
State and planning committees. He must also have a clear code of
practice to ensure transparency in the way in which he
operates.</div>
					
					<a name="07011712000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011712000526"></a>Mr.
Hands:
						</b>
						 But if those safeguards are so
strong&#151;from what the Minister says, they sound very
strong&#151;why is it still necessary to exempt the Olympics? My hon.
Friend the Member for Surrey Heath asked about the difference between
predetermination in Olympic applications and those for tall
buildings.</div>
					
					<a name="07011712000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011712000527"></a>Yvette
Cooper:
						</b> The issue around the Olympics is that there is no
need to include it. We did not make a specific decision that, because
of the Olympics and propriety issues, we need additional safeguards or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column218" />Column number: 219</div>consideration. We do not think that there is any need to include the
Olympics because, given the Mayor&#146;s championing role, he should
not be taking those decisions. There is a series of reasons for that. I
do not think that it is about providing extra special
protection&#151;there is simply no need for the Mayor to have that
role. Obviously, he will have to take his own decisions to ensure that
in other cases where he is playing the role of champion he should not
take over the planning application process and go against those common
law safeguards, which will be in his code of conduct as well. Whether
that prevents him from taking over policy issues is a different matter
because, for example, the Secretary of State could be said to champion
issues such as the green belt, zero-carbon homes and so on. Nobody
argues that because the Secretary of State has championed those
policies it is inappropriate for him to be the decision maker in an
appeal. That is the difference in practice.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011712000528"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> Will the Minister help me? I have been following
her argument carefully and I understand what she is saying, but I am
concerned about a practical matter. She said earlier that the Mayor
would not be able to delegate his planning powers. I agree that,
equally, there are certain circumstances in which on the face of it,
applications that pass the test and should be determined by the Mayor,
should not be, because of the championing role. But who then would take
the decision? Would it go upwards to the Secretary of State or should
somebody else deal with it? The Mayor has no junior
Minister.</div>
					
					<a name="07011712000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011712000529"></a>Yvette
Cooper:
						</b> Indeed, so the borough would take the decision
unless the Secretary of State called it in for some reason. The issue
is simply about the Mayor having to choose under which circumstances he
can exercise the powers that the Bill specifies. The Bill does not
simply operate as a constraint on the cases in which the Mayor can
intervene; there is also the common law and issues about
propriety.</div>
					<a name="07011712000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon.
Members have raised questions about the Mayor taking decisions on his
own. We must recognise that Secretaries of State are individual
decision makers, and that they can take decisions on their own, in the
bath or while shaving, as the hon. Member for Surrey Heath suggested. I
caution hon. Members about the idea of having to take the decision in
public, because we could end up with an awful lot of people having a
boring time while the Mayor sits and ponders matters. Important issues
have been raised about whether evidence should be heard in public.
There is no substantial issue in principle about the Mayor being an
individual decision maker, however, as those provisions exist in our
current system.</div>
					<a name="07011712000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Mayor would not be able to take over an application on the basis of
small concerns about section 106 disagreements; any takeover would have
to be on the basis of an application&#146;s significant impact on the
London plan. It would be hard to argue that a limited section 106
disagreement had a significant impact on the London plan. That is the
crux of the decision making. The resources from the section 106
agreement would go to the organisations responsible for providing those
services, just as they do normally.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column219" />Column number: 220</div>
					<a name="07011712000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is sensible to provide for a
positive power that matches the negative power. It will apply only to a
small number of cases, and we will continue to consult on the order and
how we ensure that we get the details right. The provision will help
with the delivery of the London plan, which is important, and it will
allow a sensible, strategic approach to an important capital city that
requires good planning for its economy and its housing
market.</div>

						</b> We believe that the legislation is compatible with
the Human Rights Act, and one of us has signed a declaration to that
effect. The hon. Gentleman knows that there is an obligation on every
public body to interpret the legislation in compliance with the Act,
too. There are some interesting issues about being able to hear
evidence in public, and the taking of the decision in public may be
impractical. We do not require the Secretary of State to take her
decisions in public, with people sitting around her as she does so. The
legislation before us complies with the Human Rights Act, and all
powers would need to be exercised in compliance with
it.</div>

							<a name="07011712000532"></a>Mr.

Cooper:
						</b> If the current Mayor wants a load of people with
him as he pores over documents, he is welcome to do so. We are cautious
about requiring it in legislation, but it is important to provide
transparency of process. I am not sure how much transparency there is
in sitting in a room and watching someone&#146;s face twitch while
they read particular pages of a document. That is slightly different
from a public committee. Nevertheless, the Mayor will have some scope
to choose how he interprets certain aspects of the Bill. With that, I
urge hon. Members to allow the clauses to stand part of the Bill, and
to reject new clause
12.</div>

							<a name="07011712000534"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship
again, Mr. O&#146;Hara. I begin by giving notice to the
Committee that we would like to press new clause 12 to a Division at
the appropriate moment later in the Committee&#146;s proceedings. I
would also like to give notice that we are disappointed that the
Minister, after the force of logic deployed earlier in the debate,
still feels that she has to stand by the clauses and has not recognised
how poorly drafted they were by those whom she charged with that
duty.</div>
					<a name="07011712000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
mention three things in emphasising why we feel that it is important to
insist that the clauses be removed. First, I congratulate the Minister
on noting that the hon. Member for Ealing, North had managed, in the
debate this morning, to mention seven members of the Aberdeen football
team who won the European Cup Winners Cup in 1983. She pointed out that
he still had four to name. I have to correct her on a point of
fact&#151;it is always painful for me to do so. There are in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column220" />Column number: 221</div>fact five whom the hon. Gentleman still has to name because, as she will
be aware, there was a late substitution that materially affected the
result of that football
match.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011712000535"></a>Stephen
Pound:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is defending his position much
in the style of Neale Cooper. Does he realise, in using the tactics of
Eric Black and Peter Weir and being slightly more aggressive, that he
should actually be retrenching rather than attacking? Done
it!</div>
					
					<a name="07011712000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011712000536"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> Like me, Mr. O&#146;Hara, you will be
delighted to know that the hon. Gentleman has managed to write himself
into the history books by managing to mention in the course of one
day&#146;s debate on the Greater London Authority Bill all 12 members
of that winning team. For the consideration of the Committee, I have
produced a research paper on what happened to every member of the team.
I shall not go into those matters now, but I would be happy to share it
with hon. Members
afterwards.</div>
					<a name="07011712000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
raise two points briefly. The first is the Maginot line argument, and
the second is the &#147;Minister falling at the first hurdle&#148;
argument. In the order that has been laid for our consideration as part
of the clauses, the Government have gone into some detail as to what
might be termed a strategic application. Indeed, several of the
categories mentioned would seem to anyone to qualify as strategic:
aircraft runways, heliports, railway or tram stations crossing over or
under the River Thames. All of us would acknowledge that those were
strategic. It therefore seems as though a defence has been created in
the order against the arbitrary exercise of mayoral powers&#151;that
we have an effective defensive line, as it
were.</div>
					<a name="07011712000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem, as
we all know, is that one can always move around defensive lines. The
Maginot line can be outflanked. The Ardennes in this Bill, as it
were&#151;the area that is thickly wooded but can be penetrated by a
determined attacker&#151;is in article 8 of the order, which states
that</div>
					<a name="07011712000131"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the Mayor may
... if he considers that any of the issues raised by the
development&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011712000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">would
have</div>
					<a name="07011712000133"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a significant
impact on the implementation of the spatial development
strategy&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07011712000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						determine
that planning application. The Mayor can say, &#147;Well, it may not
meet any of the criteria&#148;&#151;so carefully laid down by the
Government in their order&#151;&#147;but I believe that it will
have a significant
impact.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011712000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Minister has conceded, &#147;a significant impact&#148; is a lesser
threshold than going to the heart of the London plan or the spatial
development strategy, which is the test that she introduced on Second
Reading. Despite the fact that she insists that she does not always
agree with the Mayor, the Mayor&#146;s desire to have more planning
powers has been acceded to by the fact that we already have a weaker
order than we were promised on Second
Reading.</div>
					<a name="07011712000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						What
does that mean in practical terms? I mentioned this morning a
development in Commerce road in Hounslow that the Mayor took a view
on&#151;a negative view, as it happens. That development could have
been 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column221" />Column number: 222</div>decided in one of two ways, depending on the interpretation of the
London plan. The Mayor said that the development deserved to go ahead
because it fitted with the London plan&#146;s requirement for more
affordable housing. Many of us might choose to agree with him. However,
in supporting that planning proposal, he undermined another part of the
London plan, which is the requirement for strategic employment land to
be made available in that part of London. There were two irreconcilable
aspects of the London
plan.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07011712000431"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div>
					<a name="07011712000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">There will be
many planning applications and many areas of potential development
where an irreconcilable balance between aspects of the London plan may
arise, and the Mayor will be able to decide which aspect he considers
likely to have a significant impact on the London plan. The licence for
him to intervene will be considerably greater than a casual reading of
the order would lead us to believe. In that respect, we simply cannot
support a transfer to the Mayor of powers that would give him the
opportunity to interfere in a significantly greater number of planning
applications than that on which he has already chosen to express an
opinion. We rehearsed at length this morning the reason why the Mayor
might wish to interfere in planning
applications.</div>
					<a name="07011712000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
dealt with the Maginot line, I want briefly to discuss falling at the
first hurdle. These comments relate to the Minister&#146;s admission
during her remarks on the Olympics and tall buildings, when she got
herself into an uncharacteristic fankle. For the benefit of the hon.
Member for Ealing, North, &#147;fankle&#148; is an old Scots word
that manages to combine both tangle and twist, but with a particularly
parochially appropriate and alliterative
power.</div>
					<a name="07011712000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
Minister got herself in a tangle and a twist, much as I almost did in
that etymological diversion, on the question of the Olympics and tall
buildings. She said that the Olympics&#151;and, for that matter, the
Thames Gateway development, but particularly the Olympics&#151;were
taken out of the order because the Mayor has a view on them; he is a
champion of the Olympics and we cannot have him interfering there. But
we can have him interfering in all sorts of other areas where he has a
predetermined view. The Minister cannot have it both ways. Either the
Olympics can be included because we can trust the Mayor to deal with
them&#151;the Minister mentioned common law and other
guarantees&#151;or it cannot be included if we cannot trust him.
Indeed, this Mayor or a future Mayor cannot be trusted if they have
expressed an
opinion.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011712000537"></a>Yvette
Cooper:
						</b> Does the hon. Gentleman recognise that the
Olympics and the ODA refer to specific sites, whereas policies on tall
buildings, zero-carbon buildings and affordable housing apply across
London as a whole? Those policies affect the city as a whole, as
opposed to something that affects individual sites, which was the issue
that he raised at the beginning, and the provenance of the
ODA.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011712000538"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> I fear that the Minister probably is not as familiar
with the order as she should be, because if she were aware of precisely
how tall buildings are dealt with in it and in the pre-existing one,
she would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column222" />Column number: 223</div>recognise that tall building legislation does apply to specific sites:
those that are adjacent to the Thames and those that are in the City of
London. The order is geographically specific, and it includes other
details.</div>
					<a name="07011712000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I take the
Minister&#146;s point, but her Department has a generalised policy
on, for example, zero-carbon development, and the Secretary of State
exercises his or her power on specific planning applications within
that framework. The Minister introduced the Olympic exception, as it
will become known hereafter, so she is the person who has erected the
hurdle, and she is the person who will fall at it. We cannot allow the
clauses to become part of the Bill when they have such a weakly defined
and contradictory order as their basis, and that is why I reluctantly

applications shall be made in public after public oral representations

					<a name="07011712000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
amendment relates heavily to the debate that we have just had, and to
an extent some of the arguments were pre-empted by the Minister in her
summing-up. I do not think that there is any shame in the Minister
having done so, because the amendment is so intimately involved with
that debate and discussion. The purpose 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column223" />Column number: 224</div>of the amendment is simply to ensure that the exercise of the
Mayor&#146;s planning powers is put on a statutory footing when it
comes to the question of public consultation. In the previous debate we
rehearsed the way in which the Mayor&#151;apart from the Secretary of
State, who exercises a unique power&#151;is a one-man or one-woman
planning authority.</div>
					<a name="07011712000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The case for public involvement
in the process of the Mayor deliberating on planning applications has
already been conceded in principle in the order that relates to the
Mayor&#146;s exercise of positive planning powers. The Minister has
acknowledged that it would be perfectly possible for the Mayor, if he
wished, to shape a public hearing after he had received an application
from the individual or from the developer who was pushing a planning
application or from the borough that was or had been responsible for
deciding it. In certain circumstances, we already have a procedure to
allow the Mayor to give his deliberations in public and to receive
evidence in public. Unfortunately, the provision in the order allows
the Mayor to decide the scope of the tribunal or hearing. It seems to
us that our amendment would put on a statutory footing the requirement
that we would set out not for the Mayor, but for all time through this
House for the way that such a public hearing should take
place.</div>
					<a name="07011712000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Government believe that it is important on such a matter&#151;they
clearly do, given the detail into which they have gone in the
order&#151;to lay down centrally what a strategic planning
application might be, for example, how much more important is it for
Government to lay down how the Mayor should exercise those powers in
public rather than leaving it for this Mayor or a future Mayor to
decide on a matter of whim how he might seek to do so? When the
Minister was discussing the exercise of those powers in public, she
made it seem almost as though we were being invited to vote for some
sort of return to ancient Greece, where the citizens of London would
gaze on the Mayor&#151;as though, like Socrates, he would sit there
with one fist underneath his chin as he deliberated on the planning
applications&#151;waiting, waiting, waiting until he delivered
himself of his view. The truth, however, is that what we would require
and what the amendment seeks to promote is a means whereby the Mayor
would have to justify in public the decision to which he came, to
publish in public the papers that govern that decision, to take
evidence in public from those who had a material interest and to ensure
a greater degree of transparency.</div>
					<a name="07011712000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should say that that
initiative, far from being the quixotic view of those on the
Conservative Benches, is soundly based on the Greater London
assembly&#146;s report on planning, &#147;Behind Closed
Doors&#148;, which I earlier commended to the Committee. If the
Minister feels that for any reason the amendment is not drafted
precisely as she would like, I will make her an offer. If she wishes to
come up with an appropriate new clause either in the course of this
Committee or on Report with a means of putting on a statutory footing
how the Mayor should decide those applications, we are more than
willing to meet her to discuss that. It seems that to leave the
decision entirely to the Mayor in the order, which is pendant on our
discussions, is to leave in the hands of a future incumbent of that
office a power that we in this House should delineate
today.</div>

							<a name="07011712000557"></a>Tom
Brake:
						</b> This morning we had a full discussion of the risks
associated with a one-man planning authority. In an intervention, I
invited the hon. Member for Surrey Heath to speculate on the scenario
of a Mayor with a financial interest in a particular application. I did
not want to give the Committee the impression that I was impugning the
present Mayor&#146;s probity, but I think that we need to prepare for
all eventualities. It is our business to tackle hypothetical
situations, hence the need for the amendment to ensure that the process
is totally
transparent.</div>
					<a name="07011712000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
served as a local councillor on two councils. The first was Labour
Hackney in the late &#146;80s, where little was done to promote
affordable housing and council keys were sold to people who were not
legitimate tenants. More recently, I served in the London borough of
Sutton. I know the pressures that local councillors face when they are
asked to consider planning matters in which they are discouraged from
entering into any discussion with developers. Councils must have a full
and open consultation process and go overboard in providing their
residents with information about planning matters. If they do not, God
forbid, the residents&#146; response will be very strong indeed. The
amendment would make the process public by ensuring that everything is
fully documented, all the documents in which decisions are based are in
the public domain and everything is open to
scrutiny.</div>

said:</div>
					<a name="07011712000173"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Mayor is also content for the meeting at which he hears representations
to be open to the public and broadcast over the internet. He is also

public.&#148;</div>

						</b> I assure the hon. Gentleman that this intervention
will have nothing whatever to do with the working man&#146;s ballet.
He is making a powerful case in support of the official
Opposition&#146;s amendment. The last two words of the amendment are
&#147;interested parties&#148;. Bearing in mind that there is not a
person on this planet who is not interested in London, has he given any
thought to the possible consequences of any person describing
themselves as an interested party making oral representations? Surely
that is a recipe for ultimate
gridlock.</div>

							<a name="07011712000561"></a>Tom
Brake:
						</b>
						The hon. Member for Surrey Heath,
who speaks for the official Opposition, has addressed that point. He
invited the Minister for Housing and Planning, if she is not satisfied
with the wording of the amendment, to present an alternative. A
precedent was set by the Minister for London when he agreed to draft an
alternative to amendment No. 38. We hold out the hope that the Minister
for Housing and Planning and Labour Members will see the amendment as
straightforward and entirely
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column225" />Column number: 226</div>in keeping with our debate, and we think that they can support it. It is
about transparency. We do not have a proprietary hold on the amendment.
If the Government want to come forward with their alternative, I am
sure that it would receive support from these
Benches.</div>

							<a name="07011712000562"></a>Yvette
Cooper:
						</b> I have sympathy with the intention behind the
amendment. We certainly attempted in the order to introduce
transparency into the procedures that the Mayor must follow. As a
minimum, he must hear oral representations from the applicant and the
local authority, if it so wishes, before making a decision. That goes
further than requirements placed on other local planning authorities.
There is no requirement for local planning authorities to allow oral
representations to be made to planning
committees.</div>
					<a name="07011712000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
also procedures for the Mayor to publish a statement setting out lists
of other persons who will hear oral representations for other
procedures to be followed and so on. As I said earlier, I have sympathy
with the idea that, in fact, those oral representations should take
place in public. We should take that into account in the order because
it is an important part of the process of delivering transparency.
However, I reiterate the fact that there are serious practical worries
about trying to replicate the role of Socrates, as the hon. Member for
Surrey Heath suggested. If the current Mayor chooses to emulate
Socrates, that is obviously a matter for him. However, I do not think
that it is a sensible issue to be dealt with under primary
legislation.</div>

							<a name="07011712000563"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for the spirit with
which she has so far approached the principle of openness, with which
we all agree. Does she accept that, because of the importance to those
involved of planning and the issues that we have discussed, the
Government should concede as a matter of principle the commitment to
having the planning hearings take place in public. Whatever wording is
used, that principle is so important that it should be outlined in the
Bill rather than be dependent on the concession of a Mayor or made
under regulations? That is what we are driving
at.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011712000564"></a>Yvette
Cooper:
						</b>
						Again, I say that the matter is
about process. It is better dealt with under secondary legislation than
under primary legislation. I am happy to agree to the principle about
hearing representations in public rather than in private, but such a
process is most sensibly dealt with as part of the order under
secondary legislation rather than by primary legislation. That approach
reflects the practical approach that we take to other aspects of
planning deliberations. On that basis, I ask the hon. Gentleman to
withdraw the amendment. I do understand the intention behind it and
have sought to set out the Government&#146;s
response.</div>

						</b> For the illumination of the Committee, because we
lost the vote on that clause and because the other clauses are more or
less consequent on clause 31 we are now reluctantly content to allow
the other clauses the stand part of the Bill. As we lost the vote on
clause 31, we will not contest the other clauses, so with the
Minister&#146;s permission and your permission, Mr.
O&#146;Hara, we can move on to the next debate. The final point that
I wish to stress is that we and, I suspect, the Liberal Democrats may
wish to table further amendments on Report that deal specifically with
planning proposals. However, at this stage we acknowledge that the vote
has been won by the Government.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011712000602"></a>Ms
Buck:
						</b> I am grateful to have the opportunity to speak to
clauses 35 to 40 and 42 and amendmentsNos. 62 and 64 and the
consequent new schedules. I apologise to the Committee in advance for
what will be a failure to rise to the giddy heights of the previous
debate when every 12 members of the Cup Winners cup team were
mentioned. I have managed to include subtly within my speech a
reference to every one of Britain&#146;s entries to the Eurovision
song contest between 1964 to 1977, with the exception of Lulu&#146;s
1969 entry &#147;Boom Bang A Bang&#148; , which was frankly just
too difficult. It is fair to say that I am surprised to be introducing
these amendments, because a cursory glance at my website would reveal
that waste disposal in London has not featured in my top 500 policy
interests to date. None the less, having attended a Mayor&#146;s
briefing on this issue, armed with hot pins to retain my sense of
purpose, I was completely converted to the case that was put to me.
With your forbearance, Mr. O&#146;Hara, I will spend a few
minutes outlining the key
points.</div>
					<a name="07011712000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
central issue&#151;establishing a single waste disposal authority for
London&#151;stems from the recognition that the existing arrangements
and changes proposed by the Government are not capable of bringing
about the step change in waste management that will be necessary if we
are to offer Londoners the most efficient and effective waste
management strategy and avoid liability for potentially extensive fines
for landfill in future. Such an authority will enable us to drive
further improvements on the waste hierarchy, reducing landfill and
incineration, particularly without incidental benefit, and increase
recycling capacity, helping us make further progress on the
climate-change
agenda.</div>
					<a name="07011712000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Under
the current proposal, the waste disposal arrangements for London remain
cumbersome and unco-ordinated with no single body responsible for
recycling and disposal operations at city level. The proposals do not
alter the fundamental weakness in the system that has left London
trailing in this country and internationally and allowed it to slip
further down the league table of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column241" />Column number: 242</div>comparable city regions in recent years. However, all parties
fundamentally agree about what we would like to see. We need efficient
and effective management of the system and proper value for taxpayers;
a dramatic reduction in landfill for environmental purposes and to
avoid liability for landfill tax; incineration should be offset by the
use of energy used for heat and power; the distance travelled during
waste disposal should be subject to the maximum reduction possible;
environmentally friendly transport methods should be used; and there
should be increases in recycling and value for taxpayers. The
Government&#146;s favoured approach does not best place us to realise
those objectives. That statement is based on past performance and on
objective and independent research on the effectiveness of the strategy
to date.</div>
					<a name="07011712000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
three key arguments, among many, which I should like to spend a few
moments discussing. First, on the coherence of the existing
arrangements, the Government have stated that creating a single waste
disposal authority would mean separating functions of waste collection
and disposal, which would make it more difficult to manage waste
effectively and could cause confusion for residents about who was
accountable for their services. That is a bizarre argument, given that
21 of London&#146;s boroughs already have a two-tier waste management
system, under which collection and disposal are
separated.</div>
					<a name="07011712000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The single
waste disposal authority that I propose would have local political
representation on its board. The proposed structure for the single
waste disposal authority means that many of its day-to-day operations
would be undertaken sub-regionally. Local residents tend to be aware of
their local recycling and waste collection services, but waste disposal
remains largely out of sight for the public. A single organisation
responsible for waste disposal and accountable to the Mayor of London
is likely to have a far higher public profile than existing waste
disposal authorities and would be directly accountable to the people of
London through the Mayor, rather than through joint waste disposal
authorities that collectively process and dispose of between 60 and 70
per cent. of London&#146;s waste. Those are little better than
quangos, with no direct accountability to the people whom they serve.
Waste management is separated between county councils, and between
district councils in the shire counties, yet their recycling
performance does not suggest that this makes waste management more
difficult. The average household recycling rate in two-tier areas in
2005-06 was 31 per cent., compared with 23 per cent. in unitary
areas.</div>
					<a name="07011712000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">The United
Kingdom&#146;s largest waste management company, Biffa Waste
Services, in its response to the consultation on the Mayor&#146;s
powers,
stated:</div>
					<a name="07011712000422"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
believe that time is rapidly running out to achieve sensible decision
frameworks for one of the most significant flows of waste in the UK
economy. London could be a benchmark for the entire UK economy by
demonstrating boldness in its economic, technological, and
socio-political decision making framework. It is unlikely that such
vision can be achieved within the current framework compared to the
strategic vision offered by the Mayor&#146;s
office&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07011712000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">All of that
broadly finds favour with the public,50 per cent. of
whom&#151;pollings rated 2:1&#151;favour the strategic approach
over the mess that we have
now.</div>
				
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column242" />Column number: 243</div>
					<a name="07011712000433"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div>
					<a name="07011712000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that
the structure proposed by the Government is, in some ways, a
strengthening of the extant position, but it is a diagram&#151;I know
that we are not allowed to introduce visual aids, Mr.
O&#146;Hara&#151;that Heath Robinson would reject for its
unnecessary complexity. I am absolutely confident that anyone looking
at that bowl of spaghetti would favour the clarity that a single
authority would bring. What matters is not the bureaucratic structure
but the extent to which a structure is capable of delivering on the
environmental objectives of effective waste
disposal.</div>
					<a name="07011712000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think we
all agree that at the heart of this is the desire to reduce landfill
for economic and, above all, environmental reasons. In support of the
current delivery mechanism, the Government say that local authorities
are on track towards reducing their use of landfill and therefore are
not at risk of incurring the fines that will befall them if they do not
meet their objectives. That is prayed in aid as a case for not needing
the significant and radical change of having a single waste authority,
but I do not accept those arguments.</div>
					<a name="07011712000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">London has two large-scale
waste incineration plants that manage 20 per cent. of London&#146;s
waste between them. That is significantly more than in any other
region, which has led to there being false confidence in
London&#146;s ability to meet landfill targets, particularly after
2010. The real tipping point with landfill targets will come between
2010 and 2013, but many London authorities have no plans or
procurements to ensure that there will be an infrastructure in place to
cope with that tipping point. The GLA estimates that four fifths of
London&#146;s authorities are at high or medium risk of not meeting
their landfill obligations. Even the construction of the Belvedere
incinerator would not substantially alter that position.</div>
					<a name="07011712000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">About two thirds of
London&#146;s waste is buried in landfill sites, and most of that
amount is taken to sites in the surrounding counties. The Mayor has set
a target that London should be 80 per cent. self-sufficient in managing
its municipal waste by 2020. That level of self-sufficiency is needed
to meet landfill directive targets and avoid landfill fines of up to
&#163;1.7 billion between now and 2020.</div>
					<a name="07011712000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">By 2020, London will need four
times its existing capacity for recycling and three times its existing
capacity for waste treatment. A GLA assessment indicates that four
fifths of London waste disposal authorities are at risk of failing to
deliver the landfill directive targets. Whilst the Government are
concerned in the short term about changing governance arrangements and
the risk of failing to deliver on early landfill directive targets, the
real challenge is in the medium to long term. Estimated fines for
landfill could be &#163;35 million in 2010, rising to &#163;139
million in 2013 and &#163;232 million by 2020.</div>
					<a name="07011712000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government have completely
missed the point by focusing only on short-term landfill directive
targets, because the targets will become progressively harder to meet.
Waste disposal authorities in England must collectively reduce the
biodegradable waste that they send to landfill to 75 per cent. of their
1995 levels by 2010, 50 per cent. by 2013 and 35 per cent. by 2020. It
is because the real risk to London, in terms of failing to achieve
targets, is in the medium to long term that I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column243" />Column number: 244</div>believe, as does the Mayor, that it is essential to make the radical
changes needed to allow London as a whole to meet those targets by
putting in place the support and investment mechanisms required to
enable us to avoid those
risks.</div>
					<a name="07011712000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both the amount
of landfill and the risk of receiving fines could be reduced in several
ways. Currently,20 per cent. of London&#146;s waste is
incinerated, and that level is set to rise to between 33 per cent. and
38 per cent. depending on whether the Government&#146;s or the
GLA&#146;s figures are accepted. That is a substantial proportion of
the UK total.</div>
					<a name="07011712000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need
to take care that incineration does not drive out the scope both for
new technologies, such as gasification and pyrolysis, and for
recycling. The new technologies always sound to me like particularly
unpleasant stomach complaints, but they are at the cutting edge of
alternatives to landfill and incineration and produce a number of
beneficial side products that, among other things, permit creation of
heat and energy and provide scope for hydrogen production to feed
London&#146;s bus fleet.</div>
					<a name="07011712000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is absolutely clear that, on
the basis of current developments, the scope for investing in new
technologies and in plant to boost recycling is at risk of being driven
out by the emphasis on incineration. Recycling as it stands is
unsatisfactory and London&#146;s performance is poor. Some London
boroughs are performing well, but many others are not. Overall, London
is the poorest-performing region for its recycling of household and
municipal waste, recycling just 21 per cent. of household waste as
against the English average of 27 per cent. Just one London borough is
in the upper quartile of local authority recycling performance, and 18
London authorities are in the lower quartile.</div>
					<a name="07011712000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some argue that London faces a
unique challenge, and that that should be taken into account when
considering its recycling. However, although it is true that there are
particular challenges to recycling in London, I do not believe that
they are insurmountable. The best-performing European cities outperform
London significantly. Hamburg recycles 57 per cent., Munich 42 per
cent., Milan 39 per cent. and Berlin37 per cent. In north
America, San Francisco recycles more than 50 per cent. of household
waste and Seattle recycles 58 per
cent.</div>
					<a name="07011712000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">As part of the
consultation on the Mayor&#146;s powers, the Government asked waste
disposal authorities to forecast recycling rates up to 2020. The
answers to that question show a total lack of ambition. Just one
authority stated that it planned to meet the London plan&#146;s
target of recycling 45 per cent. of municipal waste. Collectively, the
recycling rate forecast for 2020 was less than that for Europe&#146;s
best performers now, with some authorities aiming no higher than 25 per
cent. That approach, coupled with a hunger for incineration, means that
unless a different approach is taken now, the waste management system
in 2020 will continue to lag 30 years behind.</div>
					<a name="07011712000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						A press
release from London Councils on Monday stated that London should be
compared with urban authorities in England and is therefore doing
acceptably well. London Councils have trawled through the available
research on recycling, and all that they have managed to show is that
half of London councils are recycling less 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column244" />Column number: 245</div>than Barnsley. It is my contention that London should be aiming to be a
leading international city on recycling, and should be benchmarking
against the best in the world, yet London Councils show the real lack
of ambition that is the present
position.</div>

Buck:
						</b> That is absolutely right. What is particularly
powerful in that case is that because the Mayor has strategic
responsibility for transport and has planning functions, he can combine
the waste management, planning and transport strategies in the
interests of a progressive climate change agenda, so as to get the
maximum benefit and to cross-reference those policies so that they work
together most effectively. Although that is still possible to some
modest extent with the very diverse and unco-ordinated structures that
we have at the moment, the opportunity that is being presented to us is
not being taken as it would be were we to have a single authority and
be able to combine the functions as one.</div>
					<a name="07011712000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend is right,
therefore. What this all comes down to in a sense is two words: climate
change. We need, of course, to maintain a strong economic argument, and
to focus on value for money for taxpayers at all times. However, if we
are to ensure that the city of London is able to make the contribution
that it can&#151;through recycling, combined heat and power, making
the best use of incineration, developing new technologies and putting
them to use in other parts of our service delivery&#151;that clear
strategic responsibility needs to be vested in a single place: the
position of Mayor of
London.</div>
					<a name="07011712000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
have also tabled amendments to ensure that London boroughs undertake
street litter functions in general conformity with the Mayor&#146;s
municipal waste management strategy. Like its performance on recycling,
London&#146;s performance on litter is the worst of all English
regions. Although waste disposal is most appropriately managed at city
level, street cleansing and waste collection is best managed at borough
level. However, more needs to be done to ensure that high standards of
cleanliness are achieved right across the city.</div>
					<a name="07011712000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given London&#146;s
importance as a tourism centre and the 2012 Olympic games, it is right
that we should show it to be a clean city. The Mayor&#146;s municipal
waste management strategy can contain policies and proposals on litter,
but under existing legislation, London boroughs do not have to have
regard to it&#151;nor, under the new clauses in the Bill, will they
have to be in general conformity with it when undertaking street
cleansing. My amendment seeks to address that issue while ensuring that
boroughs remain in control of such local services. I propose that
boroughs should be in general conformity with the Mayor&#146;s
municipal waste management strategy when undertaking their functions on
litter, and that they submit to the Mayor documentation on any proposed
new street cleansing contract to ensure that it is not detrimental to
his strategy.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column245" />Column number: 246</div>
					<a name="07011712000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						
						To
sum up, London needs strong, effective leadership on waste management.
That requires not only a clear direction, but powers and funding to
deliver it. Transport for London has demonstrated the benefits of a
single, properly resourced organisation under mayoral leadership. A
single waste authority will be able to attract world-class leadership,
as has been the case with Transport for London. That is urgent and
necessary, as the fines for missing the landfill regime loom
nearer.</div>
					<a name="07011712000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The benefits
offered by a single waste authority proposal clearly outweigh any
short-term difficulties presented by transition. It will make a
positive contribution to the climate change agenda; help increase
recycling dramatically; help deliver new and emerging recovery
technologies for waste management; enable London to meet the
requirements of the landfill directive; enable London to become
regionally self-sufficient in the management of its municipal waste;
ensure that waste is managed as close to the point of production as
possible; reduce the risk of Government fines for failing to deliver
under the landfill directive; improve the commercial attractiveness of
the London waste market; promote economies of scale and the development
of a single, resourced centre of procurement; and standardise contract
conditions.</div>
					<a name="07011712000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ultimately, it comes down to
risk. The Government contend that the structural change during the move
from the existing arrangements to a single waste authority would place
the arrangements at
risk&#151;</div>

							<a name="07011712000605"></a>Mr.
Pelling:
						</b> I am very aware that the hon. Lady is coming to a
conclusion. However, would it not be possible for the boroughs
themselves to capture such economies of scale? That approach is being
taken in south London, between boroughs from Croydon to Richmond, under
the new waste contract that they are considering. Surely it is better
to give the initiative to local authorities, which are aware of the
concerns about performance on waste in
London.</div>

							<a name="07011712000606"></a>Ms
Buck:
						</b> It is certainly true that partnerships between local
authorities can produce greater economies of scale than when they act
on their own. However, the counter-argument boils down to this: given
relative performance in London, that has not happened in recent years
since the abolition of the Greater London council and the clarity of
structure that existed then. Across a range of indicators, such as
recycling and other aspects of performance, not only have London
authorities failed to meet that challenge, but in the much tougher
environment of the coming years and the stricter regimes that will
apply&#151;the fines and other pressures that will bear down on such
authorities&#151;there are no realistic signs of their being able to
meet the challenge.</div>
					<a name="07011712000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						In
conclusion, it is clear to me that the risks of making the changes to
the structure are more than heavily outweighed by the Mayor&#146;s
proven track record of delivery on comparable services, as well as by
the necessity of ensuring investment in recycling plant and new
technologies and ensuring that although incineration has a part to
play, it is promoted only when it has other beneficial side effects.
Incineration should not be allowed to squeeze out other
technologies&#151;there is a risk of
that.</div>

						</b> Does my hon. Friend have some sympathy with the
point made by the hon. Memberfor Croydon, Central? Is my hon.
Friend aware thatin 1985 the Minister with responsibility for
local government, Lord Baker, referred to extensive discussions and
imminent co-operation between boroughs such as Bromley, Croydon,
Sutton, Merton and Kingston upon Thames? Is she aware that,20
years later, that co-operation has not taken place and that the tide
seems to be flowing in the other direction, as demonstrated by the
capital standards mayoral initiative? The five boroughs that initially
refused to join that scheme are about to be joined by three boroughs
that since May 2006 have announced their intention of leaving. Is not
the move away from a voluntary coming together and towards a more

						</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for rightly drawing
my attention to those facts. I was reaching a conclusion, which is
this: we need urgently to rise to the environmental, value-for-money
and economic challenges of this agenda, but there are few signs that
London boroughs, either individually or collectively, can do that. That
is the case often for good reason, but it is sometimes because, as he

					<a name="07011712000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the

ineffective proposals on the table are not sufficient to allow us to

stage.</div>

						</b> I welcome the opportunity to discuss the
Mayor&#146;s proposals for a London strategic waste authority, which
were so enthusiastically endorsed by the hon. Member for Regent's Park
and Kensington, North. If only the enthusiasm of Labour Members for the
Mayor&#146;s policies were reciprocated by the Mayor in relation to
Government policies. I understand that this morning the Mayor described
the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs as the
carbon kid. There is a danger that the Mayor&#146;s actions will mean
that London becomes the worst performer in Europe on recycling rates. I
am afraid that the process of enthusiasm and endorsement goes one way
between Labour Members and the
Mayor.</div>
					<a name="07011712000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree with
one point that that hon. Lady made: the performance of a number of
London boroughs on recycling is pathetic. There is no other way to
describe the situation. We agree on the need for
LondonCouncils to run with the issue much more
enthusiastically.</div>
					<a name="07011712000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The Mayor is
seeking a fifth functional body&#151;the London single waste
authority&#151;which would operate like the London Fire and Emergency
Planning Authority. He wants responsibility for disposal but not for
collection, although interestingly he has said that he wants
appropriate oversight of waste collection contracts. I shall return to
that shortly. The body would be funded by central Government grants and
the Greater London authority precept. That would introduce a disconnect
between what local people pay in tax and the disposal of their waste,
which is a significant issue.</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column247" />Column number: 248</div>
					<a name="07011712000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I can see that
there are arguments in favour of the proposal&#151;the idea of
London-wide co-ordination, the possibility of improving performance
through pooling resources and expertise, increased investment in
sustainable waste management, and, possibly, long-term cost savings,
although the Government&#146;s investigation of that suggested that
the costs may rise rather than
fall.</div>
					<a name="07011712000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">The perceived
benefits of the single waste authority are outweighed by the arguments
against it and the comparisons that have been made are not terribly
helpful. London councils are generally doing well compared with other
metropolitan counties and, as I said earlier, there is potential for
the proposal to incur greater costs than currently apply. There is a
lack of cohesion, which I have already referred to, if a break is made
between collection and disposal. Such a disconnection has already
happened in other parts of the country, where it has not always been
helpful. There is a loss of accountability at a borough level when the
precept is raised by the Mayor, with local people feeling that they do
not have any great say over what is being spent locally.</div>
					<a name="07011712000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many boroughs&#146;
performance in areas such as recycling plays a significant part in
success or otherwise at elections. That would be lost if the Mayor was
to exercise what he suggests is appropriate oversight over waste
collection contracts. There is also the potential for disproportionate
regional impacts. If a scheme is organised on a London-wide basis,
there is the possibility that certain parts of London will find a lot
more waste disposal activity going on in their patch. That link between
collection, disposal and recycling should be local, because only on
that basis will people accept the way in which their waste is dealt
with.</div>

						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I would like to ask for clarification,
because I may have misunderstood what the hon. Gentleman has just said.
Surely the purpose of recycling is not just to make councils look good,
but to ensure that we take account of the very serious environmental
issues that are affecting us as people who live in an ever-expanding
city. We have to redouble and retreble our recycling efforts, rather
than merely feeling that we are being warm and friendly about it and
that that makes us look
good.</div>

only for appearances&#146; sake. Certainly, that is not the case for
my own local authority, which has done very well on that
score.</div>
					<a name="07011712000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">The best way to
respond to the hon. Lady&#146;s proposal is to look at what can
happen on the ground. I had a conversation earlier today with
Councillor Colin Hall, who leads on environment issues for Sutton,
which has a very good track record in this respect. First, many
boroughs are already delivering on recycling. The economies of scale,
which were highlighted in an intervention made from the official
Opposition Benches, can be achieved
already.</div>
					<a name="07011712000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Kingston,
Croydon, Merton and Sutton are in a voluntary agreement to look at
waste procurement, and Sutton is taking the lead on that issue. There
is a legitimate concern that a pan-London proposal would neglect the
importance of dealing with issues at a very 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column248" />Column number: 249</div>local level. In Sutton, for example, research demonstrates that in
Cheam, which is part of the borough, people will recycle bottles door
to door. Therefore, there is perhaps a case for expanding that service
at a very local level in the Cheam area. In St. Helier, however, the
provision of extra bottle banks or additional facilities for paper or
cardboard may be appropriate to help to boost recycling efforts. That
is the sort of knowledge that the Mayor cannot
have.</div>

could solve the difficulties of climate change, I would be greatly
relieved. Is this not an example of the tail wagging the dog? I know
that the Liberal Democrats do not have many party activists now, but is
Councillor Scroggins, or whatever his name is, to dictate national
policy? I am afraid that Cheam on its own, however commendable its
record, would not solve London&#146;s waste problems, and the hon.

Fulham.</div>

more sensitive to the controversies over waste collection? I recall
that a previous Member for Sutton and Cheam, Lady Olga Maitland, became
known as the bin lady owing to her concern about recycling. Surely, the
way in which the council eventually gave way before significant

something of a free for all: for example, the city of Westminster sends
much of its waste by road to Lewisham, sometimes via Wembley. That is
not necessarily a case of local politicians responding to local needs;
those in one area take decisions that might be fiercely opposed by
local people in another. No one has overall

for being parochial, but I think that it is worth referring to examples
of best practice. In Sutton, the Mayor fully endorsed the local
authority&#146;s approach by granting it &#163;4 million to develop
a site on which composting tunnels and a new Dano drum could be built.
He has already expressed his support for what individual local
authorities have done. That is the right approach. We all need to put
pressure on local authorities to deliver on his agenda, but the
creation of a monolithic pan-London waste authority run by the Mayor is
not the best way to maximise recycling in London. It is down to the

it has disposed of those four boroughs&#146; waste. I have had a
fruitless association with that body for more than 20 years. Indeed,
when I was the vice-chairman of the dustbin and drain sub-committee in
1986, I was a voting member. This is how it worked: because there were
eight members&#151;four Labour, four Conservative&#151;and because
it previously had a Conservative majority and thus the chair retained a
casting vote, for about12 years every vote was decided in
favour of the interests of the two Conservative boroughs and against
that of the two Labour boroughs. They were the most fractious and
long-winded meetings that I have ever been to, and I have been to quite
a few.</div>
					<a name="07011712000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we move
forward 20 years through some pretty horrific decisions, mismanagement
and incompetence by that body, we come to June 2005. I quote the first
paragraph of a report by the Western Riverside waste
authority:</div>
					<a name="07011712000423"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Last
autumn, the authority instigated judicial review proceedings against
Wandsworth
council&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="07011712000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">one of
its constituent
bodies&#151;</div>
					<a name="07011712000424"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
respect of decisions made about commercial waste collection. The
authority agreed, at its meeting in November 2004, to suspend the clerk
and the treasurer to the authority for the duration of the dispute
because of the conflict of interest arising from their employment as
chief officers at
Wandsworth.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011712000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">Here
we have a waste disposal body suing one of its constituent member
councils and, in the meantime, suspending its senior officers because
they are also the senior officers of that member council. I need not go
into the causes of the dispute&#151;suffice it to say that it was a
characteristic attempt by Wandsworth council to bend the rules of
commercial waste collection to avoid paying the same penalties as the
other three boroughs&#151;but what an absolute farce that a body
charged with such a responsible task should operate in that
way.</div>
					<a name="07011712000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say that
because we have heard some complimentary things about the boroughs from

job. However, in many cases that is not working, and boroughs are not
up to the job.</div>
					<a name="07011712000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">I must
briefly respond to a plaintive letter that I and my hon. Friend the

and, as he is a reasonable, one nation sort of chap, I am minded to go
along the route he suggests, despite all my reservations. It is
unfortunate that the council leader was provoked to write only at the

as my hon. Friend the Member for Regent&#146;s Park and Kensington,
North covered many of the main points.</div>
					<a name="07011712000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">Brent is ranked in the top 10
of the worst performing boroughs for recycling. In 2004-05, under a
Labour administration, Brent was collecting around 8 per cent. By 2006,
that had increased to 20 per cent. The hon. Member for Carshalton and
Wallington referred to the campaigning potential of recycling. That
makes sense in Brent, because the council is now run by a Lib Dem-Tory
administration&#151;</div>

Butler:
						</b> Well, actually it is. In Brent, the administration
is known as the &#147;Fib Dem-Con&#148; administration because of
all the promises it makes but fails to deliver. Recycling is a case in
point, because the &#147;Fib Dem-Con&#148; campaign promised to
double the amount of recycling collection achieved by the Labour
administration. As a result, Brent went from a record 20 per cent. to
20.2 per cent. Last week, a resident of Willesden complained that they
had still not had their Christmas recycling collected, so we may yet
see a reduction of that 20.2 per cent.</div>
					<a name="07011712000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although Brent is below the
national average, and while Opposition parties see recycling as having
campaigning potential and as a subject for political point scoring, we
may never see collection levels at the 40 per cent. we would like to
see. The fragmented system means that waste collection may never amount
to the 40 per cent. that we could see under a single waste authority
for London. As my hon. Friend the Member for Regent&#146;s Park and
Kensington, North said, we have to consider climate change, and if we
are totally serious about that, we need to consider having a single
waste authority for London.</div>

McDonagh:
						</b> I, too, rise to support the amendments tabled by
my hon. Friend the Member for Regent&#146;s Park and Kensington,
North, but in doing so I find myself in a strange position. I do not
necessarily see myself as a close political ally of the Mayor, or
indeed as somebody who would normally oppose the Government&#146;s
provisions. My concern is that the Government may have backed away from
their new Labour credentials, which are about public service reform,
tackling issues of concern, and standing up to the establishment. The
provisions in the Bill do not do those things and do not follow the
tradition that has been incredibly successful in the
Government.</div>

						Recycling
and environmental issues are not about nice little photo opportunities,
feeling good about things, or somehow achieving an increase in the
opinion polls; they are about the future for us and our children. If we
are serious about this, we must start now and press now. It is all very
well wanting to tax people&#146;s flights or to restrict
people&#146;s quality of life, but by recycling and changing how we
get rid of our waste, we can make substantial differences that benefit
everybody and improve the quality of everybody&#146;s life.</div>
					<a name="07011712000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">In 2005-06, London produced
almost 1 million tonnes of non-household waste. Only 9 per cent. of it
was recycled, compared with England&#146;s figure of 30 per cent.,
and 22 of the 37 London waste authorities failed to meet their
recycling targets. I have a great deal of respect for Sutton&#146;s
traditions and for its record, but this is not about being the best but
about being the worst. It is about lifting everybody up, because the
problem has an impact on all of us.</div>
					<a name="07011712000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was lucky enough to sit on
the 1998 Standing Committee that scrutinised the great new Labour
measure to introduce an executive Mayor for London. I believed that an
executive Mayor would bring about a significant changes to London by
virtue of his or her powers to do so. Irrespective of what party the
executive Mayor for London represents, they can bring a substantial
change in waste management in London and better all our environments.
Even more importantly, they can avert the impending problem of being
fined because we cannot do enough with our waste to prevent it going to
landfill.</div>

management in London. We are the only city in Britain to have more than
one waste authority, we lag substantially behind other prominent
European cities, and we must tackle the problem. Again, it is not about
photo opportunities or about being seen to be good on such matters; it
is about doing the right thing. I am interested in doing rather than
posing, and the proposal would do that.</div>

						</b> It is a pleasure to speak after a fascinating debate
in which several important issues were raised. The hon. Member for
Regent&#146;s Park and Kensington, North made a coherent case,
underlining the way in which no one who takes climate change seriously
can afford to ignore the impact of waste management. She also outlined,
with a mixture of passion and authority, how a single waste authority
for London might make a difference.</div>
					<a name="07011712000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like to support the
hon. Lady, but I cannot. Before I explain why, and why logic guides me,
I shall say a few words about the other contributions. The hon. Member
for Brent, South also spoke with passion and commitment about the
importance of recycling, emphasising the way in which we cannot take
climate 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column253" />Column number: 254</div>change seriously unless we take recycling seriously. Brent&#146;s
Lib-Con alliance is in its infancy, and if it has made an
improvement&#151;albeit small and modest&#151;to recycling, all I
can say is that we ain&#146;t seen nothing yet.
</div>
					<a name="07011712000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">I notice that the
hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington flinched slightly when I
suggested that Liberal-Conservative co-operation was the future. I
acknowledge that such a view is not shared by all Liberal Democrats,

the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden was brief. Nevertheless, in its
own way it was all the more effective for being sincere and from the
heart. Unless I am much mistaken, although she confirmed such matters
earlier in our deliberations, she is Parliamentary Private Secretary to
the Home Secretary. The Government&#146;s position is clear. They
believe that a single waste authority is wrong. The Secretary of State
for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has made it clear that he
considers it to be a misguided measure. The Minister who deals with
waste at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has
also made that clear. The hon. Lady&#146;s speech is a clear example
of her departing from the doctrine of collective responsibility. I have
a great deal of admiration for her courage in so doing, but a new
precedent has been set. If she remains on the Government payroll after
the debate today, a significant coach and horses has been driven
through the doctrine of collective
responsibility.</div>

detail about the Mayor&#146;s plans for a single waste authority and
the weaknesses of those plans. It is significant that a Parliamentary
Private Secretary to someone who is a Cabinet Minister and a potential
leadership challenger has signalled that she considers that the
judgment of the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs is deficient on the central question of waste management. She
is on the record as saying that he is wrong. In crude tabloid terms, it
is a Government split. There is no other way in which to dress up the

Gove:
						</b> Thank you, Mr. O&#146;Hara. I wish to
turn briefly to the speech of the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and
Shepherd's Bush. In the early part of the 18th century, Jacobites
furnished the hope that one day there would be a rising in the north
and the west, and that the Scottish Jacobites would find themselves
joined by individuals who proclaimed their allegiance to the king over
the water on each occasion that it was safe to do so. But when push
came to shove, those Jacobites found that their swords remained in
their
scabbard.</div>
					<a name="07011712000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thinking of
those Jacobite lords, I am inevitably reminded of the hon. Member for
Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush, because the burden of his speech was
an attack on the current system of waste management and the Western
Riverside waste authority. I thought that he was gearing himself up to
take his sword from his scabbard and to join the rebel band led by the
hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North, which has recently
enjoyed the adherence of the hon. Members for Brent, South and for
Mitcham and Morden, but at the final moment he kept his sword in his
scabbard and said that he would vote with the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column255" />Column number: 256</div>Government. Implausibly, he asked us to believe that that was the result
of a nice letter that the Conservative leader of Ealing borough council
had sent him. We all know that the leader of that council is a
persuasive individual. Nevertheless, I suspect that the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s decision might have rather more to do with the
tender and persuasive powers of the hon. Member for Chatham and
Aylesford, or possibly the prospect of a vacant PPS-ship&#151;for
example, that of the hon. Member for Mitcham and
Morden.</div>

I have tried to cut through and bring a little light into his elaborate
but sometimes misleading discourse. I shall get in my retaliation
first. I believe that we will hear a lot about the single waste
authority, which is probably wrong, and about the boroughs, which are
also wrong. I was trying to indicate that not all is necessarily well
in the boroughs as they stand, just as all was not necessarily well in
the Jacobite court of the 18th century. I do not know whether as an
Aberdonian he is siding with the Duke of Cumberland, which would be an
unusual course to take, or whether he is declaring his support for the
Stuart
king.</div>

Gove:
						</b> Thank you, Mr. O&#146;Hara. As I said,
the case for a single waste authority was put with passion by the hon.
Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North, but I am afraid that
the detail behind her argument does not hold up to the same degree of
scrutiny that I and others might wish it to. We ask ourselves what is
the evidence for a need for change, and the hon. Lady says that it is
the poor record of recycling in London. I agree that many boroughs in
London have a poor recycling record. One of the worst is Tower Hamlets,
which has the second-worst recycling rate in the country after
neighbouring
Newham.</div>
					<a name="07011712000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We
should be aware that both of those local authorities are run by Labour.
Last year, Tower Hamlets recycled only 7 per cent. of its waste, well
below its target of 18 per cent. If a local authority fails in that
way, central intervention might be required or considered under this
Government, with their adherence to targets and centralisation, and
with hit squads being sent in to rescue residents when local
authorities fail. But when a suggestion of intervention was raised, an
official from the Government office for London said that the Government
could not possibly intervene in the case of Tower Hamlets because the
chief executive was married to a Minister&#151;I shall spare his
blushes and not name him&#151;and another Minister who had a relevant
interest 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column256" />Column number: 257</div>in the case was the Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, the
hon. Member for Poplar and Canning Town (Jim Fitzpatrick), who is the
Minister for London. So the Government acknowledge that Labour local
authorities are failing but at the same time are sometimes reluctant to
take the steps that might be necessary to bring them up to the
mark.</div>

may not be aware of it&#151;that the official was taken to task and
that rebuttals were issued by the Government office for London and
Tower Hamlets, as well as the Department for Communities and Local
Government. They said that action would be taken if it were necessary,

						</b> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for that
clarification, but the fact remains on the record that Tower Hamlets
and Newham have particularly bad recycling records. However, it is not
my intention fruitlessly to criticise the local authority or the
Government, because most local authorities in London have unique
problems when it comes to recycling. It is right to compare London
boroughs on their recycling records, but it is also appropriate to
recognise that the situation is slightly easier in Sutton than it is in
Tower Hamlets. One reason for that is that central London boroughs are
more likely to have multi-storey developments, and we all know that
flats and tenement blocks are the sorts of development in which it is
more difficult to achieve higher recycling
rates.</div>

						To return to some of the
statistics that I quoted in my speech, it is surely also true that the

consider what happens in Europe. There are certain things that we can
learn from Europe and the United States about improving waste
management. However, to stick to the United Kingdom, it is unfair to
demonise London. London counts as a region and has a form of regional
government, but it is the only effective city region in the United
Kingdom. Comparing the performances of London boroughs with other
metropolitan boroughs is the only effective level of comparison. Doing
so shows that the highest-performing boroughs on recycling are all
London boroughs, although I do not want to be partisan about that. Some
of the best-performing include boroughs such as Camden, which were
until recently under Labour control, although the best-performing is
Bexley. Other metropolitan boroughs outside London, in Liverpool,
Wirral and&#151;it pains me to acknowledge this&#151;Knowsley, are
not performing as well as they might.</div>

He has made the case that London deserves not to be compared with other

in recycling, as compared with the leafy
suburbs?</div>

Gove:
						</b>
						The hon. Lady amplifies one of my
points, which is that one needs to take account of the problems that
exist where there is a high level of high-rise blocks in an area.
However, even the most urban boroughs in London tend to outperform as
compared with the most densely populated urban boroughs in the United
Kingdom, which either are similar socio-economically or have a similar
architectural pattern. Overall, it is unfair to demonise London. We can
acknowledge&#151;as I have acknowledged, and as I suspect the
Minister will acknowledge&#151;that there is underperformance in
certain London boroughs. However, when we consider the global picture
of London overall, it is wrong to compare it with other UK regions.
When we consider not only recycling overall, but dry
recyclables&#151;acknowledging the fact that little composting is
going on in London&#151;it is even more appropriate that
London&#146;s performance should be seen to be even stronger. That is
a distinction that we should
acknowledge.</div>
					<a name="07011712000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Having
acknowledged that London&#146;s performance is less bad than
advocates of change would paint&#151;indeed, it is better than that
of comparable metropolitan boroughs&#151;we need to consider what
London is doing with its waste. London&#146;s performance on
recycling is more impressive than one might think from the
Mayor&#146;s briefing and the arguments of his allies. However,
recycling is not the whole answer, as we know. There must be a method
for waste disposal. The hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden pointed out
that landfill is an inadequate way of proceeding, but only one London
borough failed to meet its landfill target in 2005-06, which is the
last year for which there are figures, while five metropolitan boroughs
outside London failed to meet theirs. Again, when it comes to
respecting the need to avoid landfill, London boroughs are doing better
than one might think from the Mayor&#146;s arguments. Also, many
London waste authorities have landfill surpluses. The landfill trading
system allows those that do well to have trading surpluses, and two
authorities have traded their excess allowances. Again, London boroughs
have exceeded the level of performance that central Government have
asked of
them.</div>

						One
of the ways in which such boroughs have attempted to do that is by
embracing incineration. I take the point that the hon. Member for
Regent's Park and Kensington, North made about incineration as
currently practised not necessarily being everyone&#146;s answer to
the waste problem. I note with interest the comments that my hon.
Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst made about the Belvedere
combined heat and power plant in south-east London. Having an
incinerator in south-east London is perhaps not the best way to deal
with waste coming from central London. However, the Belvedere proposal,
which the Secretary of State approved and which the Mayor objected to,
went to judicial 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column258" />Column number: 259</div>review, when the Mayor&#146;s objection was branded
&#147;hopeless&#148; by the judicial body charged with overseeing

important to recognise that incineration is one of a range of tools
that can be used in dealing with waste. It is not my favourite
method&#151;I suspect that it is few Committee members&#146;
favourite method&#151;but it has to be included in our range of
proposals because, as the hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington,
North said, the one thing that we want to avoid is landfill, for
various reasons, including European regulation and various
environmental factors that I suspect most Committee members agree
with.</div>
					<a name="07011712000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">To avoid
landfill, the Mayor invites us to consider a form of gasification and
pyrolysis, but although that is a potentially attractive way of dealing
with waste, the technology is relatively in its infancy. There are few
examples of combined gasification and pyrolysis operating in the United
Kingdom. Woking borough council, which advanced a proposal for
consideration in Surrey, acknowledged that it was a revolutionary
method to use in the UK. Gasification and pyrolysis might yield
significant benefits, some of which were mentioned by the hon. Member
for Regent's Park and Kensington, North, but the burden of my argument
is that we cannot be certain that it will do so. We know that we cannot
rely on landfill. Therefore, incineration has to be one of the methods
at our disposal. Yet the Mayor has made it clear that, as far as he is
concerned, incineration is out of the
picture.</div>

						</b> I do not think that the difference between us is as
great as the hon. Gentleman imagines. Surely, the Mayor&#146;s
preference is for a balanced strategy for waste disposal and, clearly,
a recognition that there will be incineration capacity in that strategy
for sometime. However, given London&#146;s heavy reliance on
incineration and the proportion of the UK&#146;s total incineration
capacity used by London, the central point is that new and developing
technologies that require encouragement and investment get squeezed out
by incineration, which deals with the waste that has shifted over from
landfill.</div>

							<a name="07011712000657"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> I take the hon. Lady&#146;s point. She may be
right: the difference may be less than I depicted. However, it is
instructive that the Mayor has not only opposed the Belvedere
plant&#151;albeit other Committee members might think that he had
good reasons for doing so&#151;but lobbied against an extension of
incineration in Edmonton and expressed concernabout certain
western boroughs sending waste for incineration near Slough, in
Berkshire. At every point when boroughs have attempted to use
incineration to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column259" />Column number: 260</div>avoid transgressing landfill targets, the Mayor has been on the side of
preventing them doing so, which is a matter of
concern.</div>
					
					<a name="07011712000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011712000658"></a>Stephen
Pound:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman mentions Slough. The Mayor of
London is concerned that Slough has recently signed contracts for
disposal with Poole in Dorset and Wiltshire county council. One of the
problems with the unco-ordinated approach is that waste is trucked
along the M25 from Wiltshire and Dorset to Slough. That is a critique
not of the plant at Slough, but of the system that allows specialist
centres to draw in rubbish from outside their own area. That is a
severe
problem.</div>
					
					<a name="07011712000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011712000659"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making that
point. It might fall outside the scope of the Committee&#151;that has
not stopped us in the past, though&#151;to discuss whether local
authorities in the west of England should be sending their waste to
near Slough to be dealt with. That is only a couple of kilometres
beyond the boundary of Greater London, however, and seems to be an
appropriate place to be used by authorities in Hillingdon, Brent,
Hounslow, Harrow and Richmond&#151;the authorities currently using
it. Yet the Mayor seemed unhappy for reasons to do not with London, but
with his broader approach to waste. Again, that makes me think that we
should be a little cautious about accepting the arguments advanced so
ably by the hon. Member for Richmond
Park.</div>
					
					<a name="07011712000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011712000660"></a>Tom
Brake:
						</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, under a single
waste authority, the risk of the Mayor setting up a very limited number
of key waste disposal sites, and thereby increasing the number of
journeys required to transport refuse to those points, would be the
same?</div>
					
					<a name="07011712000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07011712000661"></a>Michael
Gove:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a very good point: there is
no automatic link between the Mayor&#146;s powers under a single
waste strategy and a necessarily short journey from collection to
disposal, be that by incineration or another
means.</div>
					<a name="07011712000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
established that the Mayor has shown an antipathy towards incineration
and has, as it were, bet the recycling ranch on untested technologies,
we should be cautious about giving him those powers. More than that, it
is appropriate to recognise that, if they were granted to him, the link
would be broken between the collection and disposal of waste. The hon.
Member for Mitcham and Morden was right in acknowledging that. There is
a division already in rural areas such as shire counties and
boroughs.</div>
					<a name="07011712000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
successes of the London boroughs that have reformed their recycling
rate and dealt effectively with waste has been the way in which
collection and disposal have been effectively integrated. More broadly,
the integration of collection and disposal in London boroughs brings
together street cleaning and the tackling of litter. Although we are
all aware of the problem of grime, dirt and litter in London, it has
moved down the agenda and list of issues that concern London voters.
That is a reflection of the way in which certain boroughs&#151;I
shall refrain from making partisan political points&#151;have made
their streets brighter.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column260" />Column number: 261</div>
					<a name="07011712000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are not denying the Mayor an
important voice in shaping how London deals with waste. Indeed, the
Bill gives him the power to amplify his voice through his waste
strategy. It talks about the need for London boroughs to co-operate
effectively with the Mayor when discharging their responsibilities in
order to conform to the strategy. As we discussed on the previous
planning legislation, the Mayor has an enhanced role in dealing with
waste plants. He has greater freedom to intervene. One might expect
Conservative Members to be concerned about that&#151;legitimate
concerns could be raised&#151;but in the spirit of achieving
cross-party consensus on the vital issue of climate change, we
recognise that the Government make a decent case for their proposals.
However, the Mayor still has a number of levers to pull in encouraging
a more effective waste strategy and we do not believe that we should
move to a single waste authority while those levers are still in
place</div>
					<a name="07011712000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, the
Government have talked about what might happen when the London waste
and recycling forum is set up, to which they have allocated potentially
&#163;25 million. That money can be spent only on improving waste
management and recycling and only if boroughs, the assembly and the
Mayor can get onwith the job as defined in the Bill, not the
amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington,
North. Impressed as I was by the focus that she has brought to the
debate and admiring as I was of the passion with which she spoke, I
fear that the largest Opposition party will not vote for her
amendment.</div>

							<a name="07011712000662"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:
						</b> It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair
again this afternoon, Mr. O&#146;Hara. I am grateful to my
hon. Friend the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North for
moving her amendment, which has allowed us to have this discussion. The
usual channels thought that the whole day may be taken up with
planning, so I am grateful that we have managed to reach some of these
items. Possibly the only point of agreement between she and I, however,
is that we both want to see some improvement in performance&#151;a
point on which I am sure that no one dissents.</div>
					<a name="07011712000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is regrettable that the
Mayor has decided to resort to name calling on the subject of this
discussion. PA describes his disagreement with the Secretary of State
for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs as a personal attack. I find
that slightly strange because I know that the Mayor has a high regard
for my right hon. Friend, and I hope that the discussion can take place
in the same spirit as the one in which the amendment was moved by my
hon. Friend.</div>
					<a name="07011712000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government want to enhance the Greater London authority&#146;s
strategic role in dealing with London's waste. Through clauses 36 and
37, we have proposed amendments to the Greater London Authority Act
1999 which will strengthen the GLA's role further. We are at a crucial
stage in delivering a step change in how waste is managed nationally,
in order to reduce the environmental impact of our waste and to meet
challenging European targets for diverting waste from
landfill.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column261" />Column number: 262</div>
					<a name="07011712000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is clearly important to be
aware of the distinction between landfill diversion and recycling.
There are many ways to avoid landfill, including reducing waste
production in the first place, recycling, and treatments to convert
waste into energy. We face significant fines if we do not achieve our
EU landfill diversion targets, but I am pleased to say that early
indications are that London is rising to the challenge. Figures for
2005-06 show that London is outperforming other regions. In fact,
London is second best only to the west midlands in making progress
towards meeting its allocations for 2010. Recycling is of course also
very important. Performance on it in London is mixed. Two London
boroughs&#151;Sutton and Bexley&#151;have been awarded beacon
status on waste and recycling, whereas Tower Hamlets, as has been
mentioned, is at the bottom of the national waste recycling league
table. Some boroughs need to make major improvements, and the
Government are working with them to ensure that that
happens.</div>
					<a name="07011712000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some of
London&#146;s success on landfill diversion is due to its
above-average use of energy from waste technology. Data from other EU
member states demonstrates that use of incineration is completely
compatible with high recycling rates. Denmark, Sweden and the
Netherlands, which are considered to be green countries, all have much
higher recycling rates than the UK, although they rely on incineration
technologies as well. Belgium is another example. It recycles 60 per
cent. of its waste and incinerates 30 per
cent.</div>
					<a name="07011712000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have not seen
any convincing evidence to suggest that a single waste authority for
London will deliver improvements in waste management or cost
efficiencies. In fact, we believe that we have seen contrary evidence,
suggesting that a single waste disposal authority could result in extra
costs to the Government and extra costs to the boroughs, and could put
our landfill diversion targets at risk. If the UK failed in its
targets, the resulting fines could be equivalent to as much as 5 per
cent. on the council tax bills of Londoners.</div>
					<a name="07011712000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposed amendments would
not give the Mayor full control of recycling, and so may do little to
help to boost recycling rates in the capital. Instead, they would split
control over collection and recycling, and dispose of responsibilities
between two, different political bodies. That is why the vast majority
of London boroughs, irrespective of political colour, are opposed to a
single waste authority for
London.</div>
					<a name="07011712000372"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first EU
landfill diversion target is just three years away, and we face
significant fines if it is missed. The creation of a new single waste
authority could threaten the good progress that the latest figures show
London to be making. During the transition to a single authority,
Londoners would have no incentive to drive forward investment in the
new waste facilities that are needed in London.</div>
					<a name="07011712000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">Over the past year, the
Government have thought long and hard about London&#146;s waste. Our
position has been informed by public consultation and by a number of
detailed consultancy reports, and our considered view is that to
reorganise waste arrangements now would divert attention and resources
at a crucial time and lead to a performance dip that would put
achievement of our EU targets at risk. We therefore see 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column262" />Column number: 263</div>little benefit in making significant and costly changes to the way in
which waste functions are delivered at local and regional levels.
Instead, efforts and resources should be focused on improving diversion
and recycling performance within current
structures.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="07011712000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall return
to the detail of the amendments and new clauses, but first I shall set
out the Government&#146;s proposals in clauses 36 and 37. Clause 36
introduces a requirement on London&#146;s waste collection and
disposal authorities to</div>
					<a name="07011712000425"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;act in general conformity
with&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011712000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">the Mayor&#146;s
municipal waste management strategy when exercising certain functions.
Section 353 of the 1999 Act requires the Mayor of London to prepare and
publish a document known as the municipal waste management strategy,
which sets the strategic direction for London&#146;s waste
activities. Section 355 requires waste collection authorities and waste
disposal authorities in Greater London to &#147;have regard
to&#148; the municipal waste management strategy when carrying out
their waste functions.</div>
					<a name="07011712000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 36 amends section 355 of
the 1999 Act, and it requires waste collection and waste disposal
authorities in Greater London to</div>
					<a name="07011712000426"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;act in general conformity
with&#148;</div>
					<a name="07011712000377"></a><div class="hs_Para">the Mayor&#146;s
municipal waste management strategy when exercising any of their waste
functions underpart 2 of the Environmental Protection Act
1990. The duty has effect only to the extent that it does not impose
additional excessive cost or require an authority to breach or
terminate a contract.</div>
					<a name="07011712000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause includes a
transition provision to deal with contracts in procurement when the
Bill is enacted. To ensure greater clarity, we are considering amending
the wording of the clause. Further, if the Mayor revises his municipal
waste management strategy, no authority should have to breach a
contract, and a borough would need to be only in general conformity
with the strategy that existed when contracts were made.</div>
					<a name="07011712000379"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause includes a power for
the Secretary of State to issue guidance on the definition of general
conformity and excessive additional costs. The enhancement of the
Mayor&#146;s powers to require waste authorities to deliver services
in general conformity with his strategy, along with his existing power
of direction, will help to deliver the strategic vision that the Mayor
sets out for London.</div>
					<a name="07011712000380"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 37 amends section 358 of
the 1999 Act on information about new waste contracts, and it updates
the Act following changes to public procurement legislation. It will
strengthen the requirement for authorities to inform the Mayor before
putting waste contracts out to tender.</div>
					<a name="07011712000381"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under existing legislation it
is not always necessary for London waste authorities to inform the
Mayor before putting waste contracts out to tender. The clause adds a
provision so that where authorities are obliged neither to send the
European Commission a first information notice of their intention to
tender a waste contract nor to publish the authorities&#146; buyers
profile, but they are obliged to send a second information notice, they
must inform the Mayor of their intention to tender. They will be
required to notify the Mayor 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column263" />Column number: 264</div>108 days before issuing the second information notice. The amendments
would ensure that the Mayor was informed of all waste tenders in
advance.</div>
					<a name="07011712000382"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
strengthening the requirement for boroughs to inform the Mayor if they
are to tender a contract, we will ensure that the Mayor has a role in
procurement decisions and that the Mayor&#146;s vision and policies
are implemented locally when waste authorities deliver their
functions.</div>
					<a name="07011712000383"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 64 would extend the Mayor&#146;s power of direction so that he
could direct London waste collection and waste disposal
authorities&#146; management of waste past the second information
notice stage of their tendering for a waste contract. Extending the
Mayor&#146;s power of direction beyond that stage would create
uncertainty and it might make the waste industry less willing to engage
in procurement with authorities. For that reason we oppose the
amendment. </div>
					<a name="07011712000384"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 62, new clauses 35, 36, 39 and 40 and new schedules 1, 2 and 3 seek
to amend the 1999 Act to establish and give powers and duties to a
single waste disposal authority for London&#151;the London waste
authority. It is obvious that we do not accept them. I have already set
out in detail our position on the matter. The amendments would
fundamentally change how London manages its waste, and the Government
firmly believe that waste services are best operated locally, as I and
many hon. Members from all parties have described.</div>
					<a name="07011712000385"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						On new clause
37, it is difficult to understand what purpose would be served by a
minerals and waste development scheme for London, because the Mayor
does not have responsibility for preparing the associated development
plan documents on minerals and waste. That is the responsibility of the
boroughs. Clearly, the purpose of the amendment is that the Mayor
should prepare a MWDS and take responsibility for site-specific
plan-making for waste and minerals sites, but that is also the wrong
balance of decision making. Site-specific plans should be made by
boroughs, which have the required intimate local knowledge, while the
Mayor should maintain a strategic policy direction.</div>
					<a name="07011712000386"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						If the
concern behind the amendment centres on the timetabling and speed of
plan-making at borough level, a MWDS for London, prepared by the Mayor,
would add no benefit because the proposed new planning
powers&#151;for example, in clause 30&#151;to allow the Mayor to
direct changes to boroughs&#146; LDSs give the Mayor sufficient
influence over the timetable for the production of minerals and waste
policies by boroughs throughout London.</div>
					<a name="07011712000387"></a><div class="hs_Para">Now that the Mayor has
published a suite of strategic waste policies in his early alteration
and draft alteration to the London plan containing a borough-level
apportionment of waste&#151;both were both published in December
2006&#151;boroughs have a clear framework for local plan-making that
they did not have in the past. They are now expected to implement the
strategic framework set out in the London plan, and by allocating sites
for waste facilities they will encourage planning applications to come
forward, leading to the delivery of facilities on the
ground.</div>
					<a name="07011712000388"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of
the amendment may be to ensure that the timetable for the review of the
Mayor&#146;s strategic minerals and waste policies is produced. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column264" />Column number: 265</div>Mayor&#146;s special development strategy&#151;the London
plan&#151;incorporates regional strategic policies on minerals and
waste which can be amended and updated as necessary, as they were in
the early alterations to the London plan published in December
2006.</div>
					<a name="07011712000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">The timetable
for review of the London plan in the form of an LDS-type document is
unnecessary. The arrangement for timetabling the SDS is set out in
Government office for London circular 1/2000 and involves establishing
an indicative target time scale and resources, and publicly adopting
the timetable at the outset. That approach has been effective and is
comparable with the arrangements for other regions outside
London.</div>
					<a name="07011712000390"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 38
would amend sections 353, 355 and 357 of the 1999 Act. Section 353
relates to the Mayor&#146;s municipal waste management strategy. The
relevant amendment would widen the scope of the strategy to include
litter. The Government believe that litter policies are also best dealt
with at local level and in accordance with local needs and
circumstances. The proposed amendment to section 355 would require
waste collection and disposal authorities to act in general conformity
with the Mayor&#146;s municipal waste management strategy when
clearing litter and refuse. However, the removal of litter and refuse
from land under existing duties involves a variety of other agencies,
including statutory undertakers, the Crown and governing bodies of
educational institutions, as well as local authorities. Therefore, it
is appropriate that strategies for dealing with litter are developed
locally in London, as elsewhere. There are already sufficient
partnership arrangements in place through the capital standards
programme to allow for co-ordination at regional level. On the
amendment to section 357, the new clause proposes a single waste
authority, on which I have already explained the Government&#146;s
position. For those reasons, I must strongly resist this new
clause.</div>
					<a name="07011712000391"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, on
new clause 42, litter functions are dealt with at local level by the
boroughs working closely with partners and others that have
responsibility for clearing litter and refuse. Currently, they do not
have to provide any information to the Mayor before putting street
cleansing contracts out to tender. The new clause would enable the
Mayor to have oversight of procurement activity for street cleansing
and thereby assist him in promoting and encouraging best practice with
inner London boroughs.</div>
					<a name="07011712000392"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have some sympathy with the
principle of the amendment, and would welcome the opportunity to
consider it further. With that assurance, I hope that my hon. Friend
will not press it to a Division. I have explained that I cannot accept
his other amendments.I said that London is improving its
recycling arrangements, but the amendments would leave waste collection
services, including the recycling service, with the boroughs, so they
would not change the current
arrangements.</div>
					<a name="07011712000393"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend suggested that boroughs do not have plans to meet 2014 targets.
Restructuring now would increase the risk of fines by delaying plans
that are already in place&#151;for example, the mechanical and
biological treatments in Havering and Newham, which 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column265" />Column number: 266</div>should come online with full capacity this year, and the Belvedere
energy-from-waste facility, which is due to come online in
2010.</div>
					<a name="07011712000394"></a><div class="hs_Para">On splitting
collection and disposal, there are problems in shire areas, as some
districts are not providing counties with the data they need to meet
their obligations under the landfill directive. Joint waste disposal
authorities are run by the borough representatives, as my hon. Friend
knows, and so reflect local needs. Splitting collection and disposal
between completely separate political bodies could cause problems
because new technologies need the integration of collection and
disposal.</div>
					<a name="07011712000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
I have been able to reassure hon. Members of the robustness of the
Government&#146;s approach to managing London&#146;s waste. I urge
my hon. Friend not to press her amendments and new clauses to
Divisions, and I hope that clauses 36 and 37 will stand part of the
Bill.</div>

							<a name="07011712000663"></a>Ms
Buck:
						</b>
						I shall be brief. The comments
made by the Minister and by Opposition Members fall into two
categories. The first is that we are basically doing all right, so any
fundamental changes such as those I have proposed would pose a risk to
the objectives, which I think we broadly share. The second, stressed by
the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington, is that there is a
conflict between the Government&#146;s devolutionary intentions and
the centralising of responsibility involved in the creation of a single
waste authority.</div>
					<a name="07011712000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do
not accept either of those arguments. We are not doing well enough. It
is fair to say, as the Minister did, that there has recently been a
degree of improvement in recycling performance and that the core
responsibilities for collection and recycling would remain with the
boroughs. However, we face a number of challenges, across the spectrum,
that will only intensify as targets bite more severely, and that
entails the fundamental risk that authorities will be faced with fines
or landfill charges.</div>
					<a name="07011712000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">There has been a degree of
improvement on recycling, but we are being asked to accept mediocrity.
In the face of both external challenges, such as population growth, and
the fundamental policy objective of rising to the test of climate
change, we need to do something that is better than mediocre. We must
make London as great a city on these issues as we seek, in many ways
successfully, to make it on a number of other fronts. That point was
drawn out by my hon. Friends the Members for Brent, South and for
Mitcham and Morden. I thank them for their contributions.</div>
					<a name="07011712000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I tried to illustrate, I
accept the devolution argument, but we must make a pragmatic and not an
ideological judgment about which duties fit most comfortably at the
strategic level and which fit
locally.</div>

						 I just wonder whether the hon.
Lady can explain why she is so certain that a single waste authority
would create the dramatic improvements that she seeks. Is it not the
case that, in the initial stages, the mere setting-up of such an
authority would undoubtedly have an impact on boroughs&#146;
abilities to recycle, because they would be focusing on
reorganisation?</div>

							<a name="07011712000665"></a>Ms
Buck:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is advancing an argument against
any change ever. When there is structural change, there is always the
risk that during the period of reorganisation those involved are not
focusing on their core functions. That argument does not apply to
anything else that the Government are doing, but let us put it to one
side.</div>
					<a name="07011712000402"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Of course
there is an element of risk. The issue lies in the fact that a single
authority would be able to commission, to ensure that there is an
ability to be strategic, to examine planning capacity for recycling
plants, to take decisions to invest in new technologies London-wide, to
ensure that contracts for procurement across the entire city are
economic and efficient and allow the development of recycling and new
technologies to help to meet our environmental objectives, in a way
that some boroughs are simply not able to do as they handle only 50,000
tonnes of waste a year.</div>
					<a name="07011712000403"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The other
point is on devolution. As I said in my example about Westminster, what
is in the interests of one borough and what may have the support of
residents in that borough may not necessarily be in the strategic
interests of Londoners, including future Londoners 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column267" />Column number: 268</div>affected by climate change, or in the interests of those other boroughs
through which the rubbish collected by borough A may have to be driven
in order to be taken to plants in other parts of the city or even
outside the city. I am not convinced by that
argument.</div>
					<a name="07011712000404"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
make a step change in order to rise to our climate change targets and
to ensure that we do not fall foul of landfill tax fines. I am not
convinced that the Government&#146;s approach will enable us to make
that step change. It is complex and bureaucratic matter. Indeed, it
enshrines the sort of conflict that my hon. Friend the Minister said
that he hoped to avoid.</div>
					<a name="07011712000405"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have failed to convince my
hon. Friend and the Government to my way of thinking. Judging by the
remarks made by Opposition Members, I have failed to persuade them. Not
being of a martyr tendency, and wishing to return to the subject, I
shall resume my seat.
