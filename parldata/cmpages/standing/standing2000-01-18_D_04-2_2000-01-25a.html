[Continuation from column 138]
<P>
<H5>8.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming—
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 69, in page 6, line 27, leave out `three' and insert `twelve'.
<P>
I shall be brief, as we covered much of the relevant ground earlier. The amendment would redefine the term ``meeting'' in clause 11(4) as a gathering of 12 persons or more, rather than three. It is a probing amendment, which I do not intend to press tonight. We have already covered, in exchanges involving the hon. Members for Southwark, North and Bermondsey and for Hall Green, the status of very small groups of people—two or three—meeting privately, and whether, and in what circumstances, those attending would be judged to be addressing the meeting and therefore committing an offence.
<P>
I draw the Minister's attention to one example of what I am concerned about. One person, an interlocutor of the sort we mentioned earlier, and a translator—which might be appropriate in the case of an international terrorist organisation—would fall foul of the definition specifying three persons or more. There is no magic in the figure of 12 and there is an inevitable arbitrariness about any figure. All that I ask of the Minister this evening is that he renew his earlier assurance that he will meet representatives of the relevant bodies and reflect on whether it is possible to amend the definitions in clause 11 to avoid catching people who are innocent of supporting terrorism.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> This is a helpful probing amendment and I take it in that spirit. I am not sure what meetings with organisations that want to make representations the hon. Gentleman means; I can provide clarification about the Society of Editors.
<P>
The purpose of the proscription regime is to deter and disrupt terrorist organisations. That is what we are about. It is obviously not possible to have a meeting of one person or two people. I agree that there is some element of arbitrariness, but we thought that three was the right number, and were guided in taking that view by the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989 and the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1998. We simply continued that regime. Any figure other than three struck us as even more arbitrary.
<P>
I understand the spirit in which the hon. Gentleman moved the amendment, but I see no strong argument for changing an approach which hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will acknowledge has been reasonably satisfactory.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 41, in page 6, line 31, leave out `ten' and insert' three'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 58, in page 6, line 31, leave out `ten' and insert `five'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> These are also probing amendments, on the issue of the maximum sentence for supporting a proscribed organisation. I have the same question for the Minister that I had earlier, about the number of convictions under the previous legislation, in Northern Ireland and United Kingdom-wide, and what range of sentences was given. Clearly, in the league table of these matters, membership of a proscribed organisation should in most people's view carry a lower straightforward conviction tariff than support for such an organisation, without other aggravating features. I suggested with respect to clause 10 setting the level at the lower end and that was why, for the purposes of debate, I focused on the alternative of six months, on summary conviction.
<P>
Amendment No. 41 is intended to test the water. Supporting a proscribed organisation is a higher level of offence, but it is still not as serious as some others. I am not committed to, or pretending that I am committed to, the alternative in the amendment. However, it would help to be aware of the Government's thinking.
<P>
What process will be used to review the tariff for sentences under the Bill as part of the general process of criminal law review? Tariffs are periodically reviewed. We have discussed the frequency with which the legislation is reviewed. The Minister wrote to hon. Members and to me today about a review process, which was welcome as far as it went, and for which I thank him. I assume that that would allow the tariff question to be raised. However, a criminal justice revision process includes whether the sentences prescribed for offences are right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clark:</B> The hon. Gentleman conceded that the offence of support is more serious than membership, and that the sentences available should be at least as great as for membership. I heard what he said on clause 10. However, we decided to keep the sentence set out there, and I think it reasonable to keep the same sentence in clause 11. I acknowledge that the hon. Gentleman wants a graduated system, with a different starting point from the one that we used, but the issues are serious and it is right that the potential sentences for clause 11 offences should be at least as high as for the membership offence. That is why I hope that the hon. Gentleman will reconsider and withdraw the amendment.
<P>
I shall write to the hon. Gentleman with the detailed information that he wanted about the range of sentences and so on, to help the Committee. I do not have anything clear to tell him about the process for reviewing the tariff, beyond reference to the general process with which he is familiar and the annual review that we may be considering. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment, on the basis that a crime under clause 11 is greater than a crime under clause 10.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The Minister has, at least in part, put the Government's argument on the record. I say ``in part'' because I understand that logically if a 10-year sentence can be given for one offence, another that is more serious should attract at least 10 years. The Minister has not dealt specifically with the logic of differential tariffs. However, I am grateful for his comment that some of the other facts, that may or may not justify the Government's stance, will be made available.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 11 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 12</center></H4>
<H4><center>Uniform</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 17, in page 7, line 1, leave out from `liable' to end of line 5 and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(a) on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or a fine or both, or
<P>
(b) on summary conviction, to
<P>
(a) imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months,
<P>
(b) a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum, or
<P>
(c) both.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment, which is a probing amendment, would reinstate the possibility of a Crown court trial and, consequently, the possibility of the more serious Crown court penalties for the offence of wearing, carrying or displaying an article in support of a terrorist organisation. The provision for Crown court trials and sentencing powers exists within the EPA. The Government have chosen, in re-enacting that part of the EPA, to amend the provision so that only magistrates courts may deal with such offences. That will much reduce the maximum penalty.
<P>
Will the Minister explain the policy behind the decision? In earlier debates on the penalties for membership of a proscribed organisation, the Minister was rightly firm in saying that other courts required the tougher penalties that could be applied only by the Crown court. The offence being considered is akin to that of membership of a proscribed organisation and could be committed by a range of people, from a green recruit to a hardened terrorist. The Government seem to be adopting different approaches. The Committee would be grateful for explanation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> Although I would not wish to diminish the hon. Gentleman's point, the explanation is simple. Clause 12 replicates an offence that appears both in section 3 of the PTA and in section 31 of the EPA. The PTA version of the offence, which has effect in England, Wales and Scotland, is a summary-only offence with a maximum penalty of six months. The EPA version is an either-way offence, with a maximum penalty on indictment of a year.
<P>
In consolidating the legislation, we needed to ensure that the offence had the same penalty throughout the UK, and so had to decide which way to go. We could give the offence either a tougher penalty in Great Britain, or a lesser penalty in Northern Ireland. It is serious, but we decided, on balance, that it was right in principle to align the situation in Northern Ireland with that in Great Britain, rather than vice versa. That is for why we chose the form that is before the Committee, which I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I shall want to reflect on the Minister's remarks before we reach later stages but they were adequate for this evening's purposes, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 12 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 13</center></H4>
<H4><center>Terrorist property</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 71, in page 7, line 10, leave out `which is likely to' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`in respect of which there are reasonable grounds to believe that it will.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are now considering part III and are making great progress. I hope that we need not be here all night; hon. Members Downstairs hope that they need not be here all night, either. I hope that, if they are persuaded to rise early, we shall be able to rise as early as them.
<P>
The amendment would affect the part on terrorist property. The Government have again done the decent thing by starting with a definition so that we at least know where we stand. The benefit of the amendment is that it would tighten the proposals. Offences will arise from ownership of property such as money, as is made clear by subsection (1)(a), which refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``money or other property which is likely to be used''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
for terrorist purposes.
<P>
I should say, not only as a member of the Committee and as a Member of Parliament, but as a lawyer that that is an extremely general definition. My alternative would apply a more common legal test. I apologise that the amendment is longer than the original—many other amendments have been shorter—but it proposes a test of reasonable grounds for belief. I, and others, think that it is important to have clarity and reasonableness, especially given the definition of the offences that we shall soon consider. I would be grateful if the Minister would say whether he is willing to consider the alternative definition.

<P>

<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> My quarrel with the amendment and—if you would indulge me a little, Mr. Stevenson, and so save me from speaking again—amendments Nos. 72 and 73 is their use of ``will''.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am ever so grateful for the hon. Gentleman's continued assistance, but it would put me in difficulty if we started to hedge hop onto other amendments. It is perfectly legitimate to refer to others, which I am sure the hon. Gentleman intended to do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I assure you, Mr. Stevenson, that I will not deal with the other amendments. My comments on this amendment will save me having to speak on the subsequent ones.
<P>
My objection is the grammar used. The proposed substitution,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in respect of which there are reasonable grounds to believe that it will'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is adequate apart from the word ``will''. It would mean that an offence could be deemed to have occurred only after an act had been committed. The Bill would no longer cover the intention to commit a crime. I shall say little more than that, although the point is important. The intention to commit a offence is an offence in itself. The provision should not be that an offence might be said to have occurred only after an act had occurred.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I shall respond first to the points of the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone. A three-level hierarchy of language has been used. The lowest level of proof, under the PTA, provides that property ``may be used'' for terrorist purposes. The Bill proposes a slightly higher level—property ``is likely to be used'' for terrorist purposes. The higher burden of proof is justified because it is important that a case should be demonstrated clearly.
<P>
The proposal of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey—that property will be used for terrorist purposes—wouId raise the level again. That would draw the provision too tightly—it will be much more difficult to prove that property will be used than that it is likely to be used. As the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone said, it might be possible to prove that only after the event. We have raised the hurdle from ``may be used'' to ``is likely to be used'', but to go as far as has been proposed would be to go a stage too far.
<P>
My second point is about the idea of the ``reasonable grounds'' for suspicion specified in the amendment. We believe that the Bill achieves the same result with the defence in clause 17—that someone had ``no reasonable cause'' to suspect. For the reasons that I gave when we discussed clause 10, I believe that a statutory defence is right in this case. It should be for the defence to make and establish a reasonable excuse for what is prima facie wrongful conduct.
<P>
Clause 17(2) says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It is a defence for a person charged with an offence under subsection (1) to prove that he did not know and had no reasonable cause to suspect that the arrangement related to terrorist property''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We believe that that wording meets the point about reasonable intention that led the hon. Gentleman to table the amendment, so I hope that he will consider withdrawing it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I understood the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone to say that if the amendment had read
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in respect of which there are reasonable grounds to believe that it may''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
rather than
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in respect of which there are reasonable grounds to believe that it will'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
he might have joined us. He said that we were cavilling not about the ``reasonable grounds'' test but about the difference between ``will'' and ``may''.
<P>
I understand what the Minister said about hierarchy, and about the statutory defence in clause 17. However, that still leaves us in the same area of debate and difference as before. In terms of the process of bringing a charge and securing a conviction, and of the test involved, there is a difference if it is for the prosecution, rather than the defence, to prove something beyond reasonable doubt—or, in this case, to prove that there are reasonable grounds to believe something. Of course the two sides would be using the same phrase, but the burden of proof will be shifted.
<P>
The Minister may say that it is the Government's consistent view throughout that there should be a lower threshold for the prosecution and a higher threshold for the defence. Of course I understand that a statutory defence does not preclude the ordinary arguments that one would adduce in defence—a point that the Minister very properly made earlier. Are we at one at least in acknowledging that there is still a difference—that he and his colleagues are relying on the defence to argue the ``reasonableness'' case from the defence point of view, and that that is different from my proposal? I understand what has been said about the difference between ``may'' and ``will'', and I know that there is a difference between us over it, but I do not intend to take it further now. Will the Minister simply clarify that we are still at odds over the question of where the burden should rest as between the prosecution and the defence?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I think that I have said all that I have to say on that subject. I realise that we may have different views, but a statutory defence is important, and represents the best way to proceed. That is why we have put it in the Bill in several places. Leaving aside the difference between ``will'', ``may'' and ``likely to'', the statutory defence that we offer in clause 17 is broadly equivalent to the wording that the hon. Gentleman would like. Perhaps I did not understand him correctly, but I stand by what I said before.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I fear that we may have to have recourse to the proverbial—and never highly lauded—lawyers to give us some advice before the next round, but as there are others outside this place who have both more time and more experience to consider such a matter, I shall let it rest for the time being. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 13 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 14</center></H4>
<H4><center>Fund-raising</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 72, in page 7, line 26, leave out `may' and insert `will'. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 73, in page 7, line 33, leave out `or may'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone was right to say that the amendments touch in part on themes similar to those that we discussed on amendment No. 71. They would both change the word ``may'' to the word ``will''—amendment No. 72 in subsection (1)(b), and amendment No. 73 in subsection (3)(b). That would mean, as the Minister said earlier, a change in the threshold. The only substantial difference is that we are now dealing with the offence of fund raising, and the issue—it has been raised with me, as much as by me—is that we will be able to convict people for receiving money, if there is reasonable cause to suspect that it may be used for the purposes of terrorism.
<P>
I understand why the provision is in the Bill. Money is, self-evidently, hugely important to the support and development of terrorist organisations. It is a question of judgment, however, whether we want to sweep into the criminal law people who receive money with no intention of using it, but have reasonable cause to believe that it may be used for the purposes of terrorism. If we leave the clause like that, much will depend on whether we trust the prosecuting authorities—a point similar to that made earlier by the Minister.
<P>
Wise prosecutors would not proceed against someone who came by resources used in terrorism, unless they were sure that he or she was an active agent; the accidental possession of property would be insufficient. Only a mile from here, one can easily buy goods that have been given to the seller illegally. Such goods are readily available, for there is plenty of buying and selling of goods that have fallen off the back of the proverbial lorry, or come from other such sources, in this city, as in every other city. We should try to make sure that people get nicked only if they are knowing participants in the illegal process.
<P>
Finally, when the Minister is asking the civil servants for information on offences and severity of punishment, will he also seek information relating to all the other matters that we have raised? They are part of a set, and I do not want to repeat the request at the end of each amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I assure the hon. Gentleman that I shall try to put together a significant document. I do not know how much information is available on the various points, so I cannot give an absolute commitment, but I shall try to assist the Committee as he requests.
<P>
I will not add to what I said earlier. A threshold using ``will'', rather than ``may'', is too steep. With regard to the other points that he made, I refer to subsection (2):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``A person commits an offence if he—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) receives money or other property, and''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I emphasise ``and''—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(b) intends that it should be used, or has reasonable cause to suspect that it may be used, for the purposes of terrorism.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is not just money falling off the back of a lorry; it is money falling off the back of a lorry, plus reasonable cause to suspect that the money will be used for a certain purpose. The hon. Gentleman's criticism is unwarranted; it is not just a question of some money appearing somewhere and an innocent person not knowing what has happened. Paragraph (b) requires that the person
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``intends that it should be used, or has reasonable cause to suspect that it may be used, for the purposes of terrorism.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is an important qualification.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Is the Minister alluding to the use of what may appear to be legitimate businesses to finance terrorism? Is that not also covered by the clause, and is he not conscious of that major source of funding for illegal terrorist organisations?

<P>

<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> That is a fair point. Certainly, the Bill would cover that practice, if it were proved.
<P>
I have just been reminded that article 2 of the United Nations convention for the suppression of the financing of terrorism, which the United Kingdom signed on 10 January, defines the basic terrorist financing offences as follows:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Any person commits an offence within the meaning of this Convention if that person by any means, directly or indirectly, unlawfully or wilfully, provides or collects funds with the intention that they should be used or in the knowledge that they are to be used, in full or in part, in order to carry out''<P>

acts of terrorism. We are trying to make our legislation compatible with the UN convention.
<P>
<H5>9 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am happy that we have tested the water. The Minister's answer was consistent with what he said before, and I am grateful for his undertaking, which means that I will not have to press him on the history of offences and sentences for offences. All of the present set of clauses will be subject to the same concerns. We have aired them now, so I am happy not to pursue matters. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> Does the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey want to go home early?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> In answer to the hon. Member for Solihull, I do not know how many minutes we are taking per clause, but at the current rate he need not worry too much.
<P>
This is one of the clauses to do with money that probably gives the greatest concern. Fundraising requires active participation, but the clause is about the passive use and possession of money. The definition of the offence in subsection (2) refers to someone possessing ``money or other property'' and either intending that it should be used or having reasonable cause to suspect that it may be used for the purposes of terrorism. The argument put to me, which I will repeat rather than reinterpret, was that the possession of money alone is innocuous and should not be treated in the same way as possession of a weapon. Everyone possesses money. If the offence were enacted, people with only a few pounds in their pockets, who merely thought about giving that money to a terrorist organisation, would be guilty of an offence without ever having acted on that thought.
<P>
I am not 100 per cent. certain that that accurately reflects how I would interpret the clause. That was how the argument was put to me, and it may slightly misrepresent how the clause is drafted. However, people might come by money for a period and then become concerned, after receiving information, that the money was destined for terrorists. They could be caught before they could dispose of that money. In the real world, people can be intimidated into holding money and may not be able immediately to dispose of it. It is not terribly easy to get rid of stolen or tainted goods or money that is the profit of drug dealing or that has been used for terrorist purposes. A cache of money cannot simply be handed over to the next person, and we must reflect for a moment to ensure that we are not catching innocent users of the most common commodity of all. One point validly made to me was that everybody is likely to carry money and therefore that everybody can be caught by the provision. We must be careful that the clause is tightly drawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I shall be brief. It is hard to believe that anybody would go to the time and expense of prosecuting somebody who wanted to give his widow's mite to a terrorist organisation. My assumption was that the clause had been designed with the treasurer of a terrorist organisation in mind. It seems perfectly reasonable that someone who possesses a large amount of money or other property and intends to use it to support terrorism should be subject to the criminal law. If the Bill did not use the words ``reasonable cause to suspect'', we would provide an easy get-out for people who said that they had no intention of giving the money to the IRA or whomever. I have no doubt that such a measure is needed and I am willing to trust the enforcement agencies and the courts to consider the facts in each case. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey expressed concerns that have been legitimately raised with him as a member of the Committee and a spokesman for his party, but this is a case of fears running ahead of the reality of the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I must refer the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey to the text of clause 15, which is straightforward. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``A person commits an offence if he—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) possesses money or other property''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That relates to the hon. Gentleman's point about having money in one's pocket. One needs not a lawyer's training but simply elementary logic to understand what comes next. The clause goes on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``and<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) intends that it should be used, or has reasonable cause to suspect that it may be used, for the purposes of terrorism.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I honestly believe that that is absolutely clear. The clause will not apply to someone who simply has money in his pocket. There must be a clear intention that it will be used, or
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``reasonable cause to suspect that it may be used, for the purposes of terrorism.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I honestly think that that is as clear as daylight and is simply not susceptible to the interpretation that those who are paying suit to the hon. Gentleman place upon it. The clause is absolutely clear and the wording should stand in the current form.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 15 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 16</center></H4>
<H4><center>Funding arrangements</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I have one short question for the Minister, which has been raised with me by no less an august body than the Law Society of Scotland—not an organisation with which I was previously familiar. Will the Minister elucidate the meaning of the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``becomes concerned in an arrangement''?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My understanding is that two interpretations are possible. My layman's reading of it is that it is designed to catch somebody who works for a bank, financial institution or company involved in money laundering and who discovers during his work funding arrangements for a terrorist organisation. Unless he gets out of the organisation or reports his discovery to the authorities, he becomes complicit and subject to the criminal offence in the clause.
<P>
It has been put to me that the phrase ``becomes concerned in'' could also be interpreted, in a more restrictive sense, as implying a deliberate concerted action by a group of people. The Law Society of Scotland says that there is no statutory definition of the phrase in this Bill or in any other legislation of which it is aware, but that it has been developed by case law in the context of drugs legislation. Therefore, it might help to create certainty if the Minister could explain what lies behind the phrase.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I am conscious that my point is tangential to funding arrangements. I was not sure whether to raise it under this clause, under clause 11 on support, or under clause 14 on fundraising. I hope that it is in order to mention it at this point. If not, perhaps the Minister will reflect on it and give me an answer later or write to me.
<P>
I am concerned about terrorists using the internet for publicity purposes. As that would not constitute hosting a meeting, I could not raise my concern under clause 11. It may be relevant now because the Minister might legitimately tell me how one could crack down on such activities and switch off the internet service provider if it was involved in an arrangement whereby money or other property was made available. I am trying desperately to remain in order and to make a valid point about terrorists using the internet. If the Minister has the answer, but it is inappropriate for him to give it now, perhaps we can find a legitimate excuse to deal with the issue later when it is in order. Perhaps we need a new clause to enable us to take powers to close down propaganda outlets.
<P>
I know how difficult it is to crack down on anything on the internet. I have a little experience of the Minister's Department, and I know that it is almost impossible to crack down on pornography and all the other abuses on the internet. However, I would hate us to achieve success with clauses 11, 14 and 15 and to have methods of getting at funding arrangements in clause 16, but then to discover that terrorist organisations had used anonymous sources to set up web pages with huge splashes of propaganda all over them. The Minister knows what I am getting at and I will not labour the point, because I am in danger of getting out of order. However, this is the only clause on which I thought that I could raise my concern.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> My speech will be even shorter than that by the hon. Member for Aylesbury. Someone who qualifies under clause 16(a) might have reasonable cause to suspect that an arrangement involved money that would be used for terrorism. If the money was never going to be used for that purpose and the transaction was entirely innocent, however, could that person be convicted?
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I shall take the points that have been made in reverse order, if I may. The right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border made an absolutely fair point. I must confess that I thought that we would deal with the issues that he raised under clause 52, but perhaps I am wrong about that. However, I am advised that a Bill on the regulation of interceptions—which we shall shortly lay before the House—and possibly the Electronic Communications Bill will deal with some of those issues. Whichever route we take, I assure the right hon. Gentleman that we shall consider his point, which was fair and well made. I shall communicate with him on the way in which we deal with it. I am not sufficiently clear about it to respond properly now.
<P>
On the point raised by the hon. Member for Aylesbury, the phrase ``becomes concerned in'' is intended to cover people who, although they do not initiate an arrangement, subsequently become involved in it. I am advised that the wording in the clause is unambiguous from that point of view, but I am prepared to examine what the Law Society of Scotland has said to see whether further clarity is needed. However, our advice is that the present wording is watertight as regards the concerns that have been expressed.
<P>
On the question raised by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, the relevant phrase is clear. The clause uses the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``knows or has reasonable cause to suspect that it will or may be used for the purposes of terrorism.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The question whether money is finally used is relevant, but it is not the decisive factor. Money might, for example, be collected to fund the exploding of a bomb, but the security forces and law enforcement agencies might be able to prevent the explosion by finding the money. In that case, the money would not have been used for the intended purpose, although it would be reasonable to suspect that it might have been. Again, the wording is fairly clear. As I said on earlier clauses, our intention is clearly to examine the activities of people who know that resources are being used for terrorism or who have reasonable cause to suspect that they are.

<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I do not criticise the Minister for making such a straight-bat argument, but I want to give just one example of what I mean. Someone might be party to an agreement whereby money comes into his home. He might suspect that somebody is going to collect it in a month to make arms purchases. However, it might be a surreptitious payment as part of a matrimonial settlement and have nothing to do with terrorism—the person might simply have got the wrong idea. The Minister understands the question. Can one be done if what one suspects is a terrorist-linked activity actually relates to goods that have nothing to do with terrorism?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I do not have much to add to what I said earlier. I understand the Hon. Gentleman's point, but I do not think that it has substance. In the case that he describes, the individual believes or has reasonable cause to suspect that the money will be used for terrorist activities but decides to do nothing about it. This law will rightly cover that, irrespective of what eventually happens to the resource.

<P>
<H5>9.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> We have had more representations about this clause than any that we have debated so far. The most prestigious of those is from Lord Lloyd of Berwick, who says that the clause should not be in the Bill. Therefore, I want to challenge the Minister on the clause that has been most widely criticised for eating into civil liberties.
<P>
On page 93 of Lord Lloyd's ``Inquiry into Legislation against Terrorism'' he addresses the suitability of retaining the present law, as set out in section 18 of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989. The section relates to the failure to disclose information about acts of terrorism, and is replicated in the Bill. Lord Lloyd states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It is an offence, punishable by up to five years imprisonment, to fail to report to the authorities information which might be of material assistance in preventing the commission of an act of terrorism connected with the affairs of Northern Ireland, or in securing the apprehension of a person for such an offence. The provision applies throughout the UK.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Lord Lloyd says that the measure is one of the more controversial in the Act. He points out that when Lords Colville and Shackleton reviewed the legislation they recommended the repeal of that provision, although he also notes that Lord Jellicoe, in his review, recommended that it should stay. He goes on to analyse the argument, and writes:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The offence clearly targets the person who finds him or herself on the fringes of terrorist activity. Such a person might, perhaps, have rendered assistance to someone whom he later discovers to be engaged on a terrorist enterprise. Or he might be close to the person concerned and thus have discovered what he is about. A public spirited citizen would have little difficulty in resolving that his duty lay in informing the police of his suspicions. The purpose of the offence is to bring home to the person who puts personal considerations above the public safety that staying silent is not an acceptable option where terrorism is concerned.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Then, referring to one of the reviews of the law, Lord Lloyd says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``In his admirable and well-balanced examination, Walker could find little evidence that the offence has been of much practical value in increasing the flow of information to the police, and he is concerned about the `chilling' effect on the reporting of terrorism by the media . . . It is undoubtedly true that the offence has been little used. In Great Britain only 28 people have been charged since the offence was introduced in the 1976 Act, of whom 10 were convicted. The figures for Northern Ireland are rather higher.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Lord Lloyd sets out two substantive criticisms. First, he says that although we have
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a moral obligation to help the police, the state should be reluctant to transform this into a legal duty. The second argument is . . . that prosecutions''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
under the Act—and, it would follow, under the clause that the Government suggest should replace it—are almost always used against families of people suspected being involved in terrorism, and place family members in an untenable position of conflicting loyalties. As a result of Lord Jellicoe's consideration of the proposal, the Home Office issued a circular to provide guidance on the use of the provision in order to temper the Act's draconian nature. On the Act and the subsequent circular, Lord Lloyd of Berwick stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Where I differ from Lord Jellicoe is that I do not regard it as satisfactory to create a wide-ranging offence, and then circumscribe it by a Home Office Circular. Since the abolition of the common law offence of misprision of felony in 1967, it is no longer an offence simply to withhold information which would assist the police. The policy of the criminal law has set the other way. There are some limited statutory exceptions . . . But to make an exception in the case of terrorism would be inconsistent with the first of the principles which I have set out in Chapter 3. This was the view of the Government when the offence was first proposed by a Private Member in 1974. It was also Lord Colville's view . . . I agree with those views. I do not think that the police would be seriously hampered by the absence of the section 18 power once peace is established in Northern Ireland. I therefore recommend that the offence of withholding information in relation to terrorism should not appear in the new legislation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have not comprehensively read every one of Lord Lloyd's recommendations and checked them off, although I have such a check-off list and may do so. However, he makes a clear recommendation not to continue with existing law. The Government's response, on page 58 of their consultation paper, betrays a stitching-together of officials' writing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I intervene simply because I believe that the hon. Gentleman may have got the wrong end of the stick. As I understand them, Lord Lloyd's recommendations relate to section 18A of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act, which covers matters that arise in the course of a trade, a profession, a business or employment, but not to section 18 of that Act, about which we have followed Lord Lloyd's advice. That is why I believe, with respect, that the hon. Gentleman may have got the wrong end of the stick, but he will correct me if I have misunderstood what he is saying.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> If I have, I apologise to the Minister and the Committee, but in his conclusion—which is in bold type—Lord Lloyd recommends that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the offence of withholding information in relation to terrorism should not appear''. <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He refers to that as section 18 of the PTA, which is, as far as I can tell, the most parallel provision to clause 18. Clause 18(1) contains the qualification that the belief or suspicion must be based on information acquired in carrying out a trade, a profession, a business or employment. It specifies subsets of how the information could be acquired.
<P>
If the Minister is saying that the Government have merely limited the provision to continue the offence in order to exclude ways of receiving information other than in a professional and business context, I stand corrected, and a considerable drawing back from the original provision that appears in existing legislation has taken place. If that is so, however, I am not the only one to have misunderstood it, because it has been the subject of widespread representations, some of which, I assume, the Minister will have seen.
<P>
I am very happy—it may shorten proceedings—to enable the Minister to speak to the clause, so that the hon. Member for Aylesbury and I may respond to what he says.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I, too, have read the explanatory notes, and a distinction is made between section 18A and section 18, which, according to the notes, the Government have decided not to replicate. It would be helpful if the Minister could explain.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I think that the confusion has arisen because of the number 18. We are dealing with sections 18 and 18A of the PTA and with clause 18 of the Bill, and have gradually become confused as we have gone round in circles. The offence in section 18 of the PTA of failure to disclose information on terrorist acts is not included in the Bill, because it is of questionable practical benefit and criminalises the families of terrorists, as the hon. Gentleman suggests. However, the similar but more narrowly focused offence in section 18A of the PTA, which is replicated in clause 18(1) (b)—I apologise for repeating the numbers—requires disclosure of suspicion gained in the course of trade, business or employment. In the words of the clause, it applies where a person:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``bases his belief or suspicion on information which comes to his attention in the course of a trade, profession, business or employment''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the specific context that we are discussing.
<P>
I hope that that meets the hon. Gentleman's concerns. I am sorry if we have been responsible for any confusion. We believe that we are following Lord Lloyd's recommendations in not including the provisions of section 18 of the PTA, but including those of section 18A of that Act. I hope that that is clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> Like the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, I have received a number of representations from organisations that are dissatisfied with the clause as it is drafted. In view of those representations and of the criticisms made by Lord Lloyd, I have tried to think through the rationale of what my opinion should be. Since it is again the Society of Editors that has expressed particularly strong concern, that will doubtless be another item on the Minister's lengthening agenda at his forthcoming meeting with that organisation, which has serious concerns about the impact of the clause on journalists' freedom to do their job. They argue in particular that the defence of reasonable excuse is uncertain; a journalist or his employer would have to second-guess whether the courts would accept as reasonable excuse the confidentiality of journalistic sources and define at what stage in his investigation a journalist would be obliged to report his suspicions. He might come across information about terrorist intentions or activity that later proved to be ill-founded, for example, and it would clearly not be in people's interests for police time to be wasted by journalists reporting all the many rumours that they pick up when going about their normal occupation.
<P>
Having read the clause and thought about the criticisms of it, I believe that the Government are right to include it in the Bill. The removal of the reference to family members, along the lines suggested by Lord Lloyd, removes the aspect of the old legislation that attracted the most criticism and was seen as objectionable. We have a public duty to report suspicions of criminal activity to the police, but it is also reasonable that, in view of the particular threat posed by terrorism to our society, people should have an additional legal obligation to report suspicions. The clause can also have a deterrent effect on people who might otherwise be tempted to turn a blind eye to information that comes their way. We are all fallible human beings, motivated not always by public duty but by self-interest, natural cowardice and other drives. It is therefore not unreasonable for people's strength of mind to be bolstered by such a clause.
<P>
Finally, I take the opportunity given by our short debate on the clause to make it clear that I and my party firmly support the package of clauses on terrorist finances. When the Conservative party was in office we made several—admittedly piecemeal—moves in that direction. The Government are right to consolidate measures to extend the powers and the provisions regarding the financing of international and domestic terrorism. I am therefore happy to support the clause.

<P>

<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I tinkered with some measures on disclosure of information in the previous Government, but I cannot remember exactly when.
<P>
This part of the Bill is important, and the clause is one of its most vital provisions. Every time that I visited the National Criminal Intelligence Service, it said that its future depended on receiving such information. Banks and other financial institutions are amazingly co-operative with regard to passing on information about odd transactions. Given the way in which money moves around the world, a lot of money arrives in banks in odd circumstances. Many people who make unusual financial deals are genuine and turn out to be innocent, but many are not. NCIS and our security organisations would be impossibly hampered if they did not have these provisions.
<P>
I do not know how much the Government have changed the clause from its form in some of the previous Government's legislation. They may have tinkered with it, tightened it up, cleaned it up or simplified it, but I am happy with its general principle and think that it is vital that it stays in the Bill. I wish the Government more strength to their elbow in using it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for making it clear that we are now dealing with the more limited provision, and I do not dissent from the view that there ought to be such a provision. Unusually, I agree with the hon. Member for Aylesbury and the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border.
<P>
I have three specific questions. First, is the hon. Member for Aylesbury right about the representation from the Society of Editors? I and possibly other hon. Members have been told by the society that newspaper journalists are, by definition, covered by clause 18(1)(b) for information that comes to them
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in the course of a trade, profession, business or employment''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If so, would it not be worth considering the reasonable case for their exemption? They are a different category to those people, rightfully and understandably referred to by the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border, who deal with bank accounts and watch money coming in and out.
<P>
Secondly, does a power under section 5 of the Criminal Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1967 already deal with the issue? If not, what is the difference? If that legislation covers the matter, why do we need a new provision?
<P>
Thirdly, have the Government considered how to get round the argument that the provision might contravene article 10 of the European convention on human rights, which enshrines the right to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authorities? If so, what conclusion have they come to? I assume that they would use the convention's public protection and defence exemptions, but it would be helpful if the Government could show how they have prepared the clause to be compatible with the convention.
<P>
The Government's consultation paper on section 18 hinted that the Irish Government have such a provision in their legislation. It would be interesting to know whether they do, as a clear parallel between the north and south, where appropriate, is sensible to assist law and order on both sides of the border.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I shall deal with the points raised by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey in reverse order. Article 10 of the European convention on human rights states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The exercise of these freedoms . . .  may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As I said at the outset, we have taken legal advice and we believe that the provision is compliant with the convention and the 1998 Act.
<P>
On the hon. Gentleman's penultimate point, many of those matters are dealt with under section 5 of the Criminal Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1967. Those provisions are restricted to Northern Ireland, but it is at least a belt-and-braces arrangement for Northern Ireland.
<P>
I turn now to a point of substance. One of my first responsibilities as a Minister was to represent the Government at the G8 meeting that discussed organised crime and financial crime in Moscow. We had a full discussion, and all the G8 Governments were united in recognising that dealing with that flow of funds was, as the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border said, critical to enabling us to deal with international terrorism. We signed up to that agreement, as did the United States and all other Governments.
<P>
The clause is vital. Subject only to lawyers' privilege, it is right that accountants, lawyers and others should face up to their responsibilities to society. It is right in principle, because some people on the edge of the professions are not prepared to take their responsibilities seriously. Their professions will be made more dignified if they recognise that obligation, and we should encourage them to do so. That is what the clause is meant to achieve.
<P>
I now come to the first point made by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, which was made also by the Opposition spokesman. I know that he represents somewhere nice in the home counties—ah, yes, the hon. Member for Aylesbury: I shall henceforth think of him as Mr. Duck. Journalists, too, have an obligation to their profession, just like the other professions that we have mentioned, but that should not excuse them from their responsibilities to society. For example, a journalist may become aware that Canary Wharf is about to be blown up but decides not to tell anyone in order to protect his sources. That would be unacceptable.
<P>
Although I accept the integrity of the professions—I mean that sincerely—that must go side by side with the responsibility of the professions and individuals to society as a whole. That is why the clause should be supported. It has the material benefit that it will give rise to the flow of information referred to by the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border, which is important to enable us to deliver our strategy. A defence is allowed under subsection (3), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It is a defence for a person charged with an offence under subsection (2) to prove that he had a reasonable excuse for not making the disclosure.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That statutory defence is important in this context, as it gives some protection.
<P>
For all those reasons, I hope that the Committee will agree that the clause should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

I am still trying to find my place.

<B>Mr. John M. Taylor Will my hon. Friend give way?</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I have now found it. I am grateful for my hon. Friend's offer of help.
<P>
This is another probing amendment. It would provide that the immunity from committing an offence provided for under clause 20 when someone acts with the express consent of a constable applies only when the constable is acting lawfully. The Minister may say that the assumption that the constable is acting lawfully is already contained in the wording. The amendment is designed to test that assumption, and to ask for a fuller explanation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> The assumption of the hon. Member for Aylesbury is entirely correct. If the constable were crooked, his ``express consent'' could not lawfully be given. We do not need the belt and braces that his amendment offers. We believe that the amendment would have no effect on the Bill for the reason that I have given. I hope that that clarifies the matter for the hon. Gentleman.

<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Stevenson. Anxious as I am to help the Committee, and given the long sequence of clauses without amendments to them, may I respectfully ask whether there is a case for putting them as a string?

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Clause 36 is the enabling provision for schedule 5, so the debate should centre on the schedule rather than the clause. Without it, we would not get the schedule, so it would be fairer to the Committee to debate the schedule rather than the clause.

<H4><center>Terrorist Investigations</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the Fifth schedule of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>9.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Various representations have been made to me about schedule 5. May I start with another one from the Society of Editors; I imagine that the hon. Member for Aylesbury also received it. It makes the relevant, valuable point that is often made:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Schedule 5 requires the police to obtain judicial permission for production, access and search in respect of journalistic material in some circumstances. However, this does not appear to allow the media to make any representations against the grant of such permission. The Circuit judge is not in a position to make an informed decision on the satisfaction of the relevant pre-conditions . . . after only hearing the police application.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It also argues that the media should be heard as well, although I should point out that people on both sides of the argument must be heard before the court makes a decision. The Society of Editors goes on:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We are concerned that the procedure also applies to journalistic material that is not yet in existence, and is only expected to materialise within 28 days of the order. This could greatly restrict freedom of expression. It could be deployed as a form of prior restraint. It could result in the media being used by the police to entrap those suspected of terrorist involvement, in the broadest sense that the definition permits. It would certainly restrict the flow of information if sources, journalists and others are aware that any information or documents that they pass on could already be the subject of a police seizure order. There appears to be no protection against entrapment or self-incrimination.
<P>
The problems are increased by the requirement to provide an explanation of any material seized or produced.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It concludes:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Such safeguards as are provided by the requirement of prior judicial consent are undermined by the ways of bypassing the consent requirement. For example, the police could exploit the urgent cases procedure or merely make an application to a Justice of the Peace for a search warrant under paragraph 1. Fishing expeditions could easily be mounted.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those concerns, which could have been expressed by others but happen in this case to have been expressed on behalf of the media, relate to the procedure set out in the schedule for search and investigation. Can the Minister tell us—I have not had the chance to check it line by line—in what way the procedure in the schedule gives more power to the authorities than that for non-terrorist related offences in regard to the apposition of evidence under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984? We should give additional powers only if we believe that they are justified by, and are commensurate and proportional to, the offences. The Minister has accepted that argument in principle so I want to test whether it is accepted in practice.

Finally, what provision is made for the review of the schedule and the powers of the police, other than that under any normal review procedure that the Minister may accept as part of the review processes of the legislation? It seems important to me—and certainly to those involved in the legal process, whether prosecuting or defending—that we know that the powers are not excessive and that they work. Serious additional powers are being given to the authorities and we need always to be vigilant that we do not give them too much power. Liberty should be preserved, unless there is a good case for giving it away. It would therefore be helpful to know the provision for the review of the schedule and the powers contained in it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> As the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey deduced, I too have received representations from the Society of Editors. It has a case that merits a response and I look forward to the Minister's comments on it. The schedule seems to be largely based, with one or two modifications, on the provisions in the existing Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provision) Act 89. I hope that the Minister will flesh out in a little more detail where the differences lie and what accounts for them.
<P>
The explanatory notes drew my attention to two aspects of the schedule's provisions, and I should be grateful for a response—either now or, if that is not possible, in writing. First, I am interested in the discretion that judges are to have over search warrants. Paragraph 108 of the explanatory notes states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Sub-paragraph (5)(c) of paragraph 1 gives the judge a broad discretion over the necessity for a warrant in the particular case. This . . . replaces a narrower set of conditions in paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 7 of the PTA''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
How much broader will the judge's scope for discretion be compared with the conditions that currently apply, and what is the reasoning behind that change?
<P>
Secondly, the notes drew my attention to the changes in the law regarding a defendant's response to an explanation order. Normally, a defendant will be protected from having his response to an explanation order used in evidence against him at a criminal trial. The PTA provides two exceptions to that principle. The first is retained in schedule 5; the notes state that an exception will be made
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``if the criminal trial in question is for the offence of giving a false or misleading answer to the explanation order itself''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is right that that must be capable of being admitted as evidence. The PTA provides another exception to that general rule. The exception is if the person is on trial for ``any other offence'' and during that trial the person
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``makes a statement inconsistent with his response to the explanation order''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That second exception to the principle that a reply to an explanation order may not be deployed in evidence has been dropped in the Bill.
<P>
That change would seem to strengthen the position of the defendant and weaken that of the prosecuting authorities. Are the Chief Constable and the prosecuting authorities content with that? Do the Government believe that the change is safe and that it will not hinder the Government's and the law enforcement agencies' fight against terrorism?
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> As the hon. Members for Southwark, North and Bermondsey and for Aylesbury said, the schedule provides the police with powers to obtain search warrants, production orders and explanation orders in terrorist investigations. It is based on schedule 7 of the PTA. The Committee may be interested to know that those powers are most often used to investigate terrorist funds, and have proved effective.
<P>
I turn to a point raised by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. The essential difference between the powers in schedule 7 and those in PACE is that the PTA provisions do not require the police to satisfy a magistrate or judge that they have reasonable grounds for believing that a serious arrestable offence has been committed. They have only to demonstrate that a terrorist investigation is being carried out, that they have reasonable grounds for believing that material likely to be of substantial value to the investigation is on the premises and that they need a search warrant or production order. That will enable the police to obtain search warrants and production orders at an earlier stage in their investigations than under the PACE provisions.
<P>
The hon. Gentlemen referred also to the substantial references in the schedule to the need to obtain the authority of a justice of the peace or a judge for action that is being taken, although the thrust of the provision is to expedite those processes in relation to terrorism. I do not think that the concerns expressed by the Society of Editors on that point are legitimate. As I said earlier, I am prepared to discuss the matter with the society, and if any points come out in conversation that were not mentioned today, we may have cause to reconsider the matter. However, nothing that I have heard so far leads me to believe that that concern is justified, as its actions and behaviour would not be inhibited significantly.
<P>
I cannot do more than say again that we keep all such matters under constant review. If an annual review of legislation were produced, that would give an opportunity for debate in the House and for people to make representations and observations about every aspect of the Bill's operation, including that of the schedule.
<P>
We believe that the process in the schedule is safe according to the criteria given by the hon. Member for Aylesbury. We do not believe that it is more difficult than it was otherwise, and it is based strongly on the existing legislation. The process is trusted and tried, especially as it relates to terrorist finance, and we have no reason to believe that there are any significant problems with it.
<P>
I hope that on that basis the Committee will approve the schedule.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I neglected to ask the Minister two factual questions, and I am sorry that I did not give him the chance to reply.
<P>
Does paragraph 1(4)(b) of the schedule contain a power to strip search—not in public—that breaks the usual convention, which is that a person of the same sex carries out the search? If so, the normal police practice will not be followed, and people will have no recourse to the law. I understand that a person of the same sex will perform strip searches under clause 41. Is it correct that individuals who do not co-operate will be committing a criminal offence, even if they are women being strip searched by men?
<P>
Am I right to think that paragraph 13 of the schedule provides a power not previously in legislation to require a suspect to explain material found, failure to supply which would be contempt of court? If so, is that compatible with the Saunders judgment by the European Court of Human Rights on the United Kingdom? I admit that I have not read it, but it held that the use of any explanation in subsequent criminal proceedings would violate the right to a fair trial under article 6.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> On the first point, I think that I can satisfy the hon. Gentleman. The searches referred to in the schedule will take place under PACE code A, which means that the same-sex rule applies.
<P>
I confess with some shame that I have not read the Saunders judgment in detail either, so I am not in a position to comment on it. Paragraph 13 is not new, as I understand it. It is in the PTA, as paragraph 112 of the explanatory notes makes clear, so it is not a new departure. However, I plead guilty to my legal ignorance of the details.
<P>
Schedule 5 agreed to.
