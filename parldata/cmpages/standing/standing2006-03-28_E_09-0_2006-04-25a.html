out</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;with the consent of the

Secretary of

of State shall only consent to the publication of proposals under

subsection (1) for the establishment of a community or community

special school if the local authority can demonstrate to the Secretary

of State that the establishment of such a school would lead to

substantially better academic results than would be the case for a

foundation or foundation special

school.'.</div><a name="060425116000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">No.

181, in clause 9, page 7, line 40, at end

insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(1A) The Secretary

of State may not refuse consent under subsection 1(a) in any case in

which the request by the authority for such consent is shown to be

supported by parents in such numbers and in such categories as may be

prescribed by

regulations.'.</div><a name="060425116000019"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000405"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b><b class="B"> </b>Subsection (1) of the clause provides

that:</div><a name="060425116000347"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A local

education authority in England may with the consent of the Secretary of

State publish...proposals to establish&#148;</div>

<a name="060425116000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">a new school otherwise than under clause

7&#151;that is, without a competition or having regard to the other

clause 7 provisions that apply to competitions.</div>

<a name="060425116000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 9 is a repetition of

section 65 of the Education Act 2005, which is more of a safety valve

than a section of real substance or importance. According to the

regulatory impact assessment, the objective of section 65 is:</div>

<a name="060425116000348"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;To promote diversity

by extending the requirement for secondary school competitions so that

competitions are held whenever a new school is proposed unless the

Secretary of State decides that a competition is not required in an

individual case.&#148;</div><a name="060425116000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

section therefore dealt with individual cases and was intended to cover

unforeseen

exceptions.</div><a name="060425116000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill

repeals section 65 of the 2005 Act and replaces it with clause 9, which

is simply an updated version of section 65, but which relates to

primary schools as well as secondary schools. The regulatory 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column353" />Column number: 353</div>impact assessment relating to the Bill confirms that point in paragraph

5.20, stating

that:</div><a name="060425116000349"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

requirement on local authorities to seek the prior consent of

the&#148;</div><a name="060425116000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secretary of

State</div><a name="060425116000350"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to propose new

community schools is therefore intended to apply only in exceptional

circumstances. Similar provisions already exist where the Secretary of

State gives consent for the publication of proposals for new schools

outside competitions. The purpose of requiring local authorities and

others to seek consent is to ensure that there is greater

contestability and that local people have the opportunity to consider a

range of proposals from different providers when new schools are to be

established.&#148;</div><a name="060425116000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">That

paragraph refers to clause 7 as well as clause 9, but it is clear that

clause 9 is meant to be used only in exceptional circumstances because

the aim of the Bill is to ensure greater contestability when new

schools are being proposed.</div>

<a name="060425116000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">We agree with that aim, and

the purpose of amendment No. 29 is to promote that purpose further. If

subsection (1) were removed, local authorities would lose the right to

seek the consent of the Secretary of State to establish a new school

without going through a competition; clause 9 would apply only to

non-local authority proposers of new schools. The amendment would thus

make the Bill even stronger and move it further in the direction set

out by the

Government.</div><a name="060425116000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">In fact,

paragraph 5.17 of the regulatory impact assessment

states:</div><a name="060425116000351"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Under

the extensions proposed in the WP, there might be around 100

competitions a

year&#148;</div><a name="060425116000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">under clause 7,

but</div><a name="060425116000352"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This

would depend on the frequency with which the Secretary of State

exercised her powers to allow proposals for new schools outside a

competition.&#148;</div><a name="060425116000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not

necessarily against the Secretary of State using such powers, but it

would be helpful if the Minister set out the circumstances in which she

envisages those powers being exercised.</div>

<a name="060425116000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 28 is a

variation on the theme of amendment No. 29, but instead of removing the

whole of subsection (1), it would remove only paragraph (a), which

refers to local authorities that wish to establish a new community

school. The right of a local authority to establish a new foundation

school outside of a competition, with the permission of the Secretary

of State, would remain. Again, the amendment would help to achieve the

Government&#146;s objective of achieving more diversity of

provision.</div><a name="060425116000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 77 essentially is the same as the amendment that we tabled in

relation to clause 7. It sets out the fall-back position that if the

Secretary of State decides not to exercise her veto, the criteria for

permitting a local authority to establish another community school will

be confined strictly to cases in which there is clear evidence that

such a school would achieve better academic results than a foundation

school.</div><a name="060425116000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to

amendment No. 67, tabled by the hon. Member for Brent, East (Sarah

Teather) and her colleagues, and amendment No. 181, tabled by the hon.

Member for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor). Amendment No. 67 is superficially

similar to the amendment that the Liberals tabled to clause 7, in that

it would remove the need to seek the consent of the Secretary of State

if 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column354" />Column number: 354</div>a local authority wishes to establish a new community school. I say

&#147;superficially&#148; because, although the amendment is worded

similarly to the previous amendment, when applied to clause 9 it would

provide local authorities with much greater powers than they have now.

It would allow a local authority to set up any type of school without

going through the competition process set out in clause 7. I am not

sure whether that is what the Liberals intended, but it would take us

back to the position before the Education Act 2002. We will therefore

oppose the amendment if it is pressed to a

Division.</div><a name="060425116000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 181 would require the Secretary of State to consent to proposals to

establish a new community school if there was parental support. In

their response to the Education and Skills Committee&#146;s report on

the White Paper, the Government

said:</div><a name="060425116000353"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where a

local authority with a good track record in education proposes a

community school that will command the support of parents, the

Secretary of State will not normally

intervene.&#148;</div><a name="060425116000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose

of the amendment is presumably to put that commitment into the Bill,

but it would do so without the important caveat that the local

authority must have a good track record in education. I guess that the

hon. Member for Bury, North does not care about that point and is happy

for local authorities with a poor track record to continue to establish

new schools on the same

basis.</div><a name="060425116000035"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="060425116000406"></a><b class="B">Mr.

David Chaytor</b> (Bury, North) (Lab): That remark is unworthy

of the hon. Gentleman. He argued last week that the essence of

amendments that I had tabled was little different from the spirit of

his amendment that provided for new schools of a particular kind to be

established on the vote of a specified number of parents. I assert the

importance of the parental voice for one purpose and he asserts it in a

different way for a similar purpose, so I do not think that he can

argue that he is concerned about standards and I am

not.</div><a name="060425116000036"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000407"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point, but his

amendment, No. 181, relates to local authorities, not to the wider

range of proposers to which our amendments referred, and he has

specifically omitted from the amendment any reference to the track

record of a local authority, which is important in relation to allowing

authorities to establish schools outside a

competition.</div><a name="060425116000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is

important to remind the Committee of another comment in the

Government&#146;s response to the Select Committee. The Government

stated:</div><a name="060425116000354"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is

important that local authorities seriously consider all alternatives to

secure the best education for their community, however, and do not just

promote local authority community schools as the default

option.&#148;</div><a name="060425116000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">In their

application to clause 9, amendments Nos. 181 and 67 would create the

same problem: they would allow local authorities to bypass a

competition under clause 7, which would undermine the principle that

local authorities should consider all alternatives to secure the best

possible education for their community, not just promote local

authority community schools. As such, if the hon. Gentleman presses his

amendment, we will oppose it.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column355" />Column number: 355</div><a name="060425116000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">I look forward to hearing the

Minister&#146;s response to the

debate.</div><a name="060425116000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="060425116000408"></a><b class="B">Sarah

Teather</b> (Brent, East) (LD): We accept that the clause is

intended only to apply in special circumstances, and we look forward to

hearing from the Minister what those circumstances will

be.</div><a name="060425116000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 67

is not intended to allow local authorities to get around the need for a

competition. However, clause 9 allows the Secretary of State to get

around that need. Our argument is that even in those special

circumstances, the local authority is best placed to decide what is

most appropriate for its area. We made that argument on clause 7 and I

do not intend to rehearse at great length points that I have already

made in Committee, except to say that we believe that the proper place

for strategic planning of education is within the local authority. It

is the elected tier of government that is closest to the decisions that

have to be made and closest to the people whose lives are affected by

those decisions.</div>

<a name="060425116000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Localism depends on a

willingness to let go. It is true that the implications of our policy

are that in certain areas a Labour council or a Conservative council

might make decisions with which we disagree. We accept that. That is

the nature of localism. If we disagree, we will campaign on a local

level to remove that local council. That is what democracy is all

about. We believe that even in special circumstances&#151;I hope that

the Minister will elucidate those&#151;it is still for the local

authority to make the decisions on what schools best fit the local

area.</div><a name="060425116000043"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000409"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> I shall speak briefly to amendment No. 181. In

one sense we are repeating the arguments that we went through on an

earlier clause. It is important that parents have a voice in the

decision, but that voice should not be used in a systematic way to

allow a small and unrepresentative group of parents to undermine the

broader democratic processes. That is why my amendment does not specify

a minimum number of parents, but allows for the numbers of parents and

the categories of parents to be specified in regulations.</div>

<a name="060425116000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Bognor

Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) said that there was no reference to

the quality of the local education authority, but there is not always a

direct relationship between the quality and the performance of the

local education authority and the quality and the performance of

individual schools within that authority. If there were such a direct

relationship life would be much simpler, but there are many schools of

outstanding quality within local education authorities with poor

performance ratings, and vice versa.</div>

<a name="060425116000045"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000410"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> To pick up on the point that the hon. Gentleman made

just before he came on to that point, he stated proudly that his

amendment does not specify the number of parents that would be required

to demonstrate support and that that would be specified in regulations.

Does he not feel that as an elected Member of Parliament he should have

a say in what the Government would propose in those regulations, and

does he have a view that he can express

now?</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column356" />Column number: 356</div><a name="060425116000046"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000411"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> No, I honestly do not feel qualified to decide

whether 20, 30 or 40 per cent. or 50, 70 or 90 parents is the right

threshold. The matter needs more consideration, which is why it is more

appropriate for secondary legislation.</div>

<a name="060425116000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the question of the quality

threshold of the local authority, my amendment has the advantage that

by allowing for further consideration to be given to the exact number

and category of parents who would be able to exercise their voice in

this way, we can reasonably and safely assume that if a large group of

parents were overwhelmingly in favour of a new community school, it

would reflect very effectively the quality of that LEA. If parents had

no confidence in the performance of their LEA, presumably they would

not sign up to the cause of a new community school. That is an

important point. We have to trust the judgment of parents. In one sense

it is rather patronising to assume that parents would sign up for the

cause of new community school without any knowledge of the quality of

their local education authority. Parents have a better gut instinct of

the quality of what is going on locally than the hon. Gentleman perhaps

gives them credit

for.</div><a name="060425116000369"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45

am</div><a name="060425116000048"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000412"></a>The

Minister for Schools (Jacqui Smith):</b> We have had a short

but good discussion on this group of amendments. The hon. Member for

Bognor Regis and Littlehampton ably spelt out the intentions behind

clause 9, so I will not go over that again.</div>

<a name="060425116000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 29 would prevent

a local authority from proposing to establish any new schools outside a

competition. As we discussed in relation to clause 7, we have

introduced competitions to create and promote diversity and choice

within the education system, and in particular to provide an

environment within which new promoters will be able to propose the

establishment of new schools. However, there are

circumstances&#151;exceptional circumstances; the hon. Gentleman is

right about that&#151;in which a competition might not be

appropriate. In effect, clause 7 is the default position for proposals

for new and reorganised schools, but clause 9 provides some flexibility

to allow a local authority or promoter to propose the establishment of

a new school without the need for a competition.</div>

<a name="060425116000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members have asked me to

outline some of the limited circumstances in which that might be

appropriate. If a school was failing, the local partners, in concert

with expert advisers, might decide that the best way forward would be a

collaborative restart of the school with a particular character and

ethos; that would need to happen quickly and there would have to be a

consensus on how to deal with that example of failure. As for primary

schools, a junior and an infant school sharing a single site might want

to amalgamate to form an all-through primary; we do not think that a

competition would necessarily make sense in those circumstances. I

shall give other examples when I discuss some of the other

amendments.</div><a name="060425116000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of

course, in deciding whether to consent to proposals outside a

competition, the Secretary of State will take into account the local

authority&#146;s track record on educational performance, the

existing degree of 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column357" />Column number: 357</div>diversity in the school system and parental preference and the views

expressed by parents in the area. Also, any proposals by the local

authority, whether for a foundation school or a new community school,

would be decided in such circumstances by the schools adjudicator.

There would be another stage to complete following the Secretary of

State&#146;s consent to the publication of proposals outside a

competition: that stage would consist of consultation, the publication

of proposals and the making of a decision, similar to the process that

have already discussed.</div>

<a name="060425116000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">In those circumstances it is

appropriate for the schools adjudicator to be the decision maker,

because it is important to avoid any question of the authority&#146;s

being judge and jury in its own case. If the Secretary of State agrees,

however, we think it right that a local authority should be able to

publish proposals for a new community or foundation school. I hope that

the hon. Gentleman will realise the sense of that in certain

circumstances, and that he will feel able to withdraw the

amendment.</div><a name="060425116000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 67 would enable local authorities to make proposals outside

competitions without the consent of the Secretary of State. As we have

heard, the arguments are very similar to those that we rehearsed at

length under clause 7 about allowing proposals for new community

schools to be made within competitions without the consent of the

Secretary of State.</div>

<a name="060425116000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">To reiterate some of the

points that I made then, the argument is not about centralisation or

localisation, but about the direction in which we want to move the

local authority&#146;s role and the nature of the dynamic that we

want to create in the school system. We are not opposed to local

education authorities. We are strengthening their role as the champions

of parents and in assuring the quality of provision in an area.

However, that is a modernised role as commissioners of services, rather

than as direct providers.</div>

<a name="060425116000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I suggested earlier, it is

important that we do not, as the amendment would, allow local

authorities to sidetrack competitions. We made it clear in the White

Paper that we think that competitions will normally be the best way to

encourage diversity in the system. If the system is to be open to new

ideas and to innovation by new providers, potential providers should

have the necessary information about opportunities for new schools and

should be encouraged to make proposals for local people to consider.

That is how we are most likely to get a diverse range of schools, which

will increase not only the choice for parents and pupils, but the

chance that schools will learn from each other. Clause 9, like clause

7, represents the right balance between encouraging a diverse and

dynamic system and allowing proposals outside a competition when that

makes sense.</div>

<a name="060425116000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 28 would remove

the ability of a local authority to propose a community school outside

a competition. We had a lengthy discussion last week about what we said

in the White Paper and the fact that we considered that there might be

circumstances in which it would make sense for a local authority to

promote a community school either under the clause 7 arrangements or,

in certain circumstances, outside a competition.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column358" />Column number: 358</div><a name="060425116000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">In circumstances in which the

Secretary of State agrees that a community school might be the right

option, a local authority should be able to publish proposals for that

community school or a community special school. As I have said, the

normal route would be to hold a competition under clause 7 and the

local authority would propose a new community school as part of that

competition. The decision will be made according to criteria that, as I

have said, wewill produce on Report. However, in exceptional

circumstances, a local authority should be able to make the case for

proposing a community school without a competition. I gave the example

of the collaborative restart idea in the case of failure. It seems to

be appropriate for that option to be available, with the consent of the

Secretary of State.</div>

<a name="060425116000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 77 would limit

the Secretary of State&#146;s power to agree to allow a local

authority to publish proposals for a new community school outside a

competition unless the authority can provide evidence that the

establishment of such a school would lead to better results. Without

going over old ground, I have made it clear that we think that the

circumstances in which we agree to a school being established without

competition will be limited. I have already given the example of a

failing school that is to be replaced by an agreed collaborative

restart.</div> <a name="060425116000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another

example, which would not directly meet the criteria outlined by the

hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton but which I think he

might think would be appropriate, would be if denominational schools in

an area were being reorganised and it was proposed that the replacement

school or schools be of the same denomination. In such a case, we would

not be talking directly about a standards test. However,if,

say, two Roman Catholic schools were being reorganised because of

falling rolls, it would be appropriate to propose one Roman Catholic

school to replace them. That would seem to be an appropriate

circumstance in which to make a proposal outside a

competition.</div> <a name="060425116000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was

our intention in the White Paper to say that new community schools

should not be able to be established in any circumstances, but we

listened to representations from hon. Members, local authorities and

others, and agreed that there are circumstances in which a community

school might be the right option. Also, as I have suggested, it might

be appropriate to allow proposals outside a competition even in

circumstances in which there is not, as the amendment suggests, a clear

standards case. It is important to allow freedom to consider all the

factors in each case&#151;the process should not be purely

mechanistic.</div><a name="060425116000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

amendment is narrow and could lead to arguments and counter-arguments

about the respective merits of different categories of schools, whereas

what we want is the best school for each area&#151;one that meets the

specific needs of local parents and of the community. Of course, as I

said, even if the Secretary of State agrees that proposals can be

published, the final decision will be for the schools adjudicator, who

will naturally consider the impact on local standards and

circumstances. If the proposals do not provide hard evidence that a

school will make a positive contribution to local standards, to

community needs, and to parental choice, I expect that the proposals 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column359" />Column number: 359</div>would be rejected. Consideration of standards is therefore included in

the process for publication of proposals, so I hope that the hon.

Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton agrees that there may well be

circumstances that would not fit into his proposals. Our priority is to

secure high standards, but we also need to be free to judge each case

on its own merits.</div>

<a name="060425116000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my hon.

Friend the Member for Bury, North said, we had a similar discussion on

the role of parents in relation to clause 7 as we have had on

amendmentNo. 181, so I shall not rehearse the arguments in

detail, because our position is well known. We strongly support the

role of parents and we have made specific provision in the Bill to

strengthen it. My hon. Friend is right to argue that that role should

be developed in a systematic way that recognises the variety of

different ways in which parents may make representations or express

concerns. That is why, when we discussed clauses 2 and

3,which place new duties on local authorities to promote

diversity and parental choice and to respond to specific

representations from parents, we discussed the ways in which we would

expect local authorities to respond and examined in detail the guidance

published alongside those clauses&#151;guidance that explained the

action that we expect from local

authorities.</div><a name="060425116000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">If

parents wanted a community or a foundation school that was being

proposed by the authority, that would add weight to the arguments in

favour, but it would not be the only or the decisive factor. I hope

that my hon. Friend is reassured about how seriously we take the need

to consider parents&#146; requirements and by our recognition of the

complexity involved in doing so. I hope that he will be willing not to

press his

amendment.</div><a name="060425116000064"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="060425116000413"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Gibb</b>: I am grateful to the Minister for that comprehensive

explanation of her resistance to the amendments. She cited a suitably

narrow range of examples of when the provisions of clause 9 would be

needed by a local authority to establish a school outside of the

competition arrangements of clause 7. That confirmed my understanding

of the clause, that it is only to be used by local authorities in

exceptional circumstances. She convinced me that the wording of

amendment No. 29 may be unnecessarily wide, in that it would remove any

possibility of a local authority establishing a school outside of the

competition arrangements. The examples that she cited of when a local

authority may wish to do that were

valid.</div><a name="060425116000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I was

unconvinced by her justification for not removing the ability of local

authorities to establish a community school outside the competition

arrangements. As with clause 7, I believe that that provision was

inserted into clause 9 as a concession to Labour party rebels.

Therefore, although I shall withdraw amendment No. 29, I shall move

amendment No. 28 formally at the appropriate

point.</div><a name="060425116000370"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000414"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> The Minister argues that that

the presence of the Secretary of State&#146;s veto in the clause and

elsewhere is not about centralisation, but that is precisely what it is

about and I do not understand how she can conclude otherwise. The

definition of centralisation is taking power away from local

authorities and putting it 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column360" />Column number: 360</div>in the hands of the Secretary of State. We can come to no other

conclusion. It is like arguing that the world is flat when we know it

is round, or that the sun is shining when it is raining. It is no good

arguing that something is the case when it blatantly is not. The right

hon. Lady is right to say that the clause is about the role of local

authorities and what we consider it to be. We believe that their role

should be to make decisions about their local

area.</div><a name="060425116000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause

allows the Secretary of State to sidetrack competition. If that is not

what the right hon. Lady wanted, the clause should have been drafted

differently. Our amendment provides that in the special circumstances

when we do not want the competition rules to apply, the decision-making

body would be the local authority, not the Secretary of State. That is

a point of principle and we shall divide the Committee on amendment No.

67.</div><a name="060425116000068"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000461"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> The reason for tabling the amendment is based on

arguments similar to those that I advanced earlier and in a previous

sitting: even in the special circumstances in which an external body

may come forward to publish proposals outside the remit of a

competition, the body whose agreement must be sought should be the

local authority, not the Secretary of State. The local authority is

best placed to decide about the circumstances in an area, what criteria

should be used to set up a school, and what kind of school it should

be. The local authority should take that strategic role, as the

Minister argued elsewhere.</div>

<a name="060425116000126"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="060425116000462"></a><b class="B">Mr.

John Hayes</b> (South Holland and The Deepings) (Con): Before

I speak to amendment No. 30, I welcome you again to the Chair, Mr.

Cook, as ever. Indeed, why not do so on a regular basis?</div>

<a name="060425116000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon. Member for Brent,

East rightly said, the amendment tabled by the Liberal Democrats

reprises the argument that has run throughout the Committee between the

different parties about the nature of the role of LEAs and the balance

between that and the role of local communities and the Secretary of

State.</div> <a name="060425116000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Different

views on the matter have emerged and I want to make it clear that we

perceive a role for LEAs in education, as my hon. Friend the Member for

Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said at our last sitting. Had we not

believed that, we could not reasonably have supported the Bill, because

it perceives an ongoing role for LEAs. However, the Bill makes

important changes to that role, and the hon. Lady&#146;s amendment

and her comments on it reflect earlier comments that show a difference

between the Liberal Democrats&#146; perspective on the subject and

that of the Opposition and the Government. Our views on education are

not identical to those of the Government, but we are close to their

position on the corresponding roles of LEAs and the Secretary of State

because we appreciate that although local government is more than an

agency of central Government, it is the creation of

Parliament.</div> <a name="060425116000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do

not have a federal system; we have a unitary constitution in which the

power of local government is defined both by its legitimacy drawn from

the people whom it represents and by the statutory powers vested in it

by Parliament. The nature of central and local relations reflects that;

there is always a balance to be 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column362" />Column number: 362</div>struck between the proper considerations of Government&#151;and, in

this case, the educational considerations of the Secretary of State,

who has a responsibility to ensure that schools are established

properly and that they are fit for purpose&#151;and the role of local

authorities in determining the provision in their locale. Thus, I have

doubts about the Liberal Democrats&#146;

amendment.</div><a name="060425116000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 30 would insert the words &#147;an academy&#148; into the

clause. The omission of the phrase is surprising, given that the White

Paper states that the Government

will</div><a name="060425116000355"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;continue to

promote Academies as a key part of our system...tackling the acute

challenges in areas of real and historical

underperformance&#148;.</div><a name="060425116000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">We

had a short debate about academies last week and the Minister waxed

lyrical about their virtues. Of course it is true that the performance

of academies has been patchy. Some have done well and some less well,

but it would be wrong to exclude academies from this part of the Bill,

as though they were no longer the pivotal element of the policy the

Minister reaffirmed a few days ago in Committee.</div>

<a name="060425116000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our amendment is consistent

with the Government&#146;s intention and our perspective. We do not,

of course, make a blind judgment that all academies are working as well

as they might, but we are anxious to give them a fair wind and to

support the good work that is being done. They are founded on a proper

consideration of the need to engage in educational renewal in areas of

disadvantage. That deserves support&#151;and, by the way, we should

not let the other current debate, about the way they are resourced,

colour our views on the relevant aspect of the Bill.</div>

<a name="060425116000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">I resist the overtures that

are being made once again by the Liberal Democrats to frustrate the

intention of the Bill, by undermining the balance that I have

described. It should not be for local authorities to grant consent for

proposals to establish new schools. The best local authorities work for

the people they serve, rather than dictating what is to be provided.

The White Paper

states:</div><a name="060425116000356"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

best local authorities are strategic leaders of their communities,

listening to, and then speaking for their citizens, demanding the very

best for those who elected them and building cultural and civic

identity. They work with neighbourhoods and local communities to help

them articulate their needs, and ensure that the pattern of local

services matches up to their vision and aspirations. They act as the

commissioners of services and the champions of

users.&#148;</div><a name="060425116000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is not a

role to be underestimated. It is notan understatement of the

significance of local government, but a reaffirmation of our belief in

local government of a kind that can deliver the best by understanding

when it should step forward and when it should step back so that others

can step forward.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000463"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> With these amendments we are considering the

circumstances set out in clause 9 in which promoters other than local

authorities can make proposals for schools outside the competition

provisions. In discussing the previous group of amendments we focused,

on the whole, on the circumstances in which local authorities could

make proposals outside those provisions. In that context, the impact of

amendment No. 153 would be to enable 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column363" />Column number: 363</div>local authorities to decide whether proposers other than local

authorities could make proposals for new schools.</div>

<a name="060425116000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate the point made by

the hon. Member for Brent, East, that our proposals would ensure that

the Government could take powers to control the publication of

proposals outside competitions. As I have said, that is precisely to

ensure that competitions will be effective and will remain the default

mechanism for presenting new proposals. I do not think that the hon.

Lady&#146;s motive in tabling the amendment is to help to promote

competitions and diversity in the system.</div>

<a name="060425116000137"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="060425116000464"></a><b class="B">Annette

Brooke</b> (Mid-Dorset and North Poole) (LD): Will the

Minister comment on the duty on a local authority, which arose in an

earlier clause, to provide diversity and choice? Does not that set a

framework in which local decision making can take

place?</div><a name="060425116000371"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000465"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> It certainly does, and I hope and expect that local

authorities will take that duty seriously. However, it is also

appropriate for us to reinforce the structure that was put in place by

the 2005 Act&#151;that is effectively what the provisions

do&#151;to ensure, through competition proposals, that there is a

process and a statutory framework that enables new providers to come

forward.</div><a name="060425116000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Groups other

than local authorities have always been able to make proposals for new

schools; the large number of voluntary schools bears witness to that.

Such providers have made a valuable contribution to education and will

continue to do so. That is why we are introducing the trust school

model and encouraging foundation schools of all kinds.</div>

<a name="060425116000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we have made clear, we

support competitions because they will encourage openness to

innovation. A range of providers will be able to consider how they

might make a contribution to education, and that will potentially

increase the number of proposers. The danger in amendment No. 153 is

that if proposals could be made without the consent of the Secretary of

State, a local authority could avoid a competition by entering into a

private arrangement to support the proposals of a particular provider,

denying others the opportunity to have their proposals considered. That

would not be in line with the intention behind the proposed programme:

to open up and diversify the education system and give new providers

opportunities to make a contribution. On that basis, we oppose

amendment No.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000467"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> As I have outlined, the competition proposals in

the 2002 Act related only to completely new schools. In the Education

Act 2005 we broadened those provisions to include reorganised schools,

to widen opportunities. As I said to the hon. Member for 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column364" />Column number: 364</div>Bognor Regis and Littlehampton last week, those are the provisions on

which we are consulting. Such a broadening of competition proposals

will provide the opportunity for more new providers to come

forward.</div><a name="060425116000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that

I can provide reassurance to the hon. Member for South Holland and The

Deepings(Mr. Hayes) on the point that he made on amendment

No. 30 about the position of academies. Clause 9 will replace section

28A of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, which was inserted

by section 65 of the 2005 Act. I know that the hon. Gentleman is

intimately aware of those sections. Members of the Committee will have

noticed when we discussed clause 7 that academies are included in that

clause, which will replace section 66 of the 2005 Act. That will ensure

that where a local authority holds a competition for a new school, the

possibility of opening an academy is not overlooked.</div>

<a name="060425116000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we have discussed, clause 9

deals with cases in which the Secretary of State gives consent for

proposals to go ahead without a competition. We do not need

specifically to include academies in the clause because there is

already a clear legal process for establishing a new academy without a

competition, under section 482 of the Education Act 1996, as inserted

by the 2002 Act. The amendment would therefore not add to the power to

propose new academies.</div>

<a name="060425116000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course I welcome the

suggestion that the success of academies means that we should promote

the establishment of more of them, but we do not need the amendment to

do so. The legal process already in place includes clear requirements

for the establishment of academies and for appropriate checks on the

probity of potential sponsors. It spells out a solid basis for setting

up academies and allowing them to improve pupils&#146; educational

opportunities, and ensures that the route outlined by the hon.

Gentleman exists outwith the competition proposals in clause 7. I hope

that with that reassurance he will not press amendment No.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000468"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> As outlined by my hon. Friend the Member for

Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke), the duties at the start of

the Bill already place a duty on local authorities to increase

diversity of provision. Presumably, when the Government drafted the

clause, they expected local authorities to implement it. So I cannot

see what the Government have to lose by leaving them to get on with

it.</div><a name="060425116000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Minister

is implying that I have an ulterior motive for tabling this or any

other amendment, she misunderstands how seriously the Liberal Democrats

take local decision making. That runs throughout all of our

philosophy&#151;we take it very seriously. We believe that the local

authority should make the decisions about service provision in its

area, regardless of how special the circumstances&#151;end of

story.</div><a name="060425116000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">We could

probably have an interesting debate about the historical nature of

government, and where it began, with the hon. Member for South Holland

and The Deepings. I suspect that in the feudal system, power began at a

much lower level than central Parliament. Perhaps we could debate that

and come to 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column365" />Column number: 365</div>a decision on another occasion&#151;it is probably not appropriate in

our deliberations on the Bill before us. Regardless of historical

understanding, localism should not be about a benign gift of power,

from the centre to the local authorities, when the centre so

chooses.</div><a name="060425116000149"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="060425116000469"></a><b class="B">Mrs.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000471"></a>Mr.

Minister has satisfied me that her attachment to, and enthusiasm for,

academies is undimmed. She reminded me of the 1996 Act, amended by the

2002 Act, which in respect of academies effectively does what we want

to do. That renders our amendment unnecessary and ensures that the

process of setting up academies is not adversely affected by the

provisions in the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000497"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> The amendments are probing amendments to test out

who should be consulted and the weight that should be given to their

views. Amendment No. 350 seeks to provide that colleges of further

education should be consulted by a local education authority when it

seeks to establish any new educational institution catering for post-16

education. Amendment No. 251 would go further, requiring the LEA to

consider the impact on FE colleges of any new school opening in an

area.</div> <a name="060425116000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">Colleges are

the largest provider of 16-to-19 provision. Almost twice as many

students go to FE colleges as attend school sixth forms. They are also

much more likely to provide for the most disadvantaged students. It is

notable that 15 per cent. of learners in colleges are from ethnic

minorities, compared with 8 per cent. of the general population.

Indeed, 64 per cent. of those in receipt of educational maintenance

allowances study in FE or other colleges.</div>

<a name="060425116000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">FE colleges have a high

customer satisfaction rate. They offer high-quality courses in a wide

range of subjects. According to a survey by the Association of

Colleges, 84 per cent. of the British public believe that their local

college is as important to business as any 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column367" />Column number: 367</div>other factor. The Bill&#146;s proposal to allow local authorities to

propose new sixth-form schools seems to contradict the FE White Paper,

which contains a presumption that there should be sixth-form colleges

rather than sixth-form schools. I should be interested to hear from the

Minister how that apparent contradiction will be resolved.</div>

<a name="060425116000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill provides for local

authorities to propose new sixth-form schools, but not to fund

them&#151;that would be for the Learning and Skills Council to

do&#151;and it says that the learning and skills council for an area

should be consulted about the setting up of new sixth-form schools.

However, colleges feel that that body is not best placed to act on

their behalf. I suspect that there are many reasons for that, but

colleges are independent bodies, not subsidiaries of the learning and

skills council.</div>

<a name="060425116000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">Colleges are concerned that

smaller sixth-form schools tend to have inferior results, quality of

teaching and choice of subject and that, as theright hon.

Member for Greenwich and Woolwich(Mr. Raynsford) pointed out

on Second Reading, they are more expensive because of the funding gap

between themselves and FE

colleges.</div><a name="060425116000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are not

opposed to the setting up of new sixth-form schools; they might be the

best and safest environment for some young people. In that case, it is

important that any new sixth-form school be set up in collaboration

with others in an area to ensure that choice and quality are not

affected. Often, small schools are unable to provide as much choice as

might be

required.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000498"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> Does the hon. Lady not accept that there is a

direct relationship between achievement and the points score at A-level

and the size of the sixth form? The smallest sixth forms have the

lowest achievement in terms of A-level point score; the largest have

the highest. Each band of size of sixth form increases progressively

towards the higher end of the achievement

level.</div><a name="060425116000195"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000499"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes the point that I was

about to make; that is very much the case. That is why colleges are

very concerned about a presumption in the Bill towards setting up

smaller sixth forms, which are more expensive to provide and which may

yield lower-quality results. If there are occasions when sixth form

schools should be set up because it is appropriate for the locality, it

must be done in collaboration with others to ensure that all those

opportunities for quality, choice and teaching are provided

for.</div><a name="060425116000196"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000500"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> The case made by the hon. Lady in support of her

follow in similar vein. I understand 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column368" />Column number: 368</div>the hon. Lady&#146;s proper attention to the necessary relationship

between schools and FE institutions in the locality and her consequent

desire to involve FE in the consultation process. However, she has

Liberals.</div> <a name="060425116000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was

Nevertheless, shemade an important point about whether we see

FE&#146;s continuing role as duplicating the role that is performed

in sixth form colleges and schools or whether, like Sir Andrew Foster,

we believe that one of the problems that faces FE is the fact that

because it does a large number of things, its purpose is insufficiently

defined.</div><a name="060425116000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sir Andrew

Foster described in his report last year how FE&#146;s identity is

blurred by the fact that it is seen as doing different things by

different people. He stated that teachers and learners in FE often have

a blurred sense of the college&#146;s purpose and that there may be

some displacement of resource and attention because FE lacks

focus.</div> <a name="060425116000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a

case to be made for FE focusing much more heavily on vocational skills

and on upskilling and re-skilling the work force. There is a parallel

but equally powerful case for FE picking up the whole &#147;Skills

for Life&#148; agenda, in the way the Government elucidated after the

Budget, in the new entitlements for people up to the age of 25, and

doing less work that could be as usefully done elsewhere. I do not make

a definitive judgment on that because I do not have a definitive view

on it, but it certainly needs to be explored. It has direct relevance

to this part of the

Bill.</div><a name="060425116000204"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000503"></a>Annette

Brooke:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman explain his vision of what

students might study if they are based at a school? Would that include

only A-levels at school, and vocational studies at college? Does he not

see that a particular student, based primarily at one institution,

might study for a range of diplomas being developed by the

Government?</div><a name="060425116000205"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000504"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> That is precisely the argument that we have been

having about the breadth of opportunity available to young people,

post-14 and post-16, and the need not only to review the curriculum,

which is what the Government have done through the diplomas,

but&#151;in my judgment&#151;to look more closely at the

relationship between schools and FE

institutions.</div><a name="060425116000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have

no prejudices about the idea of schools and FE institutions jointly

designing, managing and even funding courses so that skills can be

shared. Schools have a problem of providing sufficient resources and 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column369" />Column number: 369</div>skills in order to offer the breadth of provision within their own

compass that students might demand. Even schools, such as Gleed girls

school in my constituency, that have gained vocational specialism have

that problem. To do that, they need either to collaborate with other

schools or to have a much closer working relationship with other

institutions, such as

colleges.</div><a name="060425116000207"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000505"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Order. I remind the Committee of two things:

first, the Chair is located at this end of the Room, and, secondly,

comments are meant to be directed towards

it.</div><a name="060425116000208"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000506"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> I am sorry, Mr. Cook. I shall follow your advice

with my usual

diligence.</div><a name="060425116000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">We learn

from the comments of the hon. Member for Brent, East that the purpose

of the amendment is to discourage or inhibit the expansion of schools

offering sixth-form provision because she discerns that that might be

unhelpful to FE. As I said, my case is not prejudiced, but

hypothetical. One might say that there is a direct counter-argument

that it might be rather helpful to FE to refocus its energies away from

what could be done through collaborative arrangements, but essentially

around school

education.</div><a name="060425116000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said,

that is not a prejudiced or partisan matter, but it is one that needs

to be debated in the context of the Bill and the amendments. If the

hon. Lady&#146;s vision, in which FE would continue much as it is

now, is to be realised, we would be ignoring Sir Andrew Foster&#146;s

conclusions. I suspect that my view and that of the Minister are more

similar to each other than either is to that of the Liberal

Democrats.</div>

<a name="060425116000211"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000507"></a>Annette

Brooke:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman reiterate that he thinks

that there is the possibility of collaboration so that an individual

pupil might study academic and vocational subjects&#151;in other

words, a mix, which is the direction in which we are moving 14-to-19

provision? Does he not think therefore that FE institutions need to be

consulted to see where they would fit into that

collaboration?</div><a name="060425116000212"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000508"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> Yes, I think that that is one of the purposes of

the provision, which is why I talkedabout collaboration,

jointly designed, managed and implemented courses, and the possibility

of joint institutions. For example, I have a school in my

constituency&#151;I shall not go into too much detail&#151;that is

hoping to develop a centre working with other schools to take advantage

of the vocational specialism that it has acquired and to deliver

precisely the range of products described by the hon.

Lady.</div><a name="060425116000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course I am

in favour of FE institutions and schools working together more closely

so that they can offer the mix of which the hon. Lady is in favour.

However, I am not sure that that kind of collaborative model can be

squared with the view that began to emerge from those on the Liberal

Front Bench&#151;I accept that it was only a short speech on a

particular amendment&#151;which seemed to be rather hostile to the

idea of encouraging school sixth forms and that

model.</div><a name="060425116000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unless we are

prepared to rethink more radically how we provide post-16 education,

both academic and 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column370" />Column number: 370</div>vocational, we will not overcome the problems identified by Sir Andrew

Foster, to which I draw the Committee&#146;s attention. He argued

that FE</div><a name="060425116000359"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;lacks a clearly

recognised and shared core

purpose.&#148;</div><a name="060425116000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that

he is right. FE colleges should develop specialisms in which they can

excel. That happens increasingly in schools and has long happened in

higher education. Of course higher education institutions provide a

range of courses, but we all know that some have specialisms in which

they have particular expertise and focus, and for which they have a

reputation. Why should not that situation be reflected in

colleges?</div><a name="060425116000216"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000509"></a>The

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills (Phil

Hope):</b> I was not going to speak in this debate, but I wish

to ask the hon. Gentleman whether, as he is quoting Sir Andrew Foster

so favourably, he supports the Government&#146;s White Paper,

&#147;Raising Skills and Improving Life Chances,&#148; which

implements 74 of the 80 Foster recommendations. We are implementing the

other six in a different way. He cannot quote Foster only in support of

FE colleges, but he can support the White

Paper.</div><a name="060425116000217"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000510"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> Yes, the Government have got some of this right. I

would be the first to acknowledge that the Under-Secretary&#146;s

personal commitment to the matter is undoubted. I know that he has

given considerable attention to the Foster report, but the Government

start from a difficult position on skills, because we have a skills

crisis. No Government want to admit that, but it is clear from the

interim Leach report&#151;we expect the final report this summer to

say nothing different&#151;that the task is

immense.</div><a name="060425116000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the

dilemmas at the heart of the matter is the fact that the

Government&#146;s core skills entitlement for those up to the age of

25 might well further skew the resources and attention of FE away from

upskilling and re-skilling the existing work force towards a second

chance for those up to 25. I put that point to the Under-Secretary as

he has challenged me on the

matter.</div><a name="060425116000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">One

understands entirely why the Government want to give the entitlement,

and I do not wish to question their intention or ignore the necessity

of dealing with core skills, which are vital to the life chances of

individuals and to national competitiveness. However, I worry about the

impact that the policy might have on FE, which is already telling us

that the Skills for Life campaign concentrates resources in a way that

makes it even harder to get at the hardest to get at

groups&#151;older people, more disadvantaged people, existing workers

or people outside the work force. That is my judgment, and that of some

FE principals to whom I have spoken. I raise that caveat to my general

words of praise of the Government and the

Under-Secretary.</div><a name="060425116000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I

have said, we should be even more creative and imaginative in

reconstructing the provision of skills training. We must be radical in

breaking down the barriers between schools, colleges and employers, and

we must look more closely at how courses are designed and how to

implement vocational education. We must think much more laterally about

such matters.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column371" />Column number: 371</div><a name="060425116000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">In meeting the parity of esteem

challenge, we can borrow from accreditation practice in industry. We

can draw on the best talents available in each sector and not be

hidebound by the conventional structural barriers that can lead us to

replicate and contradict some of what is done in vocational

education.</div><a name="060425116000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not

ignoring the points that the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole

made about the need to consult FE and the important debate to be had

about the role of school sixth forms and sixth-form colleges. I do not

intend just to be adversarial, but I am just not sure that I agree with

her about what FE colleges should be

doing.</div>

<a name="060425116000373"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45

am</div><a name="060425116000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady

makes an important point in that my argument is most applicable in

places where it iseasy in practice to access the kind of

mixed provision through collaboration that she advocates. That kind of

provision is probably more straightforward to access if one lives in a

conurbation or other area in which it is easier to get about than it

might be in a rural area in which travel distances and the simple act

of getting to the places where learning and resources are located make

things more difficult. In rural areas, it is harder to construct a

model around what I said in relation to Sir Andrew Foster. There,

travel issues are a profound problem, particularly for younger

learners. We shall say more about that when we consider transportation

in the later parts of the Bill. The viability of post-16 provision

because of numbers in sparsely populated areas&#151;another matter

that relates to the hon. Lady&#146;s comments&#151;also needs to be

factored into our considerations, but perhaps that is a debate for

another time.</div> <a name="060425116000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is

right that we take full account of the important role of colleges, and

that we understand the significance of vocational education in the mix

of education that is to be provided, and which is affected by the Bill.

It is right, too, that we make a judgment about how and from where we

want that educationto be provided. However, I am not

instinctively sympathetic to the amendments and nothing that I have

heard has made me more so, but I shall be interested to hear the

Minister&#146;s response to them.</div>

<a name="060425116000225"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000511"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Perhaps it would be helpful to the Committee if

I were to register the fact that I am not a mind reader. Anybody who

wants to catch my eye ought to stand erect. Greg

Mulholland.</div><a name="060425116000226"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="060425116000512"></a><b class="B">Greg

Mulholland</b> (Leeds, North-West) (LD): Thank you, Mr. Cook.

I hope that that was erect enough.</div>

<a name="060425116000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the Minister will

agree that this is an important point, and I am pleased that the hon.

Member for South Holland and The Deepings acknowledged that it is

important to have the discussion. The Liberal Democrats agree that we

need to focus on post-16 education and to improve what is on offer.

That is why we have been consistently supportive of the Tomlinson

agenda. I was a little concerned about the way in which the comments of

the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings came across. He

appeared not to acknowledge or even value the contribution of the FE

sector and colleges to 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column372" />Column number: 372</div>post-16 education. We are very aware of that on these Benches, and

support it and I hope that the Government will echo my comments.

Indeed, a recent Government survey of 27,000 businesses showed that 95

per cent. of employers approved of the trainingthat they

receive from colleges. Together with the facts that my hon. Friend the

Member for Brent, East set out, and despite the 10 per cent. funding

gap that still exists between FE colleges and school sixth forms and

the fact that there is no timetable or plan as to how that will be

changed&#151;</div>

<a name="060425116000228"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="060425116000513"></a><b class="B">Meg

Hillier</b> (Hackney, South and Shoreditch) (Lab/Co-op): It is

interesting to hear the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments about support

for vocational education. How does he square that with his

party&#146;s opposition to a Bill that proposes 14 post-14 vocational

diplomas?</div><a name="060425116000229"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000514"></a>Greg

Mulholland:</b> As the hon. Lady well knows, that is not why

we opposed that Bill. The point is collaboration. The word has been

used in the Committee, but we are still not convinced that the

necessary collaboration is occurring at local level to analyse the

effect of the Bill on local education as a whole. It is precisely

because of the need to improve post-16 education&#151;a need that the

hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings touched upon&#151;that

we support the extension to vocational education that the Government

have proposed. The point of our amendment, however, is that post-16

education will be threatened unless its planning and implementation is

examined as a whole at local level, along with the effects on different

institutions.</div><a name="060425116000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">All

members of the Committee would agree that parents want good local

education from the ages of five to 18 and 19. My party is certain that

in proposing a new school, subject to the Secretary of State&#146;s

veto, local authorities will continue to work with the local FE sector,

but I ask the Minister to assure us that that will be the case. The

amendment acknowledges and reinforces the commitment of local

authorities to the strategic planning of education, because we believe

that that has been abandoned by both the Government and the

Opposition.</div><a name="060425116000231"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000515"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> Just to be clear, I think that the hon. Gentleman

is right: there is an immense amount of good work being done in FE

colleges both by managers and teachers, and in no way do I

underestimate that. My point was that we expect too much of FE. If we

are not clear about what we want from FE it is a bit rich when we

complain about what it provides. It does a good job and we need to give

more strategic direction, of the kind that the hon. Gentleman

described, about what we want from the sector. We need local agreement

and national clarity of

purpose.</div><a name="060425116000232"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000516"></a>Greg

Mulholland:</b> I am pleased to hear that acknowledgment, and

I challenge the Minister to show that the Government have the same

commitment. From their policy, it does not appear to our party that

they have the interests of colleges uppermost. In 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column373" />Column number: 373</div>general, we are not convinced that there is sufficient acknowledgment of

the effect of decisions about new schools and new sixth forms on local

provision in other schools. I ask the Minister to comment both from an

FE perspective and generally, because the issue isthe

Bill&#146;s direction of travel&#151;the atomisation of education,

as Neil Kinnock put it, which my party wants to

avoid.</div><a name="060425116000233"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000517"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> Onlookers to this debate might have thought that

clause 10, or even the amendments, were about the future of education

for 14 to 19-year-olds, or the collaborative role of FE colleges, but

they are not&#151;although those are important issues that we shall

have ample opportunity to discuss when we reach clauses 61 and 62 and

clause 149, which makes new provision for schools and FE colleges to be

able to collaborate. I shall therefore focus my comments on the clause

and the

amendments.</div><a name="060425116000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

clause relates to special cases that are outside the competition

provisions of clause 7 and the provisions of clause 9 whereby proposals

may be made for new schools. One category of such proposals indeed

relates to schools for 16 to 19-year-olds. However, the provision

largely replicates an existing one and allows local authorities and

others to publish proposals for foundation or voluntary schools that

cater only for pupils above compulsory school

age.</div><a name="060425116000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the

proposals would be brought forward outside competition&#151;the

context is that therewould usually be a competition arranged

by the Learning and Skills Council for significant new 16-to-19

provision&#151;it would be non-statutory as opposed to the statutory

competition process that we discussed in clause 7. It would be followed

by the publication of proposals in the usual way. Capital funding for

16-to-19 provision is provided through the 16-to-19 capital fund, which

is also administered by the Learning and Skills

Council.</div><a name="060425116000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.

Member for Brent, East made clear, the impetus for the amendments to

the consultation provisions in the clause is that FE institutions

should be consulted before new 16-to-19 schools or new sixth forms are

proposed, and that in deciding proposals for new 16-to-19 provision,

their effect on the existing provision should be taken into

account.</div><a name="060425116000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have no

problem with those requirements. We agree that all those with an

interest in proposals for new provisions should be consulted and that

decision makers need to consider the effect of proposals on existing

provision. Decision makers would not be doing their job properly if

they did not consider all the relevant factors.</div>

<a name="060425116000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a technical problem

with the amendments in that it is not necessary to put the requirements

in the Bill. These matters are usually handled as they are in the

clause as drafted, with a requirement to consult such persons as appear

appropriate, having regard to statutory guidance from the Secretary of

State.</div> <a name="060425116000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">At present,

statutory guidance specifies that among those who must be consulted are

other local authorities and other schools who may be affected by the

proposals, parents and teachers in the area, local dioceses or national

faith groups, the Learning and Skills Council and any other interested

party, for 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column374" />Column number: 374</div>example the early years development and child care partnership when the

proposals affect early years

provision.</div><a name="060425116000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept

the hon. Lady&#146;s argument that FE colleges in the area would have

an interest and would therefore need to be consulted. To put that

beyond dispute, I am happy to give the Committee an assurance that

statutory guidance on consultation for new schools and additions to

existing schools under the Bill will specifically include FE colleges

in the area as well as schools and the Learning and Skills Council. I

hope the hon. Lady finds that assurance

satisfactory.</div><a name="060425116000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similar

considerations apply to statutory guidance to decision makers on the

factors that they will need to take into account in deciding proposals

for new schools or additional provision at existing schools. Paragraph

8(6) of schedule 2 states that when deciding whether to give approval

to proposals for new schools</div>

<a name="060425116000360"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the local education authority

must have regard to any guidance given from time to time by the

Secretary of

State.&#148;</div><a name="060425116000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph

17(1)(b) applies that provision to the

adjudicator.</div><a name="060425116000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">In

respect of new provision at existing schools, clause 19(6) provides

that regulations may require decision makers to have regard to guidance

from the Secretary of State. Existing guidance specifically states that

in deciding proposals for new schools and new sixth forms, the decision

maker must take into account the views of other schools and colleges in

the area, as well as the views of the Learning and Skills

Council.</div><a name="060425116000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am happy

to assure members of the Committee that new guidance under the Bill

will carry these provisions forward and that the views of FE colleges

in the area will be taken into account by those deciding on proposals.

I hope that hon. Members will consider my proposals sufficient to meet

their concerns and will agree not to press their amendments to a

Division.</div><a name="060425116000245"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000519"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> I want to say a few words about the issue of

federated schools. The purpose of the clause appears to be to enable

the provisions on federated 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column375" />Column number: 375</div>schools in the Education Act 2002 to apply to theBill&#146;s

provisions on the establishment of new schools. Clause 11(2) states

that the phrase</div> <a name="060425116000361"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;

&#145;federated school&#146; has the meaning given by section

24(2)&#148;</div><a name="060425116000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">of the 2002 Act.

I looked up that section, which states:

</div><a name="060425116000362"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In this

Chapter &#145;federation&#146; means a group of schools that are

federated by virtue of this section, and "federated school" means a

school forming part of a

federation.&#148;</div><a name="060425116000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">So that is

clear, then.</div> <a name="060425116000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section

24 deals with two or more schools being able to form a federation, with

a single governing body, which in prescribed cases can be treated as a

single school. That type of federation is, I presume, of the type

referred to as a hard federation, whereas in a soft federation the head

of a successful school would take on the additional headship of a local

school that was failing or coasting, but would not formally merge the

two governing bodies.</div>

<a name="060425116000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Minister confirm

that, notwithstanding the creation of a federation of schools of the

hard kind, the exam results of the individual schools within the

federation would continue to be published separately? Will she also

confirm that parents applying for their children to attend a school in

the federation would be able to specify the one that they wanted their

children to attend, and would not be forced to apply just to the

federation?</div> <a name="060425116000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does the

Minister envisage any maximum size for a federation? I recently met an

LEA officer who presented me with an apocalyptic vision of what a

future federation could look like. She said that there could be a

federation of 20 schools; that parents could have to apply to the

federation rather than to an individual school; that the federation

could allocate children to one of its schools as it saw fit; and that

the exam results of the schools could be consolidated into a block for

the federation as a whole.</div>

<a name="060425116000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">That would in effect create a

mini-education authority, within which parents would have no choice of

school and exam results would no longer be published. That would take

us back to the regime of the 1970s and early 1980s. I hope that the

Minister will confirm that such a use of the federated schools

provisions in clause 11 and in section 24 of the 2002 Act will not be

permitted.</div><a name="060425116000256"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000520"></a>Annette

Brooke:</b> I would like to make somebrief comments

because the Liberal Democrats support the general principle of

federation. It fitswith our alternative

vision&#151;alternative to that of the Government and the

Conservatives, that is&#151;of a collaborative model. I have some

questions about exactly what is envisaged under the clause. Like the

hon. Gentleman I find that that is not entirely clear when one refers

to the 2002 Act, and we join in the request for clarity.</div>

<a name="060425116000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am interested also in the

fact that federation could be horizontal, vertical or a mixture, and

would like the Minister to comment on that. I can see that in some

areas a vertical federation would provide advantages such as continuity

and economies of scale in purchasing, among other things; interesting

ideas also emerge from what would effectively be the twinning of

schools, when a school with a particular strength could 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column376" />Column number: 376</div>support another that might be weaker in that area, and vice versa. We

support the principles, but would like more

detail.</div>

<a name="060425116000258"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="060425116000521"></a><b class="B">Anne

Snelgrove</b> (South Swindon) (Lab): I want to raise briefly

some points that have arisen from correspondence that I have had with

Wiltshire education authority on federated schools. I support the

concept; it offers opportunities to solve the problems that will occur

when school rolls fall and we have to consider closures. In particular,

Wiltshire has had difficulties with small rural schools, which it has

raised with me. A number of the children in my constituency go across

the border to Wiltshire schools, and I want to raise the matter on

their behalf.</div>

<a name="060425116000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">Federations enable small rural

schools to remain open, and Wiltshire has enthusiastically pursued the

concept in order to keep rural communities going. However, it believes

that this clause and clause 7 might prevent it from continuing to do

so. I should appreciate an opportunity to discuss the matter further

with the Minister in private in order to ensure that Wiltshire is

afforded every opportunity to carry on federating as it is doing. The

Bill should not prevent authorities from finding creative solutions to

federating schools so that they may remain open. I am sure that all

hon. Members would regret it if that were to happen.</div>

<a name="060425116000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">The difficulty is that when

schools federate as some have done, the Department for Education and

Skills says that they have to announce a school&#146;s closure. That

is putting some schools and governing bodies off federating, and might

lead&#151;in some cases, has led&#151;to the closure of small rural

schools, which have been unable to remain open without federation. I

shall be very interested in the Minister&#146;s comments. My summary

might not be exactly correct, but I think that I have the gist:

Wiltshire and other rural LEAs should be able to federate in order to

keep their schools open.

</div><a name="060425116000261"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000522"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> The clause re-enacts the provisions of section 68

of the Education Act 2005 in respect of England. It provides for

specific circumstances in which a new maintained school may be planned

to be a member of a federation from the outset, and become one as soon

as it opens. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton is

right in his assumption that that relates to what we tend to call a

hard federation, as opposed to a softer or more informal one. He

mentioned accountability. Even in a hard federation, schools retain

their individual identities. They will publish separate results,

although they may also decide to publish joint results as well.

However, the accountability for results remains clear for each school,

and there will be separate admissions processes for the individual

schools, so the choice that the hon. Gentleman identified will remain

with each school within the federation.</div>

<a name="060425116000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">The vision that the hon.

Gentleman outlined is apocalyptic, but I do not imagine it to be a

serious concern. On the whole, the direction of travel in respect of

collaboration and federation is beneficial for the development of

standards and local collaboration. We will remove by regulation the

current maximum of five for a federation of schools, but I do not

foresee the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column377" />Column number: 377</div>development of unwieldy federations. One of the intentions behind the

trust model is that it will provide us with a different way of

developing collaboration and joint working between schools. However, to

reassure the hon. Gentleman, I can tell him that accountability and

admissions proposals in respect of federations remain as he asked me to

assure him they would.</div>

<a name="060425116000263"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000523"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> I take the right hon. Lady&#146;s point about

rural schools. There are similar circumstances in my constituency.

However, what is the purpose of increasing the number beyond five? In

practice, surely one reaches a point at which federation cannot be

achieved without compromising the relationship with the local

community, the identity of the schools, the historical relationships

with parents and so on. Why increase the number? Does the Minister want

to set a new

limit?</div><a name="060425116000264"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000524"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> Those are precisely the sorts of issues that the

governing body will consider when determining whether it wants to enter

into a federation. Let us be quite clear that, in almost every

circumstance, decisions about entering into federations are made by

governing bodies and, of course, they are interested in the extent to

which that would help them to deliver the objectives they had set out

for the schools. I tend to think that that would be the logical way to

determine the appropriate size of a federation, rather than a centrally

imposed limit. There is one circumstance in which a federation would be

proposed outside of a decision made by a governing body. It relates to

some of the proposals for those schools that are causing concern, which

we will come to in part 4 of the Bill. We are suggesting that a local

authority could propose a federation as a response to failure in

particular

schools.</div><a name="060425116000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole asked whether vertical and

horizontal federations would come under the clause. The answer is yes,

and I agree with the her that there might well be circumstances in

which there would be a federation of some primary schools and a

secondary school. As well as that structure, horizontal federations of

schools in the same phase would be appropriate. Once again, which of

those was appropriate would depend on the particular

circumstances.</div><a name="060425116000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

clause relates to specific provisions for the setting up of a new

school. Effectively, it ensures that a governing body is not prevented

from setting up a new school as part of a federation. Of course, there

is a range of other collaborative arrangements&#151;ranging from soft

federations to hard federations&#151;that is outside the remit of the

clause, but as I suggested earlier, many of them are desirable and we

would want them to be

developed.</div><a name="060425116000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the

issues raised by my hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon (Anne

Snelgrove), I am happy to take up the specific points that she outlined

with respect to Wiltshire. I would be concerned if small local schools

were prevented from federating. As my hon. Friend will know, in the

toolkit that we produced to deal with falling rolls we proposed that

federation may be an effective measure. So, although I do not 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column378" />Column number: 378</div>have the answer today, I will consider the specific case that my hon.

Friend outlined and come back to her with a

response.</div><a name="060425116000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause

ensures that existing regulations allow those proposing a new school,

or the temporary governing body of a school before it opens, to

complete the processes normally carried out by the governing body of a

school that wishes to become a member of a federation. That involves

consulting parents and others about the proposals before taking a final

decision. It is a sensible and time-saving provision and may be

particularly important to the fresh start of a school in need of

additional

support.</div><a name="060425116000269"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000527"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> This is an important clause. My amendments relate

to subsection (4), and Members will see that they deal with four

criteria, which must be considered and taken into account by those

proposing to close a rural school. I am in favour of subsection (4),

and these are sensible criteria. I am delighted that the Minister is

obviously concerned about what is going on with the closure of rural

schools.</div> <a name="060425116000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">I represent

a rural constituency. One of the greatest heartaches over the years has

been our campaigns, successful and unsuccessful, to keep open small

rural schools. They often involve very small schools, such as the

recent campaign in Holton le Moor. At the start of the campaign the

school had 17 pupils in total; the closure has now been confirmed with

the school roll having fallen to seven pupils. Those who represent

urban constituencies may question how a school can be effective with

only 17 pupils, but these schools in remote rural areas are often

extremely popular and provide a very good education. Some educationists

deny this, because year groups have to combine, but I assure hon.

Members that the tremendous spirit, care, love and all the rest of it

in these primary schools is a joy to

behold.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column379" />Column number: 379</div><a name="060425116000375"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15

pm</div><a name="060425116000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">The school

that I am talking about now has been in existence for over 100 years.

It is at the heart of the community in a small village. It is often

heartbreaking when these rural schools close. Often, as happened at

Holton le Moor, a school closes because the head teacher is approaching

retirement. We now live inquite a competitive environment.

There is nothing wrong with that, and of course I support that in terms

of education&#151;schools are competing for pupils. Sometimes when a

head teacher is approaching retirement or perhaps has a more

traditional view of education based on catchment areas, the school may

not be as vigorous in recruiting pupils as neighbouring schools. That

is obviously what happened in this case. There is nothing wrong with

the head teacher; he gave years of loyal service. Equally, in

Lincolnshire as elsewhere, we have falling school rolls and this puts

pressure on the county council which itself is under pressure from the

Department. They have to find schools to close and some of these small

schools can be an obvious

target.</div><a name="060425116000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have no

objections to the subsection. It seems perfectly sensible that when one

is closing a rural school one should look at the likely effect of its

discontinuance on the local community. It is undoubtedly true that when

these villages have lost their village shop, when the church only

operates one Sunday a month, and when the school is ripped out, they

become almost suburban dormitories, albeit in the middle of the

countryside, with no life going on during the day.</div>

<a name="060425116000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">Certainly, a county like

Lincolnshire is hit extremely badly. As my hon. Friend the Member for

South Holland and The Deepings will confirm, as he is also a

Lincolnshire Member, we have a great problem with the cost of school

transport. We argue constantly that the Department does not give

adequate recompense to the county council to deal with the heavy costs

that we have to meet in bussing children around. If a school closes in

a village by definition the children have to be transported further

afield. Paragraph (b) is very sensible. Paragraph (c) mentions the use

of motor vehicles. Obviously if a school closes the use of motor

vehicles

increases.</div><a name="060425116000283"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000528"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> As my hon. Friend mentioned my constituency

interest, will he say a word in this context about the particular

difficulties of providing services in sparsely populated rural areas?

Much is said about rurality, but less is said about sparsity. They are

different but overlapping factors and have a real impact on local

public service provision, including education, and a consequent impact

on the need for proper transport. It is worth emphasising that on

behalf of sparsely populated rural areas such as those we

represent.</div><a name="060425116000284"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000529"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> &#147;Sparsity&#148; is a technical term of

art, but it is important to recognise the difficulties that it causes

to local authorities such as Lincolnshire. Lincolnshire&#146;s

population is evenly distributed throughout the county, whereas

counties such as Devon have some areas of high population concentration

and others, such as Dartmoor, where there is virtually no one at all.

They do not, therefore, suffer as much as Lincolnshire does 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column380" />Column number: 380</div>from the sparsity problem. Because our population is so evenly

distributed its transport costs can be very high. That is the point

that my hon. Friend was making. All the paragraphs in subsection (4)

are perfectly sensible, and I am delighted that the Minister seems to

have understood the position. Presumably it is why the provision has

been framed as it has.</div>

<a name="060425116000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason for my amendments

is that, although I have no argument with the idea of considering the

criteria in the clause in relation to rural schools, I wonder why the

Minister does not consider that many of the factors listed in the

relevant paragraphs apply to all primary schools, wherever they

are&#151;this may be where I attract the interest of Members

representing urban and suburban seats. My amendments would merely

ensure that the sensible factors in the provision, which should be

considered, would be taken into account when any primary school was

closed.</div> <a name="060425116000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why, for

instance, should the closure of a school affect the local community

only if it is in a rural area? I should have thought that if we were to

close a school in the heart of an inner city, a suburb or anywhere else

the community might well be affected; it might be a big issue. My

amendment is intended to tease out from the Minister why she thinks

that those factors apply only to rural schools.</div>

<a name="060425116000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another instance that we might

consider concerns</div><a name="060425116000363"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the

availability, and likely cost to the local education authority, of

transport to other schools&#148;.</div>

<a name="060425116000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">I must now wear my green hat, because of

course I am now totally committed to green politics. I have done the

school run in London for many years, and it is not only in rural areas,

as we know, that people take their kids to school in cars. I do not,

therefore, know why the Government think that the likely effect of a

closure on transport to other schools is relevant only to rural

schools. One need only look around London to see large numbers of 4x4s

transporting kids to school. What do the Government mean by that

paragraph?</div> <a name="060425116000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">The same

argument also applies to paragraph (c) and to

considering</div><a name="060425116000364"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any

alternatives to the discontinuance of the

school&#148;.</div><a name="060425116000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why does the

Minister think local education authorities should not take into account

those factors? </div><a name="060425116000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">To

add insult to injury there is subsection (7)(b). I would like to know

what it means. It leaves it to the Secretary of State to define a rural

school. That might, surely, be a quite arbitrary decision. The

paragraph enables the Secretary of State to choose which primary

schools are expendable and which are not. I am sure that that is not

the intention, so my amendment would delete that paragraph. It is

surely difficult for anyone, let alone the Secretary of State in

London, to determine whether a school is rural.</div>

<a name="060425116000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suppose that I represent

four or five traditional market towns and more than 100 villages, but

some of the villages are not really villages any more. They are huge

suburban communities to the north of Lincoln, which could by no stretch

of any definition be termed rural. Presumably there is no difficulty in

determining that other villages, with tiny populations of perhaps a

dozen or two dozen people, are rural. However, there are many villages

in between. How can the Secretary of 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column381" />Column number: 381</div>State choose which primary schools are rural and therefore entitled to

the extra defence under subsection (4), by which the local authority

must have regard to the various

factors?</div><a name="060425116000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

am delighted that subsection (4) is in the Bill and that the Government

are taking note of rural schools, because, contrary to what many

educationists believe, small rural schools provide an excellent

service. I want to find out from the Government, however, why they

think that the effects on transport and on the community do not apply

equally in urban and suburban

areas.</div><a name="060425116000294"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000530"></a>Annette

Brooke:</b> Perhaps in surprise, I find myselfin

total agreement with the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh). I

did not quite follow the exact reasoning behind the amendments before I

heard his speech, but I am now absolutely convinced of the argument.

People struggle with my constituency&#146;s name, but, as may be

imagined, Mid-Dorset and North Poole is a mix of urban and rural

communities. It has village schools that struggle for numbers, while in

the more urban areas there are very large primary schools that possibly

suffer in funding because of the existence of other

schools.</div><a name="060425116000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless,

the contribution of those other schools to the local community is so

great that a value must be put on it, and I agree that the closure of a

school situated in an locality classified as urban might be just as

devastating as the closure of a rural primary school. I support the

sentiments that underlie the amendments.

</div><a name="060425116000296"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000531"></a>Mrs.

Dorries:</b> I, too, support the amendments. Although I

represent a rural constituency, I have spent most of my life in the

city of Liverpool, so I am in a strange position because, although the

provisions have advantages for my constituency, I am slightly aggrieved

for the schools of my home city, where the same considerations would

not apply.</div> <a name="060425116000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">In

mid-Bedfordshire there are three, small, urban conurbations, but there

are many rural schools in the constituency. We have been in the strange

situation of discussing whether to go from the three-tier system to the

two-tier system, which may result in some school closures, and we are

currently in the consultation period and we know that that would have a

devastating effect. The constituency is rural, so there are not that

many roads, but if local, rural schools began to close we would find

ourselves in the bizarre position of having gridlock during rush hours,

because the roads already get into that kind of

state.</div><a name="060425116000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless,

the fact that consideration is being given to rural schools but not to

schools in cities and urban areas is of some concern, and I ask the

Minister why schools in cities such as Liverpool would not merit the

same consideration. I support the comments of my hon. Friend.

Subsection (4) is excellent for mid-Bedfordshire but does not have any

bearing on urban areas, which seems unfair to schools in cities such as

Liverpool.</div><a name="060425116000299"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000532"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> I want to raise one quick point with the Minister.

My hon. Friend mentioned that the definition of a rural primary school

is in subsection (7)(b), which says

that</div><a name="060425116000365"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;&#145;rural

primary school&#146; means a primary school designated as such for

the purposes of this section by an order made by the Secretary of

State.&#148;</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column382" />Column number: 382</div><a name="060425116000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the Minister&#146;s letter of 27

March to Committee members, the only illustrative regulations

circulated in relation to clause 14 are the School Organisation

(Establishment and Discontinuance of Maintained Schools) (England)

Regulations 2006. In my reading of those I could not see a definition

of a rural primary school. Will the Minister shed some light on

that?</div><a name="060425116000376"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30

pm</div><a name="060425116000301"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000533"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> As has been discussed during our deliberations on

this group of amendments, the Government take the role of rural schools

seriously. In fact, the protections in clauses 14 and 15 for rural

schools reflect amendments made during the passage of the Education Act

2005, but there was already recognition in legislation and in the

processes for the consideration of school closures of the importance to

their communities of rural schools, and we support and encourage their

preservation.</div><a name="060425116000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">Notwithstanding

the important points that have been made by hon. Members about the

difficult decisions in respect of any school closure&#151;in a

moment, I shall talk in detail about the processes involved in

that&#151;there are specific issues relating to rural schools,

particularly primary schools. For example, often they provide services

beyond educational ones. That is becoming increasingly important with

the development of extended schools. Such schools might well be centres

for local child care provision as well as other services&#151;for

example, some rural schools run the local post office, too&#151;so

they have a significance beyond educational services. If a rural school

closes, it is more likely that there is not another school within

walking distance, which is an important consideration. That is why in

statutory guidance to those who decide on school organisation proposals

we have a presumption against the closure of rural schools, and have

had for some time. Since 1998, that has brought about a big reduction

in the number of rural school closures per

year.</div><a name="060425116000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provisions

of clause 14 require any local authority or governing body preparing

proposals for a rural school closure to consider the potential impact

on the community, transport implications and possible alternatives to

closure. Clause 15 requires that body to consult parents, the local

authority and district and parish councils before publishing those

proposals. The vast majority of authorities and governing bodies would

take those steps without such requirements in the Bill, but their

inclusion puts those important steps beyond doubt. As I outlined, we

attach special importance to the preservation of rural schools if they

contribute to standards, are wanted by parents and have the support of

the local education

community.</div><a name="060425116000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Members for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and for Gainsborough asked

about the designation of rural primary schools. On the 30 March, we

wrote to directors of children&#146;s services in England and

diocesan directors of education, and asked them about that issue,

particularly with respect to the commencement of section 70 of the

Education Act 2005 which puts in place proposals for a specific

designation of &#147;rural primary school&#148;. We identified for

each local authority, those schools that we think come within that

category. In preparing the draft order in which we will designate

certain schools as &#147;rural 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column383" />Column number: 383</div>primary schools&#148;, we used the rural indicator on the EduBase

register to identify those schools.</div>

<a name="060425116000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">In case hon. Members are not

aware, that register is an indicator based on the Office for National

Statistics&#146; rural indicator developed by the Countryside Agency,

the Office for National Statistics, the Department for Environment,

Food and Rural Affairs, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the

Welsh Assembly. It is the same indicator to which decision makers refer

when considering proposals to close rural schools in relation to the

presumption against closure that I have outlined already.</div>

<a name="060425116000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, we asked directors

of children&#146;s services for their comments on the proposed

inclusion of a list, which we attached for each of those 150

authorities, of primary schools in the area that we intend to include

in the designation order as &#147;rural schools&#148;. We also said

specifically:</div><a name="060425116000366"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;You

should consult the schools as appropriate when considering the list. We

will review the designation order annually and will consult individual

local authorities and dioceses on proposed changes as

appropriate.&#148;</div>

<a name="060425116000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not only are we using a

recognised measure of the nature of a school that could be designated

as rural, but we are also inviting consultation responsesfrom

directors of children&#146;s services and diocesan authorities, and

asking them to discuss that with the schools before including them on a

list, which we shall then be willing to review in order to keep it up

to date.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000534"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> The recognised measure that the Minister describes

does indeed take account of sparsity in the mix of considerations that

it uses to define rurality, but given the words of my hon. Friend the

Member for Gainsborough, will she look again at the circumstances of a

large area with a sparse population, such as the county of

Lincolnshire? There are concerns that, even though the measure takes

sparsity into account, it is given insufficient weight where sparsity

affects the whole of a county. It does so rarely, but that is certainly

the case for Lincolnshire. Would she have another look at

that?</div>

<a name="060425116000309"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000535"></a>Jacqui

Smith:</b> Of course it will be possible for the director of

children&#146;s services in Lincolnshire, when considering the

designated list, to comment if schools have been left off that the

director considers to be rural. We are inviting comments from directors

of children&#146;s services by Friday 23 June. I am not convinced

that individual schools would be excluded because of the measures that

we have used, but we are consulting precisely because we want to ensure

that the list is

right.</div><a name="060425116000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

amendments, as we have heard, are probing amendments about the extent

to which we should extend the requirements to all cases where a local

authority or governing body proposes to close any category of primary

school. I know only too well&#151;I am sure that other hon. Members

do as well&#151;how sensitive school closure proposals can be for

pupils, parents, staff and others who might be affected. We would not

expect a decision to close any school to be taken lightly. I would not

want hon. Members to think that because we are discussing the specifics

of the closure of rural schools, that implies somehow or other 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column384" />Column number: 384</div>that there is not an important and significant process for the

consideration of the closure of any school, primary or

secondary.</div><a name="060425116000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">Responding

to the proposed amendments to clause 14&#151;amendments Nos. 333 and

334&#151;as I have said, those considering making proposals to close

any school will consider a range of factors, including the impact on

standards, pupil number forecasts, the pattern of parental demand and

levels of diversity in addition to the factors in clause 14. The body

that takes the final decision on such proposals will expect to see

evidence and well reasoned arguments for closure on those and a range

of other factors. Establishing a statutory requirement to consider the

four factors set out in clause 14 could be misinterpreted. For example,

it might be read as lessening the importance of the other factors that

I have spelt out. I do not think that there is a defensible argument

for treating primary school closures as a whole differently, as that

would bring into doubt whether the issues that I have outlined should

be considered with respect to all school closures, rural and

urban.</div> <a name="060425116000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn now to

clause 15 and amendments Nos. 335, 336 and 337. Those preparing to

publish any type of statutory proposal, including for closure, must

consult any such persons as appear appropriate. In doing so, they are

required to have regard to the Secretary of State&#146;s guidance.

That guidance already exists and is in operation. It includes the

parties listed in the provision. If the decision maker wanted to set

that guidance aside and not consult some of those parties, they would

have to have an extremely good reason; if not, they could be subject to

a judicial review. I cannot see any reason to make special provision

and to treat primary school closures differently from any other type of

school closure.</div> <a name="060425116000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

hope that I have reassured hon. Members not only that we take the

specific position of rural schools seriously, which is the reason for

the presumption relating to closure and the provisions that we have

made, but that we have in place robust guidance and processes for

proposing and considering the closure of all types of

school&#151;rural or urban, secondary or primary. We fear that the

amendments would put in question the robustness of those arrangements,

which is why I hope that the hon. Member for Gainsborough feels

reassured and able to withdraw the

amendment.</div><a name="060425116000314"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000536"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> I am pleased that we have had this debate. It has

given the Minister the opportunity to put on record the importance that

she attaches to rural schools and the factors that might apply to

them&#151;for instance, the fact that they provide other services to

the local community. I am very reassured by that and by the fact that

factors such as the effect on a local community and local transport

will be taken into account before an urban or suburban school is

closed.</div> <a name="060425116000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am less

convinced by her argument that such factors cannot be included in the

Bill in the case of an urban school because they might somehow detract

from the importance of other elements. Surely that argument could also

apply to rural schools. I am still slightly worried about why

subsection (4) appliesonly to rural schools. However, if I

were to press the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column385" />Column number: 385</div>amendment to a Division, it might be misunderstood outside the

Committee. Some people might come to the incorrect conclusion that I

somehow wanted to lessen the protection of rural schools.</div>

<a name="060425116000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">Somewhat reassured by the

Minister&#146;s comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

amendment.</div><a name="060425116000317"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000537"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 100, in clause 14,

page 10, line 25, at end

insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(aa) the effect of

the discontinuance of the school upon the ability of the local

education authority, andupon the governing bodies of other

schools maintained by that authority, to continue to perform and carry

out the duties and functions in relation to education imposed upon them

by this or any other

enactment,'.</div><a name="060425116000319"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000538"></a>The

Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss

amendment No. 31, in clause 14, page 10, line 26, leave

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000539"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> Amendment No. 100 would insert an additional

criterion into subsection (4). It brings a new dimension to the debate.

I do not want to repeat the arguments that we have already been

through&#151;the hon. Member for Gainsborough put the case extremely

well and made an important argument for having a set of criteria that

applies to all potential school closures. That would be helpful to

local authorities and governing bodies in preparing their proposals. He

could have made the case for deleting not only the word

&#147;rural&#148; but the words &#147;primary school,&#148;

because the arguments apply equally to secondary

schools.</div><a name="060425116000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment

No. 100 would ensure that the wider system of schooling in a given area

would have to be considered before decisions on school closures were

taken. It draws particular attention to the capacity of the local

authority and of other schools to continue to perform and carry out

their duties and functions&#151;that is, to run viable schools with a

broad and balanced curriculum. That is an important dimension. Too

often in the case of school closures, we look in a rather narrow way at

the individual school and the immediate impact on the community that it

serves. In most parts of the country&#151;rural areas are arguably an

exception&#151;there is a network of interrelated schools and it is

difficult to take decisions on one school without there being a wider

impact.</div>

<a name="060425116000377"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45

pm</div><a name="060425116000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">My

recollection is that subsection (4) emerged as a compromise during the

debate on the EducationAct 2005 because of a Government

defeat in the Lords, so it may not be in the Bill for the most logical

reason, having come about as a result of a political fudge. There is,

however, a strong case for strengthening it to apply to all schools,

both primary and secondary, and including an additional criterion to

focus on the impact of the whole network of schools on a given local

authority.</div><a name="060425116000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is

not an argument for or against closing schools, or for increasing or

reducing the likelihood of their closure; it is simply an argument that

all local 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column386" />Column number: 386</div>authorities and governing bodies should act in accordance with an agreed

set of criteria that have credibility and take all factors into

account. I am currently involved with a school closure in my

constituency and during the past nine years I have supported the

closure of a number of schools in my constituency. I know how sensitive

such issues are and how easy it is for parents not to understand a

local authority&#146;s wider reasons for proposing such closures. I

know how easy it is for parents to adopt a very narrow focus on the

impact on their child in the immediate future. Those cannot be the only

criteria; we have to take a wider

view.</div><a name="060425116000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

have another point, which was made particularly effectively by the 2003

Ofsted report on pupil place planning and more recently by the Audit

Commission&#146;s submission to Education and Skills

Committee&#146;s inquiry on the White Paper. Attention was focused on

the relationship between quality and popularity. There is a tendency to

believe that when a school seems to be losing pupils or when, for a

variety of reasons, it does not have as many pupils as the neighbouring

school down the road, that is a reflection of quality.

Myright hon. Friend the Minister stressed the important

criteria of standards, parental preference and diversity in determining

any school closure, but that is not a simple and straightforward matter

because parental preference may be exercised in favour of school A

rather than school B for a variety of reasons other than an objective

assessment of the quality of the school.</div>

<a name="060425116000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am putting down

a marker in support of the argument that we need to consider the wider

impact on the local system of any school closure. We should separate

the issues of popularity and of quality. There may well be very good

schools&#151;occasionally high-performing ones&#151;that are not

judged to be popular schools, based on the patterns of parental

preference. It is a mistake always to go for popularity rather than

quality as the key criterion for a decision on the future of a

school.</div><a name="060425116000326"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000540"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> Does that mean that the hon. Gentleman is now

downplaying the importance and validity of parental preference and

choice in an area? When he moved his amendment during the debate on the

previous clause, he cited how important parental choice and involvement

are in establishing new schools.

</div><a name="060425116000327"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000541"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> No, that is not the case at all. It is not an

either/or matter. I think that the situation is slightly more complex

than the official Opposition would have us believe.</div>

<a name="060425116000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">Popularity does

not equate to quality. A simple example of why that could be the case

is the fact that many schools happen to have been built&#151;whether

it was 20, 30, 40, 50 or 100 years ago&#151;in the wrong location.

They were built to serve a community that existed then but economic

change has meant thatthose communities no longer exist, or

that thelocal population has declined greatly. That causes

difficulties. If a school is trapped by its geography and a decision on

its location that was taken many years ago and it cannot draw on new

areas of residential 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column387" />Column number: 387</div>housing, it will struggle for ever to increase its numbers&#151;unless

it is able to reach out to new groups of parents in adjacent areas.

However, that does not mean that it is a poor or unpopular school. It

may well be popular with those parents within easy travelling distance

who can send their children to that school.</div>

<a name="060425116000329"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000542"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an important point, and I

can see some sense in his argument. However, is his view not at

variance with the basic premise of the Bill, which is that greater

parental choice and greater responsiveness to the choices they make are

likely to drive up quality? Is that premise right or

wrong?</div>

<a name="060425116000330"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000543"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> In relation to previous amendments, I said that

parental choice is important. My criticism of the arrangements in the

schooling system in England and Wales is that we confuse parental

choice with institutional choice. In many parts of the country, schools

determine which pupils will attend. Parents do not have an absolute

right to send their children to certain schools. The point of my

amendment is that parental choice does not happen in a vacuum; there

are a series of constraints. Most parents understand that there is no

such thing as pure parental choice. The system cannot be based on pure

parental choice without building in vast excess capacity. The issue is

how parental choice is managed and regulated and the framework in which

it operates.</div>

<a name="060425116000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 100 suggests

that when a decision is taken about the future of an individual school,

the framework must include the consideration of the decision&#146;s

impact on neighbouring schools.</div>

<a name="060425116000332"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425116000544"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> I am not unsympathetic to thehon.

Gentleman&#146;s amendment. School closure has implications not only

for the community that it serves directly, but for the schools that are

required to educate the children who would previously have been

educated at that school. Amendment No. 31 would ensure that the matters

that must be taken into account before deciding whether to close a

school, as set out in subsection (4), should include the increased

transportation costs that would accrue as a result of the closure.

Subsection (4)(b) provides that the likely additional cost of transport

that would accrue to the local authority must be taken into account,

but it says nothing about the likely costs to individual parents. They

are just as much costs to the community as costs incurred by local

authorities. We shall debate school transport issues under part 6, but

it is incongruous that in determining the efficacy of a school closure,

costs that might be incurred by local authorities should be a factor in

determining whether the school should close, but costs to individual

parents should not.</div>

<a name="060425116000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Forum for

Rural Children and Young People points out that rural children and

young people often find school transport unresponsive to their needs.

Those problems are echoed by the social exclusion unit in its report on

transport and social exclusion, &#147;Making the Connections: Final

Report on Transport and Social Exclusion&#148;. The report noted that

children in some areas are prevented from taking part in

extra-curricular activities because of a lack of public 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column388" />Column number: 388</div>transport at the required time. The Central Council of Physical

Recreation is quoted in the report as saying that in one school, 40 to

45 per cent. of pupils were missing out on after-school activities

owing to transport constraints.</div>

<a name="060425116000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">The report also highlighted

more general concerns about the availability of transport in rural

areas.More than half of people in rural areas live more than

13 minutes&#146; walk away from an hourly daytime bus service, and 29

per cent. of rural settlements have no bus service at all. The lack of

public transport, combined with the lack and cost of taxis, leave

people unable to get to key places. Some rural families have to go

without certain things in order to afford to run a car. The cost of

transport would also be an issue if a denominational school were closed

in a rural area.</div> <a name="060425116000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our

amendment would therefore remove the words</div>

<a name="060425116000367"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to the local education

authority&#148;</div><a name="060425116000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">from

subsection (4)(b) to make it provide simply that the matters that

should be taken into account are the availability and likely cost of

transport to other schools.</div>

<a name="060425116000337"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="060425116000545"></a><b class="B">Dr.

Roberta Blackman-Woods</b> (City of Durham) (Lab): As my hon.

Friend the Member for Bury, North said, amendment No. 100 would add to

the criteria listed in subsection (4). In particular it would ensure

that, when a school was being considered for closure, the impact on

other schools in the area and on the local education

authority&#151;especially in relation to its ability to provide

parents with diversity and choice in school provision&#151;would be

considered. I also seek an assurance from the Minister that, when a

closure process is to go ahead, it will be properly

managedand that all relevant factors will be taken into

consideration.</div><a name="060425116000338"></a>

Brooke:</b> I would like to make a brief comment on amendment

No. 100. I very much support the sentiments behind it, but I wonder

whether it should refer to local authorities in the plural, to cover

instances of schools on boundaries. Poole unitary authority has schools

on its boundaries&#151;except for the one with the sea. Schools on

the boundary with other authorities suffer knock-on effects and it can

be difficult to get both authorities, which have their own budgets, to

take the decision that is best for the community overall. In the

proposed reorganisation it is proposed to delay any activity in respect

of a large and excellent comprehensive school that is right on a

boundary. That causes considerable concern among 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column389" />Column number: 389</div>constituents who live in the adjoining local authority. I should like

the amendment to be strengthened to cover the cross-boundary

before I start, for the information of the Committee, I should point

out that when we break for lunch information will be available for hon.

Members to consider alongside clauses 17 to 19&#151;in case we are

fortunate enough to reach those this afternoon. I do not want to push

my luck, but I am

hopeful.</div><a name="060425116000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">To deal

first with amendment No. 100, as we discussed on the previous group of

amendments, we already make special provision when it is proposed to

close a rural primary school. We require local authorities to consider

a range of specific factors; that requirement reflects an addition to

the present arrangements under an amendment to the Education Act 2005.

My hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North is right about the provenance

of that amendment, but it was built on a presumption against the

closure of rural schools that the Government had already established

for decision makers. For the reasons that I gave previously we strongly

support the continuation of rural schools that have strong parental

support and contribute to the community and to education standards in

their area.</div> <a name="060425116000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.

Friend rightly argued that it is important to consider the wider

implications of proposals to close schools. Those proposals would be

made only by the local education authority or the governing body of a

foundation or voluntary school. Given the potential impact of closing a

rural primary school, we shall require the local authority or governing

body when drawing up school closure proposals to consider whether there

are any alternative options. They should consider the impact on the

local community; the availability and cost to the local authority of

transport to alternative schools; and the increased use of cars by
