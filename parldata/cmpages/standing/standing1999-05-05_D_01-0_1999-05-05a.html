Resolved
<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill, copies of which are available in the Room. If hon. Gentlemen and Ladies wish to remove their jackets, they may do so. I also remind hon. Members, as a general rule, that adequate notice of amendments must be given. I do not intend to call starred amendments, including any starred amendments that may have been reached during an afternoon sitting of the Committee.
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>International football banning orders</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Burns </B>(West Chelmsford): It is a pleasure to have you as Chairman, Mr. O'Brien. I categorically assure you, on behalf of the Committee, that we anticipate giving you no trouble whatever. We trust that the Committee will be enlightening rather than contentious.
<P>
For the sake of brevity, and to avoid wasting anyone's time, I do not want to reiterate the debate on Second Reading. It was a full and vigorous debate, which provided ample opportunity to explain the overall thrust of the proposed legislation. It might help the Committee, however, if I were briefly to outline the purposes of clause 1.
<P>
Clause 1 does two things. First, it renames the current restriction orders as international banning orders. Secondly the main thrust of its powers  it puts on the statute book the powers for courts to impose international football banning orders on those people who have been convicted in a court in this country. The order will require them to hand in their passports up to five days prior to an international football match, which will prevent them travelling abroad and causing the mindless acts of vandalism and violence that have besmirched our national reputation in the international arena.
<P>
On Second Reading, a vigorous discussion took place about whether the clause should be amended in Committee to give courts the power to impose a banning order on individuals who are unconvicted of an offence. It would have to be proved to the courts that reasonable grounds existed to believe that such individuals may commit an act of violence or vandalism if they were to travel abroad. I listened carefully, on Second Reading and subsequently, to hon. Members on both sides of the House, and it would be fair to say that there was some disquiet and misgiving about the proposal.
<P>
Throughout the course of the Bill, I have been prepared to listen to arguments that may not coincide with my own and to have discussions with the Government. I am persuaded, in the light of the Second Reading debate and my misgivings, that it would be wrong for me to table amendments to make such a significant change in a private Member's Bill. I still believe it is right for the courts to have that power because it would hep to combat even more the problems that we saw in France and elsewhere last year and earlier. It would be unwise for me so to amend the Bill, but it is open to the Government later to introduce such legislation in a law and order or criminal justice Bill. I hope that the Government will consider that when they draft their legislation on public order.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Kate Hoey):</B> I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. O'Brien. Your fairness and humour will allow us to have an interesting, amicable and enlightening debate.
<P>
The Government strongly support the Bill, which is timely. It is necessary to make changes to the Football Spectators Act 1989, on which I made my maiden speech. I hate to think that I was involved in making legislation that, only 10 years later, needs amending. It is clear from the way in which the Act and other public order legislation has worked that it is necessary to keep up with the way in which people who are involved in football hooliganism have managed to circumvent the law.
<P>
I particularly support clause 1. Changing the restriction orders to international banning orders may seem a cosmetic exercise, but it makes the exact purpose of the order clear and removes any confusion with orders for other purposes. The clause clearly covers international football banning orders.
<P>
The clause also puts the courts under a duty to make an international football banning order when someone has been convicted of a football-related offence and they have reasonable grounds for believing that such an order would help to prevent violence or disorder.
<P>
The Committee will be aware that the measures in the Bill are aimed at strengthening the 1989 Act. The courts have been criticised for not using powers available to them. I said on Second Reading that my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary had written in December to remind the police, the prosecutors and the courts of the powers available to them, and that resulted in an increase in restriction orders.
<P>
The clause further provides that the courts must state in open court the reasons why they decide not to issue such orders. That is important. If a court decides that a football-related offence has been committed but that it will not serve an international banning order, it must give its reasons so that those who may have suffered from that violence, whether they were directly involved or were innocent bystanders, who are often caught up in such violence, know why the person concerned will be allowed to go to the next football match. 
<P>
The power to make banning orders in respect of people without conviction is necessary. I understand the reluctance of the hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) to introduce a controversial amendment, which might make it more difficult for the Bill to make progress. However, the Government will want to return to the matter, because from football intelligence we know that some people commit offences or are involved in organising violence but cleverly manage not to be where they may be arrested. We need to find a way of dealing with those people.
<P>
We accept that the issue is complex and that the Bill is not the right place to deal with it. We will want to have further discussions, particularly with organisations that represent decent football supporters. The Football Supporters Association and the National Federation of Football Supporters Clubs know that there is a small minority that must be dealt with. If we can find a way to bring football with us so that it supports us, we may be able to deal with this issue later in a Government Bill.
<P>
I support clause 1 and hope that we will be able to debate some of the slightly more controversial issues.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Greenway </B>(Ryedale) : I reiterate the welcome that you have been given as Chairman of our deliberations on this important Bill, Mr. O'Brien.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) said that a detailed debate took place on the Bill on Second Reading, and I was happy and privileged to take part in it. I agree with him that it would not be sensible for us to go over the same material again.
<P>
I have discussed the question of an amendment with my hon. Friend and the Minister, and my hon. Friend has reached the right judgment. It is important to place the measures in the Bill on the statute book at the earliest opportunity. We should certainly do so well before English fans cross the channel this winter, when a record number of club teams will take part in European competition. More importantly, we should do so in good time for the European nations championship in Belguim and Holland next year.
<P>
There could be agreement on both sides of the Committee on the proposed amendment, which would strengthen the Bill. My comments on Second Reading demonstrated my support for such a proposal. I say that in particular because, although the police had yards of video footage from incidents that occurred in Marseilles in the World cup last year, for example, those responsible were not prosecuted they were put on a plane and sent back to this country. Perhaps we could consider how we might improve the prospect of such people being prosecuted in this country for what they do abroad, that is another option. Without question, however, we must, in our enthusiasm to get the Bill on the statute book, be mindful of the fact that there will always be some trouble. When it occurs, the public and, no doubt, the tabloid press will ask, "What did Parliament do to prevent it?" We now have an opportunity to answer that question. That is why I support the Bill.
<P>
We are all familiar with the difficulties of private Member's legislation. The wise choice is, therefore, to have a debate on the clauses there are contentious points, as the Minister said and to make the progress that we all want. We should return to the question of how we deal with unconvicted hooligans on another occasion.
<P>
I hope that I have made it clear that we would support a measure that the Government introduced in Government time. Indeed, last summer, during proceedings on Report on the Crime and Disorder Bill, my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) and I pushed for more to be done on the issue. We proposed football behaviour orders to mirror the anti-social behaviour orders contained in that Bill. The wording in this Bill, which differentiates between international and domestic football banning orders is clearly a much better solution.
<P>
I agree with the Minister's remarks about the need for clear titles to ensure that there can be no doubt about the orders' purpose. The phrase "restriction order" is so widely worded that it could mean almost anything. However, the meaning of an international football banning order is clear, and even the thickest yob could understand it.
<P>
It should not just be left to the magistrates to decide whether it is appropriate to impose such an order; the burden should be reversed. The courts will have a duty to reverse their procedure when considering particular convictions, which we shall debate later during our consideration of the Bill. When a court does not consider that the imposition of a banning order is appropriate, it must state its reasons in open court. The clause is important because of that, and we have no hesitation in supporting it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gerry Sutcliffe </B>(Bradford, South): I, too, welcome you to the chair, Mr. O'Brien.
<P>
I want to be brief, but I am slightly concerned. I understand why the hon. Member for West Chelmsford does not want to table an amendment on unconvicted hooligans, and I accept his remarks about the particular problems of a private Member's Bill. By supporting the Bill, the Government are taking the opportunity to pass the legislation as quickly as possible. We are happy about our legislative procedures and about the amount of legislation that is going through. I am, however, slightly worried that we will lose the legislation in the long term. I hope that the Minister's assurance is correct, and that the Government will consider the matter seriously.
<P>
Football is currently being considered as a whole. The football task force report will be published in the summer, and football in general is the subject of a variety of academic reports and press speculation. As the hon. Member for West Chelmsford said, we are trying to deal with circumstances that have prevailed in international matches, so it is appropriate that the orders are called international football banning orders.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will reiterate that we will not lose sight of the Bill's purpose because of the tight parliamentary timetable. People will question our judgment if incidents in the coming months or years show that we have let the loophole remain.
<P>
<B>Mr. Derek Twigg </B>(Halton): I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. O'Brien.
<P>
I congratulate the hon. Member for West Chelmsford on his Bill, as I have not yet had a chance to do so. I am pleased that the Government have perceived the opportunity to pass important legislation in a difficult and crowded parliamentary timetable.
<P>
I share the concern expressed by my hon. Friend and Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe) about the amendments that are not being tabled. I am sure that the Government will take account of those concerns, but it is a pity that it will be difficult to bring the matter forward during this Parliament because of the Government's legislative programme. The issue at stake is striking a balance between personal liberty and the effects of people's actions abroad and the damage it does to our reputation as a country and to football in Britain.
<P>
Interestingly, after the problems in Marseilles, the Government received a lot of criticism from people asking, "Is this the sort of Britain that we live in?" Labour Members have not been in government very long and, as the Minister mentioned, existing legislation could have been used. I do not think that prosecutors and courts were strong enough, which perhaps resulted in some of the problems that occurred during the World cup.
<P>
A balance must be struck, taking account of personal liberty, ability to travel abroad and so on. We cannot afford to allow the damage to our reputation that we have seen in the past to continue. Even domestically, football violence has increased and a number of incidents involving such violence have occurred during the past 12 months. Worries have been expressed about the European competition and about the increase in the number of teams in the European Champions cup.
<P>
The Government want to take action to show that they are dealing with offenders. The issues that have been raised will be well dealt with.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) spoke about the amount of video footage evidence available to the police and to the courts. One wonders whether such evidence is being used and whether there should be a closer look at what happens. Events have occurred that might have been prevented.
<P>
There is a balance sheet approach to considering what affects personal liberty and what is good for the reputation of the game and of the country. I am pleased to support the clause, but I have reservations. We could be harder in the legislation that we use to deal with such problems.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Relevant offences</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> The clause deals with schedule 1 of the Football Spectators Act 1989, which lists football-related offences. Its purpose is to bring into the definition of football-related offences issues such as ticket touting. To use the legal jargon, it will add to the list certain offences of violence or disorder, which are not committed at a football ground or on a journey to a football match, but which are committed within 24 hours of a designated football match and which relate to that match.
<P>
A classic illustration of such an offence is what happened across England during the World cup in France. The football matches were taking place 800 or 900 miles away in the south of France, but there was violence, disorder and other breaches of the peace in towns and cities in this country. Under the clause, such offences will be added to the schedule as football-related offences. The provisions of the Bill could then be triggered to deal with such people.
<P>
I strongly support the clause because it is part and parcel of the entire package. I hope that the Committee will support it also.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Clause 2 is crucial to the Bill. The authorities have experienced difficulties in the application of what have been restriction orders but which will, under the Bill, become banning orders. One such difficulty has been the vexed problem of designating an offence as a relevant offence.
<P>
Supporters might travel from one end of the country on a Friday night or a Saturday morning for a match on a Saturday afternoon. After the game, possibly when they are halfway home, there might be a violent fracas involving the police, which results in successful prosecutions. The question would be whether all those events were related to football. It plainly was: had there not been a football match, those people would not have been travelling the length and breadth of Britain, causing trouble after a match.
<P>
In the past, the courts have not necessarily considered such events to be relevant offences subject to the banning orders. Under clause 1, we shall put on the courts a duty to impose international or domestic banning orders and a duty to explain if they do not do so. That will allow the courts to focus their attention on whether offences are relevant. It is important that the courts have a much clearer steer from Parliament on which offences should be considered relevant if they are to have to explain why they do or do not impose banning orders. I hope that I have made myself clear on that point.
<P>
I know that some, from a civil liberties perspective, have questioned whether the time limit of 24 hours has been too widely drawn. I do not believe that it has: that limit is essential. As all who follow football closely know, we largely contained the violence that occurred inside football grounds. The violence that occurs now has also been largely contained by police action, but when it occurs it is usually outside the grounds. It would be ludicrous if we passed the Bill and the hooligan could say, "Ah, now we know how to avoid getting nicked and becoming subject to these banning orders we will behave in a certain way at a certain time in a certain place." Some of the violence is so organised and orchestrated that we have to ensure that, while we need to balance civil liberties, as the hon. Member for Halton said earlier, it is crucial that the courts clearly understand what offences are relevant. Furthermore, the hooligans those intent on violence must understand that if they spend 48 hours on the road travelling the country to go to a football match and cause trouble anywhere at any time, and they have convictions, those convictions need to be relevant. The clause that my hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford has proposed will ensure that that is the case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Derek Twigg:</B> I support the clause, but I should like to add a caveat. Football is not the cause of the violence it is caused by the people who hang on to it and try to make it an excuse for violence. It is important to make that distinction. It is a great game, but unfortunately certain individuals and groups of people want to use it as an excuse for committing violent offences, as we have seen during this season. For example, the Manchester City-Millwall match led to offences taking place many miles away from the ground in other parts of Manchester and Stockport. Another bad incident occurred at Salford Quays as a result of the Liverpool-Manchester United match. Some serious and nasty incidents have taken place this year in the lead-ups to matches. It is important to make the distinction that the problem is not football, but the people who hang on to it to cause trouble and violence.
<P>
I sometimes wonder whether the courts have sufficient powers available to do more than they have done in the past. More clarity is needed to understand what the courts should be doing and what they can do. That is a shame, because much of it should be common sense. 
<P>
Ticket touting remains a major problem at football grounds. On Saturday I went to Liverpool's game against Tottenham and saw numerous people offering tickets, although I am not sure whether they were overpriced. The police should intervene policemen were standing around doing nothing about it. The powers are there, but they are not being used.
<P>
Most of the people I sit with at Anfield are season ticket-holders. We turned up at a match last season, and all the seats in our row 10 or 12 seats were taken up because people had been sold forged tickets for those seats. Some of them had come from as far away as Australia and Ireland. I am not sure whether the offence of ticket touting covers forged tickets or whether it relates only to genuine tickets. I assume that it does include forged tickets, but I would appreciate clarification on that point. Over the years that I have watched football I have seen trouble breaking out at grounds as a result of people trying to sell tickets at exorbitant prices and purchasers finding out that they are forgeries. Ticket touting can be a major source of disorder, and it needs to be dealt with. The Manchester United-Newcastle cup final is coming up, and I hate to think of the black market ticket prices, especially around Wembley towards the start of the game. It is unacceptable, and I am pleased that the Bill provides an opportunity to deal with the problem in a more determined way.

<P>

<B>Mr. Tony Clarke </B>(Northampton, South): I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. O'Brien, and congratulate the hon. Gentleman on promoting the Bill.
<P>
I support the clause. However, it could make it difficult for the courts in trying to interpret whether a person should be convicted and have a banning order imposed on them because of their position at the time the offence took place. The hon. Member for West Chelmsford mentioned matches that can take place 800 or 900 miles away. It may be necessary to prove the intent of the person who has committed the offence. Football violence tends to be one of two things it is either proactive, where those carrying out violence have gone with a clear intent of causing trouble, or reactive, where people find themselves caught up in violence without having intended it when they left their house.
<P>
In respect of the example given, we must bear it in mind that the 24-hour period may be over a weekend. People may be in town centres for no purpose related to the football game they may be on a stag night; they may normally be present there but react to an incident and be subject to a banning order. While I support the clause, work may need to be done to assist the courts in interpreting whether those concerned acted with intent, were proactive in violence and in committing an offence, or were simply reacting to events.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Joan Walley </B>(Stoke on Trent, North): May I say what a pleasure it is to serve on this Committee with you, Mr. O'Brien. The last time that you and I were in Committee discussing football was during consideration of the Water Bill 1989 when we sat on the Opposition Benches and filibustered for long hours through the night. May I say what a pleasure it is to see you as Chairman on this most important Bill. 
<P>
In recent years, huge advances have been made in policing and much attention has been paid to local police forces briefings before and debriefings after the match. Policing has been geared to incidents in the ground, and the focus has moved from clubs to stewarding arrangements.
<P>
It will be crucial that police forces have adequate guidance on how to interpret the proposed changes to the relevant offences in clause 2. In the same way in which emphasis has moved from policing to stewarding in the grounds, we must carefully consider the guidance given to police forces, so that if offences are committed within the 24-hour period, they are geared up to deal with them. I can think of recent incidents in which those involved good honest citizens and football supporters have felt that the police were not there when they were needed. It is crucial that we rethink what guidance police forces should be given, so that they can properly police the new offences.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sutcliffe:</B> I was remiss earlier in not congratulating the hon. Member for West Chelmsford on the Bill; I am happy to do so now. There are those in the football authorities who are against regulation. They consider that there is too much regulation by outside bodies and argue that it should be done by the Football Association itself, especially with regard to ticket sales.
<P>
I am happy that ticket touting is covered by the clause, but to help the police and the courts, we need a clear code of conduct on ticket distribution for football clubs, the FA and other bodies concerned with club competitions. If such a code is made clear, we can reduce the amount of touting. For example, I am concerned about how corporate hospitality tickets get into the hands of touts. We should be able to trace where tickets have come from. The guidelines to clubs and organising bodies should make it clear that they have a responsibility for tickets. I am happy to support the clause, and am glad that ticket touting is covered by it.
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey: As the hon. Member for West Chelmsford and I were discussing, there is a lot of expertise among members of the Committee. All the points that have been raised demonstrate that the Bill is being considered in detail by people who understand football. My hon. Friend the Member for Halton said that violence was not football's problem. I understand what he means; it is the people who come to football matches.</B><P>
<P>
I used to say all the time, "Oh, it's just thugs who attach themselves to football." The problem is that a lot of thugs like their football, but they get their best kicks out of what they do around it. That is why it is so important that we change the culture of the game, in the sense that we put first the 99.9 per cent. of supporters who are decent. Those of us who are football supporters would not support the Bill if we did not think that it was in the interests of the genuine supporter.
<P>
The period of two hours before a game and one hour after is clearly not working. Those who organise the violence are sophisticated, they have planned it. They contact each group by mobile phone so that  they know exactly where they will meet up to stage their violent attacks on each other or on innocent people. That is why we must change the period to 24 hours.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member of Northampton, South (Mr. Clarke) talked about the power of the courts and asked whether people would have to act with intent or just react. Before anyone can be convicted of an offence, the normal criminal burden of proof needs to be satisfied that is, there must be proof beyond reasonable doubt that the offence was committed intentionally.
<P>
I am pleased that the hon. Member for West Chelmsford has included ticket touting in the list, but the difficulty is that the police must satisfy the court that touting was actually taking place naturally, the seller and the purchaser tend to claim that the tickets are changing hands legitimately. They say things like, "He's my mate and I've just met up with him." The Football Supporters Association pointed out to me that often, genuine supporters, who for some reason cannot go to a match, will want to get rid of their ticket and get their money back. We should encourage clubs to be much more flexible on the day. I know that it happens further down the league, but in the Premier League it is much more difficult to return a ticket on the day and get the money back, and for that ticket to be sold to someone else. We can do a lot with legislation, as the Bill shows, but football  generally must change how it acts.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Drew </B>(Stroud): We are all mindful of the weekend's events at the match between Celtic and Rangers. The authorities must think carefully about whether the time at which games are held whether at the behest of television companies or not will give opportunities for trouble. Will my hon. Friend comment on that? How might the Bill influence the situation?
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> First, to finish my comments on ticket touting, the Bill deals with the point made by my hon. Friend for Halton about forged tickets, because the offence includes anything that purports to be a ticket. 
<P>
Clearly, the time of matches is not in the control of the Government; nor is it in the control of the hon. Member for West Chelmsford. It is certainly not in the supporters' control. I share the concerns that have been expressed about that by, among others, the Football League and the Association of Chief Police Officers. Some matches are moved to the evening just to fit in with broadcasting requirements, particularly those of Sky Television. However, I do not want to start Sky-bashing, because it does an extremely good job of covering matches; many people can now go to pubs and watch matches that they could not travel to or see otherwise. The Football Association, as the overall governing body of football in this country, must consider the issue, and supporters must ensure that they apply pressure in that regard.
<P>
As I am sure the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) realises, the Bill does not apply to Scotland. I woke up in the middle of the night a couple of nights ago worrying about whether all the Scottish Members would demand that the Bill be applied to Scotland. Clearly, they have to look at the problem and see whether the Scottish legislation is adequate.
<P>
With regard to the Celtic-Rangers match, the police had asked that it start earlier, but the club refused, because it wanted to tie in with other matters. Clubs must always be aware that they have a responsibility for the well-being of their supporters in the widest sense.
<P>
I hope that I have covered all the points. I am sure that the hon. Member for West Chelmsford will pick up any that I have not answered. The clause is necessary. It will make it much easier to deal with people who are committing offences outside the period covered by the present legislation.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill
<H4><center>Clause 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>Conditions and duty to report</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 2, in page 4, line 39, after Ôinternational' insert Ôfootball'.
<P>
Clause 3 deals with the nuts and bolts of the imposition of international banning orders. I believe that the law, as enshrined in previous legislation, is rather weak: the requirements on an individual on the day of a match to report to a police station of their choice are too loosely defined so that it is difficult for the authorities to ensure that the court order is adhered to and obeyed. The clause will tighten up the current law, provided that when an international banning order is issued, a particular time and police station will be specified not later than five days before a designated match for the surrendering of a passport.
<P>
Clause 3 does, however, need a simple amendment to the drafting so that there is no question of a clever lawyer playing around with the legislation to get a client off the hook. The clause contains the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"by an international banning order".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would simply insert "football" after "international" to make it compatible with the rest of the Bill. It picks up a drafting error. It will ensure that no doubt remains, and leaves no scope for clever lawyers to use the mistake to evade the implications and powers in the Bill. I hope that the Committee will see fit to accept the amendment.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, that the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I did not intervene on my hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford because my remarks did not relate specifically to the amendment. However, it would be helpful to the Committee and to the House to ensure that we are supporting my hon. Friend's proposal on the surrender of passports.
<P>
On Second Reading, some hon. Members seemed to be under the mistaken apprehension that once the passports had been taken away, they were taken away for good. That is not the case. We are proposing a mechanism to ensure that those who are subject to international football banning orders are unable to travel to matches when they take place abroad. I have thought long and hard about this since Second Reading. It goes to the heart of what we said earlier about whether it would be sensible at this stage to include such banning orders in respect of known hooligans who had no convictions, which offends some people's civil liberty views.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Let us imagine a situation in which a known man of violence someone whom the police have every reason to believe is intent not simple on committing violence but on orchestrating and organising it at a match abroad is made the subject of an international football banning order. He ignores it, goes abroad and causes mayhem and damage. We saw that happen in Marseilles during the World cup. Communities miles away from the football grounds, which had nothing to do with the World cup, had their shops, cafes, restaurants, and houses smashed to smithereens. That known man of violence had caused mayhem because we had not taken the trouble to require him to surrender his passport. We just left him free to honour the obligation to attend a police station and not to go abroad.
<P>
The public would look on Parliament with utter amazement if we did not take the precaution of requiring people to surrender their means of travelling abroad for the few days before a match. It is with that in mind that we must conclude that, unusual though it is to take this step, past experience tells us that it is as does our anticipation of what may happen in the future if we do not.
<P>
I detect that the Committee wants to make speedy progress with the Bill. I hope that those who study our deliberations will conclude that we have not taken this step lightly and simply rubber stamped a provision. We have given the matter very careful consideration. I cannot recollect our doing anything like this before, but it has been on the agenda for a long time. For the reasons that I have given, we would be failing the public of this country if we did not include the provision in clause 3.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sutcliffe:</B> I agree that this is a very serious matter. As my hon. Friend the Member for Halton said, it is a question of balance and judgment because there are civil liberty issues at stake. I believe that, on balance, surrendering passports is the right way forward.
<P>
I considered I do not know whether the hon. Member for West Chelmsford did as well the idea of stamping passports when orders are issued so that when an individual travels abroad on any other business, people know that he is capable of violent conduct. We deal with such issues in-house at home, but surely other countries have the right to know that such people are capable of violence. However, on balance, I believe that the surrender of passports is the right way forward.
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> This is a very important part of the Bill. The public have seen people who have been told that they must not travel to a match get away with it because the powers requiring them to report to any police station are not adequate. People could report and then travel no one checked. There was no way in which the police knew who would be reporting to their station.
<P>
This is a question not of an individual's civil liberties, but of enforcement of the law. The law states that these people must not travel. The clause will ensure that they do not travel; it will simply take away their passport for the five-day period before the match. That is important, and is key to everything that the Bill seeks to do.
<P>
Legitimate questions were raised on Second Reading about the Government's obligations under European legislation and international conventions on civil rights. We are satisfied that we may do everything intended by the Bill under those treaties. We fully support this crucial measure. The Bill is crucial and I know that 99.9 per cent. of decent supporters will support it.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 3, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 4</center></H4>
<H4><center>Duration and termination of orders</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Clause 4 deals with the maximum time scale under which international banning orders may be imposed. We listened to, and the Minister held discussions with, interested parties on the issue. We want to get the legislation right and are prepared to make changes in the light of representations. We have reached an example of where powerful representations were made, and of where I was prepared to change the Bill prior to its original publication.
<P>
I thought initially that if someone was convicted of an offence and an international banning order was imposed, that order should have a maximum duration of 10 years. Representations were made to me that that might be too harsh, and that there should be a sliding scale. Those arguments were both realistic and compelling, and so I was prepared to propose a sliding scale when the Bill was finally published.
<P>
On that sliding scale, orders of six to 10 years will be imposed on people who have been convicted of a football-related offence and have been given a custodial sentence. In other cases, in which a custodial sentence has not been imposed, the scale will be between three and five years. The clause also contains the important proviso that, after people have served two thirds of an order imposed by a court, they will be able to go back to the court and make a case that, on the ground of good behaviour, they can have the rest of the ban withdrawn.
<P>
That proviso is reasonable because it gives an incentive to people who have had a banning imposed upon them to behave well. They will have a hope that they can, having served two thirds of the period, go back to the court and say, "I have been good and the rest of the order should be lifted I should be allowed to be outside the restrictions."
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 4 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 5</center></H4>
<H4><center>Offences outside England and Wales</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> The clause will enhance the procedures for use when someone is convicted of a football-related offence by simplifying the processes by which details of convictions and of corresponding football-related offences committed outside England and Wales are to be provided to the British courts. The current situation is unduly complicated, and is in many ways ineffective. The clause will simplify the law and also tighten it to make it more effective so that we maintain the pressure on people who travel abroad and whose behaviour there brings shame on our country.
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> We have bilateral agreements with six countries Scotland, the Republic of Ireland, France, Italy, Sweden and Norway. We are in discussion with Belgium and the Netherlands, and members of the Committee who follow football that is all of us will know that those countries will be very important next year. We are also seeking agreements with Denmark.
<P>
Bilateral agreements are entered into so that the courts in England and Wales can consider international football banning orders against those who are convicted of football-related offence in a particular country. The present arrangement requires the judgment of the court in that country to be provided and to contain specific information about the conviction. That is quite a bureaucratic process. which can result in delays and in the foreign jurisdiction supplying insufficient information. Hon. Members will know, for example, that the judgments that the French authorities forwarded following convictions during France 98 lacked the salient information needed to put the cases before the English courts. Even with bilateral agreements, therefore, the system sometimes does not work properly.
<P>
The measure will allow for the relevant time to be determined individually with each country. That time will form part of the agreement and be subject to an Order in Council. We very much support the proposal.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 5 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 6</center></H4>
<H4><center>Domestic football banning orders.</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> We have just completed the part of the bill that deals with international football banning orders. In clauses 6 to 8, we move on to their mirror image for domestic football matches. In many ways, the three clauses mirror for the domestic market what the Bill does in the international field.
<P>
Like clause 1, clause 6 changes the names of existing measure; in this instance, exclusion orders are being changed to domestic football banning orders. Under the previous legislation, there were exclusion orders for domestic games and restriction orders for international games. We felt that that was confusing as my explanation shows. To simplify matters, we have introduced international football banning orders in clause 1 and domestic football banning orders in clause 6.
<P>
In that way, there will be clarity and simplicity.
<P>
Clause 6 places on the courts the same requirements that they have under clause 1 in respect of international football matches. Again, this is an important issue. We have problems with domestic matches, just as we do with international matches. Fortunately, as statistics showed on Second Reading, many of the problems that are associated with the Premiership and the main league matches are shifting away from the grounds somewhat. Sadly, however, they are shifting to non-league matches, which were far freer of problems in many ways until relatively recently. I am confident that, with the powers that we discussed under clause 2, we will be able to tighten up in that regard. I hope that the Committee will agree that clauses 6 to 8 are important weapons for the domestic game.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 8, line 44, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Ô(aa) in section 50 of that Act (meaning of sentence), in subsection (1)(h) (which contains a reference to a declaration of relevance under the 1989 Act), after "under" insert "section 31 of the Public Order Act 1986 or under".'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The amendment provides for a right of appeal against a declaration of relevance by a court that the offence being considered related to football matches for the issue of a domestic football banning order. In effect, it provides a similar right of appeal to that which applies when a declaration of relevance is issued by the court in respect of an international football banning order. Again, it brings domestic provision in line with the corresponding international provisions, and I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The amendment deals with an important issue. The mood of the Committee is wholly supportive of my hon. Friend's Bill, but the amendment demonstrates to those outside who follow these matters that my hon. Friend has considered carefully what was said on Second Reading. In particular, there should be an opportunity for someone to say, "Hey, you've got the wrong end of the stick here", and for someone else to take a fresh look at whether the individual should be subject to a banning order.
<P>
None of us can have a reason to challenge someone's ability to appeal. It is an important element in getting the balance right between the public interest and an individual's civil liberties.
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> The amendment shows the Bill, although small, has been considered very carefully to ensure that it gets the balance right.
<P>
The Bill and existing legislation already provide for appeals to be made to the Crown court against declarations of relevance and domestic and international football banning orders, and for further appeals to the Court of Appeal against the making of both orders and a declaration of relevance in relation to the international order. The amendment is important because it will ensure that on an appeal against a domestic banning order to the Court of Appeal, that court can also overturn the declaration of relevance. If it does so, of course, the banning order is automatically overturned.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Clause 7, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill
<H4><center>Clause 8</center></H4>
<H4><center>Effects of orders etc</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> This clause mirrors earlier provisions covering international football banning orders and deals with the time scale of an order. It provides that the period for which a domestic banning order can be imposed should be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"not less than one year nor more than three years."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Ironically, that is in some ways a relaxation of the existing regime. At present, exclusion orders for a domestic match are required to apply for not less than three months, but there is no cap at the upper end. Thus, to give a ludicrous example, an exclusion order made under the existing regime could in theory last for life, although clearly that would never happen. The existing regime is inconsistent with the regime for international matches, where a minimum and maximum time scale is specified. Again, 66 per cent. of the period must be served before someone can return to the courts to ask them to reconsider and possibly relax the remaining third of the ban.
<P>
The clause also tightened up the penalties for someone who fails to comply with an order, making it an arrestable offence under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. It also increases the maximum penalties from one month in prison to six months and the fine level from level 3 to level 5. I hope that the Committee will agree that the clause is sensible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Derek Twigg:</B> I welcome the clause, which increases the penalty for a breach of a football banning order. People who receive a ban or a sentence sometimes decide to try to get round the system. The creation of a penalty to catch such people reinforces the purpose of the orders. The clause makes breach of a domestic football banning order an arrestable offence under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. That is an important message for people who try to ignore the system or try to get round it. The provision shows the importance that the hon. Member for West Chelmsford and the Government place on that message. It must get across to the public and the media, and those who want to commit offences or who think about doing so must understand it. The clause makes it clear that the Bill is not a softly, softly approach, despite reservations about the time scale of the three-year limit rather than the higher limit.
<P>
The message that the clause gives to me and to people outside the House, is that the Bill toughens the current system against efforts to circumvent or to get round it and against people who commit offences while being subject to a banning order.
<P>
Kate Hoey: The proposals provide sufficient enforcement powers and penalties to deal with breaches of orders, which are so annoying to people, as I said earlier. There is nothing worse than people getting round legislation, and something happening when the law says that it cannot, so it is right to strengthen the penalties involved. However, we could be getting a little complacent about domestic enforcement. It is important to recognise that, and to build on the success that we have already had inside grounds.
<P>
You will know, Mr. O'Brien, about the Government's consultation document on measures to strengthen and improve existing laws. It contained concern about the courts regarding one year as the maximum as well as the minimum period, and suggested that they should be allowed discretion to consider the length of the order according to the seriousness of the offence in question. The provisions strengthen current legislation in those respects.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I think that I said earlier that after a domestic banning order had been in place for two thirds of its duration, the person to whom it applied would be able to ask the courts for the final third to be set aside on the ground that he or she had behaved well. On reflection, I think that I was incorrect and that a person can appeal to the courts after a year. Will the Minister confirm that, as I would hate to have misled the Committee?
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> The hon. Gentleman would never knowingly seek to mislead the Committee, but he was correct in his second statement that the courts can be asked to set aside an order after one year. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The consultation included discussion of an arrestable offence to apply when a constable thought that someone was likely to breach what was then an exclusion order now a domestic banning order. Will constables have the power of arrest in such circumstances? 
<P>
Earlier, we discussed passports in relation to international football banning orders, and we agreed that it would be sensible to require the surrender of passports to prevent people from travelling abroad to matches. However, I am not clear whether one physically has to breach a domestic banning order before one can be arrested and convicted of the offences that clause 8 creates, or whether the Government still intend to consider creating an arrestable offence in terms of a person whom the police believe is intending to breach the order. For example, in the case of a match in London involving Leeds United, to which known hooligans from Yorkshire are intent on travelling, regardless of the fact that they have a banning order, what powers would the police have to prevent them from travelling? I know that that issue was discussed in detail in the consultation paper. Can the Minister clarify whether the Government and my hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford, whose Bill this is have come to a conclusion on the matter?
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> In response to the hon. Member for Ryedale's point about the right of arrest, section 24(7) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act gives the constable the power of arrest on reasonable grounds that the person is about to commit an offence. I hope that that clarifies the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am most grateful. It is an important point, and those who read our deliberations will be left in no doubt about the situation.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 8 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 9</center></H4>
<H4><center>Indecent or racialist chanting</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Clause 9 deals with extending the law on indecent or racist chanting. I hope that no Member of Parliament of any party would disagree with the clause, which tries to block a loophole in the law on the obscenity of such chanting. Sadly, that is far too prevalent not only at football matches, but in other walks of life in our community.
<P>
Currently, under the 1991 Act, the offence of indecent or racist chanting at a designated football match applies to two or more people engaging in that sort of disgraceful behaviour. The clause extends the law to the individual. I am surprised that provision for an offence by an individual was left out when the original legislation passed through the House of Commons in 1991. The reason has been lost in the mists of time. I have racked my brains and cannot for the life of me come up with a logical reason to explain why it was excluded I assume that it was merely an oversight. I am therefore delighted that the Bill provides the opportunity to block the loophole to enable us to try to minimise this appalling blight on our society.
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> I add the Government's support to the Clause. I too cannot recall any discussion on the matter at the time. Does the hon. Member for Ryedale have something to add?
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> From my recollection of the Home Affairs Committee, when we recommended that racist chanting should be made a criminal offence in football grounds, we were slightly confused by the concept of chanting requiring more than one person. We were concentrating on choruses at football grounds. If only one individual is speaking awful words, does that constitute a chant? If so, I think that that should be stamped out. We have concentrated on the concept of a great choir behind the goal, but one individual is all that it should take to constitute an offence.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Kate Hoey:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that explanation; we all look back at legislation sometimes and wonder why things were left out or put in.
<P>
I have seen some police intelligence unit video footage of a club I will not name it because I think that it gets an extra share of abuse about how its supporters behave; it is a London club that has made great strides to try to stop racist chanting. An individual was continuing over and over again to chant racist and abusive language. People around were reacting, but no one did anything. That is another problem we need to get supporters to pay attention and to stand up to what goes on around them. Better training of stewards is also important. It is clearly not right that an individual behaving in such a way cannot be prosecuted although he may be removed from the ground.
<P>
<B>Mr. Derek Twigg:</B> The clause removes ambiguity when it is uncertain whether a group of people or one person is involved. I accept my hon. Friend's point about other supporters and stewards. Will the Government make it clear to football clubs that they view racist chanting most seriously, and that when the Bill is introduced, clubs should make a renewed effort to stamp it out? Some clubs clearly do not view it as seriously as others.
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> My hon. Friend is right. When the Bill is passed, as we hope that it will be, detailed guidelines must go out to the police and to football clubs. They will be responsible for if not implementing many of the measures, ensuring that they are implemented by the responsible authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Illsley:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that there is a duty on football clubs to publicise the fact that racist chanting is illegal? I know that at my local football club, Barnsley, an announcement is made before every match by South Yorkshire police to draw attention to the fact that such chanting is a criminal offence, and that anyone found participating in it will be arrested and prosecuted. The club was congratulated by the football task force on that. Perhaps it would be good practice if more clubs were to implement such a warning to draw fans' attention to the fact that such chanting is a criminal offence.
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> My hon. Friend is right. Throughout our discussion, it is becoming clear that clubs can do a great deal more some already do a great deal, but we must ensure that those who are doing little are continually reminded of their duty. It is wrong for any club taking public money as all clubs do in some way or other not to carry out what legislation requires. My hon. Friend mentioned that football task force report on eliminating racism, which called for the measure to be introduced. That has been given wide support in consultation there was overwhelming backing for it.
<P>
I stress that that does not mean that football grounds will become places where people cannot shout loudly and have fun and enjoyment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Clarke:</B> Can my hon. Friend ensure that another oversight is not made at this late stage? From reading the clause, I conclude that although we have defined what is a chorus we have said that it may consist of only one person the Football (Offences) Act 1991 mentions "repeated uttering".
<P>
Would an individual who uttered a single racist cry or comment fall within the Bill, or would such a person be given a second chance because the comment was not repeated? I am concerned that there is no need for a chorus of comments one person could be involved but the Bill refers to "repeated uttering". I would not want anyone to feel that they could get away even once with making a single racist remark because, as a football supporter, I know that most supporters find such comments the most distressing.
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> What my hon. Friend says allows me to remind members of the Committee that the breach of the peace provision and public order legislation already deal with abuses and discriminatory language. They apply to football matches as they do elsewhere, so individuals are already liable to prosecution. Under those measures it must be shown that the chanting caused harassment, alarm or distress to another. However, that is required by neither the Football (Offences) Act 1991 nor the clause. It will be a little easier to get that nasty individual about whom everyone wants to do something although nothing has been able to be done up until now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The Minister reminds me of why a select committee recommended such a measure and of why legislation was then introduced which did not require evidence of alarm, distress or other effects. There is still a requirement of a "repeated utterance", but we shall be able to deal with an individual rather than two or more people in concert.
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> Individuals of the sort to whom my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, South referred, cannot currently be prosecuted. Under the Bill, they may be prosecuted, and not just taken out of a ground. Even that might not be happening, but under football clubs' own rules, stewards can remove anyone for doing something that the club does not want done. I presume that stewards have the power to remove from the grounds someone who urinates in the stadium. Whether stewards do so is up to the agreements made within each club.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Clarke:</B> For clarification, it was said earlier that clubs must avoid disruption. We must call on police forces and stewards to work more co-operatively to ensure that, when racist chants are heard, there is a universal ideal of what should be done and of how quickly people should act.
<P>
I apologise for being so vocal, but I am still concerned about the possibility of an individual who might utter expletives against ethnic minorities getting away with it because the comment was not repeated. Under the Bill, a comment must be repeated before it becomes an offence. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Clarke:</B> Yes, it has to be repeated.
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> As I said earlier, if one remark blithely said by an individual causes distress, that person would come under the provision of the legislation. Other people's feelings are involved; the case involves not jus the individual. I hope that that helps to clarify the point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I understand the point of the hon. Member for Northampton, South. Whether one person was involved or 500 people, there would not have to be repetitive chanting for an offence to have been committed as long as there was evidence of distress having been caused. Under the 1991 Act, no evidence of alarm or distress is required; repeated utterances will still be required in cases involving individuals when prosecuting under that Act.
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> If I am wrong, I hope that I will be corrected, but I am clear from the advice that I have taken that if an individual in a football ground makes one loud racist remark which causes distress to a nearby individual or group, that person can be charged if the incident is reported. That is important. Much of what has been said highlights the need widely to distribute the explanation of what can be done once the Bill is passed. That should be done not only by the football clubs, but by the police and the supporters associations so that everybody is clear about what is involved. My hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, South is right that everybody can do a little, but that they must work together to solve the problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Drew:</B> I congratulate the hon. Member for West Chelmsford on introducing the proposals. As he said, the problems relate not only to football; they certainly affect cricket and, I imagine, rugby. I hope that it will be made clear in the spirit of good will, even if there is no legislative backing that those sports should also take responsibility for dealing with the issue.
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> My hon. Friend is right. I will certainly draw his remarks to the attention of my hon. Friend the Minister for Sport. Clearly, the issue goes wider than football and it needs to be considered across the board.
<P>
I want to return to a point that I was making some time ago, before I was interrupted mid-sentence. We do not want our football grounds to be sterile, quiet places. I am concerned perhaps because I am getting slightly older that the genuine humour that was found at matches and the genuine jokes, which were not racist or filthy, have disappeared. We need to enhance the fun side, which seems to have gone away.
<P>
I do not want to enter into a debate about who goes to football matches these days and about who cannot afford to, because it might stray well beyond my Home Office responsibilities. I am, however, glad that we have had some debate on the proposals before us because they are an important part of the Bill and will be welcomed throughout football and the country.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 9 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 10</center></H4>
<H4><center>Sale of tickets by unauthorised persons</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Clause 9 blocked up a loophole in the law. Similarly, clause 10 blocks up a loophole in respect of ticket touting. The Committee will know that, under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, the sale of tickets to designated matches in England and Wales was made illegal unless done through authorised sellers. However, that leaves out of current legislation tickets that are sold for international matches played overseas. The purpose of clause 9 is to bring those matches within the ambit of the law as it applies to domestic football matches. In that way, when the Bill becomes law, it will be legal to sell tickets for international matches abroad only through authorised sellers in this country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Derek Twigg:</B> Is the proposal just for international matches and not, for instance, for European club matches?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> It is for all designated matches abroad. That would include both international and club matches that are international.
<P>
<B>Mr. Twigg:</B> I do not want to spend much time on this, but an old chestnut was perhaps mentioned earlier. It is much more difficult to get tickets for international and European club matches because fewer are available than for domestic football matches, where there are crowds of 50,000 or 40,000 and, therefore, many more opportunities for ticket touts. Will my hon. Friend the Minister tell the FA and the clubs that the Government view this seriously? There are fewer excuses for touts being able to get hold of tickets for international and European matches than for domestic club matches.

It is worth reminding members of the Committee why we want this clause in the Bill. At present, when fans obtain tickets unofficially, it is unfair to the supporter. In addition, there is potential for the breaking down of segregation at matches, and the security arrangements that have been put in place by tournament organisers can be disrupted. That can lead to problems both inside and outside the ground.
<P>
I was lucky enough last week to go to the match between Manchester United and Juventus. As I am an Arsenal supporter, it was clearly work. I spent the day with the Manchester police and its intelligence unit to see how they co-operated with the Italian police. There were real problems at the match in Milan a few weeks before. A lot of people had been treated badly and there were problems with security at the ground. Talking to supporters shows that many of those problems arose because of inadequate ticket allocation, and people trying to get tickets when they got there.
<P>
The Manchester United supporters were very good there was no arrests at the match nothing to do with the fact that I was there [laughter] but there was a problem with the way in which decent supporters, who had paid money to attend, were treated. There was a general feeling that anyone coming from England would be badly behaved and likely to cause violence. That is the reason for so much of the policing style in other countries.
<P>
We can do only so much. The clause is not a substitute for the organising authorities ensuring effective ticket sales for the safety and security of spectators. It does, however, recognise the failure of organisers in the past, and will complement any additional measures that may be introduced as a consequence of those failures.
<P>
The European Union police co-operation group has drafted a Council of Europe resolution requiring tournament organisers to satisfy the host government on ticketing arrangements. That will set out critiera to be applied for ticketing control, numbers of tickets, admission to the ground, and so on. It is important not to allow organisations to sell tickets that they do not even have, and rip off supporters.
<P>
Much of that kind of behaviour falls outside the scope of the Bill; it has more to do with consumers. The Home Office is working closely with the Department of Trade and Industry to move matters forward. Clearly, we do not want people at the next international championships to be sold tickets that were not in existence when tickets began to be sold. 
<P>
The clause is a small, technical addition. It deals with part of a much wider problem that is not down simply to the Home Office. We hope that co-operation between authorities and countries will help to eliminate, or at least minimise, such behaviour.
<P>
<B>Mr. Colin Pickthall </B>(West Lancashire): My hon. Friend the Minister said that this was part of a much wider problem. I have a niggling question about ticket touts. The problem is growing rapidly at rugby union internationals. There have been some problems at Twickenham but they have not resulted in serious violence or anything like that.
<P>
I shall leave my question hanging in the air, because I do not expect an answer to it. It is quite possible for police officers tackling ticket touting outside one of the great London football grounds one week to see the very same people touting tickets at a rugby union international the following week. Last season, when Wales played international games at Wembly, it would have been possible for the same constables to be confronting the same touts on two consecutive Saturdays outside the same ground. The police would have been able to do something about one lot of touting, but nothing about the other.
<P>
Our legislation singles out football as a special game, which of course it is it is far and away the most popular of all our sports and requires special attention but the Bill, strangely, contains no definition of "football". We used to call rugby "rugby football". Does the Bill cover rugby football as well  as soccer? I know that it is not intended to do so, but I would be fascinated to know. I have no problem with that. There is virtually no problem with violence in rugby union [Interruption.] Not among spectators, anyway. But rugby is increasingly being marketed like football and is becoming a bigger crowd-puller, so perhaps in a few years we will see similar problems, certainly at the big games. I do not really expect an answer to my question, but it is an interesting one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am not sure about this, because I am not a lawyer, but clause 10 refers to subsection (2) (c) of section 166 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, which contains a definition of designated football matches. Given that it contains that designation, I assume that it must define what a football match is.
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> Perhaps I could add that we have been having discussions in the Home Office with the organisers of the rugby and cricket World cups as hon. Members will know, both are to be held in this country. The organisers recognise that the ticket touting legislation that the Home Office is considering is designed with crowd segregation and security issues in mind, particularly the problems that have been associated with football. There is another debate about the unfairness of ticket touting, the origin of tickets and the consumer angle supporters are angry at having to pay huge sums of money. However, we are considering the issue from the narrow point of view of safety. Fortunately, although there have been some minor problems at cricket matches, so far there has not been the same scale of violence either within or outside rugby or cricket grounds

<H4><center>Financial provisions</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> The clause deals with financial provisions. As hon. Members will know, on Thursday night the House passed the money resolution to this Bill, which will in effect implement clause11. The anticipated financial cost of the Bill is put at approximately £100,000. In due course, it may lead to an increase in administrative staffing of five people. That is money well spent and the Bill is cheap at the price.
<P>
<B>Kate Hoey:</B> In supporting the Bill, we are clear that where extra money is needed to implement it, it will be made available. However, the way in which the Bill will work will be such that if substantial extra amounts are needed, they can be absorbed within the costs of the courts and prison system although people will not necessarily be sent to prison under this legislation. We will, of course, keep the financial implications of the Bill under review. I am satisfied, on behalf of the Government, that sufficient provision has been made to accommodate the measures.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Clause 12 covers the bureaucracy and nuts and bolts that are attendant upon the Bill. The Bill will come into effect two months after it receives Royal Assent. I assure the Committee that under subsection (3) it is not retrospective in any way, shape or form.

Question proposed, That the Chairman do report the Bill, as amended, to the House.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I thank all members of the Committee for the splendid way in which business has been conducted, which has made my task easy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I thank you, Mr. O'Brien, on behalf of all members of the Committee, for the courteous way in which you have chaired our proceedings, which has enabled us to have a full and adequate debate about the Bill. Hon. Members have been able to air their concerns and to discuss in sufficient detail some of the important issues that arose on Second Reading.
<P>
I also place on the record my thanks to the  Minister for the way in which she has assisted in the Bill's passage. I also thank her officials especially Mr. Alan Brown who have been very helpful with drafting, information and explanation. I hope that the Bill will now proceed through Report and Third Reading to the statute book, because the country and the sport overwhelmingly support its aims. It will help to minimise the activities of a small, mindless group of thugs and hooligans, who do so much damage and spoil the fun of the vast majority of law-abiding, decent citizens who want to enjoy an afternoon or evening of family entertainment at a football match.
