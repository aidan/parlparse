                           </span> I shall not keep the Committee
long, but I seek clarification from the Minister of the meaning of
subsection (2)(b). I presume that that gives Ofcom the power to set the
tariff for the universal service, but I am unsure of exactly how that
is to be done. Under our present system, it is clear enough. We have a
first and second class postal service, delivered by a public monopoly.
If it wishes to raise the price of the service, that has to be
determined by Postcomm, and it has recently announced that it is minded
to allow a substantial rise from April of next year. However, I am not
clear about how such a provision fits in with the Minister’s
brave new world of privatised operators competing with one another and
only the privatised Royal Mail being obliged to provide the universal
service.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000021">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
situation brings to mind the saga of the parliamentary trains, which
are now little remembered apart from by aficionados of Gilbert and
Sullivan. However, I am sure that the Minister, as a good Liberal, will
recall that Gladstone, as President of the Board of Trade, was
responsible for the Railway Regulation Act 1844. Incidentally, it is
perhaps ironic, given the nature of this Bill, that that Act originally
set out to nationalise the railways. The Act decreed that there should
be one train with provision for third class passengers running on every
line, every day, in each direction; the fare should be one penny per
mile; the speed should be not less than 12 mph; and third class
passengers should be protected from the weather and provided with
seats. That was a universal service for its day, although one wonders
whether many of our current providers could manage the last of those
conditions. Of course, many railways complied grudgingly, providing the
bare minimum or running trains early in the morning or late at
night.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000022">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">You
may well be wondering, Mr Hood, how what I have described is relevant
to the current position, but  I am concerned that these
provisions could just conceivably have the same effect on a universal
service in postal deliveries. Due to the weather, I was, unfortunately,
unable to be here to debate the earlier clauses on the universal
service and obviously I will not seek to revisit those clauses now, but
I note that the provisions for the universal service obligation specify
that there will be a 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 660<a class="bkMark" name="Column660">&#160;</a>
                           </div>daily delivery and pick-up. They do not, however, specify how long it
will take for the letter or package to get from pick-up to delivery. We
all understand that in the present system a first class item will be
delivered the next day or so, whereas a second class item may take
several days. It is not clear to me that any such undertaking is given
in the new
system.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000023">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
particular concern about this provision is that it seems to allow Ofcom
to set the price for the USO services to ensure, as in an earlier
clause, that the service is financially viable. Does that mean that a
branded universal service could be running in parallel with the same
company operating a different regular service at a different and lower
price in some areas? For example, if I wanted to send a letter from
Westminster to a constituent in Angus, I would use the USO service to
get it delivered, at a cost of, say, 50p. Perhaps the Minister could
use a different service, such as the London suburban express, which
delivers only in the Greater London area, for, say, 30p. In effect, the
larger urban areas could have a cheaper service than the USO service
due to the larger population centres and ease of delivery, leaving the
USO operating only on the periphery and Ofcom with the power and
perhaps necessity of increasing the price to consumers to ensure that
the USO
continues.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000024">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am sure that the Minister, in his usual inimitable way, will just
dismiss those concerns. He will perhaps point to subsection (5), but I
do not think that that gives protection in the possible scenario that I
have outlined. I fully appreciate that there is already a price
difference for bulk users in the present system, but I am concerned
that giving Ofcom the power to look at the charges for the universal
service in this way could open the door to a price difference for
individual users of that service, as opposed to bulk users. I would
like an assurance from the Minister that that will not happen through
Ofcom setting the price for users in this
way.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000025">&#160;</a>

Member for Angus picked one aspect of clause 44; I pick another. The
Minister will tell me if I am barking up the wrong tree, but I
understand that the clause will apply when the Secretary of State
directs Ofcom to require contributions to be made to meeting some or
all of the burden concerned. The hon. Gentleman spoke about the whole
burden, but I wish to speak about only some of it.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000027">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I presume
that we are talking about the impact on providers delivering a service
such as that currently offered by Royal Mail in its final-mile delivery
of competitors’ mail. In evidence, Mr Sibbick of the Mail
Competition Forum stated in answer to my question on how the Bill could
be improved that he thought that this clause was restrictive of
competition. Does the Minister agree with him that the discretion of
Ofcom in this clause translates into uncertainty that could be 
damaging to the market? Does the Minister believe that the access price
negotiated by Royal Mail and UK Mail—as Mr Sibbick said, it is
now in the market—is sustainable?<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000028">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As I read it,
clause 44 provides Ofcom with the opportunity to set the level of
contributions to be made to meet some of the burden, but the hon.

                           </div>Angus spoke of setting the level to meet it all. Am I right to deduce
that agreements such as that made by Royal Mail and UK Mail for the
last-mile delivery, which I believe is 13p per letter, will in future
be made by Ofcom? Could that result in the last-mile contract being set
at different levels in different parts of the country? Could a
mandatory scheme for universal service providers, if there is more than
one, apply to all other mail
providers?<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000029">&#160;</a>

I speak to staff in local sorting offices or have meetings with Royal
Mail workers, I am told time and time again that 13p is an
inappropriate amount for the job. The Minister may say that it was a
commercial decision, but am I right that it will in future be a
regulatory decision? Will he tell the Committee what was assessed to be
the burden on the universal service provider, or providers, caused by
the transfer from a commercial decision to a regulatory one? We know
that the last-mile delivery is anything but the last mile; it might be
the last 20 miles, and in the constituency of the hon. Member for Angus
it might be even longer.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000030">&#160;</a>

by both Houses of Parliament, and I congratulate the Minister on

Ofcom to set different prices and service levels in different parts of

that the universal service defines a UK-wide service at a universal

could be offered at a lower price in larger urban areas, which could in
effect undermine parts of the universal
service.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000038">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The answer is still no. I am not absolutely sure
what the hon. Gentleman is talking about. He seems to be talking about
the way in which the universal service is delivered, which is obviously
something that we debated under clauses that were considered when he
was not here. If it helps him, I can tell him that the universal
service structure is built, first, using the postal services directive,
then with the minimum service requirements in clause 30, and then of
course with the universal postal service order issued by Ofcom, set out
in clause 29.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000039">&#160;</a>

areas, with respect to letter mail, for example, which goes across the

with a compensation

the charges paid by them are the cost of the stamp or sending the

increasing the cost of a stamp to send letters around the

                        </p>I
am looking for an explanation. Are we effectively saying that Ofcom can
increase the price of the universal service to make up for the fact
that it may be losing money and a compensation fund may be necessary?

a parallel non-universal service in specified
areas?<p class="tabbed">

price of stamps and so on, but in the first instance it is much more
likely that bulk customers rather than individual customers would be
targeted by Ofcom. It will work not so much by putting up charges, but
probably by a percentage of the stamp price being allocated as a levy
into the fund. That is a sensible way to proceed should that be the
chosen option.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000046">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Let
us be clear about the process that takes us to that option. We must
have a review of the unfair burden as set out under clause 42. If Ofcom
concludes that there is an unfair burden on the universal service
provider in providing the service, it has to make a report and
recommendations to the Secretary of State who has to decide how he
wishes to proceed. If the decision is taken to go for a compensation
fund as a way to help the universal service provider pay for the unfair
burden of providing the universal postal service, Ofcom will set out
how payments are to be made into the fund, which is where subsection
(2)(a) and (b) come in. From users, indirect contributions through
their charges would be a percentage of the price paid for the
stamp.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000047">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I understand what the Minister is saying, but the
bottom line is that if a compensation fund has to be set up, the other
competitor will contribute to it, but it is clear that consumers will
also be paying higher charges for the universal service. I appreciate
that the only way in which that can be done is by raising the stamp
price, but it seems to give Ofcom the power to raise it for that
specific purpose so there will be a danger of the consumer facing
ever-rising prices in a competitive world. I am sure that the
privatised companies will be fighting hard not to be paying more into
the fund. Where does the hon. Gentleman see the parameters? How much
will come from the
consumer?<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000048">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman is right that if there were a
compensation fund, it is likely that there would have been price rises
in the meantime. It would mean that there would have been serious
financial problems for the universal service provider and that the
efficiency improvements that we needed to see in Royal Mail would not
have happened. Let us be absolutely clear that if we had reached such a
point, things have not worked well and Royal Mail will not have
succeeded in its modernisation programme. As we debated at length, it
is essential that Royal Mail working with the Communication Workers
Union and its employees implements the modernisation agreement to
deliver efficiency gains, to avoid future price rises and to ensure
that the universal service is financially
sustainable.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000049">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
whole Bill is about securing the universal service. As we have debated
at length, looking into the long term the modernisation agreement
itself will not be sufficient. Capital will need to be injected into
the business to make sure that it can continue modernisation for a long
period. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that if all that
fails—if the modernisation agreement is not implemented, if
after the Bill receives Royal Assent and Royal Mail is privatised, the
private capital that is injected to continue the modernisation fails to
make Royal Mail efficient and competitive and it is still unable to
deliver the universal postal service efficiently—there is a
danger that prices would continue to increase. We would have probably
seen the stamp price increases already, if we had reached such a
position. In such a rather unpleasant, and I hope unlikely situation,
the consumer will be paying. I am not hiding that from him or the
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000050">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I stress to
the hon. Gentleman that the whole structure of the Bill and our policy
is to ensure that that point is not reached. However, as we discussed
last week, if there is a review of the unfair burden placed on the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 664<a class="bkMark" name="Column664">&#160;</a>
                           </div>universal service provider, Ofcom and the Secretary of State have not
only one, but three options in the Bill. In the 2009 Bill they only had
the option of the compensation fund, but this Bill has two
others—the procurement option and the option to review the
minimum service requirement, subject to the parliamentary
accountability set out in clause 33. I understand the point that the
hon. Gentleman made and it is a fair one, but he should not worry,
because there is nothing hidden and the clause is unlikely to be used.
On the points he raised during his initial remarks, about different
levels of prices and of services, he need not be
concerned.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000051">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Ochil and South Perthshire cited Mr Sibbick of the Mail
Competition Forum on his concerns about the impact of contributions on
competitors. Clearly, under subsection (2)(a), the
competitors—postal operators—would be asked by Ofcom to
contribute. Most people who have debated compensation funds over many
years know that it is an option to ensure that the universal service
provider is supported if such a fund becomes an unfair burden.
Obviously the competitors are not keen to have to put their hand in
their pocket, and understandably so. They want to ensure that Royal
Mail becomes more efficient and, indeed, they welcome the fact that the
envisaged review has been delayed to ensure that no perverse incentives
might discourage Royal Mail from becoming more efficient. One reason
why we delayed the review was to make Royal Mail understand that it has
to become more efficient and so make the compensation fund a less
likely outcome. The competitors have welcomed that and although some
would rather not have the provision in the Bill in the first place,
their situation has improved vis-à-vis the 2009
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000052">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">This
may be unfair on Mr Sibbick, but he used to work for the Department of
Trade and Industry, as the Department for Business, Innovation and
Skills was then called, and when he was an official in the
mid-’90s, I met him on a train in Sweden. I say to the hon.
Member for Angus that we had second class tickets, which is what they
mainly have in that part of Sweden. We were travelling back from a
conference on postal economics, which had been thrilling. He and I
talked about this—not clause 44, as that had not been written,
but the issue of a compensation fund. As a civil servant, he mused on
the fact that it was an obvious option. People who have studied postal
economics over the years realise that it is fundamental as a safeguard,
when a universal service provider has to provide a service at the same
price for the same level of delivery throughout the
country.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000053">&#160;</a>

understand the concerns of Mr Sibbick, who represents the members of
the Mail Competition Forum, but they and he will understand why the
provision is in the Bill. They will also understand, that we do not
want to get to the point of needing such a compensation fund, and
should be reassured by that. I think I have covered all the points
raised by the hon. Member for Ochil and South

Bill. Royal Mail may well have different contracts with different
terms—that is the case now—but in terms of BIS and a
compensation fund, that is certainly not what is intended. Subsection
(2)(b) is not about changing other aspects of the universal service or
the access pricing regime, or anything like that. It is about seeking
contributions to the compensation

reiterate that the clause is simply about ensuring that there is some

that if such a fund is required, regulations establishing it would
require the consent of the Secretary of State and the approval of both
Houses. I am glad that the hon. Member for Ochil and South Perthshire
welcomed that. Only providers of services falling within the scope of
the universal service can be required to contribute to the fund.
Individual consumers cannot be required to contribute directly to the
fund—I thought that point might come up. The Bill, as we have
discussed, allows for contribution by way of charges that would almost
certainly be levied by a percentage of the price of a stamp, which
would then be allocated to the fund. Ofcom is required to secure that
regulations setting up any universal service fund are objective,
proportionate, transparent, do not give rise to discrimination against
particular providers or users and avoid or minimise the distortion of
competition. There are controls around that. Hopefully, that also deals
with some of the concerns raised by the hon.

                        <p class="tabbed">It
is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship again, Mr Hood. I rise
to speak to clause 45 and amendment 121, which is in my name and that
of my hon. Friend the Member for Ochil and South Perthshire. Clause 45
is about the report on the sharing mechanism, which is detailed in
clause 44. That clause is about the contributions that Ofcom may
require postal operators to make to the operator of the universal
postal service, to meet some or all of the burden of providing that
universal postal service. As it stands, clause 45 seems to single out
the reporting on the contribution to sharing the burden of the
provision of the universal service as an area that has a shorter review
time than the other aspects under review. Business planning and
investment needs to be made well in advance, and the universal service
provider needs to have as much certainty as possible in order to make
the necessary business
plans.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000061">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">While
I appreciate the very fast-changing nature of consumer use of mail
services, any changes in business practices take time to implement. In
order therefore to create more stability, and to give the universal
service provider—namely a newly privatised Royal Mail—the
stability and certainty to plan for a longer period than just 12
months, we are suggesting that the first report should be prepared for
the period of three years from 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 666<a class="bkMark" name="Column666">&#160;</a>
                           </div>when the first regulation made under clause 44 comes into force. In
other words, we are not suggesting that there should be any delay in
making those initial regulations on the contributions to share the
burden of providing the universal service, but we are suggesting that
once those contributions have been determined, they should remain in
place for longer than 12 months—for three years, in fact. The
idea is to give as much stability as possible to Royal Mail for its
business
planning.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000062">&#160;</a>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
certainly accept the need for reporting and reviewing, not least
because the costs of providing the universal service might escalate and
it may be necessary to make sure the contributions to the burden are
increased accordingly. This is not about setting in stone a particular
solution or set of figures for ever, but rather about being realistic
about business planning time scales and increasing stability.
Businesses need that certainty to plan ahead. To us, a period of three
years strikes a suitable balance. It would allow a sufficiently long
period of time for which the universal service provider could plan, and
yet would allow a report and possible review to be made after three
years, which would then allow changes in market conditions to be
reflected accordingly. The last thing that a fledgling privatised Royal
Mail service needs, particularly if it is encountering difficulties, is
a lot of instability, with the goalposts changing all the time. It
needs stability to establish itself and to continue with its
modernisation
plan.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000063">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
had very much hoped that our amendment 95, requiring any USP access
condition to be commercially negotiated and not to undermine the
universal service, would be looked on more favourably by the
Government. Had the amendment been accepted, that would have helped to
guarantee the creation of a more realistic financial plan for the
provision of a universal service. Even then, there could have been a
need for contributions to the burden incurred by the universal service
provider. As our amendment was not accepted, and without assurances
from the Government that they might bring forward amendments of their
own that would have a similar effect, there could very well be an even
greater need for the power that Ofcom has under clause 44 by which it
can require contributions to the
burden.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000064">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It
is in the light of that need that our amendment 121 requires, before
any report or review, a three-year period after the coming into force
of the first regulations made under clause
44.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000065">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful for the hon. Lady’s remarks,
particularly as she is showing concern about long-term planning for
business, which is what the whole Bill is about. If we are to protect
the universal postal service, we need to ensure that the universal
service provider is able to plan long term, so I refer the hon. Lady
back to clause 28 and the duties that we put on Ofcom as it sets about
regulating the universal postal service, particularly bearing in mind
the need for financial sustainability. We inserted the financial
sustainability duty in this Bill, which is different from the 2009
Bill. It has caused consternation in some of our previous debates, but
I return to it at this point because if the hon. Lady is concerned
about long-term planning, the duty on Ofcom to ensure that the
universal postal service is financially sustainable gives a sense of
its need to think long term, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 667<a class="bkMark" name="Column667">&#160;</a>
                           </div>which obviously has implications for how it regulates and how it
considers investment and all the other matters that will be required to
provide the universal postal
service.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000066">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am slightly confused by the hon. Lady’s amendment, not only
because it ignores what is in clause 28, but because clause 45 is about
the compensation fund. It is about the requirement for Ofcom to prepare
and publish a report into the operation of that compensation fund. It
mirrors a similar requirement in the Communications Act 2003. It seems
reasonable that—in the unlikely event that, Ofcom having made a
review on whether there is an unfair burden, a compensation fund is
selected as the option for dealing with that—there should be a
report on the operation of that. I should have thought that the hon.
Lady—and certainly her hon. Friend the hon. Member for Ochil and
South Perthshire, who always wants more reports and more parliamentary
accountability—would have welcomed that. Rather than welcoming
regular reports, the hon. Lady is seeking to delay the first report and
only wants a report every three years. It is important to make the
information public regularly, especially because other postal operators
who work within the scope of the universal postal fund will be
contributing to the fund, and potentially users will be doing so. The
argument for regular reporting is even stronger here, so I am slightly
mystified that the hon. Lady wants to take us in a different direction.
Given the financial implications of the compensation to those
contributing to the universal service, an annual report is absolutely
appropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000067">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I heard what the Minister said, but I would like
to point out a couple of things. First, the suggestion of a 12-month
period seems to be rather a one-off, in contrast to some of the periods
suggested elsewhere in the Bill. The real issue, however, arises when a
fledgling Royal Mail has got itself into a situation in which there
clearly needs to be a contribution to the burden of the universal
service. If we are looking at and deciding on what sort of contribution
is needed, and setting it for a 12-month period, and if there is then
to be a very quick review of that—in other words, if a change is
to be implemented at the end of the 12 months —we
would want to start planning even earlier than that. If there is to be
constant reviewing, therefore, it will be difficult to see whether the
contribution to that burden is having the required effect in
rebalancing the
market.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000068">&#160;</a>

hon. Lady’s opening remarks, she first asked why the three-year
period. I am trying to deal with that in terms of the practical
realities of the compensation fund and why it would need to report back
on how those people’s money is being spent, but she says that
the period is different from that in other parts of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000073">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Yes,
there are different time periods in other parts of the Bill, because
they relate to different things, such as when a review can take place.
In this case, it is a report. I refer the hon. Lady to clause 36(1)(b),
under which Ofcom can, through a designated USP condition, require
information from the universal service provider—it talks about
publishing<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000074">&#160;</a>

hope to disabuse the hon. Lady of her concerns. We hope that a
compensation fund would not last long. We do not wish the compensation
fund to happen in the first place nor, if it were to happen, for it to
become a permanent feature. There is that potential, if it turns out to
be the only way forward, but we hope, first, for it not to happen and,
secondly, for it to be temporary—possibly not lasting for the
three years. The danger in the hon. Lady’s suggestion is that
the compensation fund would be set up and closed down before the first
report was made. I hope she agrees that that would not be a happy
course of events and I hope that she will withdraw her amendment,

course important to have those reports and insight into how the
performance indicators are progressing and so forth. My concern is that
it takes a while for a compensation fund to kick in. I understand the
Minister’s point that one would not want it to last for ever or
be longer than it has to be. The complexities of the market are such,
and the difficulties of looking at changing consumer and competitor
patterns, mean it would be difficult to make a definite assessment. It
would be destabilising for Royal Mail to be given such a short leash on
the compensation fund that it could not plan ahead
effectively.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000079">&#160;</a>

46(7) relates to the publication of a register that Ofcom must keep of

the Minister a few questions. Why does the subsection restrict the
times at which the public can have access to the register? Why cannot
it be permanently available and updated in real
time?<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000105">&#160;</a>

where will Ofcom advertise the publication advising the availability of
public scrutiny, and what is the likely period of time of that
availability? Will it be electronically available, or will access be by
some other means? Finally, how will Ofcom determine the fees payable
for access to the
register?<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000106">&#160;</a>

46 gives the Secretary of State power to make regulations that require
operators to notify Ofcom before they carry on business as postal
operators. It requires the Secretary of State first to consult Ofcom
before making such regulations. The regulations are also subject to the
negative resolution procedure. I am sure that the hon. Member for Ochil

register.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000110">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause makes it clear that Ofcom must make the register available for
public inspection. It requires Ofcom to publish notice setting out when
that will be and stating the fees that anyone wanting to see it must
pay. The notice must be published in such a way as to bring it to the
attention of those who would be interested in it. The hon. Gentleman
has invited me to enter into the mind of Ofcom with respect to the way
it would think about the notice it had to publish and about the details
of the notice.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000111">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There are
some points worth making. It would be unreasonable to require Ofcom to
have the register available 24 hours a day. That is not to say it might
not choose to put it on the web, in which case it would be available 24
hours a day, but we shall not require it to  do so. It is also
worth bearing in mind that Ofcom  is unlikely to set up the
scheme. Similar provisions  have never been used even though
they are in the Communications Act 2003, but it is important that the
powers should be available if it were decided to go down such a
route.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000112">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One
must be clear that the detailed decisions that the hon. Gentleman
wishes me to opine on would be made if and when such a situation
arises. Given that such a situation could be a long way off and is
certainly a big hypothetical, I do not think that in this Committee
this morning I should restrict the decisions in the years ahead of
people who are not yet in post and who have not yet even had to think
about this
problem.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000113">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">All
I will say to the hon. Gentleman, because we have fought long and hard
about this issue, is that we believe that Ofcom will make the right
decisions and we think that Ofcom will ensure that the public can
access this register at the appropriate time. I also say to him that
this register will obviously be a scintillating read; I know that there
is likely to be massive demand to read it across the country. However,
I think that the higher the demand, the more accessible Ofcom will make
the register.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000114">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way before
he finally sits down. I think that he and Mr Sibbick will probably be
reading this register. However, before he winds up, can he enlighten me
as to why there is a time restriction on when the register is
available? Irrespective of whether it is available electronically or in
some other form, is there any reason why there is that time
restriction? Also, he has not explained how that access might be
available. Will he encourage Ofcom to make this register available
electronically, so that, for the period of time that it is available,
it will be available 24/7, even if it is not available 24/7 for 365
days a year? Furthermore, in relation to the last point that I made, he
has not yet touched on the fees payable to allow access to the
register. I would be grateful if he were to just address that point in
some way before he finally sits
down.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000115">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman is right; I have failed to
answer his point about fees. I will answer it now simply by saying that
the same sort of considerations that I was outlining about the time
that the register will be available would apply to fees. Ofcom will
make those decisions in due course in the unlikely event that it
decides to go down this road.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000116">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I am in danger
of repeating myself in answering the hon. Gentleman’s main
points. Regarding what Ofcom will want to have on this register, for
the purposes of ensuring that all the people carrying on businesses as
postal operators are properly brought together on it, it is difficult
to predict the information that Ofcom will require. On one level, one
assumes that the information will be pretty basic—simply the
names and addresses of the headquarters of the businesses, the
directors and so on. However, I do not want to restrict Ofcom from
seeking more information, although some of that further information
might be commercially confidential. Who knows the nature of the
information that Ofcom might want to put on the register? Therefore,
once it has decided exactly what information it wants to have on the
register, it will want to take decisions about how accessible it wishes
that information to be. Who knows what might inspire Ofcom when it is
thinking about that? If we are too specific, there is a danger that we

Gentleman can be reassured that, because the Secretary of State will be
involved in making the regulations in this area—I refer the hon.
Gentleman to subsection (1)—and therefore those regulations will
be laid before the House, it will be possible for the Secretary of
State to make provisions for electronic access and to discuss fees and
the availability of the register in such an order. The Secretary of
State, of course, is under a duty to act in a reasonable manner always
and in every case. So perhaps the best way to answer the hon. Gentleman
is to say that the times that the register will be publicly accessible
will be reasonable and that the fees will also be reasonable.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000118">&#160;</a>

have had discussions and votes on mays and musts, but the essential
conditions guarantee mail integrity—confidentiality, security
and data protection—and are an absolutely minimum requirement
for operators providing communication and logistics services.
Condition 8 of Royal Mail’s licence stipulates that
all licensed operators comply with Postcomm’s code of practice
on protecting the integrity of mail. That code requires all
operators to submit to Postcomm and Consumer Focus annual
reports on a whole range of data. I shall not go into those
data—some of them have been covered in other
contributions—but basically, they are on lost, stolen, damaged
or interfered-with items, and also on trends, patterns or other notable
features, such as above-average incident levels at certain premises.
All of that is important and necessary if we are to have faith in the
integrity of the mail service. All licensed operators must also submit,
with each report, a statement of the measures that they intend to take
to remedy any failure, or patterns of failure, to achieve mail
integrity objectives and to reduce the numbers of code postal packets
lost, stolen, damaged or interfered
with.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000148">&#160;</a>

example is alternative dispute resolution. Postal operators should be

want now to deal with the provisions in clause 47, because it outlines
“essential conditions” that Ofcom can impose on postal
operators. Such a condition can be applied to every postal operator or
to a particular description of postal operators that the condition
specifies. Ofcom can impose such conditions for any or all of five
purposes. The first is to safeguard the confidentiality of letters at
all stages of their journey: sending, conveyance and delivery. The
second purpose is to safeguard security where dangerous goods are
transported. The third is to safeguard the confidentiality of
information conveyed. The fourth is to guard against theft, loss or
damage, and the fifth is to secure the delivery of postal packets to
the intended
addresses.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000159">&#160;</a>

into complaints

                           </div>systems and so on, which we will come to and I am keen to debate with
him, but I do want to debate these conditions, because we need to know,
of course, whether they are the right conditions for Ofcom to be able
to place on postal operators. I argue that they are. Securing these
conditions is essential to maintaining an effective and reliable postal
service.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000161">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Gunrunning and drug smuggling, and public concern
in Argentina about whether a notorious mafioso criminal individual
could gain control of the Argentinean postal service. Obviously that
will not happen here, but it is important that consumers and businesses
know that their letters will remain confidential.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000164">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Our Royal
Mail service has a very high standard of integrity, and I pay tribute
to all its employees; they provide a first-class service and have done
for many years. Although the amount of mail has fallen in recent years
because of digital substitution, overall we still have relatively high
volumes. That is because people trust Royal Mail and know that their
letters will not be interfered with. Countries such as Argentina do not
have that benefit. Ensuring that those conditions are imposed on other
postal operators and not only on the universal service provider is
important, as it protects the integrity of the mail service. Customers,
be they businesses or households, will know that their mail will not be
tampered with but will remain confidential.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000165">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Other
elements of the essential conditions are important, such as those on
theft, loss and damage. It can be a real concern if letters or parcels
are damaged, but I think particularly of the dangers that Royal Mail
employees often face. I know that Royal Mail employees have been robbed
while going about their duties in my constituency, and I am sure that
it will have happened in other constituencies, with people trying to
steal things from the postman’s pouch. I shall give an
example.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000166">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There was a
spate of such crimes a few years ago when mobile phones were being
delivered regularly. They were obviously seen to be highly valuable
items, and organised gangs were robbing the postmen in order to get
hold of them. It is important to ensure the safety of Royal Mail
employees and to ensure that packages are safely conveyed. That is why
these conditions should be imposed on all postal operators. The
integrity and security of the mail service is
paramount.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000167">&#160;</a>

achieve all that by changing the second word in the clause from

these protections, why does he not make that

recognise the importance of consumer protection conditions, as my hon.
Friend the Member for Ochil and South Perthshire has just pointed out,
and feel that it is important that Ofcom should impose such conditions
on every operator, appropriate to the service that each provides. As we
have explained, we would have liked the Government to have been willing
to accept the amendment that would have replaced “may”
with “must” in the first line of the clause, which we
feel would have offered the consumer better protection. I will not
reopen that debate, other than to say that it is a recognition of just
how important we consider consumer protection conditions to
be.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000197">&#160;</a>

                        <p>That seems to leave a
loophole, because it depends on what is meant by “of a specified
description.” We feel that the amendment would help to protect
the consumer better by ensuring that every operator is subject to
consumer protection conditions appropriate to the service it provides.
We have already taken issue with the use of “may” instead
of “must” in the first line, which seems to lessen the
requirements of the regulator considerably. When the Minister responds,
would he explain the thinking behind the decision to allow the
regulator to opt for subsection (1)(b) and impose a consumer protection
condition on every postal operator of a specified
description?<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000199">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
someone takes money from consumers in exchange for providing them with
a postal service, the consumers deserve proper protection. That is
particularly true because of the nature of the postal service, as
people entrust something they value to an operator. They are asking an
operator to take a letter or package out of the consumer’s sight
and pass it along from one employer to another through a range of
settings, from its collection to its transportation, and then on to a
sorting office and perhaps another until the postman or postwoman
finally delivers it to its destination. For someone to entrust their
goods to such a service, they really need a strong belief that they
will arrive at their destination safely. We have agreed that that is an
important point for the consumer.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000200">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
situation contrasts strongly with other products and services that the
consumer can complain about straight away if they are dissatisfied,
often because they have the evidence in their possession. For example,
if someone is dissatisfied with the food or service provided in a
restaurant, they can complain about it straight away. If someone has
problems on a journey on public transport—not that any of us
knows anything about those—they are there in person to witness
those problems and complain. If someone has problems with goods they
have purchased, they have the evidence in their possession and they
have the option to return the goods to the
shop.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000201">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Those
examples are rather different from the postal service. People hand
something over, trusting that it will be delivered, and there can be
serious consequences if it does not arrive as anticipated. For example,
if someone sends a cheque to pay off a debt, but it does not arrive
when they expect it to, they can incur interest charges or late-payment
charges. Someone with a business who wishes to keep to a commitment by
supplying a customer with documents for a project within a specified
time scale could have to make embarrassing apologies. The reputation of
their business could suffer, and the loss of reputation and the loss of
future custom could be difficult to quantify. We could also be talking
about the disappointment of a child who has no present from their
granny or their auntie to open on their
birthday.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000202">&#160;</a>

that my hon. Friend mentioned indicate the problems that consumers
experience, even with legal protection, and the situation could
deteriorate greatly, given the diminution of protections in the Bill.
Opposition Members strongly feel that Ofcom should be required to
impose a consumer protection condition on all postal operators
providing a universal service, or a service within the scope of the
universal service, under the current licensing system.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000208">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under
subsection (1), Ofcom could opt for paragraph (b) rather
than paragraph (a), in which case the relevant parts of the clause
would read:<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000209">&#160;</a>

                        <p>The
phrase “of a specified description” describes the postal
operator. If it were intended to describe the condition, it would be in
the first line of the clause, and the relevant parts of the clause
would say that Ofcom may “impose a consumer protection condition
of a specified description on…every postal operator”. In
that context, the phrase “of a specified description”
would be redundant, because the clause already refers to “a
consumer protection
condition”.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000210">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
wording of the clause seems to allow for the watering down of what is
required under current legislation. Postal consumers should be provided
with at least the same level of protection as is required under current
legislation, be that in terms of the quality of the providers’
complaints handling schemes, access to alternative dispute resolution
or information about ADR, which Ofcom will require from telecom
providers from July 2011.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000211">&#160;</a>

(b). My colleagues and I propose that a consumer protection order
should apply to every operator and that it should be appropriate to the
service that each of them provides. We are extremely disappointed that
the Government did not accept our amendment to change
“may” to “must” in the first line of the
clause. Amendment 122 gives the Government another opportunity to
improve the Bill and to strengthen protections for consumers. For that
reason, we would like to press it to a

                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 49
sets out the consumer protection conditions that Ofcom may impose on
all postal operators, or every postal operator of a specified
description, in order to protect service users. Amendment 122 relates
to Ofcom’s power under clause 49 to impose a consumer protection
condition on either every postal operator or every postal operator of a
specified description and seeks to replace those categories with a
single category allowing for the imposition of consumer protection on
every operator appropriate to the postal service each
provides.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000214">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
intention of the amendment might be to ensure that regulation is
applied with greater precision. It may even be designed to narrow the
circumstances in which Ofcom can impose consumer protection conditions.
However, it is unnecessary and could create confusion for the regulator
and postal operators. Giving Ofcom the power to describe separate
categories of operator, as the clause does, enables it to direct the
consumer protection conditions precisely. That follows closely the
model in section 52 of the Communications Act 2003, which relates to
Ofcom’s functions in other regulated
sectors.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000215">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
are moving away from the current licensing regime to a regulatory
system based on general authorisation where Ofcom can impose certain
conditions on certain categories of postal service provider. Clause 49
gives Ofcom the discretion to impose consumer protection conditions on
all postal operators or postal operators of a specified description.
The latter category allows for differentiation of services, as Ofcom
can specify a description of services to ensure that regulation is
accurately targeted at the appropriate postal operators. That approach
is completely consistent with other parts of the Bill and allows
regulation to be targeted clearly and effectively where it is
required.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000216">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment does not help Ofcom’s ability to regulate. I do not
believe that it offers any greater protection to consumers than is
already provided for; indeed, it might weaken the Bill in that respect,
and would serve only to leave regulation open to challenge and
confusion. It might help the hon. Lady to read subsection (1) again. It
is clear that Ofcom is not being restricted to making only one consumer
protection condition; it can make a series of them. One consumer
protection condition might apply to every postal operator, and another
could apply to every postal operator of a specified description. I hope
that my explanation in more detail will help her understand that the
measure is about targeting and being proportionate. In relation to the
children whom she discussed, if it is necessary in Ofcom’s view
to impose a consumer protection condition on all postal operators, that
is what Ofcom will do. Accepting her amendment would make that more
difficult. I therefore ask the hon. Lady to withdraw her
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000217">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I remain a little confused, because I still see
a loophole. If Ofcom may impose a consumer protection condition on
every postal operator of a specified description, some postal operators
might not meet that specified description. It seems to be a let-out
clause. Otherwise, consumer protection conditions would have to apply
to every postal operator. The measure does not seem to be tight enough
to prevent that from being a partial
effort.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000218">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Let me try to give an example to help the hon.
Lady. Imagine a postal operator—there are many of
them—which operates only in the express parcels business and a
consumer protection condition meant only for letter mail. That is an
example of a consumer protection condition that we would not want to
apply to a particular type of operator; we would want to exclude
operators not involved in letter mail.<a class="bkMark" name="10120935000219">&#160;</a>
