<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 487, in page 24, line 42, leave out from beginning to `advance' in line 43 and insert&#151;

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it may be convenient to discuss the following: amendment No. 253, in page 24, line 42, leave out `first reference' and insert `first and second references'.
<P>
Government amendment No. 488.
<P>
Amendment No. 650, in page 24, line 45, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`unless the detained person can show there has been a material change in circumstances'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The Government think it right that at a first bail hearing, whether under the Bill or under other immigration legislation, the detainee should be able to advance any reasons why he should be released. However, we believe that it would be wrong if, at every hearing before the same court, the detainee could put forward arguments that the court had heard previously.
<P>
It must be remembered that although the Bill provides for only two routine bail hearings, no limit is set on the number of applications that can be made for bail under other immigration legislation. We believe that it is necessary to guard against the courts facing too many possibly lengthy hearings.
<P>
I am willing to consider amendment No. 253, which is in line with the equivalent provisions of the Bail Act 1976, although any change to the law should also contemplate continuing facilities for bail applications to be made.
<P>
I regret that I cannot support amendment No. 650, nor can I understand why it has been suggested. As I have already made clear, the court would not be expected to hear arguments that it had heard previously. However, if a material change in circumstances had occurred, the detainee would be advancing new reasons why he should be released on bail. In such circumstances, the court would clearly be able to hear those arguments, whether they were related to the new facts of the case or to the law as it applies to those facts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister. It was a useful contribution. I was pleased to hear what he said about amendment No. 253.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Similarly, I see a refreshing openness. The Minister referred to a consideration of whether the Bill should have parity with the provisions of the Bail Act 1976, under which an individual could use all his arguments at two hearings. I would stress&#151;I hope that I am pushing at an open door&#151;that the second bail hearing should allow a full discussion at the case.
<P>
Although we welcome the fact that the first hearing takes place rapidly, it would seem entirely reasonable that one should have a full hearing after 28 days. We are dealing with people who may find it difficult to put together a case, because of who they are and the circumstances under which they are appearing in court.
<P>
I welcome the Minister's commitment to look at the matter, and I am trying to add some weight to that argument, because the second 28-day hearing could be critical. The full case, as presented to the magistrates, would be helpful. The fact is that some matters might not have been heard at the seven-day hearing; their exclusion could be to the detriment of the administration of justice.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I was not quite clear, Mr. Hoon, whether you were accepting amendment No. 253.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> No, I was thinking about it.

Clause 34, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 35</center></H4>
<H4><center>Use of live television links at bail hearings</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> It is important to reflect on some of the evidence that we have received about television links. The clause will enable television links to be used in bail hearings. Some of those who gave evidence, especially those representing the ILPA, the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants and Amnesty International, expressed anxieties about the clause. It is important to consider the clause in the context of immigration detainees' possible language problems and their being able to communicate with their representatives.
<P>
The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 provides for magistrates' hearings to be conducted through television links, and some pilots are taking place. We did not oppose that provision, although we expressed some views and anxieties about it. The same anxieties arise with this clause, and I hope that the Minister will tell the Committee that the Government will reflect on the results of those pilot studies, paying particular attention to the concerns of the organisations that have given evidence to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> I should like to make two brief points about the clause. One of its provisions deals with the fact that the detained person should be able to see and hear the court and be seen and heard by the court. However, some of the evidence that we heard questioned the ability of a detained person appearing at a bail hearing under such circumstances to communicate privately with his representative if he so wishes. In a normal hearing, we would expect the person involved to be able to do so. If we proceed with experiments under the clause&#151;which I assume will initially be treated with caution&#151;I hope that we shall ensure that facilities to enable a person involved in a bail hearing taking place through a video link to communicate privately with his representative are clearly specified in the procedures.
<P>
We must approach the provision with caution. One of the issues in a bail hearing may be the credibility of the person involved, especially in asylum cases, in which adjudicators must often make decisions about credibility. Those of us who are relatively familiar with sitting in front of cameras will recognise that it is not always easy, especially when one is facing a camera and the other person to whom one is speaking is at the other end of a video link rather than in the same studio. It is easy to understand how someone who is unfamiliar with such circumstances might sometimes not react naturally to questions.
<P>
I hope that we shall approach the provision with caution. The ability of the detained person to consult his representative in private is important. I do not suggest that we necessarily need to amend the Bill to specify that, but even if it is not specified, that provision should be made when a bail hearing is conducted in such circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The hon. Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard) has made some useful points. I trust that the Minister will explain what is meant by having suitable facilities available at the institution. There may be a wide range of what is deemed to be suitable. In a debate on an earlier clause, I mentioned people's wish to be surrounded by those who are supporting them in their efforts to be released from detention. There may be a difficulty if a suitable facility is taken to mean an individual stuck in front of a camera in an empty room in the detention centre or prison in which that person is being held.
<P>
Will the Minister consider individuals' ability to consult others, by which I mean their ability to make contact with their legal representative and those who are supporting them in their application for bail during what may be a traumatic process in which their liberty is at stake?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The clause allows any court that is conducting a routine bail hearing to direct that live television links may be used for the purpose of the hearing. Such a direction may be made only once representation has been made by the parties at the hearing. Representatives will be allowed to make representations about whether it is appropriate that that should happen. There may be circumstances in which it is difficult for the applicant to be present. For example, a television link may avoid delaying a hearing if it has been decided that that hearing should take place on time according to routine procedures and the applicant is in another part of the country. The television link would enable the applicant to see what is going on. It is therefore appropriate for a decision to be made after representation has been made by the parties concerned.
<P>
I have made it clear that we do not intend to introduce that measure until the appropriate facilities are in place in courts, detention centres and prisons. Furthermore, the measure will not be used until we are completely satisfied that the detainee has a full opportunity to consult his or her representative in private before and during any hearing conducted by television link. The hon. Member for Hallam will note that I said ``before and during''.
<P>
There are various ways of facilitating such a consultation. The advocate does not necessarily have to be in continuous private contact with the person whose application is under consideration. Communication may be conducted via a private link by a representative who is not acting as advocate, but who passes notes to the advocate. Matters are often conducted in that way in courts in which defendants are present. We intend to ensure that, as the person most directly affected by the measure, the applicant is in a position in which he or she can properly carry out his responsibilities and wishes.
<P>
We have considered carefully our obligations under article 6 of the ECHR. We are not satisfied that article 6 applies under current Strasbourg jurisdiction. Nevertheless, we are confident that all the safeguards that article 6 offers will be provided at routine bail hearings, whether or not they are conducted by live television link.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere asked us to reflect on the pilot studies. Let me reassure him that we will certainly do that. Obviously, the measure is modelled on some of the work done for the Crime and Disorder Bill. We intend to take that into account in determining the speed at which we proceed to deal with such matters. Such a provision is unlikely to be introduced in the immediate future, except on a pilot basis. We will proceed with a degree of caution.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow rightly said that it is important to get things right and proceed with caution. I can reassure him that we will do so. I have already confirmed that we envisage that private communication with a representative will take place before and during the hearing.
<P>
I am aware that some people may not perform well on television. However, that may not be relevant, as the applicant may be able to give evidence during a bail application, although that will not normally happen. We would wish to make a careful response to the hon. Gentleman's urging for caution before creating circumstances in which the applicant may be asked to give evidence via television link.
<P>
It is right to be aware of such circumstances. Our commitment that the representatives will be heard before the procedure is permitted will allow people's anxiety about how they will perform on television to be taken into account before the courts decide whether to use that system.
<P>
I therefore hope that Committee members will support the clause.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 262, in page 25, line 25, leave out `Secretary of State' and insert `Lord Chancellor'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 493 and 494.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Clause 36 applies to the hearing of applications for bail made under other immigration measures by a magistrate. Government amendment No. 262 is necessary to clarify that it is for the Lord Chancellor to make rules for the hearing of applications by magistrates. Government amendment No. 493 removes a subsection made superfluous by the revised wording proposed by Government amendment No. 262. Government amendment No. 494 is necessary, given the fact that the Bill gives a rule-making power to the Lord Chancellor.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 491, in page 25, line 29, leave out from beginning to end of line 30.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 492.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Government amendment No. 491 is designed to clarify the Lord Chancellor's ability to make rules under the Bill and, in particular, what those rules may contain. Government amendment No. 492 adds further wording to clause 36; Government amendment No. 491 deletes wording rendered unnecessary by Government amendment No. 492.
<P>
Government amendment No. 492 is also a drafting amendment, the purpose of which is to clarify the procedures that will apply to the hearing of bail applications by magistrates under the rules.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<H4><center>Clause 37</center></H4>
<H4><center>Grants to voluntary organisations</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Earlier, we debated the expansion of the range of those able to represent people at bail hearings. There was a brief reference to grants to voluntary organisations. A key issue for me was the need to explore the Government's intentions on representation at bail hearings. I strongly supported people being able to have representatives, including those without legal qualifications who were introduced as the result of an earlier amendment being accepted.
<P>
I do not expect the Minister to give a specific commitment now, but he will be aware of concern that detained people currently undergoing bail hearings should get support and advice, although such assistance does not necessarily have to be in relation to bail hearing representation.
<P>
Does the provision introduced by clause 37 suggest a policy drive towards ensuring that the organisations that we discussed have sufficient resources to represent all detainees at bail hearings, should those detainees decide to take up such representation?
<P>
I am not necessarily interested in the funding of those who are not part of the mainstream contracted organisations or other methods of providing such funding. However, are the Government aiming for a position in which all individuals facing bail hearings under clause 29 may reasonably expect representatives from the IAS, RLC&#151;or whoever else is funded through clause 37&#151;to have sufficient resources to represent them?
<P>
Do the Government intend that only some resources should be available to represent some clients? The Government should be clear about whether the service will be comprehensive. It would be helpful if the Minister would confirm that he&#151;Treasury willing&#151;is in favour of a comprehensive service, so that no one goes into a bail hearing without a reasonable expectation of some form of advice and representation being available.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman will see from the clause that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Secretary of State may, with the approval of the Treasury''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and will be aware that no blank cheques will be written by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. We shall ensure that organisations that give free representation in connection with appeals and bail will receive appropriate Government funding in so far as it is sensible and within the terms of the Government's overall spending plans.
<P>
As far as possible, we shall ensure that the IAS and the Refugee Legal Centre are given an estimate of their funding needs to deal with such requirements. Grants will be made to them under clause 23. We shall consider in our yearly bids their additional costs and, having said that, I expect that the RLC and IAS will be on the telephone to my office asking when they should put in the bids. However, let us first get the Bill enacted. We shall be trying to provide as substantial a service as possible. Having included all the qualifications that I am sure the hon. Member for Hallam and others expected, I do not think that I can go much further.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 37 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 38</center></H4>
<H4><center>The Immigration Appeal Tribunal</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Clause 38(1) establishes and allows for the continuance of the present Immigration Appeal Tribunal, although with a significantly enhanced membership. Such a change does not actually need legislative provision, but we are aiming to increase the status and the importance of the tribunal and clarify its role as a source of a comprehensive and coherent jurisprudence in an increasing complex and sensitive area.
<P>
To mark its importance, the Lord Chancellor has decided to appoint a High Court judge to be president of the tribunal in the future. That will be a crucial position under the new system and the new appointee will have unique importance as the source of expertise, judicial guidance and training in immigration law. There will be a strong leadership team and the Lord Chancellor will also appoint a deputy president, who will be a senior circuit judge, and who will assist the president as requested and stand in for him or her in times of absence.
<P>
Clause 38(2) refers to schedule 2 which, at paragraph 1 deals directly with the process for appointing full-time and part-time legal chairmen to the tribunal. It provides that, as before, those tribunal appointments are to be made by the Lord Chancellor. We aim to concentrate the role of the tribunal as being a source of a coherent and developing field of law and the Bill allows only for the appointment of legally qualified members. Several people who gave evidence, however, argued strongly for a more flexible model as the issues involved are complex and need careful consideration. We found the evidence helpful and we will return to the matter.
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We come now to the membership of the Immigration Appeal Tribunal. I was most interested in the Minister's remarks and join him in wishing every success to the High Court judge who takes up such an important post.
<P>
Schedule 2 provides that the Lord Chancellor shall appoint members of the Immigration Appeal Tribunal. Paragraph 1(3) states that only members of the legal profession with seven years' experience may be members of the tribunal. Amendment No. 292 is designed to explore that provision. Different views were expressed to the Committee on that subject and I should like the Minister to address specifically the view of the Immigration Appellate Authority on the question of the saving for existing appointments on the tribunal, which it gave evidence to us about wanting to see. Will the Minister say whether there will be such a saving?
<P>
Amendment No. 293 would require a further condition to be met: that those who are appointed should be experienced in immigration law or have received suitable training. That follows from the evidence of the Immigration Law Practitioners Association, which made remarks about the level of experience of some members in its evidence to the Committee.
<P>
Amendment No. 294 would prevent someone from simultaneously serving as an adjudicator and as a tribunal member. That was also suggested by the Immigration Law Practitioners Association, which said in its written evidence that it was concerned that an appeal to a single tribunal member would give them problems if that member was an adjudicator. It
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``could amount to no more than a second appeal to an Adjudicator, or a sort of `peer review'''&#151;[Official Report, Special Standing Committee, 17 March 1999; c. 226.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in which one adjudicator appealed to another.
<P>
I shall not speak to amendments Nos. 549 and 660.
<P>
Amendment No. 658 is designed to highlight the desirability of members of the tribunal having expertise in asylum, immigration and human rights, a sentiment expressed by some of those who gave evidence to us.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Amendment No. 547, tabled in my name, echoes the sentiments expressed by the hon. Member for Hertsmere. In some sense, we are anticipating the change to the single-member system for the tribunal that is proposed elsewhere in the Bill. As the hon. Gentleman suggested, it would not be satisfactory to have two stages of appeal with a single adjudicator in each. If there is to be a single person on the tribunal, we ought to consider whether they should be mutually exclusive pools.
<P>
Amendment No. 548, also tabled in my name, again expresses similar sentiments to those expressed by the hon. Gentleman. We need to consider not only the legal qualification, if that is to be the criterion under paragraph 1(3) of schedule 2, but the type of experience that individuals have had. Many of us have come across a range of experience among those legally qualified concerning this most specific area of law.
<P>
Amendment No. 549 is to explore whether people who were not legally qualified in the way in which the schedule proposes could serve on the tribunal if they had specific experience of the subject. In asylum cases, academic experience can be useful in terms of human rights law. We have recently seen, not far from here, that a wide range of opinion as well as that of the legally qualified is often needed to decide on a human rights case. If we introduce the proposals to revive the tribunal, I hope that we will consider whether it is an opportunity to bring some of that additional expertise into play. The safeguards built into amendment No. 549 would ensure that such an individual should be only one member of a three-member tribunal and should not be its chair.
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis </B>(New Forest, East): I should like to take the opportunity to bring submissions by the Immigration Appellate Authority to the attention of the Committee. It is especially concerned at the prospect of losing lay members for such tribunals. It believes that without them, the tribunal would not command the necessary public confidence, and that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``issues of the credibility of appellants, or assessment of the risk they may face if returned to their countries of origin, or of socio-economic-political issues in third world or former Soviet states are often more significant.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It says that lay members normally bring ``a broader perspective'' to the decisions made by the tribunals.
<P>
The authority believes that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Tribunal's lay members remain more representative of the wider community than are the judiciary generally and the tribunal commands confidence accordingly, adding to its credibility.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``about a third of lay members are from the minority ethnic communities. Others have long experience&#151;for example, as crown servants overseas or with United Nations agencies. This experience adds credibility to the Tribunal, attracts the support of the community and fulfils stated Ministerial objectives.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In conclusion, it suggests that we should consider
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``that a more satisfactory solution would be to adapt the pattern of the Employment Appeal Tribunal.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It also suggests:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Lay members should be retained, but there could be more flexibility in the pattern of hearings. In short, the Tribunal could be more tailored to the case in hand, while retaining its basic credibility of public hearings and a mixture of legal and lay members.''<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The Government fully understand the background to amendment No. 292. It is a prime example of the success of the Special Standing Committee, which was formed to expose the Bill to wider debate.
<P>
We had originally concluded that the new Immigration Appeal Tribunal should focus almost exclusively on legal matters and that the role of lay members, which had been important in the past, was drawing to a close. We still believe that the increasing complexity of the law, especially the incorporation of the European convention on human rights, will mean that more demands of a legal character will be made of the tribunal. However, we have listened carefully to the various representations made to the Committee.
<P>
Commentators have stresssed that lay members play a valuable part and that their removal would diminish the tribunal's public credibility and effectiveness in assessing the facts of a case. We recognise that we must strike the right balance if we are to equip the tribunal to cope with future demands. Therefore, if the amendment is withdrawn, the Opposition have my assurance that we shall carefully consider the observations on tribunal composition and return to the matter later.
<P>
Amendment No. 293 is perhaps worthy, but I am unable to support it. Paragraph 1(3) of schedule 2 sets out the minimum eligibility requirements for membership of the tribunal. It is the Lord Chancellor's policy that appointments are usually made from those who have experience in the relevant area of law&#151;often, though not always, by having sat as adjudicators. However, the issue of whether or not someone is sufficiently experienced in the relevant legal matters can be tested only as part of the appointment process.
<P>
We believe that it would be unreasonable and impractical to apply statutory tests as a gate-keeping function. Similarly, training is a continuing issue; it cannot be applied as a once-and-for-all test. Therefore, I cannot support amendments Nos. 294 and 547, which would have the wholly counterproductive effect of excluding from part-time membership of the tribunal those office holders from whom most, though not necessarily all, appointments to the tribunal are drawn because of their experience and knowledge of immigration law.
<P>
It would not be possible, nor is it the Lord Chancellor's intention, for any individual to hold a parallel full-time appointment in the tribunal as well as being an adjudicator. However, it is the Lord Chancellor's policy that, before being considered for any full-time judicial post, a candidate must usually have served in a similar post in a part-time or full-time capacity for long enough to establish his or her competence and suitability for a full-time appointment. Amendment No. 294 would frustrate that fundamental principle for judicial appointments.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 295, 296, 297 and 541 deal with the membership of the tribunal. Having listened to the evidence put to the Committee, we have thought long and hard about the composition of the tribunal. Careful consideration will now be given to those amendments, especially with regard to panels consisting of more than one member. Therefore, I undertake to return to those matters later.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere gave me the impression that he was not pressing amendments Nos. 548, 549 and 660 terribly hard, so to save time, I shall not refer to them.
<P>
The savings provisions for existing appointments will be needed for adjudicator appointments, but not for the tribunal, and amendments are being prepared to achieve that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for saying that he is considering further amendments. I welcome his remarks on the Special Standing Committee. It was useful to take evidence on the composition of the IAT. I am pleased that the Minister is considering this. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 541, in page 88, leave out line 1 and insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `( ) Subject to rules of procedure made by the Lord Chancellor under Schedule 4 of this Act, the Tribunal shall be deemed to be duly constituted if it consists of three members (or a greater uneven number of members); and the determination of any question before the Tribunal shall be according to the opinion of the majority of the members hearing the case.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 295, in page 88, leave out line 1.
<P>
No. 546, in page 88, line 2, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `But the President may direct that'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `Rules of procedure made by the Lord Chancellor under schedule 4 of this Act may provide that'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 296, in page 88, line 3, leave out `case or'.
<P>
No. 297, in page 88, line 3, after `such', insert `uneven'.
<P>
I was getting used to amendments not being moved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Was that a hint?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Not at all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The amendment clearly sets out to keep the composition of the tribunal to the status quo ante. It replicates the working of schedule 5(12) of the Immigration Act 1971 and has the effect of keeping the normal composition of the tribunal at three members. That is necessary because of the particular role of the tribunal. On Second Reading the Home Secretary described the tribunal as an ``authoritative guide'' to the law. The best way for it to be that is not to have an individual sitting alone but to have a panel which would come to a more collective view. If we are to seek what may be taken as precedent in future and to seek a clarity of view from that panel that would be best based on the consideration of a number of people. One individual may come to a different decision from another individual and the advice of two other panel members might have helped them come to a more general rather than a specific view of the case.
<P>
The move towards single member tribunals introduced in the schedule is not helpful. There has been a long-standing problem with inconsistency at tribunal level. It was recognised in the evidence given to us. Inconsistency at tribunal level leads to further legal difficulties because people will seek other remedies such as judicial review of decisions that have been made. We received evidence that there has been progress in trying to achieve greater consistency at tribunal level, but moving towards a single member tribunal may exacerbate the problem and roll back the gains that have been made.
<P>
Under current rules there are powers for a chairman to sit alone for simple procedural or uncontentious jobs such as deciding applications for leave to appeal and remitting cases for rehearing on procedural grounds where both parties are in agreement. That would be covered under the rules of the procedure to be made by the Lord Chancellor under schedule 4. Amendment No. 546 refers to that.
<P>
The amendments attempt to establish whether, as in the earlier decision about the composition of tribunals and the possible exclusion of lay members, we are following the right course. By moving towards single member tribunals as the norm, with a larger panel as the exception, are we storing up further legal difficulties? Will that prevent us from achieving the common aim of a more consistent, fairer and swifter system that is less open to challenge so that the decision made by the tribunal is one that everyone will respect?
<P>
Can the Minister tell us why a single member tribunal will achieve consistency and how far have the Government considered that will increase the number of challenges that are made over and above the current system with three tribunal members? Amendment No. 297 refers to the fact that an uneven number of tribunal members is needed to achieve majority decisions. I hope that the Minister will be able to give a fruitful response.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Three of the amendments in this group also stand in my name. Amendment No. 295 covers the point about single-member tribunals which the hon. Member for Hallam has already raised. I do not want to go over that ground again, save to say that it was raised by ILPA which also made the point about the need to have a tribunal composed of an uneven number of members, which the hon. Gentleman has again touched upon.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman did not mention a matter raised by the Immigration Law Practitioners Association, which is that paragraph 6(4) allows the president to direct that specified cases and specified categories of cases could be dealt with by a tribunal containing
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``such numbers of members as may be specified.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The ILPA is worried that that provision might be used to direct that a certain appeal be heard by a single-member tribunal.
<P>
The association is happy with specified categories of cases being dealt with by a specified number of tribunal members, perhaps by a one-member tribunal, but it is not happy with individual cases in the same general category being dealt with by different members. It is worried that that might give rise to inconsistencies. It is happy for specified categories of case to be dealt by a single-member tribunal, but not for specified cases to be dealt with by a single-member tribunal. I look forward to the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I listened carefully to the observations made by members of the Committee, which I have considered with the significant evidence given to the Special Standing Committee. Further thought is being given to how the amendments and other suggestions can be taken forward to ensure that panels consist of more than one member. As the hon. Member for Hertsmere said, it will be necessary to adjust the Bill's provisions to reflect the different categories of cases, but careful thought is being given to that. If the amendment is withdrawn, I undertake that further proposals will be brought before the House at a later stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Once again, I thank the Minister for having such an open mind and for taking such a refreshingly positive view of the evidence given to the Committee. I certainly found that evidence persuasive; some senior people came to talk to us about that matter. The Minister has promised to reconsider this matter. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 663, in page 88, line 7, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(6A) Save with the consent of the appellant, no appeal may be determined unless the appellant has had the opportunity to give evidence in person.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Another concern of the Immigration Law Practitioners Association is that appellants to the appeal tribunal should have the opportunity to give evidence in person. The ILPA is fundamentally opposed to the possibility of all appeals to the tribunal being paper appeals&#151;that is, appeals decided on the case papers, the appellants not having the opportunity to give evidence. The association takes the view that although hearings can sometimes be dispensed with, it believes that that is never appropriate if a party objects to such a course. Again, I look forward to the Minister's response&#151;and, I hope, the open mind that he has been displaying to the evidence given to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Perhaps the hon. Member for Hertsmere should quit while he is ahead. The amendment is not compatible with the Government's aims or the changes to the appeals system that we seek. We want firm and fair decisions to be reached in immigration appeals, and we want the procedure to lead to swifter conclusions. That means finding ways of handling appeals that meet those requirements.
<P>
Some appeals will be complex and weighty and it is inconceivable that the tribunal would attempt to deal with them without holding an oral hearing. Many cases are neither complex nor weighty. In some cases, the legal issues may be clear and simple and the facts not in dispute, and there would be no reason to interfere with the tribunal's ability to identify those issues and to reach a decision on the papers alone.
<P>
The tribunal's procedures will obviously be governed by the European convention on human rights. We accept that that introduces a strong presumption in favour of a hearing, but it is not absolute. It is established by the Strasbourg jurisprudence that some paper hearings are quite appropriate, particularly those that deal with entirely legal matters of the sort that I have outlined.
<P>
Although the tribunal will in future be more clearly focused as an appeal body, with a greater proportion of its work dealing only with legal issues, some cases will still involve disputes of fact as well as of law. There will obviously be a greater need for hearings in such cases, which brings us to the territory that we discussed when taking evidence. Some of the arguments put to us in evidence were in favour of a rather more flexible model, with the tribunal having a wider membership. They were particularly helpful and constructive. The issues are complex an we are still considering what should be done to meet the suggestions that have been made. I shall return to them later. Any moves will raise questions about the composition of tribunal panels and the appropriate procedures.
<P>
I am pleased to tell hon. Members that I will reflect on what they said and that I will return to the issues later. All is not entirely lost for the hon. Member for Hertsmere, even though we are not happy with his specific amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I was reflecting the views of the Immigration Law Practitioners Association and I am sure that it will be pleased to hear that all is not lost. In view of the need to make progress, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 559, in page 26, line 14, at end insert `may determine'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 263, in page 26, line 14, at end insert `sees fit'.
<P>
No. 632, in page 26, line 14, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``shall after consultation with the Advocate General for Scotland determine'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Amendment No. 559 corrects a drafting error, which was also spotted by the hon. Members who tabled amendent No. 263. However, the Government cannot accept amendment No. 632. Asylum and immigration matters are reserved matters in terms of devolution legislation. The current arrangements, which do not require consultation, are wholly adequate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am pleased that we all had a chance to spot the missing words and at least my amendment, in common with the Government's, contains the word ``determine'', so we were thinking along the right lines. I understand the Minister's point about the reservation of certain matters to the UK Parliament. That is why amendment No. 632 refers only to consultation. Even where there is a reserved matter, consultation does not hurt. Members appointed to the tribunal will be drawn from the legal professions both north and south of the border, so it would be useful to consult the Advocate General for Scotland at that stage.
<P>
I understand the Government's wish not to dilute the Bill and risk it appearing not to be an entirely UK matter. The Government do not want a statutory requirement to consult. Notwithstanding the clear shutting of the door in my face, I hope that the Minister&#151;or his office through the Lord Chancellor&#151;will at least have the courtesy to consult the senior law officer in Scotland.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `( ) No person shall be qualified under this paragraph for appointment as an adjudicator unless he has suitable professional experience in the field of immigration or asylum or human rights.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are moving at an unnaturally rapid rate: it is either all-go or all-stop on this Committee.
<P>
The amendment raises similar issues about adjudicators that were mentioned with respect to members of tribunals, though it suggests a lower level of test so that adjudicators need only suitable professional experience. In response to the earlier amendment, the Minister referred to the increasing requirement for a broader range of knowledge about human rights law as well as immigration law.
<P>
The Immigration Law Practitioners Association fears low-quality decision making by adjudicators, which could work against the system. If, through lack of relevant experience, poor decisions are taken, it could lead to further decisions having to be taken later at greater cost to the public purse and to the greater distress of the person involved. If the Minister cannot accept the amendment, I hope that he will be able to provide some assurances on the quality and level of expertise anticipated in the appointment of adjudicators. The amendment is simple and straightforward in setting a fairly low threshold, but at least some threshold for the appointments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The Government cannot accept the hon. Member for Hallam's amendment, which is too prescriptive. Whether someone is sufficiently experienced in the field of relevant law can be tested only as part of the appointment process. The Government believe that it would be unreasonable to apply a statutory test by way of a gatekeeping function.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Again, the door is firmly shut, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The amendments relate to schedule 4. Amendment No. 560 is a pointer to part 1A of that schedule, which makes various provisions relating to the effect of appeals on directions for removal, variation of limited leave, continuation of leave and deportation orders. Amendment No. 609 replaces paragraph 28 of schedule 2 to the 1971 Act&#151;which imposes a stay on directions for removal while appeals are pending&#151;and that paragraph as it applies to directions under schedule 3 to that Act. It also provides that a variation of leave is not to take effect while an appeal is pending against the variation. That logical proposition appears in section 14(1) of the 1971 Act. Similarly, it provides that a deportation order is not to be made while an appeal is brought against the decision to make it is pending. That is presently provided for in section 15(2) of the 1971 Act. Similarly, it provides that a person is not to be required to leave or be removed from the United Kingdom if an appeal under clause 47 is pending. Finally, it provides that while an appeal under clause 43 or clause 51(2) is pending, the leave to which the appeal relates and any conditions subject to which it was granted, continue to have effect.
<P>
I ask the Committee to accept the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I want to speak briefly to amendment No. 299, which relates to schedule 4.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Amendment No. 299 is in the next group of amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> In that case, I will sit down.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 561, in page 26, line 31, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(4) For the purposes of the Immigration Acts, an appeal under this Part is to be treated as pending during the period beginning when notice of appeal is given and ending when the appeal is finally determined, withdrawn or abandoned.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
	(5) An appeal is not to be treated as finally determined while a further appeal may be brought under paragraph 11 or 12 of Schedule 4.
<P>
	(6) If such a further appeal is brought, the original appeal is not to be treated as finally determined until the further appeal is determined, withdrawn or abandoned.
<P>
	(7) A pending appeal under the Part is to be treated as abandoned if the appellant leaves the United Kingdom.
<P>
	(8) A pending appeal under any provision of this Part other than section 51(2A) is to be treated as abandoned if the appellant is granted leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom.
<P>
	(9) A pending appeal under section (Variation of limited leave to enter or remain) is to be treated as abandoned if a deportation order is made against the appellant.'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments:
<P>
Government amendment No. 606, No. 299, in Schedule 4, page 89, line 13, leave out `41(5) or'.
<P>
Government amendment No. 610.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The amendments reflect the provisions of section 33(4) of the Immigration Act 1971, defining when an appeal is treated as pending with some important changes. Dealing first with Government amendment No. 561, subsection (4) now clarifies that an appeal ceases to be pending when it is abandoned. An adjudicator may rule that an appeal has been abandoned, or it may have to be treated as abandoned under subsections (7) to (9).
<P>
Subsections (5) and (6) of that amendment ensure that an appeal continues to be pending while an appeal against an adjudicator's determination may be brought to the tribunal, or a further appeal under the Bill may be brought to the Court of Appeal or Court of Session&#151;and until any such further appeal is finally determined.
<P>
Subsection (7) provides that any appeal shall be treated as abandoned if the appellant leaves the United Kingdom. A new provision has been introduced in subsection (8) to ensure that an appeal is to be treated as abandoned if the appellant is granted leave to enter or remain. Appeals will be based on a requirement to leave the country, so if the person is allowed to stay, perhaps as a result of further grounds lodged with the appeal notice, there is no need for the appeal to continue. Appeals against refusal of asylum where exceptional leave has been granted will not be affected.
<P>
Subsection (9) provides that an appeal against variation or refusal to vary leave shall be treated as abandoned if a deportation order is made against the appellant. The 1971 Act has the same effect at section 14(5). I invite the Committee to accept the amendment. Amendment No. 606 omits certain provisions of schedule 4 which are to be inserted in expanded form.
<P>
I am grateful for amendment No. 299, which points out a drafting slip in the Bill. The reference to a non-existent section 41(5) should be deleted. The hon. Member for Hertsmere referred to it during a debate in the Chamber. The Government have tabled an amendment inserting the correct reference to section 51(2). While agreeing with the amendment in principle, I invite the hon. Member for Hertsmere to withdraw it on the ground that it is unnecessary because the Government have dealt with the matter.
<P>
The effect of Government amendment No. 610 is to insert a reference in section 33(4) of the 1971 Act to the new definition of
<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment defines the deemed date of receipt of a notice of appealable decision sent by first-class post as two days after posting. We thought it necessary to include it to clarify, for the purposes of clauses 43, 51(2) and 55 of the Bill, the date on which a person is deemed to have been notified of a decision; it thereby establishes whether the decision requires the person to leave the United Kingdom.

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 543, in page 90, leave out lines 12 to 16.

<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> No. 301, in page 90, line 16, at end insert `but an adjudicator or the Tribunal may only so dismiss where he or it is satisfied that to do so would not result in a breach of one of the parties human rights or a breach of the 1951 Convention'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> This is an important amendment. I hope that we will be able to spend a little more time on this than on more procedural matters because of the possibly serious consequences of the provision in the Bill for people going through the appeal system.
<P>
Schedule 4(1)(b)(i) and (ii) allows the adjudicator, or a tribunal, simply to dismiss an appeal without considering its merits, on the basis of someone having failed to comply with any part of the directions or failed to attend a hearing. The consequences of such a dismissal of an appeal are so serious that we ought to be very careful about going down this route. I have therefore suggested that this provision be deleted.
<P>
We realise that the Immigration Appeals Service has had administrative problems. The chief adjudicator, His Honour Judge Dunn, referred to this in evidence to the Committee, but said that he thought that they had to some extent been resolved. I realise that because of historic experience, the Government felt that they would need a fairly severe power to deal with people who have not complied fully with directions or attended hearings. However, I am not convinced that that now applies, so we do not necessarily need the power in schedule 4.
<P>
The fundamental problem relates to what may happen to someone whose appeal is dismissed without its merits having been considered. Potentially, such a person faces removal from the country back to what may be difficult circumstances in which his human rights may be threatened. But that will not have been tested by the powers in schedule 4. What is of special concern is the possible route by which a person may get to this situation. It often happens because of a failure on the part of legal advisers. I hope that we will deal elsewhere in the Bill with the matter of poor legal advisers. We have described them as unscrupulous but sometimes it is a matter of quality, not motives. We are dealing with those who set out to defraud people, while others are just not up to the job. Individuals may not have been looked after properly by their legal advisers. They may not have been informed of the hearing or received adequate instructions about the directions to deal with the conduct of their appeal.
<P>
<H5>9.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It would be utterly reprehensible if we were to dismiss an appeal out of hand because of an individual's failure to receive appropriate advice or, under the terms of schedule 4, the failure to comply with something, not necessarily out of malice or because of a decision not to comply with the directions. Courts have expressed concern in the past about their judgments on cases that have been taken through the review process and about the use of existing powers to determine appeals without a hearing. They are generally unhappy about decisions being made without a hearing and due process.
<P>
Why do the Government consider that the need for an outright dismissal of an appeal without hearing the merits of a case is so strong that it should outweigh the possible consequences for the individual? Why is that deemed necessary when people often end up in such situations because of poor advice? Applicants may not have been advised properly because of language difficulties or because they have not understood the complex legal system. There are a host of reasons why individuals may fall into that category and have their appeals dismissed without the merits of their case being heard, yet natural justice suggests that that is not appropriate.

<P>

<B>Dr. Julian Lewis </B>(New Forest, East): Time is short, so I shall take only a moment of the Committee's time to say that I endorse strongly everything that the hon. Member for Hallam has said. It would be appalling if, for some technical reason, a person had his appeal dismissed&#151;as stated in this reprehensible schedule&#151;``without considering its merits'', when the issues at stake were his liberty and possibly his life. I hope that the Government will seriously consider the amendment and accept it.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Member for Hallam seemed to be suggesting that we run an appeal system to accommodate confused clients who have inadequate advisers. However sympathetic I am towards some individual cases, we cannot do that. The present system is clogged up by many unrealistic appeals, often dragged out by deliberate and repeated attempts at procedural delay&#151;simply in the interests of prolonging the time before a final decision is made.
<P>
That is why the Bill provides for rules that will enable the adjudicator or the tribunal to dismiss appeals that are not being pursued, whether for reasons of deliberate delay or because they have been abandoned. That is very much part of the case management tools of the court system and will be a useful addition to the appellate authority's powers. Amendment Nos. 543 and 300 would wholly undermine that. Amendment No. 543 would enable parties who had ignored the rules' provisions or who had failed to turn up to hearings to continue their cases with impunity.
<P>
To comply with the provision as it would be amended by amendment No. 300, at the very least the adjudicator or the tribunal would need to go through the appeal papers to see whether they disclosed a reasonable excuse for delay. More likely, it would need to invite representations. The amendment would create precisely the additional procedural step of more unnecessary delay, while awaiting a party's reasons to be received and considered, which we are trying to iron out of the system. It is not compatible with efforts to ensure that the parties take greater responsibility for their cases and their pursuit. Nor is it part of the process of ensuring that unnecessary, unacceptable and often deliberate attempts to delay are curtailed.
<P>
Although it is superficially attractive, amendment No. 301 is also unacceptable. It would make a nonsense of the paragraph that provides that, when faced by unreasonable or delaying behaviour by one of the parties, an adjudicator or the tribunal has a discretion to be exercised according to the circumstances of the case, and not automatically to dismiss the case without considering the merits of the substantive appeal.
<P>
The amendment would effectively make that impossible, because before considering whether to take that procedural step, it would be necessary to consider all the facts and circumstances of the case and possibly all the legal contentions. A procedural decision that left aside the merits of the case would become a substantive decision including them. The party's position will be adequately protected when the Human Rights Act 1998 comes into force, as it will oblige the appellate authority to ensure that its decisions comply with the convention. That represents an adequate safeguard. We do not need to include further safeguards if an effective safeguard is already in place.
<P>
The schedule is about ensuring that the ``faster'' element of ``firmer, faster and fairer'' is included in the system. It is not possible to run a system that gives a get-out clause to every client who has an incompetent adviser. The system has checks and balances to protect against most possibilities. We need a system that works effectively, that delivers for people and does not enable those who deliberately set out to abuse the system to continue to do so. We want to create an element of justice, not only for taxpayers, but for appellants; we want a system that delivers for genuine refugees.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> That was a fairly robust no to the amendment. However, some questions remain. The Minister referred to a confused client who had an inadequate adviser. That may sometimes happen, but the stakes are very high and it is no reason to say, ``Tough luck; your case is dismissed.'' I hope that the members of the tribunal and the adjudicators will use their discretion on whether to dismiss appeals. I understand that the rules are enabling rather than mandatory, and I hope that the tribunals and adjudicating panels will respond more generously when confronted by such cases.
<P>
I doubt whether I shall get anywhere with the amendment today. But we shall certainly seek to revisit this and similar issues at a later stage. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 608, in page 90, line 16, at end insert&#151;

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) enabling or requiring an adjudicator or the Tribunal to treat an appeal as abandoned in specified circumstances;'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I ask the Committee to support the amendment. It enables an adjudicator or tribunal to treat an appeal as having been abandoned in specified circumstances. The circumstances will be specified in due course.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> My hon. Friend says that the circumstances will be specified in due course. Can he not give some idea of what those circumstances may be?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> My hon. Friend will see from schedule 4 that we are creating a set of circumstances in which the tribunal can make a decision about when a case will be discontinued and when it will be allowed to proceed. In due course, rules will come before the House; hon. Members will then know more about how the tribunal will operate.
<P>
When we debated an earlier amendment moved by the hon. Member for Hallam, we said that we should ensure that opportunities for delay were kept to a minimum. We must set out the particular circumstances in which an adjudicator or a tribunal can treat an appeal as having been abandoned. Those circumstances will be set out in due course, but I can tell my hon. Friend of some of the circumstances that might apply. For instance, it is possible that attempts have been made to contact the lawyers acting in a case and that the lawyers have not replied, that the appellant is not in contact, that documents are not being filed, and that the case is not being pursued sensibly and realistically. We shall set out those circumstances in due course.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington will know from her constituency experience that some unscrupulous immigration advisers deliberately exploit the system. I suspect that she, like myself, wants to ensure that, while protecting the rights of the individual, we have a system in which cases are dealt with speedily. We intend to create such a system in due course. That means that some of the detailed work on the circumstances in which an appeal may be treated as abandoned must come later. That will, no doubt, be the subject of consultation in due course. It is right that we put the basis for making the new rules into the Bill, and I hope that my hon. Friend can support that.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> I am worried that asylum seekers may find their appeals aborted against their will because of their advisers' incompetence. It is unfortunate that we cannot specify the circumstances now.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 539, in page 90, line 28, after `appellant', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and any person on whom the Secretary of State has served a notice under Section 55(3)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This important amendment deserves a response. Under paragraph 4(2) of schedule 4, legal advice or representation will be made available to those in the appeals process. It is welcome that the rules should prescribe that. We are concerned about clause 55(3), which deals with the requirement on the Secretary of State to serve notice on an individual that he or she must put forward all the grounds that will be presented in the one-stop appeal.
<P>
We are especially concerned about the new factor that that provision will introduce&#151;the appeal under the European convention on human rights. We believe that appeals under that convention will be necessarily legally complex. It will take time to build up case law as people bring novel aspects of that convention to play in their appeals. Therefore, legal representation should be available as early as possible.
<P>
Under the amendment, we want to extend the provisions made in the rules, so extending the legal representations available to those who will be served notices under clause 55(3). I hope that the Minister agrees in principle that those who have been served such notices will want legal advice. The amendment represents a straightforward way to provide that advice, and it would benefit the administration of justice.
<P>
The Minister has referred to the ``faster'' element of the Bill. Our view is that legal representation is an important way to achieve that increased speed, because those who are legally represented can, as the Minister wishes, advance all their arguments at an early date. Our concern is that, if we leave the loophole that currently exists under clause 55(3), those served such notices will not have access to legal representation immediately. That will delay the process, not speed it up.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will accept that the amendment has been moved with that spirit in mind and to achieve the common objective of speeding up the system and having a better quality decision-making process. I hope that he will accept that making legal representation available to all those who have been served notices under clause 55(3) will be an important step in trying to achieve increased speed and better decision making.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman appears to be suggesting that legal representation should be available for any member of a family who is served with a notice under 55(3).
<P>
In practice the lawyer who represents the main person in that family will be able to provide whatever advice is necessary. That is how I anticipate it will work but I cannot say that the Government will provide funding for large scale legal advice resources to any person who might by chance be served with a 55(3) notice requiring him to state any additional grounds which he may have for wishing to remain in the United Kingdom.
<P>
<H5>9.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In practice when we are dealing with an applicant and any member of his family&#151;I assume that is what the hon. Gentleman is getting at&#151;there is likely to be a lawyer who will deal with the issues relating to the family. I do not see a need for the Government to undertake that if each member of the family wishes to employ a different lawyer they can all do that. Therefore I am not in sympathy with the amendment.

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I will read through the Minister's comments and consider them. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 545, in page 91, line 33, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`on any point relating to the Convention'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment moves to a new area: certification of cases under the 1951 refugee convention. We already have a system of certification and this is to be updated in schedule 4. We are particularly worried about the effect of the new grounds of appeal referred to in the last amendment on those seeking to appeal under the ECHR. As I read the schedule, the certification would apply to any appeal. If the certification is taking place purely on the grounds of the application of the 1951 convention, it does not seem appropriate that it should also be applied to other grounds of appeal, particularly ECHR grounds.
<P>
The certification will be about whether there is a fear of persecution for a reason related to the 1951 convention and it may be certified that no appeal is allowed because there are no grounds under the convention. However that does not necessarily rule out the ability to appeal under the ECHR. Other grounds could be established under ECHR which did not necessarily overlap with those under the 1951 convention. The amendment seeks to clarify that the certification applies only to this 1951 convention by making the right of appeal to the IAT explicit in those cases and leaving open the fact that someone may have a different process of appeal under ECHR.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The amendment arises from a misguided concern on the part of the hon. Gentleman and ILPA. Its purpose appears to be to ensure that the appellants whose asylum claims have been certified and who thereby lose a right of appeal on that ground to a tribunal will still be able to apply to the tribunal on a non-asylum aspect of the case. However it does no more than restate that effect of paragraph 9.
<P>
Although a person whose asylum case has been certified will be debarred from appealing to the tribunal on any asylum issue he or she may still appeal on other grounds, subject to the general limitations governing appeals to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal. Laudable, but misguided, is probably how I would describe this: they can do it anyway so the amendment is therefore unnecessary. I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> That is a helpful clarification. If the amendment is unnecessary, the sin that I feared does not exist and all is well in the world. I am happy to have been misguided on this occasion, and beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 544, in page 91, leave out lines 34 to 39.
<P>
I believe that in this case there will be a point of difference about how the law should be applied in respect of certification. The amendment would remove the ability provided by the schedule to allow certification of appeals on the grounds of failure to produce a passport.
<P>
It is important to remove certification in such circumstances because of the particular circumstances in which many asylum seekers arrive in this country. Indeed, the possession of a passport has often been cited as evidence of someone not having a well founded fear of persecution. The fact that that person can obtain a passport from his Government is deemed to be a reason for deciding that he does not have such a fear.
<P>
In many circumstances, people in this category will be without passports or appropriate documents for reasons associated with their persecution. It therefore seems strange to tie that in to a process of certifying them as unable to proceed with an appeal under the convention. That seems to breach the spirit of the convention in that it would penalise people because of their method of arrival&#151;without the appropriate documentation.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will assure us that the Government do not intend generally to certify people who have failed to arrive with appropriate documentation or have produced an invalid passport. Regardless of the Minister's response, I think that my anxieties about this aspect of certification will remain.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The amendment may have been tabled in the mistaken belief that paragraph 9(3) is designed to penalise people who do not have passports. That is not its intention, and it would be wrong if it were.
<P>
The Committee will want to bear in mind that the deliberate destruction of passports is one of the ways in which abusers of immigration procedures try to forestall their proper removal from the United Kingdom. Making unfounded asylum claims is another. The two combined present a serious threat to immigration controls.
<P>
Sub-paragraph (3) specifies two circumstances that would lead to a loss of right of appeal to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal. In the first, the reference to the failure to produce a valid passport, I draw the Committee's attention to a key phrase, ``reasonable explanation''. We are not saying that we shall turn away anyone who does not have a passport. Indeed, we recognise that genuine refugees may be the least likely to have proper documentation, as the hon. Gentleman said. We have no problem with that and do not dispute it. However, we justifiably expect someone without a valid passport to be prepared to offer a reasonable explanation why. Genuine refugees will no doubt be able to do so without any problem. If people do not do so, it may be reasonable to treat their claims as abusive.
<P>
The second circumstance specified is the failure to inform an immigration officer that a passport is not valid. Again, it is reasonable to expect people to tell the truth in such circumstances. We are strongly committed to protecting the rights of people who claim asylum in this country, but make no apologies for being firm with those who try to abuse the system.
<P>
The provisions simply ask people to tell the truth when they arrive in this country without adequate documentation. If they do not tell the truth, they will, quite reasonably, be treated as making an abusive claim. If they do, it may be perfectly proper for them not to have adequate documentation. It will not damage a person's asylum claim if he has entered the country with a false, inadequate or forged passport. That is not a relevant consideration for refusing the asylum claim.
<P>
All that we are asking for is a reasonable explanation. I have no doubt that more genuine asylum seekers will have no problem with that, but that may not be true for the abusive ones who destroy their documentation to prevent their removal from this country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> That was a helpful clarification. Problems remain with this provision, as with others in the Bill, about how to separate those who behave wrongly, perhaps through fear or other motives that are not of themselves malicious, from those who are simply abusive and try to defraud or cheat the system. Notwithstanding the Minister's reponse, I remain concerned that some people who have no malicious intent will fall into that category. Such people may not be abusive in the normal sense of the word, but may simply fear authority figures. Due to their understanding of carriers' liability, they may not want to admit any documentation problems and may not provide the explanations required because of the possible penalties. Some people are scared to admit it when they have done something wrong, such as having used the wrong documentation or destroyed their passports, but their motives are not malicious or abusive.
<P>
The Government seem to be falling on one side of the fence in saying that they will take a tough line and expect people to respond adequately. I hope that when people have not done so and have made themselves liable for these provisions, yet their lack of malice is demonstrated, some leeway and discretion will be operated and some attempt will be made to help them salvage the situation by producing an explanation in reasonable time.
<P>
I do not think that we will get anywhere with the amendment tonight. Given the hour, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Stay on directions for removal
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> 9A. If a person in the United Kingdom appeals under sections 41 or 51(1) on being refused leave to enter, any directions previously given by virtue of the refusal for his removal from the United Kingdom cease to have effect, except in so far as they have already been carried out, and no directions may be given while the appeal is pending.
<P>
 9B. If a person in the United Kingdom appeals under sections 48, 49 or 51(4) against any directions given under Part I of Schedule 2 or Schedule 3 to the 1971 Act for his removal from the United Kingdom, those directions except in so far as they have already been carried out, are to have no effect while the appeal is pending.
<P>
 9C. But the provisions of Part I of Schedule 2 or, as the case may be, Schedule 3 to the 1971 Act with respect to detention and persons liable to detention apply to a person appealing under sections 45, 48, 49 or 51(1) or (4), as if there were in force directions for his removal from the United Kingdom, except that he may not be detained on board a ship or aircraft so as to compel him to leave the United Kingdom while the appeal is pending.

(b) the giving of a notice of intention to give such directions,
<P>
</UL></FONT>any period during which there is pending an appeal by him under sections 41, 49 or 51(1) of this Act is to be disregarded.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> 9E. For the purposes of paragraphs 9A to 9C (but not for purposes of paragraph 9D), except in so far as those paragraphs apply to appeals under section 51, where an appeal to an adjudicator is dismissed, an appeal is not to be regarded as pending unless immediately after the dismissal&#151;
<P>
(a) the appellant gives notice of appeal against the determination of the adjudicator; or
<P>
(b) in a case in which leave to appeal against that determination is required and the adjudicator has power to grant leave, the appellant applies for and obtains the leave of the adjudicator.
<P>
 9F. If directions are given under Part I of Schedule 2 or Schedule 3 to the 1971 Act for a person's removal from the United Kingdom, and directions are also so given for the removal with him of persons belonging to his family, then if any of them appeals under sections 41, 45, 48, 49 or 51(1) or (4), the appeal is to have the same effect under paragraphs 9A to 9E in relation to the directions given in respect of each of the others as it has in relation to the directions given in respect of the appellant.
<P>
Suspension of variation of limited leave 9G. A variation is not to take effect while an appeal against the variation is pending under section (Variation of limited leave to enter or remain)(1) or 51(2).
<P>
Continuation of leave 9H.&#151;(1) While an appeal under section (Variation of limited leave to enter or remain) or 51(2) is pending, the leave to which the appeal relates, and any conditions subject to which it was granted continues to have effect.
<P>
 (2) A person may not make an application for a variation of his leave to enter or remain while that leave is treated as continuing to have effect as a result of sub-paragraph (1).
<P>
 (3) For the purposes of section (Variation of limited leave to enter or remain) or 51(2), in calculating whether, as a result of a decision, a person may be required to leave the United Kingdom within twenty-eight days, a continuation of leave under this paragraph is to be disregarded.
<P>
Deportation orders 9I. A deportation order is not to be made against a person under section 5 of the 1971 Act while an appeal duly brought under sections 45(1)(a) or 51(3)(a) against the decision to make it is pending.
<P>
 9J. In calculating the period of eight weeks set by section 5(3) of the 1971 Act for making a deportation order against a person as belonging to the family of another person, there is to be disregarded any period during which an appeal under sections 45(1)(a) or 51(3)(a) against the decision to make the order is pending.

<P>
On resuming&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Clause 45 deals with appeals to adjudicators against decisions by the Secretary of State to make deportation orders or to refuse to revoke deportation orders that have been made.
<P>
I preface my remarks by saying that we share the Government's objective of wanting to streamline the appeal system, wherever possible and always consistent with justice. If we think that a right of appeal should be questioned, we shall do so. I look forward to the Minister's response. He may be able to reassure me that there is no need to ask about the right of appeal in question, but I wish the Minister to consider another point.
<P>
The Committee may recall our debates on clause 6, under which the enforcement mechanism for overstayers was changed from deportation to removal. We explored at some length the fact that that change removed the right of appeal for those who were subject to removal rather than deportation. It curtailed their rights of appeal. We make no observation on that, except that those who lose that right of appeal, although overstayers, may otherwise have led blameless lives; they may wish to argue compassionate circumstances arising from the length of their stay in this country.
<P>
Those people will have had their rights to appeal curtailed by the change from deportation to removal. Others besides overstayers have been subject to the deportation regime, but they will remain subject to deportation. Overstayers are no longer subject to it but others, including those who have been recommended for deportation by the courts, will still be dealt with under the deportation mechanism.
<P>
Subsection (1)(a) provides a right of appeal against a decision of the Secretary of State to make a deportation order. Amendment No. 270 takes that right away from someone who has been recommended for deportation by the courts. Will the Minister confirm that a person recommended for deportation will have the right to appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State to make a deportation order under subsection (1)(a)? If so the Committee should examine what that means in practice.
<P>
The person concerned will have been convicted of an offence before the courts. His legal representative will have addressed the court on the recommendation for deportation. The official handbook on immigration and refugee law for magistrates says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The person or representative should be asked to address the court specifically on the question of a recommendation and the court should also consider the effects of a recommendation on others, such as the person's family''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is the first opportunity for the person concerned to have all his circumstances, including compassionate and family circumstances, looked at.
<P>
If a recommendation is made by the court in the first instance&#151;the magistrates court or, more commonly, the Crown court&#151;that person has a right of appeal. In the case of the magistrates court, the appeal goes from the magistrates court to the Crown court. If the recommendation is made in the Crown court, it goes to the Court of Appeal because the recommendation for deportation is part of the sentence and there is a right of appeal against that sentence.
<P>
On appeal in the Crown court or the Court of Appeal, all the circumstances can be looked at, including compassionate circumstances. That is therefore the second occasion on which all circumstances can be looked at. If the appeal is not allowed the recommendation goes to the Home Secretary. He then must consider whether to follow the court's recommendation. He has to consider any representations that he receives, including special or compassionate circumstances. That is the third time the circumstances of someone with a criminal conviction will be considered.
<P>
If the Home Secretary decides to make an order, clause 35 gives the person concerned a further right of appeal to an adjudicator against the decision of the Home Secretary to follow the recommendation of the court. That is the fourth time that his circumstances will be looked at. Will the Minister confirm that in such a case the appeal to an adjudicator against the Home Secretary's upholding of the recommendation and the decision to make a deportation order is a full appeal in which all the merits of the case are looked at, including compassionate circumstances? Will the Minister also confirm that the appellant will remain in the United Kingdom until the appeal is heard?
<P>
That is our understanding of the position. It may be wrong and we look to the Minister for confirmation. It it is not, that is the fourth time that the person's circumstances are looked at. In contrast, the Home Office&#151;not a court&#151;looks at the compassionate circumstances of the overstayer only once, although he may be of good character and have no criminal convictions even for non-immigration offences. The overstayer has a limited right of appeal, not on compassionate grounds, but he can exercise it only after he has left the country.
<P>
Perhaps I am wrong, but the person whom the courts have recommended for deportation gets a good deal, but the overstayer who is dealt with by removal gets a bad deal. The overstayer has one-and-a-half rights of appeal&#151;the Home Office considers his case fully only once, and he has half a right of appeal because the grounds are limited and the appeal takes place while he is not in this country.
<P>
Looking at such matters in that light, we wonder whether or not there should be a right of appeal against the Home Secretary's decision to deport following a court recommendation, because that is the fourth time that a person has had a right to have his case considered. Perhaps the right place for the appeal to be heard is in the appellate court, following the original conviction. Is there not a case for saying, ``Enough is enough'' at that stage?
<P>
It is right that the Home Secretary looks at the person's circumstances before making a deportation order, but is it necessary to have a further appeal after that, as there has already been one appeal and the case has been considered three times? Of course, the appellate court has criminal jurisdiction and can judge the seriousness of the offence while taking into account compassionate circumstances.
<P>
It would appear that courts of first instance get it right, because we understand that last year fewer than 10 of the 360 appeals against recommendations for deportation made by the courts were upheld.
<P>
Adjudicators inevitably have less experience of dealing with criminal cases, yet by the time that a case gets to an adjudicator it will have been through the hands of one&#151;perhaps two&#151;criminal courts and of the Home Secretary. After all those people, including magistrates and specialised criminal judges, Crown courts or even the Court of Appeal and the Home Secretary, have considered the case, how can an adjudicator say that they have all been incorrect and that the decision to deport is wrong? How often does an adjudicator say that they are wrong and allow an appeal against the making of a deportation order that has followed a court recommendation?
<P>
We wonder whether the procedure is appropriate for those who have committed serious criminal offences, as the majority of those who are recommended for deportation have. In a parliamentary answer&#151;which appears in column 668 of the Official Report of 22 April&#151;the Minister showed the seriousness of the offences of which those people have generally been convicted. He told me that, in 1997, of those recommended for deportation, not one was given a community sentence; 17 were given a sentence of imprisonment for less than four years, but 297&#151;the overwhelming majority&#151;were given a sentence of imprisonment for four years or more. Clearly, those are serious offences. That colours how we look at those people, and they seem to be treated generously in the appeals system, compared to overstayers. I hope that I have made my point. Is there not a case for removing one of those layers of appeal&#151;the appeal to the adjudicator against the making of a deportation order? We look forward to the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman's argument. I confess that I was initially disposed to reject the amendment that he moved, and I even armed myself with a quote of his from a previous debate. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Certainly, a high hurdle is put in the way of people seeking to return to this country after deportation. That is right, but provision must be made for deportation orders to be re-examined and revoked.''&#151;[Official Report, Special Standing Committee, 15 April 1999; c. 594.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I can understand why he made that argument, which seems to suggest that his amendments are wrong.
<P>
<H5>10.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Having heard his arguments, however, I am predisposed to consider the issue further. The hon. Gentleman set out his concerns about multiple appeals very well. I should like to reflect further on the consequences of his proposals and perhaps write to him later. I will also consider whether it would be appropriate to table an amendment on Report. At this stage, I cannot accept the amendment. I initially felt that we should resist it, but having heard the arguments I am now convinced that there are grounds for further thought. With my undertaking to write to him later, I hope that he will withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his courteous and reasonable response. People other than those recommended for deportation by the courts can be subject to deportation orders. I intended to deal with those who were recommended for deportation following a criminal conviction. When I heard the Minister's reply, I was struck by just how serious many of the offences are&#151;the overwhelming majority are very serious.
<P>
I look forward to receiving the Minister's considered response after he has had the opportunity to reflect further on the arguments.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> Amendment No. 520 stands in my name. I will be brief because the argument is simple. The amendment relates both to schedule 13, which deals with the transitional arrangements of deportation appeals, and to the clause, which deals with deportation orders.
<P>
The Bill protects some people appealing against a deportation order, who will in future be dealt with by administrative removal. When the Bill comes into force, a person who has already received a signed notice of intention to deport will retain a right of appeal against deportation.
<P>
We have already debated at some length the removal of appeal rights on deportation and the administrative removal of overstayers, so I shall not repeat arguments that have already been made about the wide range of people to whom the provisions will apply.
<P>
There are potential problems, as people may be forced into making ECHR appeals or asylum applications. Such pleas may not stand up, but they are the only mechanism for making an appeal.
<P>
Debate on such matters ought perhaps to be reserved for another part of the Bill. My amendment concerns people who are in the country now who would have rights of appeal because deportation orders are being signed against them. We should give transitional protection to those who have notices of intention to deport and to anyone currently in the country who could have a deportation order signed against them.
<P>
Let me use the example of two people whose circumstances are almost identical on the day the Bill is enacted. One person has had notice of intention to deport signed against them the previous week; the other has not. It may well be pure chance whose file happens to be at the top of the pile in the Home Office and who therefore receives notice of intention to deport.
<P>
We should not get into a position in which one person is protected by keeping his or her appeal rights and the other is not. I would prefer to retain the current system of deportation orders. However, if we are moving towards systems of administrative removal, we should give some thought to people who, at the moment, would reasonably expect&#151;or whose representatives would reasonably expect&#151;that, should they be subject to deportation, they would have notice of intention to deport and the opportunity to appeal.
<P>
Amendment No. 520 would therefore retain the deportation order and appeal and would provide transitional protection for people who are in the country now and who could be subject to deportation order procedures.
<P>
Will the Minister give some thought to the matter? I appreciate that he may not wish to give a commitment on the amendment, but he may wish to consider it further. Perhaps we can return to the matter when we discuss other parts of the Bill. However, we should consider the transitional arrangements to be made in moving from one system to another and who should retain protection in that process.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am not sympathetic to keeping the deportation order and the various appeals as the usual method of removing overstayers. However, I am familiar with some of my hon. Friend's concerns about the treatment of overstayers who will no longer have appeal rights; to some extent, those concerns have already been dealt with.
<P>
I regret that I cannot accept my hon. Friend's amendment, because he is proposing that overstayers liable to deportation would retain rights in perpetuity under the current legislation. Clearly, that is not in keeping with the Government's stated policy.
<P>
However my hon. Friend has raised a number of interesting arguments about people who have been in the United Kingdom for long periods. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and I are willing to examine other approaches that may address some of my hon. Friend's concerns. I know that my hon. Friend is meeting the Home Secretary in the next few days; doubtless, there will be an opportunity to canvass various alternative approaches to dealing with such issues. At the moment, I can assure him only that we are determined to create a system without multiple appeals. Overstayers who have reached the limits of their rights to be in this country need to be dealt with by removals rather than deportation orders.
<P>
There may be ways to accommodate some of the hon. Gentleman's concerns about those who have been here for a long time, and we will consider them. However, I give him no commitments at all other than to continue to discuss those concerns with him. On that basis, I hope that he will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
I come to the clause stand part debate. This important clause deals with deportation orders and I hope that the Committee will support the way in which the Government have decided to try to prevent a series of appeals from people who apply to have the right to remain on multiple occasions. It is part of the process of speeding matters up, and there are ways to ensure that that is done fairly and properly. I hope that the Committee will support clause 45.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> I associate myself with the concern expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow about long-standing overstayers. I represent many such people in the north-east of London. Although, they are technically overstayers, they have often been in the country for many years and are making a constructive contribution to the community. More importantly, their children were born and are going to school here. Although I understand the Minister's concern about the text of the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow, it cannot help justice or social cohesion to fling out of the country, with no right of appeal whatever, people and families who are established parts of communities. I hope that the talks between my hon. Friend and the Home Secretary reach a fruitful conclusion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> Obviously, I am disappointed that the Minister is not able to accept the amendment, but I do not want to press it to a vote at the moment. The Committee will have the opportunity to return to some of the issues, which will arise at a later stage and on Report. I wish to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Amendment No. 520 is to schedule 13 and any decisions on it will have to be taken at that stage.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 45, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
