							<b class="B">Mr.
Nigel Waterson</b> (Eastbourne) (Con): I am happy to out
myself as someone who missed the boat on the last group of amendments,
but I shall say a couple of things that I might have said in that
context in this stand part debate. I have two points to make. First,
the Minister has developed a mantra about auto-enrolment as if it were
an everyday occurrence. Apart from the fact that he conceded that there
is an issue of degree in any event, moving from however many he thinks
are auto-enrolling at the moment in existing schemes to what is
fervently hoped will be mass auto-enrolment of up to 10 million people
under personal accounts is a very different kettle of fish. I think
that we can all accept that.</div>
					<a name="08012322000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">The National Association of
Pension Funds sent me some Department for Work and Pensions figures
suggesting that only 3 per cent. of employers who are currently
contributing 3 per cent. or more to pension schemes use auto-enrolment.
I do not know quite how that reads across to the figures the Minister
has quoted. I think he refers to Tesco. There seems to be a conflict of
evidence there. In any event we would still argue that we are in a
totally different ball game in terms of auto-enrolment under the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="08012322000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other point
is more an attempt to try to tidy up where we go from here on pay to
save and means-testing generally. I appreciate that consensus building
is unlikely to extend as far as giving the official Opposition credit
for raising particular issues which have been adopted by the
Government, but I am delighted to hear that while we were screaming
about means-testing and its effect on personal accounts in a different
part of the same forest Age Concern was saying much the same thing. It
all comes to the same in the end. Again, I should like to welcome the
discussions that are now foreseen by the
Minister.</div>
					<a name="08012322000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">We did not
support the Bill on Second Reading for precisely the reason that I have
set out on means-testing. It is perhaps an indication of how far we
have come and how quickly that we did not pursue the amendments and the
new clause in the last group as a result of what the Minister said. It
would have been the height of churlishness. I never like to think of
myself as churlish; that may be alright for the Liberal Democrats, but
not for us. Conservatives are not into churlishness in any shape or
form. It would have been churlish to have caused a rumpus or even a
vote over those matters. I should just like to place it on the record
that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column168" />Column number: 168</div>we are delighted, whoever is given the credit in public for this
movement forward on these big and important issues, that that movement
has
happened.</div>

						<a name="08012322000189"></a>
							<b class="B">Andrew
Selous</b> (South-West Bedfordshire) (Con): Without wanting in
any way to fall foul of your instruction to the Committee to have a
short stand part debate, Sir Nicholas, I crave your indulgence because
there are two completely new issues that we have not touched on at all
which are significant in relation to clause 3. Of course, you could
rule me out of order at any point should you think that I am straying
into territory that we have already debated, Sir Nicholas. However,
there are two issues that we have not touched on that are absolutely
central to the Bill and which relate to clause
2.</div>
					<a name="08012322000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012322000190"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> Order. The hon. Gentleman is always so
reasonable, and I am quite relaxed this afternoon, but
&#147;short&#148; is a matter of
interpretation.</div>
					<a name="08012322000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012322000191"></a>Andrew
Selous:
						</b> Being six foot five and a half, I am pleased to
hear that.</div>
					<a name="08012322000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first
issue that we have not so far debated is the age 22 stipulation in
paragraph (1)(a). It is a slightly different state of affairs from the
point I raised when I spoke to amendment No. 1 on clause 1. That was
about the fact that over 75s were forbidden or unable to be part of the
personal accounts scheme. Of course, because we have agreed on clause
1, people between  16 and 22 will have a right to enrol on the
personal accounts scheme. However, I want to tease out the
Minister&#146;s thinking on why the core age runs purely between age
22 and the state pension age. A person could have six wasted years
between ages 16 and 22, when they have started their working lives but
are not in the personal accounts scheme. We are all keen to get people
into the savings habit as early as possible, given the huge
deficiencies in people&#146;s pension pots that have come to light in
recent years. If a young person begins their working life earning
perhaps &#163;5,035 per year, would it not be sensible to auto-enrol
them? Of course, they would have the option to come out if they thought
that they were going to be in a particular job for only a short period,
or if they wish to study, or for whatever other reason.</div>
					<a name="08012322000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am mindful of placing too
many burdens on businesses, and some young people move in and out of
jobs frequently early in their careers, but that is not the case for
all young people. I would welcome further elucidation from the Minister
on the six-year gap between the ages of 16 and 22. My guess is that few
people who are aged between 16 to 21 will actually step up to the bar
and choose to be auto-enrolled, and I do not know whether the
Government have any advertising planned to encourage people to
volunteer, but it is an important point and I would be grateful if the
Minister responded to
it.</div>
					<a name="08012322000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other area that I wanted to touch on is the collection method for
personal accounts. All businesses, and particularly small employers,
are concerned about it. The Work and Pensions Committee dealt with the
issue in March in its fifth report of the last Session. Recommendation
no. 230 on page 56 of the report states:</div>
					<a name="08012322000159"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We would have expected
the thinking on such a crucial keystone in the operation of the scheme,
for employers, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column169" />Column number: 169</div>employees and the Authority and Board, to be more advanced at this
stage, and we are deeply concerned that it is
not.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012322000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The report goes on
to ask whether the PAYE scheme could not be amended to make life easier
for employers. On page 55, the report states:</div>
					<a name="08012322000160"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Lord Turner
admitted...that collections systems were &#145;not an issue that
we bottomed out fully&#146;&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08012322000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, the Pensions Commission did
not really begin to consider the issue, give it full scrutiny, or ask
the Government to come up with proposals.</div>
					<a name="08012322000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Businesses in general, as
represented by the Federation of Small Businesses and Mike Cherry, are
concerned about the matter. In our evidence session on 17
January, he told us that the federation is worried about the
&#147;on-cost&#148; of creating a different system in addition to
PAYE. It is not just the cost to businesses that are significant, which
we all want to minimise given the extra 3 per cent. that will be
added to employers&#146; payroll costs. There is also an
issue of
time.</div>
					<a name="08012322000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012322000192"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> Just to seek clarification, I am following the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument, but I am not sure that I have
understood one part of it. He is suggesting that PAYE should be the
means of collection for personal accounts, but is he suggesting that it
should be the means of collection for all other pension
schemes?</div>
					<a name="08012322000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012322000193"></a>Andrew
Selous:
						</b> No, I am not suggesting that. I will come back to
that point, because the Minister touched on it when he gave evidence to
the Committee. At the moment, I am touching on the issue purely of
personal accounts and enrolment. That will cause a significant extra
monthly administrative task for millions of small businesses up and
down the country. I am pleased to see the hon. Member for Ochil and
South Perthshire (Mr. Banks), a member of the Federation of
Small Businesses. This may be an issue that he wants to furnish the
Committee with his opinion on from his business
experience.</div>
					<a name="08012322000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
not just a monetary cost in creating another system. It is about time
as well, particularly for small businesses, which do not have the
resource of a personnel department that can do these tasks. There are
many issues that they have to deal with month by month of a regulatory
nature, to fulfil all of their obligations. It is important that the
monetary cost of collecting the personal account contributions and the
time that it takes are both
minimised.</div>
					<a name="08012322000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that
the Minister is aware of this issue, but I am nervous that we are
proceeding through the Bill and do not yet have the clarification that
millions of businesses up and down the country want. I will be grateful
if the Minister tells us where the Department&#146;s thinking is on
this issue and what the plans are. Is it possible to ally the payment
in some way with PAYE, notwithstanding the difficulties that he has
already told us
about?</div>
					<a name="08012322000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lastly, as far
as the PAYE computer system is concerned, I turn to the evidence that
the Minister gave to the Committee on 17 January. Having reread what he
said in answer to question no. 154, which I put, he said that he wanted
to be mindful&#151;if I read his argument correctly&#151;of not
over-favouring the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column170" />Column number: 170</div>administrative systems for personal accounts as against other forms of
pension contribution. That is a fair point because we want a level
playing
field.</div>
					<a name="08012322000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
issue is about a balance of priorities. Given the scale of
auto-enrolment that we are looking at up and down the country for
millions of our fellow citizens and millions of businesses that have
not contributed to pension funds on behalf of their employees, I think
that there is a stronger counter-argument that it should be the
Government&#146;s top priority to have administrative ease by
reducing both the cost and the time of collecting the personal
accounts. We are not talking about making life more difficult for any
other form of pension contributions. They are coping at the moment. I
think that ensuring that our businesses and our economy are not unduly
burdened should be the priority. I would be grateful if the Minister
also addressed that point in his
response.</div>

							<b class="B">Danny
Alexander</b> (Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey)
(LD): Like the hon. Member for Eastbourne, I believe that the
Government&#146;s new approach to paying to save and to means-testing
is a welcome step forward. I just hope that in the course of this
debate the Minister will clarify one thing. If the body being set up is
to produce a report, it would be useful if he put it on the record
that, although it will not make any recommendations, and although the
Government have made no commitment to act on anything in the report,
none the less Parliament will have an opportunity to debate it. It is
important to ensure that Members on both sides, who have expressed
concern about means-testing, have a chance to debate that matter on the
Floor of the House. The Bill will have been enacted, or at least all of
the Commons stages will have been completed, before the report from
this august body is
published.</div>
					<a name="08012322000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for South-West Bedfordshire made an important point about the
lower age limit  of 22. I echo his points about the fact that
at least some young people aged between 16 and 22 will be disappointed
to miss out on automatic enrolment. They might be embarking on a
career, and not just changing jobs every few months, as often happens
at that age. The ability for them to join the personal account would be
useful.</div>
					<a name="08012322000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Association of Chartered Certified Accountants raised a point with me
relating to the automatic enrolment date, which is provided for in
clause
3(6):</div>
					<a name="08012322000161"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
automatic enrolment date, in relation to any person, is the first day
on which this section applies to the person as a jobholder of the
employer.&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="08012322000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">in
other words, on the first day of their employment, as I read it. That
seems sensible; it is how many existing occupational pension
schemes&#151;the person joins on day one.</div>
					<a name="08012322000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">In its
briefing, the ACCA pointed out that some times when an employer
automatically enrols someone on day one, and when that is also the date
on which they first receive the information about the personal account,
it might take a while for the employee to digest the
information&#151;perhaps a few weeks or a month. After that, they
will decide whether to remain enrolled. It is quite
clear from the Government&#146;s forecasts, for the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column171" />Column number: 171</div>numbers of people expected to enrol in personal accounts versus the
number of people in the target audience, that it is predicted that a
significant number of people will choose to opt out. In those cases,
presumably the employer will have to repay the contributions or work
with PADA to do so. Might that not place an unnecessary additional
burden on employers by providing for an additional administrative
layer? I have some sympathy for the view that automatic enrolment
should take place on day one, but we should consider the burden on
businesses. I would like to hear from the Minister whether he or his
Department have considered that point.</div>
					<a name="08012322000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012322000195"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> Let me begin with the points made by the hon.
Member for Eastbourne. I think that his NAPF figures relate to its
members, whereas the wider issues on automatic enrolment also concern
public sector employees and others. I have been advised that one in six
employers are currently automatically enrolled.</div>
					<a name="08012322000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">On his broader comments on the
Bill, I welcome the constructive approach that he has adopted. He
indicated that the Conservative party has come some distance, and
indeed so have others. That is all part of the process of discussing
and evaluating the arguments, and of seeking to maintain a consensus.
However, to use a phrase that the hon. Gentleman has often used and
that I accept: a consensus is not a blank cheque. It is the ability to
question, challenge and ensure that the debate is properly engaged in.
I have no problem with that, and we have sought to respond to the
debate and ensure that we move it forward, recognising that these
issues must be properly discussed.</div>
					<a name="08012322000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for South-West
Bedfordshire asked a couple of questions. First, he asked, as did the
hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, why we do
not have automatic enrolment from the age of 16. There are a number of
reasons for that, but I want to make clear that a 16-year-old will have
the right to join a personal account and to have an employer&#146;s
contribution. However, it will effectively be a voluntary joining by
the 16-year-old should they, or indeed anyone up to 22 years old, want
to do so.</div>
					<a name="08012322000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue is
about at what point to impose legal obligation on employers. We are
conscious, as the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire indicated,
that 16 to 22-year-olds change their employment regularly. Many are
students and will be employed for quite short periods. Some will go
over the &#163;5,035 figure during their period of employment, but
they will only be employed in a temporary job during that year.
Therefore, particularly for 16 to 22-year&#151;olds, there were a
number of issues to take into account. As part of the process of
consulting and discussing with employers&#146; organisations, we took
the view that the creation of a legal obligation for automatic
enrolment, in addition to the employers&#146; contribution that
exists from the age of 16, would create a greater administrative burden
for 16 to 22-year-olds than it would do for the majority of people over
that age. We decided that 22 was a sensible age at which to impose that
obligation on employers. To do so below that age would have produced an
obligation that we felt to be somewhat excessive and probably, in some
cases, likely to lead to burdensome steps, particularly where people
were employed for short periods.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column172" />Column number: 172</div>
					<a name="08012322000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the method
of collection for personal accounts, the hon. Gentleman suggested, as
did the Work and Pensions Committee, that we should look at linking it
to PAYE and use one of the official mechanisms such as Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs or one of the taxation bodies. We
looked at that, and there are several problems with it. There is the
obvious administrative issue that the tax system has a lot of work to
do, and any additions increase the burden on the system, creating, by
theirs own nature, more inefficiencies. It was not a good thing to do
unless we had to, and we did not think that we did.</div>
					<a name="08012322000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The more
important question is about what this would do to the market. As the
hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire indicated, one of my key
concerns was that we should create a system of personal accounts that
complements, rather than competes with existing provision. There is a
fair degree of concern, particularly among insurance companies and
others, that we are creating a personal accounts system that will move
into a market in which they themselves are competing.</div>
					<a name="08012322000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we were to give our personal
accounts a competitive advantage in terms of the means of collection,
by saying to employers, &#147;If you have this pension provider or
personal accounts, you will be able to use a more simple method of
provision&#148;, two things are likely to happen. First, the
competition in that area of the market will say that personal accounts
have a competitive advantage denied to them and that has been done by
the state. More particularly, some employers might be tempted to trade
down and to move into personal accounts in order to take advantage of
that mechanism.</div>
					<a name="08012322000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our view is
that it would be better to leave it to the various means by which
pensions are collected today. We do not seek to create impersonal
accounts with a product and an organisation that will have a
substantial competitive advantage. We expect it to move into a
market&#151;for the low paid in particular, but also those on
moderate incomes&#151;in which, to be fair, there is not enough
profit for most of the commercial sector.</div>
					<a name="08012322000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Companies such as Aegon and
Standard Life operate in that market, but only in niche parts of it.
They want employers of a reasonable size that will give them a
reasonable payment in return. Some areas of the market, particularly
small employers, those who employ only one, two, three or four
people&#151;perhaps a chippie, a garage or a hairdressers&#151;are
often not sufficiently commercially viable to become involved with the
various pension providers at the
moment.</div>
					<a name="08012322000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">We expect
personal accounts to move into this area. In a sense, it will therefore
be accepting a position that is not for other commercial providers. It
will say, &#147;We will operate in an area in which, on the face of
it, there is not a vast profit to be made. We will be available to all
these employers, whether or not we would have done so if we were making
a purely commercial decision.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012322000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">There will be
an extra burden on the Personal Accounts Board and on personal accounts
to provide something that the commercial organisations will not
provide. We are therefore prepared to give them some facilitation and
some encouragement, some compensatory support to go into that market,
but we do not want to disrupt the overall commercial market. We do not
want to create such a competitive advantage that employers are tempted
either to get out of their current provision or to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column173" />Column number: 173</div>not even look at commercial private-sector provisions because the
public-sector provision is so strongly
competitive.</div>
					<a name="08012322000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the other hand, I can tell the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire
that we are looking for collection to be linked simply to the payroll
system. We are looking for PADA to create a low-cost, simple collection
method. It knows perfectly well that it will be dealing with a number
of employers that are very small in terms of numbers, that are often
not well provided for in terms of accountancy support or backup; and
they sometimes may not have higher educational qualifications. We
therefore need to create a straightforward and simple low-cost method.
We asked PADA to advise on the best method of providing that sort of
simple and straightforward collection method, but we do not want to
provide it with a competitive advantage.</div>

							<a name="08012322000196"></a>Andrew
Selous:
						</b> I read somewhere that it is intended that personal
accounts collection should be entirely online. Will there be an option?
Some very small business might prefer to get the cheque book out once a
month and send a cheque to PADA. Is that an option, or has it been
totally ruled
out?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012322000197"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> That has not been ruled out. It is a matter for
PADA to consider. In some cases, it may prove not to be practical to do
it only online. We have to consider the matter because some employers
will not have mastered the online facilities that are available to many
of us. We have to ensure that the garage owner, who is probably very
good at mending cars but may not be very good at running a computer
system or an accounts system, to continue his business and to employ
the extra person that may be needed to do the paperwork. It has to be
fairly straightforward.</div>
					<a name="08012322000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The straight answer to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s question is that we have not ruled out someone
sending a cheque. We want to ensure that procedures are simple, but we
also want to keep the costs down. We do not want to have idiosyncratic
collection systems that drive up the cost for the rest of those
participating. There is a balance to be
struck.</div>
					<a name="08012322000165"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30

					<a name="08012322000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander) asked
about a parliamentary debate, about which I can give no commitments.
There will be a report back by the group which Age Concern suggested,
and to which we responded positively. That will set out the background
information. As he indicated, we are not looking for recommendations
and we do not expect any in a report&#151;we expect an elucidation of
the nature of the debate and of the issues in the debate, rather than
anything else. We give no commitments as to how we will respond. The
response will be for his party, others in the Opposition and the
Government to decide when we see the document. Debates and whether
there shall be debates in the House of Commons are for the usual
channels; I will not seek to
intrude.</div>
					<a name="08012322000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s other question, he asked&#151;a fair
point&#151;about the issue of when an employer is enrolling an
employee on day one. The employee spends some time looking at the
documentation and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column174" />Column number: 174</div>decides to opt out; that will happen. The key question is when the
obligation arises for the employer to make payments into personal
accounts. From what point does he have to start paying? That does not
mean when he administratively puts in place the mechanism for him to
pay for employee X. He may give employee X a week or two to decide
whether he wants to opt out or not&#151;but the employer&#146;s
obligation begins from day one. The employer has to be prepared to pay
a contribution in but, provided that the procedures have been gone
through, that it is known that an employee has opted out and that the
opting out has been registered, then there is no obligation on the
employer to start making contributions for someone who has opted out.
The employer will, however, have an obligation as from day one to make
contributions where a personal account system has been set
up.</div>
					<a name="08012322000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will shortly
come to the exception. All that I have said is &#147;caveated&#148;
by an exception: it is possible to defer payments in from day one in
certain circumstances, but we will come to that in the next clause. I
hope that that deals with the issue for the hon. Member for Inverness,
Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey and that we will be able to approve the
clause.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012322000200"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I was referring to automatic enrolment from day
one. However, there is an exception, which we come to now. What we have
at the moment is a number of employers who provide perfectly good
pension schemes for their employees. They make a contribution that may
be above the 3 per cent. minimum that we are requiring. We want to
cause the minimum possible disruption to current good-quality pension
provision. Therefore, the objective of the clause is about where an
employer is making a fairly good-quality contribution&#151;we reckon
at least 6 per cent., or double the minimum&#151;and there is a
deferral of entry.</div>
					<a name="08012322000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, Tesco defer for a year at the moment before someone is
automatically enrolled into their pension scheme. One has to be
employed for a year and then one is automatically enrolled, as I
understand it&#151;I can be corrected if I am wrong. The result is
that we would say that we do not want to change it unless we need to.
However, one year is rather a long time and we would rather have a
period of about three months. We do not want to put that in the Bill
now and we have time to discuss it with employers and to consider the
sort of period that will be best for ensuring that we keep a good
quality provision. Some employers have very strong views; if they make
a contribution of, say, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column175" />Column number: 175</div>12, 13 or 14 per cent., as some good employers do, there may be an
argument for giving them a longer deferral period.</div>
					<a name="08012322000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to have a sensitive
discussion with employers. We want to give ourselves flexibility in the
coming months or possibly even a year or so. To have such a discussion
would ensure that we get the detail of regulations right. Three months
is the sort of period we are considering as a reasonable maximum but I
am not being dogmatic about that as we are prepared to discuss it
further as part of a consensus-building approach when we may consider
some sliding scales or say that three months is right.</div>
					<a name="08012322000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments clarify what we
are doing. We want employers using a deferral period to follow the
arrangements set out in clause 3. We want automatic enrolment and we
want it to be done properly; amendment No. 117 puts that clearly in the
Bill so that employers know that there is another procedure.</div>
					<a name="08012322000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 118 is
uncontroversial. It clarifies the fact that employers can get a
deferral period for a reasonably good scheme, but they cannot then
switch the employees to another scheme that is not so good; in other
words, they cannot manipulate the system. Employers can keep the
deferral period provided that they keep their employees in the scheme
for which they are seeking the deferral. They cannot use it to move in
and move out of a scheme.</div>
					<a name="08012322000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">I doubt that many employers
would be tempted to use that trick but we want it to be clear in the
Bill that they cannot do so. If they seek a deferral it must be to
enrol someone in a better quality scheme than the minimum. In those
circumstances we accept that an element of deferral may be possible if
current arrangements are in
existence.</div>
					<a name="08012322000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provision would particularly benefit employers who have a high
turnover, but it will mean that in order to take advantage of the
clause and the amendments they would need to have a better quality
pension scheme than the absolute minimum. There is a reasonable
trade-off, which has been discussed with various stakeholders. It is
fair to say that stakeholders have different views but what is proposed
is a sensible compromise that enables us to make a reasonable
provision.</div>
					<a name="08012322000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
looked with care at the percentage level at which we enable the
deferral period to come in, given the employer contribution. It has
been suggested that the level should be 9 per cent., 10 per cent. or 6
per cent. I chose 6 per cent. primarily because I want a minimum of
churning, of decision making and of opportunity for people to decide to
level down. The proposal is part of that process; the less we require
employers who have reasonable provision to do, the better in terms of
levelling down.</div>
					<a name="08012322000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Committee will accept the amendments and the
clause.</div>

							<a name="08012322000201"></a>Andrew
Selous:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation
of the amendments and clause 4. The amendments are entirely sensible.
Amendment No. 117 is a way of tidying up and ensuring that clause 4 is
in line with what is stated in clause 3, and the strengthening 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column176" />Column number: 176</div>provision of amendment No. 118 is sensible also, so
I understand where the Minister is coming from. However, I have a
couple of questions about the Minister&#146;s introduction to clause
4. I am grateful for his comments on clause 4 generally because he has
provided a lot more information than I have been able to obtain, either
from the explanatory notes or from the House of Commons Library brief.
I would be grateful if he provided a little further clarification on a
number of points. He mentioned, by way of example, the Tesco scheme. If
I understood him correctly, he said that employees are not enrolled in
the scheme at all for the first year, but that after that year they are
and it would pass his test of what counts as a good scheme. I am
unclear whether Tesco would retrospectively make contributions for
their employee for that first year. Perhaps he can respond later,
unless he wants to  intervene
now?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012322000202"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I will not pre-judge whether the Tesco scheme
will fit our criteria or not, I want to look at it in more detail. I
have had discussions with Tesco, it runs a defined contribution scheme
on which employees are auto-enrolled after a year. In those
circumstances Tesco would not make back-dated contributions to the
start, but from the point of enrolment. In terms of the people who
would be automatically enrolled if we moved to three months, they would
receive their employer&#146;s contributions as from three months, not
as from day one. There would be the option of a deferred period for
automatic enrolment and
contributions.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012322000203"></a>Andrew
Selous:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that
clarification. I must admit that when I first looked at clause 4, I
assumed that schemes that paid an employer contribution of 3 per cent.
or more would fit the Minister&#146;s criteria for an acceptable
scheme. I now realise that that is not the case and we shall have to
wait for specific regulations from the Minister on the exact balance of
employer contribution, when the scheme kicks in and various other
factors to determine whether a scheme will pass a reasonableness test.
He mentioned a 6 per cent. contribution figure; I do not think that he
totally committed himself to that, but that is perhaps a helpful
general clarification for employers in this
area.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012322000204"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I am fairly clear that 6 per cent. is the level
at which I want this to kick in. The pressure on me, in terms of the
views of stakeholders, has been that we should set the figure higher
rather than lower. I have tended to take the view that in order to
minimise disruption for employers and levelling down, we should set it
at the lower level of about 6 per cent.</div>

						</b> We are going to have to take on trust what the
Minister is doing. I have no reason not to extend trust to him in this
particular area. In terms of not wanting to disrupt existing good
provision as the Minister suggests, we are in agreement with him. We
shall have to wait to see the specific regulations that he brings
forward, having had further discussions with those in the
industry&#151;employers and specialist interest
groups.</div>

							<a name="08012322000206"></a>Danny
Alexander:
						</b> Like the hon. Member for South-West
Bedfordshire, I think that the amendments are sensible. They are
intended to strike the right 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column177" />Column number: 177</div>balance between not giving employers undue
incentives to level down and preserving the right of pension holders,
employees, to get a decent
pension.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="08012322000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have one
question to ask the Minister. What process does he have in mind by
which employers will register to take advantage of the deferral period?
In the light of the conversation that we had on the previous clause,
there will clearly be some benefit to doing so. The Minister hinted
that it would be a quasi-automatic process based simply on employer
contribution. Will there need to be a one-off registration process
administered by PADA, for example, or will a record of the level of
employer contributions mean that a deferral applies? Businesses will
have to be notified if they are eligible for the deferral period, so
that they can make use of it if they need to. I should like a little
more detail on the practicalities and reassurance that they will not be
unduly burdensome in delivering a potential benefit to
employers.</div>
					<a name="08012322000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012322000207"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> The whole idea is that the employer can
self-certify his scheme. There will not be a registration process. We
want to make the rules explicit so that he can make a judgment that his
scheme enables him to self-certify, and he will then be responsible for
it. He will be able to get advice if he wishes, but that is essentially
the approach.</div>
					<a name="08012322000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">PADA
would not give him a certificate, because in a sense it is just another
provider, although it has wider obligations. If a certificate were to
be issued, it would have to be by the Pensions Regulator, but we do not
intend that to happen. The employer will examine his scheme and see
whether he is making contributions above a certain level. We want to
make the rules as clear as possible so that he can say, &#147;Right,
I don&#146;t have to be concerned about having to enrol everyone and
set up a pension scheme on day one. I have got my three-month deferral
period&#148;&#151;for example&#151;&#147;before I have to enrol
everyone, because I go over the
level.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012322000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08012322000208"></a>
							<b class="B">Miss
Julie Kirkbride</b> (Bromsgrove) (Con): The Minister has put
some good arguments for his plan. From the opposite perspective, why is
he excluding schemes that make contributions of between 3 per cent. and
6 per cent.? After all, those are companies that have been doing the
right things and providing something for their employees by making a
contribution that, if an employee stays there for a considerable
period, will make a considerable difference to their pension pot
because it is above the 3 per cent. state minimum. If there is to be a
three-month waiting period, why cannot all schemes that already exist
qualify?</div>
					<a name="08012322000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012322000209"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> That is a good point. Part of the process of
deciding on the level was to consider all the circumstances of pension
schemes, because they have administration costs and running costs. It
would be very easy to set up a pension scheme with a high running cost.
For example, personal accounts could have 0.5 per cent. or 0.3 per
cent. running costs in the long term. Employers&#146; contributions
can be used up in that running cost, so the employee does not get the
benefit of them. In order to create therefore a cushion, we need a
certain amount of flexibility, and some trade unions, for example, are
concerned that the level at 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column178" />Column number: 178</div>which the exemption&#151;the provision&#151;kicks in should be
higher than 6 per cent., because the cost of running the system could
be quite high. Some systems, if they allow a lot of choice or are
complex, will have high administration costs.</div>
					<a name="08012322000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Essentially, the answer to the
hon. Lady&#146;s question is that I do not want to create a set of
complex rules that say things like, &#147;You can self-certify if
your contribution is at 4 per cent. and your administrative
costs&#151;your pension scheme&#151;remain at 0.3 per
cent.,&#148; among other conditions. I would rather have a clear and
straightforward set of rules, so that a small employer who has enrolled
his employees in a scheme that operates before 2012 and is fairly
straightforward can just say, &#147;They&#146;re all signed up,
I&#146;m paying over  6 per cent., I can self-certify,
it&#146;s fairly simple and straightforward. That gives me a deferral
period of this long, and I know what the situation is.&#148; He does
not have to get advice from an independent financial advisor. The issue
is about getting the balance right between that level of protection
against administrative costs, and making self-certification as simple
and straightforward for a small employer as I possibly can.

amendment would add new subsection (7) to the clause and stipulate the
maximum time for which automatic enrolment could be deferred. The
Minister has mentioned three months on several occasions during earlier
debates, which is half the time that the amendment stipulates, at six
months. The amendment would ensure a level playing field for all
employers, because there is a competitive advantage for employers who
do not make any automatic enrolment contributions to a scheme. An
employer, in a business in which margins are tight, may compete against
another who does not make such contributions, and 1 or 2 per cent. can
make a difference to winning business and getting orders.</div>

We need to have discussions with employers, and to have the regulations
drafted. I would like, then, to consult on the regulations; so it will

response to the amendments in the clause. I do not know whether he is
good cop to the Minister&#146;s bad cop, or maybe it is the other way
around. We shall
see.</div>
					<a name="08012322000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause deals with automatic re-enrolment. It makes a great deal of
sense to ensure that there is a regular opportunity for people who opt
out to reconsider their position to be automatically re-enrolled. The
amendment is fairly simple, so I do not intend to dwell on it for a
great length of time. It is to try to establish that the timing of
automatic re-enrolments be of maximum convenience to the employer, for
reasons of administrative efficiency that we have been discussing
previously. I think that that is also the purpose of amendment No. 15
tabled by the Conservatives. I note, for example, that the Engineering
Employers Federation suggests that it hopes that that will include
allowing employers to undertake the process on a fixed date, such as
the start of the tax year.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column180" />Column number: 180</div>
					<a name="08012322000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 80 gives 1 April,
the start of the tax year, as the suggested date, rather than the
anniversary date of when the individual chose not to be auto-enrolled.
If it was on that anniversary, automatic re-enrolments could go on in
large companies almost every day of the year. One would wish to avoid
that, in the interests of administrative efficiency. Whether the
Government choose to accept the amendment or not, I hope that the
Minister will accept the principle that automatic re-enrolment should
fall on a specific date, perhaps every year, and that choosing a date,
for example at the start of the tax year, that fits in with other
changes that employers might be making in tax and salary rises would
minimise the administrative burdens on employers. That would make the
automatic re-enrolment process easier and, of course, more likely to go
without a
hitch.</div>

					<a name="08012322000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly some businesses operate
tax years on a different basis, so the approach set down in the
Conservative amendment might be preferable to the fixed calendar date
in amendment No. 80. The point that I am trying to establish is that
there should be a fixed date every year, two years or whatever, when
automatic re-enrolment takes place at a date that is most convenient to
the company. The start of the tax year would seem an obvious date. That
is the simple point that I am trying to make. I do not think that I
need to dwell on it

Selous:
						</b> I agree with the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn,
Badenoch and Strathspey that our amendment No. 15 is similar to
amendment No. 80. He said that his amendment was inspired by the
Engineering Employers Federation. Ours has also been in part inspired
by what it had to say. I note that the recommendation of the Work and
Pensions Committee to the Government was that they should adopt this
recommendation that re-enrolment should take place for all employees en
masse at the end of the tax year in order to reduce the administrative
burden on employers.</div>
					<a name="08012322000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am pleased to note that the
Government in their response to the report said at paragraph
130:</div>
					<a name="08012322000162"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We have
been working closely with employers and their representative
organisations to design a scheme that minimises the burdens on
business.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012322000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure we
are all keen to support that. At the moment, employers would have to
track the start date and 22nd birthday of all their employees at three
year points from all those dates. Instead of having all the dates
flagged up on a computer, with letters going out 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column181" />Column number: 181</div>to everyone and re-enrolling everyone in one go, and instead of it being
a simple one-hit task that is done once a year, it will be a monthly
problem for
employers.</div>
					<a name="08012322000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, I
make no apology for repeating that we are bringing the world of
pensions and contributions to some very small businesses. The Minister
mentioned a garage earlier. Think of the small hairdresser or the very
small sandwich bar with one or two employees. Those are not
organisations that have large personnel and compliance departments that
can make sure that this is done easily. If the Minister does not like
amendments Nos. 15 or 80, I hope he will have something pretty
convincing to say to the Committee about how he will make this work
simply and effectively and with the least
hassle.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012322000219"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions
(Mr. James Plaskitt):
						</b> It is now my turn, Sir
Nicholas, to say how nice it is to serve under your chairmanship and to
deal with the amendments that have been tabled on clause 5. I am
grateful to the hon. Members for moving them in the way that they have.
We have already established that there is strong support across the
whole Committee for the concept of automatic enrolment. I hope it
therefore follows that there is equally strong support for the
principle of automatic re-enrolment. The issue is about the timing and
the way in which we can minimise the burdens for employers in carrying
out this equally important part of the process we are establishing
here.</div>
					<a name="08012322000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">There will, of
course, be perfectly reasonable reasons why some employees might wish
to opt out. But it is therefore important that a prompt is also built
into the system that gives them once again the chance to consider
whether they should be back in the system. The best way of doing that
is by having an automatic re-enrolment process at a suitable interval.
That is why these clauses include provisions that enable the Government
to require the periodic re-enrolment of job holders who are not
participating in a qualifying pension scheme&#151;&#151;a timely
reminder, through the process of re-enrolment, could make all the
difference for some employees. Without that facility, they might not
again consider revisiting the decision that they  have
made.</div>
					<a name="08012322000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are conscious of the burdens that re-enrolment places on employers and
on schemes. That is why we decided that re-enrolment should happen not
more frequently than once every three years and why we placed that
safeguard in the Bill. Support for that stance came during our evidence
sessions from the consumers, represented by Which? and from employers,
represented by the CBI. They both endorsed strongly the three year
re-enrolment
period.</div>
					<a name="08012322000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
would establish a link between the re-enrolment date and the beginning
of the tax year. Amendment No. 15 would do that every time the
enrolment is triggered. Amendment No. 80 would establish re-enrolment
on the same basis, but trigger it every year. Having re-enrolment every
year could  triple the employer burden compared with our
proposal if people who have persistently chosen not to save still
choose not to save and opt out 12 months later. Instead of a three
yearly peak in activity, the peak would be annual.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column182" />Column number: 182</div>
					<a name="08012322000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">We hope that people will stay
with pension saving, but there is a balance to be struck between
periodic re-enrolment when a person&#146;s circumstances might have
changed and virtual harassment. Re-enrolling job holders every year
would be overdoing it. There is a risk that the message could become so
routine for those individuals that it is devalued rather quickly and so
more readily dismissed than it would be were it to come up every three
years.</div>
					<a name="08012322000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I emphasise
that we are still considering the implementation of re-enrolment and
the process by which it will occur. As the hon. Members who have spoken
on the issue have indicated, we need to strike the right balance
between the benefits for job holders and the impact on employers. We
need to fully understand the impact of re-enrolment on employers and on
schemes. I have therefore asked the personal accounts delivery
authority for advice on this issue and on how it would be best
implemented. We also need to discuss with other stakeholders how best
to introduce the policy so that it minimises the burden on employers
and on schemes.</div>
					<a name="08012322000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
effect, there is a range of options on the timing of re-enrolment which
could be used to smooth its administrative impact over a calendar year,
a tax year or some other period. The hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn,
Badenoch and Strathspey suggested that one date could be chosen on
which all employers must do automatic re-enrolment. A certain logic
points towards the tax year, but that might not be the appropriate
single date for all employers. Some will have different forms of
financial years. My hon. Friend the Member for Ochil and South
Perthshire noted that the case for simplicity in respect of some
employers might point to one date, but the same simplicity argument
might point to another date for another employer. While the principle
of one date has a clear attraction, moving from that to saying that it
should be the start of the tax year will not necessarily meet the
criteria that employers reasonably have in this
area.</div>
					<a name="08012322000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is also the option of aligning the three year automatic re-enrolment to
the date on which the individual opted out. That would create another
set of complexities for many employers. Those with highly automated
payroll systems might not find it at all burdensome. They would simply
have to log, at the point of the individual opting out, a time three
years hence when they will automatically be re-enrolled if they are
still with the firm. That would not be so easy for smaller companies,
which do not have such sophisticated processes. Those are the reasons
why we need to go on discussing the matter as we are committed to
doing. However, by tying the process of re-enrolment to the start of
the tax year, the amendments would perhaps create a peak in the
underpinning administrative activity, which would affect employers and
schemes, and incur associated costs.</div>
					<a name="08012322000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government have already
made a public commitment in the consultation response to the White
Paper to take account of further analysis and advice from the delivery
authority, and to consult with stakeholders and the industry, before we
take our final decisions on the actual period of, and mechanism for,
automatic re-enrolment. I hope that with those reassurances, hon.
Members will be happy to withdraw their
amendments.</div>

amendments Nos. 15 and 80 would not do that job? However, I hope that
he will be satisfied like me with a ministerial commitment to come back
with another draft following his consultations. We want the scheme to

							<a name="08012322000226"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> Government amendment No. 120 removes the
restriction on jobholders that prevents them from opting in more than
once every 12 months. Government 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column184" />Column number: 184</div>amendment No. 122 enables the jobholder to request access at any time to
workplace pension saving with an employer contribution, but does not
oblige the employer to act on more than one request every 12 months.
Should the employer choose to accept an additional notice made within
that period, he must enrol the jobholder in accordance with the
prescribed opt-in enrolment process. This means that employees cannot
be disruptive by playing hokey-cokey with the pensions system, opting
in and opting
out.</div>
				
					<a name="08012322000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">If someone has opted out, that
person is entitled to opt back in at some point during the year.
However, as the employer need not accede to an opt-in request more than
once during the year, the employee can make such requests, but the
employer does not have to act upon them more than once. This will work
as follows. Once a year, the employer will accept employees opting in
and, at that date, will opt in those who have requested to opt in. This
is a fairly straightforward process, and the amendments clarify the
situation in respect of the way in which employers would be able to
operate.</div>
					<a name="08012322000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
70 seeks to prescribe the process by which a jobholder is able to
trigger an opt-in, and obliges notice to be given in a particular form,
signed by the jobholder, with particular information being provided. My
reason for opposing this is not that I particularly object to the
provision proposed by the amendment, but that I would rather this be
done in regulations after we have consulted with the employers&#146;
organisations and have had a further opportunity to look at how this
process will work in detail.</div>
					<a name="08012322000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">The terms of a particular form
are, I think, better dealt with in that way, unless it is a form of
great substance, as in the case of the Police Criminal Evidence Act
1984. The way in which a form is laid out may change from time to time,
and I think it is much better to deal with it in regulations, rather
than trying to put it in the Bill. I have no great objection in
principle to what amendment No. 70 seeks to do: I just think these
issues are better dealt with elsewhere, and we will come to deal with
them in terms of the way in which various forms might be dealt
with&#151;I think that is in clause 8, &#147;Information to be
given to jobholders&#148;.

entirely sensible and I understand what the Minister is trying to do
with them. I was pleased to hear the Minister say that he was not
opposed to the principle of amendment  No. 70. Our reason for
tabling it is to seek clarity, to help the employer have clear records
about who has and has not opted in, and perhaps to prevent any
come-back against the employer if, at a later date, the employee says,
&#147;What is this deduction on my wage slip at the end of the month?
I don&#146;t remember authorising you to take any more money from
me&#148;. It is just to give that degree of protection to the
employer and have a proper audit trail. That is where we are coming
from, but the Minister has said that he is sympathetic to those type of
actions and seeks to clarify how that would happen by way of regulation
at a later date. With that commitment from him, I do not wish to press

(6) enables the Government to regulate to allow an employer to use a

amendment No. 72, in clause 7, page 4, line 28, after
&#145;refunded&#146;, insert &#145;to the
employer&#146;.</div>

Selous:
						</b> These are two brief amendments that seek to
clarify what is on the face of the Bill. Currently, subsection (3)
deals with contributions being refunded, as does subsection (4), but it
is not entirely clear that contributions are to be refunded to the job
holder and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column186" />Column number: 186</div>the employer respectively, and that is all that the amendments seek to
do. For the avoidance of doubt and possible litigation, when money is
to be paid back, it is important that it is clear to whom it is going.
I hope, therefore, that the two amendments will find favour with which
ever Minister is to
respond.</div>

							<a name="08012322000232"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> The clause ensures that jobholders automatically
enrolled into work place pension savings schemes, but who decide not to
save, have the right to opt out. People&#146;s circumstances and
preferences vary, and it is important that individuals remain free to
decide whether private pensions saving is for them. A jobholder can opt
out by giving notice in accordance with regulations to be made under
subsection (2). The intention is that any contributions paid by the
jobholder before their notice to opt out takes effect will be refunded
to the jobholder. Similarly, any contribution paid by the employer
during that opt-out period will be refunded to the
employer.</div>
					<a name="08012322000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would, however, make the jobholder the only possible
recipient of a refund of a jobholder contribution, and the employer the
only possible recipient of a refund of employer contributions. Although
we can all agree with the intention, the implications up putting that
in legislation for existing schemes, of which we need to take account,
are immense. We cannot be certain at this stage about how the refund of
contributions will operate or about the full implications for tax
purposes. However, the first destination of a refund of jobholder
contributions might need to be the jobholder&#146;s employer in order
to enable income tax to be deducted from earnings, which is not a
pension contribution and, therefore, no longer entitled to tax
relief.</div>
					<a name="08012322000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">By preventing
the refund going the employer in the first instance, amendment No. 71
would require a scheme to know all the relevant details for all
individuals, and would require those individuals, were they to receive
a refund direct, to make arrangements to pay tax due on what are now
earnings. With regard to employer contributions, the intention is that
employers engaging with personal accounts should receive a refund of
their contributions if the jobholder opts out during the opt-out
period. However, amendment No. 72 would apply to all employers
regardless of what scheme they use to discharge their duties. Some
employers do not require refunds when a jobholder opts out. For
example, some choose to leave employer contributions at the disposal of
the scheme trustees when a worker opts out, either as a contribution to
administrative costs, or to be used by trustees for the benefit of
other members. The problem is that that is a highly technical area, and
if we start making changes to current schemes, we would need to
approach it with an enormous degree of caution.</div>
					<a name="08012322000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Procedures for handling the
return of contributions will be a matter for detailed consultation with
stakeholders, including the delivery authority, as we develop the
regulations. They will set out the time limits for refunds and specify
how they are calculated and paid. That approach will also ensure that
tax issues are fully addressed. However, I want to make it clear that
whatever the regulations prescribe for the process, the refund due to
the jobholder will find its way to the jobholder, and those due to the
employer to the employer. We must ensure, however, that in seeking to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column187" />Column number: 187</div>do something that might sound simple and straightforward, we do not add
a level of unintended complication and difficulty. Unintended
consequences are a habit with parliamentary legislation, unless we
approach with care, particularly when dealing with pensions regulation.
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will consider withdrawing his
amendment.</div>

Selous:
						</b> Notwithstanding the technical arguments that the
Minister set out clearly for why amendments Nos. 71 and 72 should not
be adopted, I am grateful to him, because he did say, at least twice,
that the ultimate destination of the contributions should be the
jobholder and employer respectively. I think that his words will count
if there is any dispute about the ultimate destinations of those
moneys. However, I take on board his points about the various interim
destinations. In light of that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

Alexander:
						</b> I wish to raise a couple of points in relation
to clause 7 on clause stand part. This is an important clause because
the right to opt out is a critical part of ensuring that the automatic
enrolment system operates properly. Making it easy for job holders to
opt out is clearly important and the drafting of the clause emphasises
that point. However, within the right to opt out, we find some of the
issues that we will come to later in the Bill in relation to
enforcement. For example, potentially unscrupulous employers&#151;who
we hope are a small minority, but they do exist&#151;could persuade
or put pressure on individuals to exercise the right to opt
out.</div>
					<a name="08012322000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the moment,
the drafting of subsection (7)(a) requires two things. First, that the
jobholder must receive information about the consequences of opting
out, and secondly that they must sign their name. In amendments Nos. 81
and 82, which are not selected but are on the amendment paper, we
suggest some additional safeguards: that the jobholder would need to
give notice in writing themselves, and indeed that they may also
register it with the enforcement body. Those measures may go too far in
terms of the burden on the jobholder, but I urge the Minister to
reflect on whether the degree of engagement that the clause requires of
the jobholder in the opt out process, is sufficient to ensure that it
is a genuinely independent action taken by them. Furthermore&#151;and
this was the reason for suggesting a reference to the enforcement
body&#151;there could be some action that the jobholder may have to
take outwith the context of their employment relationship. It would
mean that they have to do something else other than, in the case of the
case of the unscrupulous employer, simply sign a piece of paper that is
presented to them by the employer that says &#147;I wish to opt
out&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08012322000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
necessarily seeking an answer from the Minister now on how he would
seek to do that, but I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column188" />Column number: 188</div>urge him to reflect on whether the provisions in the Bill about the
process that the jobholder must go through, are sufficient to ensure
that the balance between making it easy for the jobholder to opt out
and ensuring that they act independently, is right. I am not sure that
it is right in the current drafting of the clause, but I look forward
to hearing the Minister&#146;s response.</div>

Selous:
						</b> I shall be brief. I recognise the issue raised by
the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey about
employers possibly putting improper pressure on their employees to opt
out. We are right to be mindful of that issue. We have tabled a new
clause on that very issue so there will be a further chance to debate
those points.</div>
					<a name="08012322000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012322000236"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> The point that the hon. Member for Inverness,
Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey raises is a good one. I will reflect on
what he said. We are not looking to make opting out so unduly
burdensome that people find it difficult to make the decision that is
right for them. At the same time, we do not want employers to be
putting a lot of pressure on employees to opt out.
</div>
					<a name="08012322000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">We focused on
ensuring that the employer will make sure that people are automatically
enrolled and that there is no way in which the employer could prevent
that. The hon. Member is suggesting that that has happened: that people
are in, and now there is pressure to get them to opt out. We want to
ensure that that does not happen either. One obvious way is through
trade unions reporting such behaviour. There will also be considerable
publicity around 2012 and thereafter so most employees will know,
irrespective of whether they are members of trade unions, that they
have rights to opt into a pension system.</div>
					<a name="08012322000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will also consider the forms
that the employee will have to sign to opt out. We will consult on
this, but that will probably be one way in which we make sure that the
form makes it clear that people have a right to remain, that employers
should not force people out and that people will have the protection of
the law if employers seek to do so. That said, the hon. Gentleman is
right that the decision to opt out must be genuinely intended. I shall
reflect on his remarks and on the new clause that the Conservatives
tabled to deal with the issue. We will have an opportunity later in the
Bill to consider the matter further.</div>
