<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We will resume consideration of the Bill with amendment No. 6 in the name of the hon. Member for Banbury (Mr. Baldry).
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett </B>(Denton and Reddish): On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I am delighted that new clause 3 has been selected for consideration, replacing amendments Nos. 215, 216, 217 and 218. Could someone give the Committee a progress report as to whether more amendments will be tabled, so that we can debate the Bill in the form that the Home Office believes that the House considers would make good law?
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. George Howarth):</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. Parliamentary counsel is now working on amendments to the entire Bill. Those that are ready have already been tabled by the promoter of the Bill, my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster). I hope that within the next week or so, or perhaps slightly longer, by the time we have reached clauses 6 and 7, we will table amendments that will resolve any outstanding difficulties in respect of the Bill's technical competence. I should add that in no way does that compromise the Government's neutrality on the issue. We believe that the Bill should be resolved by Parliament.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. The Minister's response takes us some way forward; however we may not reach clause 2, because amendments Nos. 215 to 218 are starred amendments, so it would therefore not be appropriate to select them. Therefore, the Committee will probably have to adjourn again today until next week. That causes difficulties for those who want to table amendments to the Bill as it is likely to become, rather than as it is drafted. I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to try to make a complete draft of the Bill available by Friday, so that we have the chance next Monday to table probing amendments to find out exactly what is going on.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I am trying as best I can to move the matter along as quickly as possible. I am advised that it is unlikely that we shall have all the amendments available to be tabled by Friday. However, I shall try to do so by Monday.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Baldry </B>(Banbury): I can only reflect that none of this would have happened if my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) still had a grip on the Home Office. The sooner that she is returned somewhere like that, the better.
<P>
The various amendments tabled in my name and in those of my hon. Friends are now rather otiose because they were tabled in respect of a clause 1 that will I anticipate, be abandoned by the promoter of the Bill and its sponsors. Therefore, I should have thought that the sensible course of action for good order would be for me to withdraw, or not to move, the amendments to clause 1 that are tabled in my name, so that we can reach the debate on new clause 3, which would replace clause 1 of the Bill as drafted.
<P>
I also agree with the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett). It is difficult to see how, with the best will in the world, we can make much progress beyond clause 1 stand part. Until we see what other neutral amendments the Government have tabled, debate on clause 2 would be rather otiose.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman is going beyond amendment No. 6 and I have been tolerant of that but amendment No. 6 is not being moved.
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Offences</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider new clause 3 Prohibition of hunting, &c. 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>". (1) A person commits an offence if he hunts a wild mammal with a dog.
<P>
(2) An owner or occupier of land commits an offence if he permits another person to enter or use that land to hunt in contravention of subsection (1).
<P>
(3) The owner or keeper of a dog commits an offence if he permits another person to use the dog to hunt in contravention of subsection (1).
<P>
(4) It is an offence to own or keep two or more dogs for the purposes of their being used to hunt in contravention of subsection (1).
<P>
(5) In this Act a reference to hunting a wild mammal includes a reference to searching for or coursing a wild mammal.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
And the following amendments thereto:
<P>
(a), in line 1, leave out "hunts" and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"intentionally causes a dog to chase, pursue, harry, bait, attack or injure".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
(b), in line 9, at end add 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(6) A person commits an offence if for the purpose of hunting a wild mammal with a dog he obstructs an entrance to or exit from a structure or place used or likely to be used for shelter or protection by a wild mammal.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster </B>(Worcester): With the introduction of new clause 3, we would not want clause 1 to stand part of the Bill. I shall point out the advantages of the new clause suggested by the Home Office.
<P>
New clause 3 is undoubtedly a simplification of clause 1. The purpose of the new clause is to point out clearly that the offence considered by the Bill is hunting. Hunting is a deliberate act and parliamentary counsel has made it clear that hunting cannot take place inadvertently. Reference to intention is therefore unnecessary; people do not accidentally hunt, they have the purpose of hunting in mind.
<P>
We must define clearly what hunting is so that people never forget the purpose of the Bill. Examples have[Mr. Michael J. Foster]
 been given at length in this Committee in the past few weeks; a fox is searched for and then chased to a point at which it either escapes or becomes exhausted and the hounds catch it. That is hunting; it will be stopped under the new clause. A fox escaping and seeking refuge possibly underground and terrier dogs being sent down to try to force the fox out also counts as hunting and will be stopped under this new clause.
<P>
It is important to state clearly that the new clause encompasses all such activities, including stag hunting. In the case of stags or deer, the dogs do not kill them but chase them to the point at which they are shot. That is also hunting, and will be banned under this new clause. Hare hunting and coursing will also be treated in the same way. I will deal with hare coursing later.
<P>
If I may remind members of the Committee, the former Attorney-General, the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir N. Lyell), made it clear during the debate on 28 November that in his opinion people could be found liable if they let their dogs off the lead and they chased a rabbit, vole or mouse. That is not hunting and it has never been the express desire of the Committee to include that in a definition of hunting. Parliamentary counsel acknowledge that that is not hunting.
<P>
People who walk their dogs in parks and fields will still be able to do so without fear of the consequences of being found guilty of hunting. I am glad that that can be put on the record once and for all, so that absolutely no doubt will exist in the minds of the British people about the Bill's intentions.
<P>
Subsection (1) of the new clause points out plainly and bluntly the offence that is being considered, which is hunting a wild mammal with a dog. Subsections (2) and (3) describe in more detail offences of a related nature, such as when an owner or occupier of land permits hunting to take place. Let us remember: hunting is an intentional act it is deliberate. Subsection (3) says that an owner or keeper of a dog is liable
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"if he permits another person to use the dog to hunt".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
New clause 3 encompasses and simplifies the merits of original clause 1. Subsection (4) makes it
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"an offence to own or keep two or more dogs for the purposes of their being used to hunt".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is appropriate to dispel some of the myths about what will happen to dogs involved in hunting as a result of the Bill. It has been claimed that 20,000 dogs will be put down. The Country Landowners Association claimed that 13,000 dogs will be destroyed, but 10,000 dogs a year are killed by hunts as a matter of routine.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ian Gibson </B>(Norwich, North): Is my hon. Friend aware that hounds are subject to infections from fallen stock and carcases that contain bovine spongiform encephalopathy or salmonella, which can cause abortions in female fox hounds? It cannot be argued that the system of feeding the hounds is not cruel.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am aware of the diseases that can be caught by eating raw flesh, which is often what the dogs are fed; and the dogs can spread those diseases across the countryside on which they roam. I do not, however, want to concentrate on diseases or the deaths of dogs in pursuit of foxes in an earlier sitting we spoke about the electrocution of dogs when hunting.
<P>
It is simple mathematics that 10,000 dogs a year are killed as a matter of course. The normal life expectancy of a fox hound is 12 years, but after six years a hound can no longer keep up with the chase so it is disposed of as being past its best. A colleague visited a north Shropshire hunt and he was told that the average life expectancy of a hound was five or six years, after which it ceased to be viable. When I visited the Worcestershire hunt kennels, I was told that the top age of a working fox hound was seven or eight years, but I take some of the things that I have been told with a pinch of salt. Perhaps it is the Worcestershire water, but I doubt the sudden increased ability of Worcester hounds to chase foxes.
<P>
Part of the reason for my visit to the Worcestershire hunt was to find out about the dog-breeding programme and to get a feel for the number of dogs bred and therefore the number of pups born. I wanted to know the extent of the ritual killing of dogs. I was told that the average litter size was 12 and that in the previous year the hunt bred from five pairs of dogs. At the risk of getting caught out, five 12s are 60, but when I was presented with the list from the Worcestershire hunt puppy show, only 29 dogs and bitches were mentioned, so something must have happened to the other 31. There is no doubt that they have been killed they have ceased to be.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
If 60 pups are born and all survive, the pack size will increase by 60, provided nothing is done to the older age range of fox hounds. But that is not the case; we know that the dogs' lives are curtailed. If 60 dogs are born and 31 are killed as pups, then a considerable number have been killed at an older age

<P>

<B>Miss Ann Widdecombe </B>(Maidstone and The Weald): My hon. and temporary friend refers to the older age range of dogs. Can he be more precise because I believe that it is not only old dogs that are killed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The old-age range is six or seven, when they cease to be able to keep up with the pack 
<P>
<B>Miss Widdecombe:</B> But that is good, healthy middle age.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> It is good, healthy middle age to most members of the public who do not understand why a dog's life is treated with such disdain. I want to highlight the fact that the practice occurs regularly so that everyone knows how many dogs are killed each year as part of the hunting process.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have been listening with interest to the hon. Gentleman's argument about the numbers of dogs that disappear, but I cannot see how it relates to new clause 3.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I apologise, Mr. O'Hara, if I have strayed from the point. I am trying to concentrate on subsection (4), which would make it an offence to keep two or more dogs. It has been argued that making that an offence would mean that many dogs would have to be put down. I wish to show that that is irrelevant because of the number of dogs that are regularly killed.
<P>
This is a matter of simple mathematics. In Worcestershire, 60 pups a year are born and 30 survive until the puppy show, so it is easy to work out that if that happens all over the country, there is a huge loss in dog's lives.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lembit &#214;pik </B>(Montgomeryshire): First, is the hon. Gentleman saying that all packs are treated in this way? Secondly, I have been waiting for a definition of ritual killing the phrase that he used to describe the process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I do not know whether all hunts conduct themselves in the same way, but I suspect that they do. Otherwise, if some hounds cannot keep up with the hunt, they will stray from the main pack pursuing the fox. The hunt explained to me that hounds are working dogs and are not treated like domestic pets. That is why I suggest that the practice is the same throughout the country.
<P>
On the hon. Gentleman's second point, I believe that it is a ritual. If, in the eyes of the hunt staff, a dog cannot keep up, it is disposed of, regardless of the fact that it might have another six years of life ahead of it. I wish to draw the Committee's attention to that sort of disregard for a dog's life.
<P>
The fact that more than 10,000 dogs are killed each year means that, even if all hunting stopped and nothing was done with the dogs, we would still be looking at two years worth of killing. However, that ignores the fundamental advantages of the Bill. We want to encourage drag hunting and we believe that dogs can be retrained for that. There is no reason why dogs following a scent cannot follow an artificial scent and still have all the pursuit and fun of the chase. Furthermore, where a scent has been laid for a drag hunt, it reduces the likelihood of dogs crossing railway lines and being electrocuted or crossing roads and being run over. It gives those dogs an extra few years of life, something that we should all be seeking.
<P>
The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has also made it clear that it will lead the way in rehousing hounds rather than seeing them killed as a result of the Bill. It wants to protect dogs' lives too, so there is no need to fear the huge loss of lives that my opponents argue would result. To those hunt kennels I say, "You know the writing is on the wall for your sport. You know it will not last. You know it will come to an end by the millennium. I urge you all now to stop breeding dogs in excessive numbers so that we will not have to rehouse so many dogs in the future. If you stop now, you will make an investment for the future."
<P>
<B>Mr. &#214;pik:</B> Can the hon. Gentleman confirm that the RSPCA's generous offer will stand even if the Bill falls?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before the hon. Gentleman responds, I remind him that he should address the Chair and not the wider audience outside the Room.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> That was done inadvertently, Mr. O'Hara. The offer to rehouse dogs is part of the RSPCA's raison d'\ketre and I suspect that the offer would hold. Certainly the RSPCA will lead the way in rehousing hounds rather than seeing them destroyed by hunts.
<P>
Subsection (5) makes it quite clear that searching for a wild mammal is also an offence. Searching takes place where the quarry has not yet been located and packs of dogs are sent into woodland or forest to pick up the scent of a wild mammal prior to the chase. The process of "coursing a wild mammal" also becomes an offence under new clause 3. Coursing is viewed as separate from hunting. We spent a considerable time examining coursing, particularly hare coursing. Most people would accept that it is a totally unnecessary, cruel and barbaric activity and we want to make sure that it is also caught by the legislation. Activities such as the Waterloo cup will quickly come to an end. Committee members have spoken about hare coursing and I do not want to go over the valuable contributions that they have made to the debate.
<P>
In summary, the new clause is an improvement on clause 1. It is far simpler and it restates the important point that hunting is an intentional activity. We do not need to include the word "intention" in the clause. If people hunt, they do so knowingly. When the Bill is enacted, they will knowingly engage in an activity that will have become a criminal offence; they will be caught and they will be stopped.
<P>
<B>Angela Smith </B>(Basildon): On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I listened with interest to what my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester said about the new clause. This may be an appropriate time to ask the Minister for his comments on the scope of the clause and his definition of the word "hunt".
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> Certainly. Dictionaries give different definitions, but the ninth edition of the Concise Oxford dictionary will serve our purposes. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Hunt. (a) to pursue and kill (wild animals or game) for sport or food; (b) to pursue on horseback and usually kill (a fox) using hounds; (c) use hounds (or a horse) for hunting or (d) (of an animal) chase (its prey)."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is as close to a working definition as we can find. Hon. Members who are thoroughly confused will be enlightened when they read the definition as reported in Hansard.
<P>
I shall explain how new clause 3 will work in the light of advice that I have been given. The ordinary meaning of "hunt" becomes clearer after reading the Concise Oxford dictionary definition. The reasoning behind new clause 3 includes fox hunting and activities that are part and parcel of the hunt: for example, sending terriers down a fox hole to force the fox out is part of that definition. The issue has concerned the Committee for several sittings and has been discussed from several perspectives.
<P>
Hunting, within the meaning of new clause 3, can take place on horseback or on foot. Indeed, as my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester said, subsection (5) of the new clause makes it clear by relating hunting to the word "searching" that it would include coursing it is specifically named in the new clause which would be an offence whether or not the quarry is found. The offence would include anyone setting out on one of[Mr. George Howarth] those activities, whether or not the quarry is identified, found and dealt with accordingly. That would get round the difficulty involved in intentionally, which we have debated at length. We now rely on two key words: hunting, the meaning of which is fairly clear, and searching, which gets round the difficulty of whether or not a quarry is found.
<P>
<B>Mr. &#214;pik:</B> First, why have the Government included terrier work in the definition? It seems to go beyond the intention merely to tidy up the Bill to make it legally workable, as the Minister said at a previous sitting.
<P>
Secondly, subsection (5) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"searching for or coursing a wild mammal."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
How does that interact with the part of the Bill that allows animals to be flushed out to shoot them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The hon. Gentleman is incorrect. Terrier work is included in clause 1(2), as originally drafted. The Government have not taken a policy decision on the matter. Our position, I repeat, is neutral. We are trying to make the policy of the Bill's promoters workable. That is the point of new clause 3 and our subsequent amendments. The Government have no opinion one way or the other about terrier work.
<P>
I think that the hon. Gentleman made another point 
<P>
<B>Mr. &#214;pik:</B> Subsection (5) refers to "searching". How does that relate to the part of the Bill that allows hounds to be used to flush out foxes to shoot them when they come out of cover?
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> That issue remains to be determined. New clause 1 is about the meaning of the offence and is the most intelligent way to proceed. The hon. Gentleman will have an opportunity to tease out more information. I know that there are particular concerns in parts of Wales. However, he will have to discuss the policy reasoning behind the Bill with others, as that is not a matter for me. My concern is only with the technical competence of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I should like to refer to amendments (a) and (b). First, however, I congratulate my hon. Friends the Minister and the Member for Worcester on sorting out clause 1. Some people outside the House have complained that that should have been done long ago, that it should not have been done in Committee, or that it should be done on Report. There is a procedure under which my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester could table a new clause on report. Effectively, that would give us a new Bill, which has been done with other Bills before. It would have the attraction of effectively curtailing debate on Report, but would not help us to make good legislation. What we have done may seem messy, but we are trying to get the Bill into a good form before it leaves the Committee, which is our job.
<P>
Having said that, we seem to have changed a Bill that set out to describe to ordinary people what is happening into a Bill that may, if people infringe it, have to be interpreted by judges. In principle, the House of Commons should make legislation that is easy to understand and not dependent on a build-up of case law. My hon. Friend's first attempt at the Bill was a good attempt at doing that, but it also demonstrates the disadvantages of that approach and suggests that relying on judge-made law might be the easy way out. Acceptance of one of my earlier amendments, which would have included intention in clause 1, might have provided a way forward, but, as it did not, the definition of hunt becomes crucial.
<P>
Had we not had the Minister's intervention following the earlier point of order, I would want to press him to confirm that everything included in amendment (a) 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"intentionally causes a dog to chase, pursue, harry, bait attack or injure" <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is covered by "hunt". That is important. If we are to have judge-made law, it is possible that judges will look at what was said in Parliament, although that does not often happen. It would be useful to have a firm yes on the record from the Minister.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> With the exception of "bait", all the matters mentioned by my hon. Friend and referred to in amendment (a) are covered by new clause 3. Baiting is already illegal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> That is reassuring and I shall not pursue amendment (a) on the understanding that all the points contained in it are covered.
<P>
I have a question for the Minister on amendment (b), which is not covered by clause 1. In giving neutral advice, the Minister may be reluctant to see my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester accept amendment (b), although it will be some time before we have to deal with it. It relates to the despicable practice, sometimes used by hunts, of blocking up the holes that foxes might escape into.
<P>
The vast majority of those who go hunting are keen to point out that they are law-abiding citizens, who will be disappointed if hunting stops, but will accept the law of the land. However, a small group of people may try to get around the law. They will want to continue activity that will have become illegal, just as some people go after badgers although that is illegal. In some areas, cock fighting still goes on and dogs are set to fight each other.
<P>
We must be sure not to apply the Bill only to the law abiding. We must make it absolutely clear that the law is designed to stop illegal activity. It is probably easier to detect the offence of blocking up a hole that the offence of someone going out to hunt.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Amendment (b) would add a new subsection (6) to new clause 3. It would create a separate specific offence for a person who
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"obstructs ... a structure or place used or likely to be used for shelter ... by a wild mammal."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That offence could take place on the day or the night before a person goes hunting. The difficulty is that it would be difficult for a prosecutor to prove that the blocking operation was intended purely for the purposes of hunting. A credible defence might be that it was simply being done for pest control. To prove in court that the person doing the blocking was doing so for hunting purposes would require proof that that person intended to go hunting. New clause 3 covers the offence of hunting, so we would end up back where we started. I know that my hon. Friend is trying to be as comprehensive as possible, as I have sat with him on many Bills and know that he always is. However, the amendment might cause more confusion that it resolves.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for that explanation, which is probably logical. However, can anything be done to prevent those who would organise an illegal hunt from blocking holes down which foxes might disappear? Will people have to be caught in the act of hunting? Is blocking up holes too difficult to detect?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> My hon. Friend is right to be concerned about this point, but to accept his amendment, we would have to agree that there could be no other legitimate purpose for blocking up a hole. However, there are legitimate purposes such as pest control and that is where the difficulty arises. I repeat that the best way to deal with the problem would be to rely on evidence that the blocking was being done for the purposes of hunting and was therefore covered by new clause 3.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I am satisfied with my hon. Friend's assurances on amendment (a), but shall give more thought to amendment (b). Perhaps I can come back with another amendment. Fortunately, we shall not vote on new clause 3 today or on amendments (a) and (b), so I can reserve my position for now. I can make a decision when you call a vote on them, Mr. O'Hara.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I cannot guarantee that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> I genuinely seek information. The Bill is now that of the parliamentary draftsman, not that of the hon. Member for Worcester, so I want to ask the Minister some questions.
<P>
Unless the Bill defines "hunt", the courts will await an interpretation of the word by, for example, the divisional court or the Court of Appeal. They will not be able to rely on Hansard or the Oxford English dictionary for a legal definition of "hunt". Therefore, the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish was correct to say that the courts would have to interpret "hunt".
<P>
My substantive questions relate to new clause 3(2), which uses the word, "permits". What does the Minister understand by the word in the context of the new clause? There is a lot of case law on the word. Clearly, hunting or a hunt can cover a considerable amount of ground in a day. The land will often be owned or occupied by several different people. Must owners or occupiers actively encourage the hunt to cross their land to be liable for prosecution under the new clause? If the hunt is technically trespassing, does the owner have to injunct the hunt from crossing the land to avoid prosecution? What does a landowner or occupier have to do to show that he has not permitted the hunt to cross the land? What is the mens rea of the offence?
<P>
I am genuinely confused by the parliamentary draftsman's use of the phrase,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"An owner or occupier of land".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Landowners sometimes have no day-to-day involvement with land management. In my constituency, various Oxford colleges have owned land since the Reformation. Will the masters and wardens of those colleges be up before the Oxford beak on a regular basis, and prosecuted for incidents that occur in their Tudor fiefdoms?
<P>
How will the Crown Prosecution Service decide whether to prosecute the owner or the occupier? Why does the new clause state, "owner or occupier"? Clearly, someone will have to choose. What does the word, "owner" add to "occupier"? In most cases, the occupier has control of the land. Frequently, tenancy arrangements expressly permit the occupier to decide whether to allow hunting on the land.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
In what circumstances will the owner be made criminally liable if there are civil contracts outstanding that relate to the occupation of land or to occupying rights over land? Will those civil rights be made void by the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that large areas of the countryside are leased? Almost all those leases specify who has the shooting and hunting rights.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> I am seeking guidance and clarification from the Minister. If the phrase "owner or occupier" is meant to encompass an interpretation of those leases, I do not understand why it should not simply be "occupier".
<P>
There is another difficulty. In many instances, when land is bought, it is conveyed in fee simple, under the Law of Property Act 1925, subject to the continuing rights of the lord of the manor to own both the mineral rights and the hunting rights over the land. There are many farming deeds with those rights still reserved to the lord of the manor. Will lords of the manor be up before the beaks, as well as the masters and wardens of many Oxford and Cambridge colleges? Will they have to renounce their rights under the 1925 Act, or will the Bill revoke those existing rights? That is the Minister's homework. Will he help the Committee by explaining those points?
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I do not know whether the hon. Member for Banbury (Mr. Baldry) is being mischievous.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> I am not being mischievous. My comments are genuine. If the Bill becomes law, at some stage at Banbury magistrates court, or some other court, solicitors and magistrates will have to interpret it. There are criminal sanctions attached to the Bill and it is important that we get the Bill right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> There is a fatal flaw in the hon. Gentleman's approach, which I will discuss in a moment. That is why I was not sure whether he sought the truth or was being mischievous.
<P>
The difficulty with his approach is that the courts generally rely on the accepted meaning of a word. If a definition is given in a Bill, it is because the proposers in this case, my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester feel that a definition is necessary to extend[Mr. Howarth]
the normal meaning of a word. We did not feel that it was necessary to do that when drafting the amendments, as we believed that in court the normal meaning of the words would describe what was intended.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The hon. Gentleman can intervene later.
<P>
We could have a debate about whether we should give a closer definition of the word "hunt" in the Bill. After taking advice, I do not think that it would be sensible to do so. It is better to rely on the accepted meaning of the word and I gave a definition. A judge and the average man or woman in the street would have a reasonable understanding of what is meant by the word "hunt", which can then be more closely related to a particular activity. When it is sensible to do so and the meaning of the words is clear, it is better to rely on the use of the words in new clause 3.
<P>
I shall respond to the points raised by the hon. Gentleman, but he needs to understand my position. Decisions on the policy of the Bill are rightly and properly those of my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester. With the exception of my vote on Second Reading, I have not expressed any opinion. The Government's position on the Bill is neutral and our commitment to allow a free vote was expressed on Second Reading.
<P>
My concern is only with the technical competence of the Bill and it would be wrong for me to discuss the policy implications raised by the hon. Gentleman. However, insofar as they have any bearing on the technical meaning of the Bill and the advice that I have received, I shall try to assist the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman referred to the use of the word "permit". It is not helpful at this stage to enter a long and convoluted debate on the meaning of the word, which is usually well understood. If the hon. Gentleman is seeking a substitute for the word "permit", I suggest "allow". They have basically the same meaning and there is no need for a major debate. There may sometimes be difficulties with the meaning of the word when pursuing a prosecution because the case will depend on proof of the landowner's intentions and so on, but that will be resolved by evidence, not by the Committee being too pernickety about the definition of the word "permit". Most people would agree that "allow" and "permit" are interchangeable.
<P>
The hon. Member for Banbury then moved to a discussion of the words "owner or occupier", which appear in the Bill drafted by my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester. We are back to the question of policy and technical considerations, but it is clear that my hon. Friend intended to cover anyone who owns or occupies a piece of land.
<P>
The hon. Member for Banbury then became involved in a complex argument on the position when an owner's or occupier's rights are superseded one by the other and what extent of collusion would be necessary. That will vary from place to place and from circumstance to circumstance, so it would not be helpful to have a lengthy debate on when the prerogative lies with the owner and when it lies with the occupier. When an offence is committed, the story will be told by the evidence, not by a lengthy definition in the Bill or from the Committee's proceedings. It will be for the courts to consider the evidence and decide whether someone is an owner or an occupier. There may be other claims to title of the land, and whether or not people with subsequent title were involved will depend on the circumstances at the time. We should not be so prescriptive as to try to cover that in amendments or in debate today.
<P>
I presume that the question of lords of the manor is covered by the definition of "owner or occupier". I can find no reason to believe that anything other than that would be the case and the situation that the hon. Gentleman described would not exempt them from the provisions.

<P>

<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. I do not think that my conduct in Committee or that of my hon. Friends could ever be described as mischievous. It would perhaps be helpful if he accepted that I was not in any way seeking to be mischievous and replied to me on that basis. As for my comments about the definition of the word "hunts", he has not contradicted the simple point I made. I did not suggest that there should necessarily be a full definition in the Bill. I said that, unless and until there was anything else in the Bill, it would be for the courts to interpret the word "hunts". The Minister may well be confident that they will interpret it in a commonsense way, but sooner or later it will be for the Court of Appeal or some other court and not for the Oxford English dictionary to determine that definition.
<P>
We have made such slow progress in Committee to date that we have not reached clause 1(3) of the Bill as presented by the hon. Member for Worcester. We have not debated the position of owners or occupiers. We are now debating a new clause in its entirety, effectively in a mini-stand part debate. Moreover, the Minister said last week in all his neutrality that the clause, as drafted by the hon. Member for Worcester, was defective; on behalf of the Government he has replaced it with a clause that he considers is not defective. We are therefore entitled to ask the Minister about the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman tell us when he tabled an amendment to the original clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> As the hon. Gentleman knows, the Committee has been making extremely slow progress on the Bill. It is fair to say that at our earlier sittings, various members of the Committee were simply wallpapering time. Things have moved on. When we reached the end of line 2 of clause 1, the Home Office clearly decided that the Committee was not going to get the Bill into what it would consider order. The Minister of State intervened with a Government new clause, drafted by parliamentary draftsman. We are entitled to an explanation of what the Government consider the clause to mean.
<P>
The words "permit" or "allow" have a legal usage. If I take out from the House of Commons Library a text book of words and phrases in legal usage, it will contain a lot of case law on such words, which I could use to help the court to arrive at a definition. I am seeking from the Minister some understanding of what he thinks that will mean in the context of hunting. Will it be sufficient that an owner or occupier has given express permission for a hunt to go across his land? For the mens rea of the offence, does he have to do something positive and tell the master of the hunt that the hunt is welcome to cross his land I accept that that may be a matter of evidence or, must he actively take steps to prevent the hunt from crossing his land? How does the Minister understand the word "permits" in that instance?
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I do not wish to be mischievous. Hunts can cover considerable distances in the course of the day and can clearly cross over the land of many different land owners and occupiers. Is it the case that unless a landowner expressly seeks to prevent a hunt from entering his land, he is allowing or permitting it on to his land? The clause is otiose. Landowners will be silent and we will have permissive trespass. If no express permission to trespass is given, when does that become "allow" or "permit"? It will be non-permissive trespass only if a landowner takes a specific step to prevent a hunt from entering his land. What is that step meant to be?
<P>
Many farmers need to understand the Government's proposals. The Minister may not have noticed, but the farming community is not enamoured with the Government. If they are going to criminalise the hunting and farming communities, he had better make it clear 
<P>
<B>Angela Smith:</B> I am interested in what the hon. Gentleman is saying about the farming community. Is he aware that every year hundreds of farmers try to keep hunts off their land, but are unable to do so? They are forced to go to the courts and take out private prosecutions for trespass. Does he not think that they will welcome the clause?
<H4><center>[Mr. Bowen Wells in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> The farming community will want to know on what matters they are at risk. If the hon. Lady's contention is right, it seems strange that the only way for a farmer to demonstrate that he has not permitted a hunt to cross his land is to seek an injunction or private prosecution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> Has the hon. Gentleman looked at clause 6? Is he happy with the definitions of "occupier" and "owner"? Perhaps he can press the Minister to amend the definitions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish and other members of the Committee think that I am trying to create mischief. I am not. The clause is, in effect, a Government clause. Government lawyers and parliamentary draftsmen must have put their minds to it. I am trying to understand the circumstances in which a landowner or an occupier will be prosecuted for an offence and why. Simply to say that in some instances the owner will be prosecuted and in others the occupier will be prosecuted will not reassure tenant farmers, corporate landowners or others.
<P>
I am surprised that the Minister's notes on clauses are not more complete and helpful. None of my questions is mischievous. It is a brave Minister who brushes aside the Law of Property Act 1925 as though it does not exist. We are unlikely to complete the debate on this clause today. Perhaps, he could talk to the parliamentary draftsman and parliamentary lawyers and give us a fuller explanation of the Government's understanding of the words "permit" and "owner or occupier" in our next sitting. A far wider group than those who go hunting is at risk. The whole of rural England is at risk. People are entitled to know on what basis they are going to be criminalised.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> The hon. Gentleman took great offence at my earlier remark, so I shall withdraw it he is just being otiose. He tried to lure me into a debate about the definition of the words "owner" and "occupier", but I do not think that would be helpful. For the Bill to emerge from Third Reading in a workable form, we must deal with the difficulties of defining the circumstances in which one would be deliberately involved in hunting. After much thought, I believe that the Bill will be improved if, as far as possible, we rely on the commonsense meanings of certain words "hunt" is the obvious example, and there are others.
<P>
If, at this stage, we were to imagine future case law under the Bill, we would get into difficulty because it is impossible to imagine every circumstance that may occur in any particular hunt on a certain course. That is impossible, as the hon. Member for Banbury, who has practised as a lawyer, will be well aware. That being the case, the word "permit", which I said was interchangeable with "allow", is a useful word that is well understood.
<P>
In each case, a court would have to decide, on the evidence, what transpired between the owner or occupier of the land and those who were hunting that led to them being on the land. However it is impossible to imagine every transaction or conversation that might take place and what would constitute permission. To ask us to exercise some enormous collective imagination in Committee is to ask us to do something that I have never witnessed in a Standing Committee nor in a Second Reading or Third Reading debate, or on Report. Because of the difficulty in following that route, it is better to rely on the ordinary meaning of the words. If the hon. Gentleman wants to know whether I intend to table any amendments to the use of the words "owner or occupier" in clause 6, my reply is that I have not received the necessary advice. However if it proves necessary, I shall do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> I do not wish to be mischievous, but the Minister has just made the point that I was trying to make. The Minister just said I am sure that it will be recorded in Hansard that what farmers would have to do to stop a hunt would be a matter of evidence. That takes the issue beyond a simple one of a farmer giving a hunt permission to cross his land. The Minister suggests that the word "permits" might put farmers in jeopardy unless there is evidence that they took action to prevent the hunt from crossing their land. If that is the[Mr. Baldry]
Government's suggestion, farmers and others will be entitled to know what they are expected to do to demonstrate to the court that they had not given permission to the hunt. What are they expected actively to have done to have stopped it? The structure of the Bill may put many land owners and occupiers in jeopardy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am not entirely clear what the hon. Gentleman is asking, but I shall try to be as helpful as possible. If a farmer gives permission for a hunt to take place on his land, he will have committed an offence under the clause if it ends up on the statute book. The hon. Gentleman seems to understand that, as he shows by a nod of his head. There is no implication of what signifies an act of consent on the part of the farmer. I have not said anything to the effect that farmers should put up extended fences or barbed wire, or do any such thing. It is not the Committee and it is certainly not for me, to define some action that a farmer should take to prevent a hunt from taking place. I am arguing not that an offending individual has simply ignored the fact that the organisers of a hunt are using his land, but that some sort of permission was given. Permission could be interpreted in a number of ways. The best way to deal with any potential ambiguity is for the prosecuting authority to determine whether an owner or occupier or indeed, both as there could be circumstances in which both parties are involved in giving some sort of permission has permitted the hunt to take place. If that were not clear from the facts, prosecution would be bound to fail. I cannot foresee all circumstances, but unless there were clear evidence that consent or permission was given, and that the owner, the occupier or both allowed or permitted the hunt to take place, what would be the point of taking out a prosecution? It would be pointless.
<P>
If the hon. Member for Banbury searches his heart and mind, he will acknowledge that in such circumstances, it is better to rely on the ordinary meaning of those words as they would be understood by prosecuting authorities in a court of law and by most common-sense people who considered whether to get involved in a hunt or whether to give permission or consent to allow a hunt to go across any land in which they have an interest. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will accept that that is the most common-sense way to approach the problem.

<P>

<B>Mr. &#214;pik:</B> I should like to refer to new clause 3 in the context of old clause 5 to ensure that I understand clearly the relationship between them. I agree that one of the most dangerous aspects of the Bill is that it may create vagaries that could ultimately lead to prosecutions of, primarily, countryfolk, who have acted in good faith, but who are judged criminals by a court of law. I intend to examine the five subsections to ensure that I have a clear understanding that old clause 5 still stands.
<P>
New clause 3(2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"An owner or occupier of land commits an offence if he permits another person to enter or use that land to hunt in contravention of subsection (1)."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Nevertheless, I assume that the definitions of exemptions in paragraphs (a) to (e) of subsection (2) of clause 5 still stand.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> Would it help the hon. Gentleman to know that new clause 3 replaces clause 5(1)?
<P>
<B>Mr. &#214;pik:</B> That much is helpful. The hon. Member for Worcester has reassured me that the conditions under clause 5(2) still stand. I assume that that is the correct understanding of the Bill; I am looking for a nod or a wink to be absolutely clear 
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The conditions stand at present, bearing in mind the fact that there may well be further amendments from the Home Office parliamentary counsel.
<P>
<B>Mr. &#214;pik:</B> On that assumption, it seems from new clause 3(2) that the exemptions that currently apply under clause 5 would stand. New clause 3(3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The owner or keeper of a dog commits an offence if he permits another person to use the dog to hunt in contravention of subsection (1)."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I presume that if the owner or keeper of the dog has acted in good faith and believed that the user of the dog intended to pursue one of the activities exempted under clause 5, the owner or keeper would not be subject to prosecution. New clause 3(4) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is an offence to own or keep two or more dogs for the purposes of their being used to hunt in contravention of subsection (1)."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Again, I presume that it would be acceptable to keep a pack, for example, to flush out a wild mammal as permitted under clause 5(2)(c) or for drag hunting under clause 5(2)(e). New clause 3(5) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In this Act a reference to hunting a wild mammal includes a reference to searching for or coursing a wild mammal."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I presume, again, that the searching for would not overrule the exemption under clause 5(2)(c) that allows the flushing out of a wild mammal from cover. If that is the correct understanding it would imply to me that we must be absolutely clear that new clause 3 fits in the context of the exemptions that are already in the Bill. I do not want to start a debate about which parts of that I agree or disagree with that is not the purpose of our current discussions. I just want to be absolutely clear that my understanding is correct, so that when we come to debate those points we are all speaking with the same assumptions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> It depends upon any changes that the Home Office advises, but in principle the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire's understanding is correct.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> In relation to the Minister's response to the questions raised by the hon. Member for Banbury about the words "permits" and "owner or occupier", I was not totally convinced by the Minister's answer to the question about "permits". When he considers clause 5, I hope that he finds it worthwhile to come up with a definition of "permits" or a defence of its use. The Minister was talking about hunting with a pack of hounds. It would be fairly easy to judge whether such an activity was taking place on a person's land and whether or not that person had encouraged that activity.
<P>
I remind the Minister that the Bill is also intended to deal with people hunting hares an activity that is much more difficult to address. If someone has three dogs, and takes them along a public footpath, does a landowner have to do anything to ensure that those dogs are not let off the lead or allowed to chase hares? We may need to return to that question, but we should give some thought to these messier issues. The activity that I have described is quite distinct from horses and hounds charging across the countryside, and although it would be illegal under the legislation, it may well continue.
<P>
Question put and negatived.

<P>
Clause 1 disagreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> Given the circumstances and while awaiting further clarification from the Home Office, I beg to move that further consideration be now adjourned.
