[Continuation from column 488]
<P>
<H5>8.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome kindly said that he did not disagree with the purpose of the clause; I think that, as always, he was trying to be helpful.
<P>
In the context of directions made for the purposes of fire prevention, amendment No. 478 would remove any requirement for the risk of fire to have arisen because of exceptional weather conditions. The hon. Gentleman suggested that conditions of high fire risk can occur independently of exceptional weather—for example, peat moors may remain vulnerable to the outbreak of fire long after the end of a drought. However, the cause of the high fire risk would remain the exceptional weather, even if those conditions no longer prevailed. The relevant authority would therefore still be able to make a direction if it were necessary for the purpose of fire prevention.
<P>
In other circumstances, the risk of fire may not arise in exceptional weather conditions. For instance, some types of vegetative cover may be flammable even in an ordinary summer. Such circumstances are not exceptional. By definition, they are not caused by unusual weather conditions; they are part of the normal fabric of the open countryside. I am not satisfied that they give rise to sufficient reason to restrict access to the land.
<P>
Referring to amendment No. 479, the hon. Gentleman said that the use of the word ``done'' was ambiguous and might not include contemporary operations. I am advised that the Bill does apply to contemporary operations.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I agree that ``done'' must include that which is contemporaneous. My objection was that it could also include that which is historic, whereas the wording that I suggest makes it absolutely clear that we are talking about operations that take place at the time of the restriction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I have been advised that such an eventuality will be covered by the Bill. Indeed, all reasonable possibilities are covered. No real benefits would flow from amendment No. 479. If the hon. Gentleman reads the clause again, he may agree with me.
<P>
Amendment No. 480 has the opposite effect to amendment No. 479, in that it opens up the scope for directions to be made under paragraph (b) of subsection (l). It allows for closures or restrictions because of exceptional prevailing conditions, whether or not they relate to the weather. Clause 29 provides for exclusion or restriction of access in an emergency. It will allow the Secretary of State to make regulations providing for directions in respect of emergencies for up to three months. I refer the hon. Gentleman also to clause 2(3), which preserves the effect of any orders made by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food under the Plant and Animal Health Acts if there is an outbreak of a virulent disease. We do not think that we need go any further than that. It is for members of the public to exercise caution and to take responsibility for their own safety. For those reasons, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that there is no need for the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for his comments. However, he did not quite address the issue of whether the hot, dry summers that can prompt exclusion on the grounds of fire safety can be construed as exceptional if they happen every year. That was my only problem with the provision, and I wanted to ensure that the Bill dealt with it. I shall not go to the wall on amendment No. 479 and the construction put on the word ``done''. The Under-Secretary asked me to read the clause and told me that I would then realise the truth of his remarks. I did read the clause, which is why I tabled an amendment and also why it would not be unreasonable to assume that I did not agree with the construction put on the word in question.
<P>
In respect of amendment No. 480, I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for drawing attention to a clause 2 provision that provides the answer in relation to animal health restrictions. I hope that clause 29, which relates to emergencies, deals with the range of possibilities that I had in mind when I tabled the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> The Under-Secretary assures me that it does, and I am quite happy to accept that assurance. I shall, however, reflect on the provision further and endeavour to identify any circumstances that would not constitute an emergency but would pose a danger to public health and merit exclusion. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Amendments made: No. 443, in page 13, line 15, leave out `access'.
<P>
No. 444, in page 13, line 23, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5) Where an application under this section relates to land which is not access land at the time when the application is made, the relevant authority shall not give a direction under this section unless they are satisfied that it is likely that the land will be access land during all or part of the period to which the application relates.'.—[Mr. Meacher.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am sorry to take up the Committee's time, but I do not think that the Under-Secretary answered my questions on the previous group of amendments. I expressed concern about the application of subsection (4) to restrictions on fire made previously. I asked on what grounds the relevant authority would take into account the extent to which an applicant had exercised or proposed to exercise rights under clause 21, which appears to be entirely irrelevant to whether an exceptional fire risk has developed over time. Will the Under-Secretary comment on that issue?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I regret that I shall have to write to the hon. Gentleman. I do not perceive any problem, but I shall reflect on the matter. If the hon. Gentleman helps me to understand what he thinks the problem is, I may be able to help him on the answer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> The problem is simply this: subsection (4) requires the relevant authority to take into account the degree to which the owner or user of the land has used the discretionary powers of closure contained in clause 21. That does not seem a relevant consideration in respect of fire risk due to exceptional weather. Why is such qualification necessary? It appears to be nonsense.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I cannot tell the hon. Gentleman why that qualification sits within the clause, and I agree that it is unreasonable in the circumstances that he describes. I am sure that the relevant authority would not take into account the extent to which the optional days had been used in relation to the potential for a natural hazard such as fire. I am sure that that would not count against—[Interruption.] Yes, the relevant body could take into account the use of the 28-day period, but if it could not foresee the emergency, it would not be expected to place much—if any—weight on the issue. The hon. Gentleman is as well informed as I am on this matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> Is the Under-Secretary asking me to accept that the relevant authority will be required to take account of something that will be nugatory because no one can foresee the exceptional circumstances?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> No. It is a consideration. It is reasonable to expect land that has to be closed as a result of exceptional weather conditions not to be counted as part of the 28 days. It would be unreasonable for the relevant authority to hold that closure against the applicant.
<P>
I am told that clause 23(4) applies to clause 23(1)(b), which is foreseeable, as well as clause 23(1)(a)—let that stand on the record.
<P>
Question put, and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 23, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 24</center></H4>
<H4><center>Nature conservation and heritage preservation</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 335, in page 13, line 24, after `direction', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, on an application made by a person interested in any access land, or by the relevant advisory body, or otherwise,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 336, in clause 28, page 16, line 14, leave out `or 23' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, 23 or 24'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 338, in clause 28, page 16, line 19, after `applicant', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`in writing'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 337, in clause 28, page 16, line 28, leave out `or 23' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, 23 or 24'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I hope that the amendments produce greater elucidation than we received on the previous clause.
<P>
It is a particular pleasure to reach the clause 24. Its purpose is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Nature conservation and heritage preservation,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which many of us believe should be the main purpose of the Bill. It is a relief to be able to debate such matters. The clause introduces an important safeguard for wildlife and for heritage conservation of features found on open country. Wildlife and heritage features might be damaged by excessive or over-concentrated public access. At sensitive times or at sensitive locations, sites might be disturbed by a level of use that would not be enough to disrupt land management, which we discussed in our debate on clause 22. Clause 24, therefore, deals with more sensitive matters. For example, ground-nesting birds are known to be intolerant of disturbance, especially by dogs. Even with the Minister's oft-repeated point that we are simply talking about people who walk their dogs across open land, that activity could disrupt wildlife preservation.
<P>
I shall be interested to hear the Minister's response on the following issues. He will be aware that the Conservation (Natural Habitats, etc.) Regulations 1994 implement the EU habitats directive and the birds directive. They charge the competent authorities, which include the national park authorities and the countryside bodies, with ensuring that their consents will not have significant effects on the integrity of sites notified as special areas of conservation in the habitats directive or special protection areas in the birds directive.
<P>
That could be a broad requirement. The directives and regulations do not define significant effect, but Environment Agency guidance interprets it as an impact that excludes merely trivial or inconsequential effects. I would be grateful for clarification from the Minister on the way in which he would guide the relevant authorities to grant restrictions or closures to the right of access in the light of the legislative precedents already in place. Does he envisage such restrictions being commonplace? When we assess the effect of this potentially important clause, it is important for us to consider how often it will be invoked and for us to deal with the specific amendments tabled by me and my hon. Friends.
<P>
The express purpose of the provision is the protection of nature and the heritage. The important mechanism should be facilitated in every possible way. Amendment No. 335, to which amendments Nos. 336 and 337 are consequential with regard to clause 28, would protect the rights of all those involved to draw the relevant authority's attention to the needs of an area regarding closure or restriction for the purpose of protecting nature or the heritage. To leave the measure to the relevant authority, as the clause does, could lead to unintentional oversights. Such oversights could be insured against by the involvement of landowners, managers and others with an interest in the land. The Minister will surely agree that many of those people are likely to be the most sensitive to the needs of an area in terms of nature and heritage conservation.
<P>
The purpose of amendment No. 335 and the consequential amendments Nos. 336 and 377 is to widen the scope of the existing protection and to make it more likely that it would be effective in defending nature and heritage features. We all want to see them protected. I hope that the amendments are helpful to the Government's aim.
<P>
The one amendment that I have not discussed is amendment No. 338, which simply says that, if an applicant has an appeal refused, the response should come in writing. I am sure that the Minister would agree that that would be a simple courtesy, which should be a normal part of the act of any public body.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will take the amendments in the spirit in which they are offered. We agree with the Government that clause 24 provides an important set of protective measures for our natural environment and heritage. We simply seek to strengthen them by ensuring that landowners and other with an interest in the land on which sensitive features are situated can play a role in the features' protection.

<P>

<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I shall add briefly to what has already been said. Various regulations have been referred to. Does the Minister envisage the exceptions being commonplace? How does he see the restrictions being advanced?
<P>
Clause 24 makes no explicit provision for relevant authorities to have regard to applications made by the owner or others with an interest in the land for restrictions or exclusions to protect and enhance nature conservation. According to the Countryside Agency, clause 24 (2)(c)(i)
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>is unhelpfully restrictive as it stands, in limiting the determination to owners of land. There will sometimes be occupiers other than the owner who will be better placed to determine a period of restriction, for example, a voluntary conservation society with a long term lease. We would prefer the model used in clause 23 and therefore recommend replacing 24 (2)(c)(i) with ``determined by the relevant advisory body or any specified person in accordance with the direction''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sure that the Minister will have received notification of the agency's views.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> If the hon. Gentleman looked at amendment No. 481, which I tabled, he would find those words used. It will be considered in the next group.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> Oh joy. If it is not a bit late, I shall contain my remarks.
<P>
The point is made. The various habitat directives and regulations need to be interpreted and brought into effect. I am sure that the Minister will respond in due course, either to me or to the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome.
<P>
Finally, if the relevant authorities—the countryside bodies or Departments—wished to promote or to seek restrictions, how would they go about it? What is the mechanism? Those are my main points, and I shall leave further debate on clause 24 to others more competent to deal with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The hon. Member for Ashford said in a throwaway remark at the start of his comments that the clause is what the Bill should be about. I note that part III, covering clauses 62 to 67, is explicitly about SSSIs and the protection of wildlife. We accord great significance to that. That is not to say that other aspects of dealing with the countryside are not important and relevant. Nor is it to say that the statutory right of access and the amendment and modernisation of rights of way are not equally important.
<P>
As the hon. Gentleman rightly said—he tabled them—amendments Nos. 335 to 337 would amend clause 24 to provide a specific right of application for a direction in the interest of nature conservation and heritage preservation. They would also require consequential amendments to clause 28 to ensure a right of appeal against an adverse decision on the application. It is correct to say that there is no provision for an application to be made under clause 24. The absence of such a provision, however, does not prevent the owner of the land or anyone else interested in it from asking the relevant authority for a direction to be made. Relevant authorities will be obliged to give such a request reasonable consideration.
<P>
In the same way, if it appeared to the relevant advisory body—whether on its own initiative or in response to comments received—that the relevant authority should make a direction under clause 24 in respect of an area of land, it may make representations to the relevant authority. The authority will be obliged to have regard to the body's advice when considering whether to give a direction. There is no need for a special right of application for either the owner or the relevant advisory body.
<P>
The purpose of clause 24 is to protect the nature or heritage conservation interest of the land, in the context of the statutory right of access. The key role will belong to the relevant advisory bodies, which will give advice to the relevant authority. Whether a proposal for a direction under clause 24 originates with the owner, the advisory body, another person with an interest or a third party, chapter II provides the advisory body with a right of referral to the Secretary of State or to the National Assembly for Wales if the relevant authority declines to issue a determination in accordance with the advice. The right of referral under clause 27 will be sufficient to protect wildlife where, for example, the Countryside Agency and English Nature are unable to agree on how access to a sensitive habitat should be reconciled with its conservation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> It may be a misreading of the Bill—I would be grateful if the Minister would correct me if it is—but he has just repeated what he said to the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy—that third parties may apply under the clause. However, as I understand it, clause 24 applies to clause 2(1) and to narrowly defined ownership, which we have already discussed, so will third parties be able to apply under the clause or not?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> My view is that they will, but my point is that it does not matter where the application comes from. The important point is that, wherever it comes from, chapter II provides for a right of referral to the Secretary of State. However the application is originated, that right of referral exists if the relevant authority declines to issue a determination in accordance with its advice. I am advised that there is no formal right of application for third parties—congratulations again to the hon. Gentleman—but anyone can make representations in favour of a direction. That approach underlies much of the Bill; formal channels do not have to exist for representations to be made. There is nothing to prevent people from writing letters, speaking to people on the phone, meeting them and making representations.
<P>
The hon. Members for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy and for Ashford asked me how widely the application for a direction for the purposes of nature conservation is likely to be used. The answer is as often as necessary, although I cannot say how often that is likely to be. If it is regularly necessary, I would strongly favour such representations being made. The relevant authorities will have to take into account their duties under the habitats directive and habitats regulations. On the whole, we do not expect access to give rise to any significant adverse effects. As my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and I have repeatedly said, 1.5 million acres are already subject to de facto or actual access, which has not proved to be a problem. However, where there is a risk that it will cause a problem, the relevant authorities will consider making any necessary direction under clause 24. If necessary, the Secretary of State will be able to reverse the relevant authorities' decision. That provides a strong back-up to safeguard nature conservation.
<P>
On a final point, which is not intended to be flippant, amendment No. 338 would require relevant authorities to notify applicants specifically in writing of the reasons for a decision not to act in accordance with the application. We would certainly expect, at least for the present, that the relevant authorities should give their reasons in writing. However, the Electronic Communications Bill currently being considered in another place is intended to facilitate communications in electronic form as well as by written means. The amendment would not afford that flexibility and might require an order to be made under that Bill to allow relevant authorities to use e-mail as well as snail mail—[Interruption.] I am glad that someone is listening—to advise applicants of the reasons for an adverse decision. The current form of wording in clause 28 allows for flexibility, and, therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendment. I hope that I have persuaded Opposition Members that I am as concerned as they are to ensure full and adequate protection for wildlife and nature conservation. We believe that the Bill will achieve that. For that reason, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<H5>9 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The problem with the Minister's explanation is that everything is in a self-contained loop and contained within the public sector. Although he thinks that it is satisfactory for bodies whose executives are appointed by the Secretary of State to make recommendations, advise each other and then appeal to the Secretary of State, all that will take place inside a loop from which many people who own and manage land will feel excluded. That is the problem with the Minister's comfortable-sounding explanation. As he will be aware, the organisations that represent many of those at the sharp end who will be most concerned about this—the National Farmers Union and Country Landowners Association—support the amendments and will not be happy with the Minister's explanation.
<P>
On my reading of clause 27 and line 40 on page 15, only the relevant advisory body will be able to refer another body for appeal. That starkly illustrates the problem; decisions will be taken by a public body, the only right of appeal will be to the Secretary of State and only the bodies themselves will be able to appeal. That process will not seem satisfactory to those people who are outside the loop, nor will it lead to the best conservation. The amendments would merely increase the number of people who could take steps to ensure that wildlife and heritage conservation is carried out appropriately. It seems extraordinary that the Minister wishes to resist that process.
<P>
On the habitats and birds directive, the Minister said that he hopes that as many appeals as possible will be made. That is inadequate. It is important to know whether that will be a routine aspect or something that will happen only in extremis. It is barely credible that, as the Bill was prepared, discussions did not take place about whether that would be an important daily, weekly or monthly occurrence or whether the provision was included to deal with extreme circumstances. Clearly the Minister cannot say exactly how often it will happen, but he could say whether it is intended to be an emergency or a normal power.
<P>
On his response about electronic communications, I dare say that e-mail will be slightly preferable to a phone call. Even so, as Committee members whose constituents have dealt with organisations such as the Child Support Agency will know, the status of something in writing, which can be shown to a public official, is an important weapon and symbol for people who disagree with public authorities. However much we welcome the onset of the electronic revolution, when it comes to communications between individuals and public bodies, a simple piece of paper that explains their actions, against which those actions can be tested, is extremely useful. Therefore, I very much regret the Minister's response, but perhaps we can return to the issue.

<P>

<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> If the hon. Gentleman is moving to a rousing peroration, perhaps I can pre-empt him. He is being uncharacteristically unfair in suggesting that this is a public sector stitch-up; it patently is not. If a temporary closure is suggested for the purpose of protecting wildlife, the first port of call in the search for agreement would be the local access forum. That is outside the public sector; it is a voluntary body and there is no reason why agreement should not be reached. Such a decision would be formally passed to the Countryside Agency, which I am sure would support it.
<P>
I have already said that not only the public sector or persons within it can initiate representations if agreement is not reached. I said that there is nothing to stop the landowner or anyone else interested in the land asking the relevant authority to make a direction, and that serious consideration would have to be given to such requests. It is true, however, that only the advisory body has a right of referral to the Secretary of State. Frankly, we cannot have disaffected individuals flinging off referrals to the Secretary of State for a formal decision on whether or not he agrees with a relevant body. It has to be done on a proper, filtered basis, which is what we propose; but there is no question of it being limited only to the public sector.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That was a rather lengthy intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am sorry, Mr. Malins.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> But it was quite helpful. The distinction that the right hon. Gentleman draws between a formal right of appeal and the right to representation is important. He said that I was being unfair, but I merely reflect the view, widely held among representative bodies, that many people may find themselves at the wrong end of the process. The Minister may think that being able to make representations is enough. However, he seems to think that individuals should not disturb the Secretary of State with such appeals. We know that Secretaries of State are busy people, and we would not wish them to have to deal with the problems of all those affected by the legislation that they put through the House, but it might be good for them if they had to do so occasionally.
<P>
We may wish to return to the matter. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 445, in page 13, line 25, leave out `access'.—[Mr. Meacher.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Prentice:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 461, in page 13, line 33, leave out `the owner of the land or'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 481, in page 13, line 33, leave out `owner of the land or the relevant advisory body' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`relevant advisory body or any specified person'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Prentice:</B> I can gallop through the amendment, which was anticipated by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy. Some organisations and groups are worried that the owner of land can promote a closure for the purposes of nature conservation. It is not necessary. In the briefings that it has circulated to members of the Committee, the Countryside Agency makes exactly that point; it says that the provision is unhelpfully restrictive. I therefore propose that the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`the owner of the land'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
be struck out.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> Amendment No. 481 does not entirely strike out the owner of the land, but would replace him with a ``specified person''. As the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy pointed out in a previous debate, that is the form of words used in clause 23. I am pleased to have received his support.
<P>
It seems a retrograde step to reintroduce the concept of owner. There is no obvious reason why the period should be determined by the owner rather than others with a primary interest in the land. For instance, a non-governmental organisation involved with environmental or conservation matters may be well versed in the subject; perhaps it should have a significant voice in the discussions on the period. It might have a lease on the land or be a tenant, but under those circumstances, it would not be covered by the clause. However, an owner, who might be an owner in title only because he merely has a fleeting knowledge of the land, is specified. It would be better to refer to a specified person, which is the form of words used in clause 23. Will the Minister say why he has replaced that with ``the owner''?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I shall try to do just that. The amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle and the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome are valuable, but there is a difference between them. My hon. Friend's amendment would remove the anomaly that the period of effect of a direction could be determined by the owner of the land. He is concerned that vesting it in the owner of the land would place too much responsibility on someone who might have an antipathy to public access. That is well understood, but although I agree with my hon. Friend's motive, his amendment would leave a vacuum because he does not suggest an alternative.
<P>
The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome goes further. For that reason, I prefer his amendment. It would allow any person to be appointed by the relevant authority to implement a direction under clause 24 in accordance with the terms of the direction. Subsection (2)(c)(i) allows the owner to close the land when a rare plant begins to flower or when a particular species of bird begins to arrive on site for a length of time that would have been specified in the direction. The amendment would allow the relevant authority to appoint any person to fulfil that function. It could appoint a local conservation body or a wildlife trust with a short-term lease for that purpose instead of the owner or the tenant. It would preserve the power for the relevant authority to appoint the relevant advisory body to that role.
<P>
I have a lot of sympathy with the amendment. The relevant authority should have wider discretion to appoint any fit person to determine the precise dates of an exclusion or restriction in accordance with the terms of the direction. We are happy to accept the principle of the amendment and propose to table a suitable amendment on Report.
<P>
That is probably as far as I should go at this hour—my hon. Friend the Whip concurs. I agree with the motives behind both amendments, but the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome is preferable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The Minister and his hon. Friends, having spent most of their time in Committee denigrating landowners by saying that they would want to restrict access, are now trying to replace the role of the landowner to restrict access to land with a relevant body. Why does the Minister accept the principle behind amendment No. 481?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I should like to say, considering the general tone of the Committee, that the hon. Gentleman is uncharacteristically wrong in suggesting that Labour Members have denigrated landowners. I have been present for every moment of the Committee, and such denigration has been virtually absent. The hon. Gentleman's remarks give me the opportunity to pay tribute to my hon. Friends for their positive and constructive comments.
<P>
<H5>9.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asks why I am accepting the thrust of amendment No. 481. I am doing so because somebody has to decide the period of effect of a direction with regard to a temporary closure. Most landowners will be perfectly scrupulous, but some might seek to take advantage if responsibility for such a decision were left with them. It is therefore reasonable to ensure that there is an opportunity to vest the power in a third party. That is the purpose of the provision, which is not an anti-landowner measure, but merely a sensible and constructive way of ensuring a fair response. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not about to challenge me, as I am doing my best to support him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> Far from it. I thank the Minister for his positive and constructive attitude to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prentice:</B> As the Minister has assured us that he will table amendments on Report to deal with the point made by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 287, in page 13, line 38, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) the purpose of protecting any dry stone wall,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider amendment No. 288, in page 13, line 38, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) the purpose of protecting the quality of any water,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I trust that these amendments will be less contentious than those considered previously. If the Minister thinks that allowing everybody except landowners to take decisions about closure is not a denigrating, anti-landowner policy, he has moved to a different planet.
<P>
The amendments seek to probe the meaning of the protections contained in the clause. In particular, they question the meaning of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the purpose of conserving flora, fauna or geological or physiographical features of the land in question,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and seek to define more closely one or two such aspects of such protection. They do so in the hope of eliciting from Ministers information on whether the clause will protect the features to which they refer.
<P>
The Committee has had several good debates on the importance of dry stone walls, which are often as much a feature of the countryside as hedges. I am sure that Committee members want to protect dry stone walls in the same way that they want to protect hedgerows, so they may agree that the protections afforded by the clause should be extended to include them. Ministers will know that dry stone walls are prime pickings of thieves and vandals and may need protection. Does the Minister believe that the purpose of protecting a dry stone wall should be a specific reason for exclusion, or that restriction of access is covered by the clause? If not, amendment No. 287 should be agreed to, or a similar amendment tabled. Amendment No. 288 would introduce the purpose of protecting the quality of water. Does the Minister think that the clause provides those protections? If it does not, will the Government consider accepting the amendments, which deal with important aspects of protection that should be included in the Bill? In the Minister's mind, they may be included; if they are, will he clarify the way in which the provisions cover them?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am tempted to pick up on the throwaway remarks that have been dropped into the debate by Opposition Front-Bench Members, but I do not want to make too much of them. I insist that the provision is not based on any antagonism to landowners. It is simply a recognition of the possibility of conflict of interest. I hope that the hon. Member for Ashford will understand that decisions should be taken, as far as possible, by people who do not have a vested interest in the outcome. That is the only point that I am making.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The Minister is not so much resolving a conflict of interest as saying, as he did in relation to the amendments previously considered, that only landowners are the only people who cannot have an impact on a decision. That is a straightforwardly anti-landowner attitude.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> We are beginning to wear thin your tolerance and patience, Mr. Molins.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the discussion will now centre on the amendments. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The amendments, which I take seriously, would introduce new criteria for the making of directions under the clause for the purposes of protecting dry stone walls and the quality of any water. Although those considerations are important, we do not share the Opposition's view that the new right of access will cause special threats to them. That is just the sort of underlying innuendo that I find difficult to accept. We have explained that damage to walls and pollution of water will remain criminal offences, and the Bill ensures that such offences will also deprive walkers of their right of access.
<P>
Only rarely will the presence of walkers on land threaten water quality. All public water supplies are subject to thorough treatment. Even where dwellings rely on untreated water supplies source from open ground, we have provided that the right of open-air recreation does not include a right to bathe, as I have mentioned several times.
<P>
I do not want to appear dismissive of the scenarios which were painted—slightly luridly—by Opposition Members, who seem to imagine Cotswold walls crumbling under the onslaught of hordes of ill-disciplined walkers. Indeed, we have heard today about the prime pickings for vandals and thieves. Let me offer some reassurance. If problems such as those described arise—I do not for one moment expect them to—it will be open to affected parties to seek restrictions on the right of access by means of directions under clause 22 to secure the effective management of land. They might also want to seek agreement with access authorities under chapter III for the construction of new means of access.
<P>
The amendments are therefore unnecessary in practice, but I am no less concerned than the hon. Gentleman that dry stone walls and the quality of water should be protected. They are already protected by the Bill and the hon. Gentleman exaggerates the threat to them. For those reasons, I hope that he will ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Like the Minister, I hope that all will be peaceful and calm, although it has been suggested to me that, if he sees the price paid in garden centres for raw materials used in the construction of dry stone walls, he will know the temptations that already present themselves to thieves. I am sure that people whose main interest in life is walking will not be minded to give way to such temptations, but other people will find that the Bill puts them more easily in their way. The Minister has assured us that the protections that we seek are already in place. Time will tell, and we shall see whether that is true. For now, I accept his reassurance, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 482, in page 15, line 29, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and shall report to Parliament.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause deals with defence and national security. No one wishes to prejudice our defence or national security interests, but the suspicion is that a lot of land has been held for a long time by the Ministry of Defence on the pretext—genuine or otherwise—of defence or national security. That may or may not have been justified by the use to which that land has been put.
<P>
The clause makes no provision for the Secretary of State to justify the closure of land except for the overriding purpose of defence or national security. No level of magnitude is required, nor is he required to consult before making such a direction. It is therefore appropriate to put a long stop in place. When a permanent or quasi-permanent closure is directed, which is the purpose of subsection (4), Parliament should know when the matter is being reviewed and whether a specific piece of land has been deemed unsuitable for public access.
<P>
I know that the military takes its responsibilities seriously. Clearly, some areas are dangerous for civilians even in normal circumstances. However, there is some evidence that the Ministry is taking its countryside interests rather more seriously than it once did. I was interested to read in press reports that all soldiers will in future carry a guide to the countryside in their tunic pockets, saying what they should and should not be doing in it. I asked the MOD for a copy, and found that it applies only to the Salisbury plain training area. However, it is a useful little document that advises soldiers not to dig in or drive over ancient monuments. It is at least a start that soldiers should consider such responsibilities.
<P>
The MOD's natural inclination is to retain land that it owns for its exclusive use. Often without reason, it wishes to avoid allowing public access to it. The only bulwark that the Bill provides against that is the Secretary of State's discretion. I have no argument with that. It is appropriate, in consultation with his colleagues in other Departments, that he should make such decisions. However, those decisions should be subject to public scrutiny and open to challenge. What I suggest at least provides Parliament with the opportunity of knowing what is being decided; if appropriate, hon. Members will be able to raise objections and to have their say.
<P>
<H5>9.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> As the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome says, clause 26 gives power to the Secretary of State to restrict access where he considers that necessary for the purposes of defence or national security. The nature of military training is such that it might be necessary to exclude or to restrict public access on a long-term or annually recurring basis or, in some cases, indefinitely.
<P>
Where such closures or restrictions are long term, the Government recognise that it is important to have in place a review mechanism. That is why we have built into the Bill a duty on the Secretary of State to review long-term closures every five years. The duty provides the right balance between allowing scope for flexibility and avoiding unnecessary bureaucracy. The hon. Gentleman's amendment sought to add to the duty so that the Secretary of State, on reviewing long-term closures, would need to report his conclusions to Parliament.
<P>
I came prepared to argue against the amendment, but I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman's points. Although I cannot give him any undertakings, I am prepared to take the amendment away and to consider it. I would be grateful if he would seek to withdraw it on that basis.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I seem to be on what is vulgarly called a roll. That being the case, I have no wish to upset the tenor of the Committee. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gareth Thomas </B>(Clwyd, West): I should like to explore issues arising from the drafting of clause 28, which has caused me and perhaps other hon. Members puzzlement.
<P>
The clause is deficient in that it is unbalanced. It is unbalanced because it does not sufficiently take into account a proper balance regarding the interests of the users of land as defined by clause 41. We know from debates on clauses 6 and 7 that interest in land is defined legalistically to encompass those with a strict legal estate—a licence or tenancy in land—or sporting rights, but not those exercising recreational access. Although there is a right of appeal against a refusal to give appropriate directions under clauses 22 and 23 for those with an interest in land, as narrowly defined by the Bill, there is no corresponding and balancing right of appeal for those wishing to exercise recreational access under clause 2(1).
<P>
I wish simply to draw the attention of my hon. Friend the Minister to the concern expressed by many involved in the area, not least the Ramblers Association and the British Mountaineering Council. Those organisations put the case well. A document that the British Mountaineering Council has helpfully provided says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Experience clearly shows that restrictions—<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Malins. Is it in order to quote from a document that has not been circulated to all members of the Committee?
<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Thomas:</B> I shall continue.
<P>
The letter says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Experience clearly shows that restrictions—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
as set out in clauses 22 and 23 to deal with land management and the avoidance of danger and fire—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>are most effective where representatives from all interest groups have been involved in negotiation. The absence of involvement for recreational users' representatives will undermine the effectiveness of restrictions and— <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the important word—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>respect for the process which has led to their application. For recreational users' representative bodies to have to resort to judicial review is clearly inappropriate.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Why has no corresponding right of appeal been given to people who want to exercise their rights under clause 2(1)? If the Government are not prepared to grant a right of appeal to people who exercise recreational access rights, will they consider giving bodies that reflect the views of ramblers and others the right to make representations? If the appeal process is one-sided and solely in the hands of those who have a legal interest in land, it would be sensible to give a right of representation to other people.
<P>
We covered some of the argument when we debated my amendments to clauses 6 and 7, which outline the appeal procedure following a refusal to include land within a mapped area. I was told that to give a right of appeal to those who want to exercise recreational access rights would open the floodgates to a multiplicity of appeals. Surely that consideration is not relevant to clause 28, which deals with a different procedure. There is no question of the mapping exercise being delayed indefinitely.
<P>
The clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Sections 7 and 8 . . . have effect in relation to an appeal under this section.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 7 allows local inquiries to be held. It also provides for the more informal procedure of hearings, which I am worried can be held in private. I was sceptical about using the phrase ``right to roam'' because it caused unwarranted alarm in some circles. However, having decided to give citizens the right to enjoy access to the countryside, why will the Government not protect that right? Why will they not accept that when they create rights that could be restricted or revoked, it is necessary to give both sides a right of appeal?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The clause reflects the Government's determination to ensure compliance with the obligations in the European convention on human rights. As my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West said, we touched on this argument when we debated clause 7. Clause 28 also reflects our recognition that those whose interests will be most affected by decisions on closure should be able to obtain a second opinion. We have considered carefully whether a right of appeal should be available more widely, perhaps even to members of the public. There is concern that without such a right of appeal, land might be subject to closure or restriction without an obvious reason. That might make some users sceptical about the closure regime. Clearly, we wish to guard against such a scenario, which is why it is vital that the criteria for exclusions or restriction should be transparent and readily understood. The fact that the Countryside Agency plans to consult on the criteria for closures or restrictions, including with the National Countryside Access Forum, will help to secure consensus about the reasons for restrictions.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman requested that members of the public should be given the right to make representations, but they already have that right. It will be possible for anyone with any interest to make representations without a provision being enshrined in law, and we would expect extensive and long-term closure proposals to be considered by local access forums, on which users will be represented, so we are not persuaded that it is necessary to grant a right of appeal. The right of appeal exists to help us to fulfil our obligations under the European convention. I hope that my hon. Friend would accept that landowners have a greater interest than any individual member of the public, so it is right that they should be given the opportunity to obtain a second opinion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thomas:</B> None the less, the Bill creates certain rights for the public. I hear what the Minister says about the public having an opportunity to make representations at all stages, but will he clarify whether the public will be able to make representations when an appeal is lodged under clause 28?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I cannot think of anything to prevent that from happening. In particular, extensive and long-term closure proposals will be considered and debated at local access forums, on which users will be represented and will be able to make whatever points they wish.
<P>
Were we to provide in the Bill for a right of appeal for anyone, it could add substantially to the costs and administration involved in operating the closure regime and could result in greater confusion and delay about whether the right of access applies to a given area of land at any one time. Provided that the criteria for restrictions are robust and justified—and are seen to be such—and that applications are fairly assessed against those criteria, I believe that the system of closures or restrictions will operate effectively and gain general acceptance.

</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 220, in page 17, line 1, leave out `may' and insert `shall'.
<P>
I knew that it would be worth my while returning this evening, although I assure the Committee that my contribution will be brief. We discussed the rights of landowners and other interested parties to close land for various purposes. I referred during those discussions to the regulations, the most important aspect of which is the amount of notice that must be given by a landowner who wishes to use his opportunity to close any part of his land for one or more of the 28 days on which he is entitled to do so.
<P>
The amendment, which seeks to change only one word, would ensure that regulations on exclusion or restriction of access are properly made. It would require the notice period necessary for closure of land under clause 21(1) to be decided by an affirmative procedure in both Houses and ensure that it is not left to the discretion of the relevant authority. Such decisions are political and are based on political judgments. A national set of regulations, stating the notice period, should apply throughout the country. I am loth to give a hostage to fortune, but I must say that the notice period could be anything between 12 hours and 12 months, although many issues will come into play. We believe that the regulations should be compulsory rather than optional and that Parliament should have a say in how they are drafted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> This is another amendment that requires more regulation but which has been tabled by the party of deregulation. The Government recognise the importance of providing regulations to govern procedures in respect of directions for exclusions or restrictions under chapter II. That is why we have provided the power contained in clause 30, which lists in considerable detail the issues in relation to which regulations are likely to be needed.
<P>
We certainly plan to make regulations covering most, if not all, of the issues listed. For example, it is clearly important that regulations are made in good time for procedures governing the giving of directions by relevant authorities and the steps to be taken for ensuring effective consultation and notification. Similarly, it is essential that regulations are made to detail how landowners will notify the relevant authorities about their use of the 28-day discretionary closures and the procedures for application for closures and for appeals against decisions.
<P>
I agree that regulations covering all key elements must be made if we are to ensure effective implementation of the right of access. Similarly, I recognise that these regulations will provide details that many of those with an interest in the land are keen to see and that there may be concern that some important details are being overlooked if they are not made. We recognise the importance of those details and will ensure that they are properly provided for. I suspect that there is little difference in practice between the purpose of the amendment and the aims for which the Bill already provides. The difference relates to whether regulations must be made on all items or whether a measure of flexibility should apply. On balance—do not want to make a big issue out of this—and in line with usual policy, we consider that the Bill should remain as it stands. However, I reassure the hon. Gentleman that we shall make regulations in relation to all necessary procedures. I hope that he will ask leave to withdraw the amendment on that basis.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The Under-Secretary has reassured me that regulations will be made and has obviously taken on board the importance that we attach to them. I am happy to accept his word and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Kidney </B>(Stafford): I beg to move amendment No. 471, in page 17, line 5, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and the manner in which any persons holding rights of common must make any such application'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is modest, but neat. I hope that the Under-Secretary will support it. Under clause 22, a person interested in land can apply to the relevant authority for an exclusion or restriction on grounds of land management. Under clause 23, a person interested in land can make an application to the relevant authority for an exclusion or restriction for reasons of avoiding danger to the public, including danger from fire.
<P>
My amendment relates to registered common land. If, as seems likely, every registered commoner will be regarded as a person with an interest in land, we might be considering several hundred people having the same interest in one area of land. It is not difficult to foresee a large number of applications on roughly the same subject being made at about the same time, either by accident or design, and clogging up the system of the relevant authorities.
<P>
It would be helpful to those authorities if such a situation could be controlled by regulation. What regulations could there be? I have in mind regulations that would provide for a minimum number or proportion of commoners that would have to make an application. Once relevant authorities had considered one application, they would not have to consider another in the same or similar form for a particular period. The area of the Bill's procedures is narrow, but such regulations might stop a flood of applications, which would be unwieldy for the relevant authorities to deal with. I hope that the Under-Secretary finds that helpful.
