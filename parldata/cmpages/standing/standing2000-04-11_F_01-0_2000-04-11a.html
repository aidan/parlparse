<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mr. Malcolm Wicks):</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Learning and Skills Bill [Lords], the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Nine o'clock and at half-past One o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Benton, and also your co-Chairman, Mr. Hancock. My two ministerial colleagues and the whole Committee look forward to your guidance over the next few weeks in what we hope will be constructive and meaningful scrutiny of the Bill.
<P>
It will be convenient for hon. Members to assume that the Committee will sit on Tuesday and Thursday mornings and afternoons. I hope that we can make good progress and that agreement can be reached through the usual channels about when the Bill will leave Committee, but until then we must make that assumption.
<P>
We had a useful and wide-ranging debate on Second Reading last month. I welcome the opportunity to pick up on issues raised and to participate in closer scrutiny of the detail.
<P>
I also welcome the varied and very relevant expertise from which the Committee and the Bill will benefit. When wearing a different hat, Mr. Benton, you chair the governors at a college of technology, and Mr. Hancock is a former leader of Hampshire county council and is still chair of its planning and economic development committee.
<P>
We have former education Ministers on the Committee and I note particularly that we have several members of the Education and Employment Committee, which I had the great privilege to co-chair until relatively recently. Indeed, looking around I must remember that I am no longer chairing that Committee but that those present are in a sense here to scrutinise me and my colleagues.
<P>
Several Committee members are also members of relevant parliamentary groups on adult education and further education and of committees concerned with disability and many other relevant subjects. I note also from my research that several Committee members have been involved in different ways in the education process, as teachers or lecturers. The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) is a former head teacher. In many other respects, too, we have an expert Committee to guide and stimulate us in the weeks to come.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State, Wales Office and my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd (Mr. Ruane) will help us to do important scrutiny of the provisions for Wales.
<P>
Several noble Lords made the point on their Second Reading—because of course the Bill entered the upper House first—that the Bill represents an all-too-rare opportunity for debates on further education and training. Despite the best efforts of the Education and Employment Committee, and although delivery of post-16 skills and learning is crucial for our economic well-being and social cohesion, I fear that that is true. This is a rare opportunity to study these matters in detail.
<P>
On Second Reading I said that this was legislation for the 21st century. I would like to take a moment to substantiate my claim and to remind hon. Members of the issues at stake and of the different areas that we will be considering over the coming weeks.
<P>
We have a serious situation in this country that we need to address and there are statistics to back that up: statistics that some of us know only too well but that are worth repeating. There are still more than 6 million adults in this country with no formal qualifications. One in five of the adult population have a lower literacy level than an 11-year-old should have. There are about 170,000 young people aged 16 to 18—about one in 11 of the age group—who are not in training, not in education and not in employment. The qualification achievement rates in further education colleges vary too much, from about 34 per cent. up to 94 per cent.
<P>
Dropout rates from training and enterprise councils courses range from 30 to 60 per cent. Small wonder, then, that business people talk about a skills gap. Employers are often able to offer jobs but receive no takers even in areas of unemployment. It is hardly surprising, too, that we lag far behind France, Germany, the United States of America and other nations in terms of productivity. In essence, the country is in no fit state to face the challenges and opportunities of the knowledge economy or to further the aim of creating an inclusive, learning society.
<P>
The Learning and Skills Council and the 47 local councils that we aim to establish in England will be concerned with stripping away bureaucracy and waste. Our aim is to achieve coherence and quality across the whole post-16 spectrum. We are talking about big money: large amounts of public expenditure. The Learning and Skills Council will have a £6 billion budget and will provide learning to some 6 million learners—academic, vocational, work-based and leisure-time learning for young people and adults.
<P>
We will build partnerships for private, public and voluntary sectors and at national, regional, sectoral and local levels to place the consumers of learning—employers, communities and individuals—at the centre, and to promote cohesive, dynamic communities. That will combine the benefits of a single, unitary system, guaranteeing a coherent and strategic approach, with local decision making and flexibility. Local people will make local decisions.
<P>
The Bill also offers the prospect of a real change in Wales through the creation of a new Council for Education and Training for Wales, the CETW. Under the aegis of the National Assembly, the new council will open up new opportunities for learning, remove barriers to learning, and help to continue the upward drive of education and training standards in Wales. The National Assembly in plenary on 1 February debated proposed arrangements and overwhelmingly endorsed the approach for Wales as now expressed in the Bill. The National Assembly will be taking a close interest in the Bill's progress through the House, not least to see that Welsh needs and circumstances are reflected. My hon. Friend from the Wales Office will be helping the Committee in explaining the provisions relating to that country.
<P>
I will now say something about school sixth forms, because this is a feature of the Bill and of the debate around the Bill. The provisions on sixth forms focus on coherence, quality and choice. The LSC and the CETW will fund local education authorities for their sixth form provision, as part of promoting coherence across the schools-further education divide, which was a principle welcomed widely during consultation.
<P>
We have arrangements to secure our commitment to standards in sixth form provision, including in schools. There will be provision to enable LEAs to propose new maintained 16-19 institutions—a reflection of the value that we place on sixth form provision in the schools sector. We want an effective and successful sixth form sector offering young people an attractive range of high-quality learning routes.
<P>
Inspection is another important part of the Bill, which will introduce the first ever rigorous, independent and comprehensive regime for inspection of post-16 learning.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): Does the Minister have confidence in the existing arrangements for the inspection of further education by the further education inspectorate, whether in further education colleges or in sixth form colleges? He seems to be implying otherwise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> We have great confidence in the inspectorates in place. Indeed, all the evidence suggests that the different inspectorates have been key in helping us in our objective of driving up standards. However, the Committee's purpose is to scrutinise a Bill that brings together education and training for those aged 16 and over. We are dealing with a new fund and a new policy strategy, and the Government will argue that we therefore need new inspection arrangements. We will have plenty of time to cover the important issues about which the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) and is so concerned, as we all are.
<P>
The current arrangements involve three different bodies with overlapping remits, different inspection cycles and no common methodologies, grading or post-16 inspection follow-ups. Given that we are proposing a new policy, that makes no sense, and we need to reform the inspectorates, just as we are reforming other parts of the sector.
<P>
Two massive and specialist jobs need to be done. There will be a new adult learning inspectorate to take on the inspection of all adult learning and workplace training, and the remit of the Office for Standards in Education will be extended to include the inspection of provision for 16 to 19-year-olds in further education colleges. Provision for effective joint working, especially for the inspection of all learning provision for 16 to 19-year-olds in an area, is allowed for.
<P>
I shall deal now with the aspects of the Bill that relate to disability and learning difficulties. Important and positive provisions are made as regards equal opportunities, especially for people with learning difficulties and/or disabilities, whose learning might otherwise be delayed or disrupted. There will be a statutory duty on the LSC and on the council in Wales to promote equal opportunities. There will be duties on both councils to take account of the needs of people with learning difficulties when planning provision for learning and work experience. There will be new provisions to help people with learning difficulties to make the transition from school to other post-16 learning. Those have been worked up in consultation with disability organisations. All that represents a real advance on existing arrangements and an entirely appropriate boost for equal opportunities in learning.
<P>
There will be a statutory basis for the new ConneXions service, which will provide information, advice, guidance and support for all 13 to 19-year-olds. That will build on and better co-ordinate existing support services to raise aspirations and expectations and to enable young people to maximise their potential and get the most from learning. Government amendments will be tabled to provide for a local service for young people in Wales that is tailored to particular circumstances and objectives there.
<P>
I hope that the Committee agrees to the sittings motion. My brief run through the Bill has allowed me to give an appetiser to our debate, and I am sure that hon. Members are as anxious as I am to get on to the detail of the main course—there is certainly much to chew over. [Hon. Members: ``Oh dear.''] It can only get better. I am grateful for the time and effort that hon. Members, you, Mr. Benton, and your co-Chairman will expend over the coming weeks in scrutinising the Bill to ensure that we have got things right.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I echo the Minister's welcome to you, Mr. Benton, and to your colleague, Mr. Hancock, who will replace you at some of our sittings. We are lucky to have you looking over our deliberations and will do our best to act in the right spirit and not to abuse your trust and good will.
<P>
As I am starting with accolades, I should also thank the Minister for his explanation of the Bill, although we still have reservations about it. Nevertheless, I accept his bona fides as regards his wish to have a genuine debate and the Government's interest in the matter before us. We have a common interest in trying to get the Bill as right as we can.
<P>
The only thing at which I might cavil slightly—this is not intended to excite the Government Whip's attention—is that the Minister said that we would sit in the afternoons. That will, of course, depend on the motion before us; otherwise, the presumption must be that we will sit in the mornings. I can perhaps help the Minister by saying that I am not minded, unless severely provoked, to advise my hon. Friends to oppose the sittings motion. Nevertheless, we must agree to it if we are to sit in the afternoons.
<P>
It is not my wish, not least as the temporary, impressed Opposition Whip—I once had that role in substance, but even that has been taken away from me—to excite or disturb the Government Whip. It is not the purpose of Conservative Members to seek, by some magic trick, to overturn the Government's majority. We might be able to do so by spreading disaffection or concern among Labour Members on a particular issue, but I cannot speak for them in that regard. However, without their support, we shall have difficulty in carrying the day.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I hope that I shall not fall out with any hon. Member—although I might do with the Minister and his officials—when I say that the Committee's time might be better spent rehearsing issues at a reasonable hour and encouraging the Minister and his officials to go away and think over, at an unreasonable hour, the complications that we raise. We will have much work to do on the detail, and there must be a balance. In the light of my ministerial experience, I always take the view that the most constructive dialogues—this is not to say that the Committee is not a good use of Parliament's time—happen when Ministers go back to their officials and say, ``Blimey, why did he say that?'' or ``Could he be right?'' The Minister is generous minded and will realise that, just occasionally, hon. Members can be right.
<P>
I hope that I am not taking the spirit of consensus too far if I give the impression that the evenings will, if necessary, not be a no-go area. The Government Whip will remember that we sat up late discussing several matters relating to the minimum wage, and, if duty calls, we will do so again. However, I shall not necessarily regard that as a badge of honour.
<P>
To finish the tour d'horizon of the persons present, I should say that I genuinely join the Minister in welcoming several Labour Members who have considerable expertise in and enthusiasm for the matters before us. I hope that their involvement will be recompensed by at least controlled releases from the leash on occasion so that they can express their opinions. I will try to tailor my remarks to make that possible, because the Committee would benefit. Equally, it is a pleasure to have with us the hon. Members for Harrogate and Knaresborough and for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan). As one of them has shown previously and as the other showed on Second Reading, they have a good deal of expertise and a common commitment in this area. There will, I hope, be much that we can hammer out and improve together.
<P>
I should, not least because I am acting as the Whip, turn to those sitting on my own Benches. In that regard, I am deeply blessed in quality, if not quantity. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) is a considerable addition and will take an interest in schools, although he will have a licence to roam wherever he wishes, provided that he remains in order. We look forward to his contributions. He is a man of legal expertise and precision, which will greatly benefit the Committee. He is a veteran of many Bills.
<P>
Like me, my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke), has form in this matter: he, too, was an education Minister, with responsibility for higher, not further, education. He spoke magisterially on Second Reading, showing considerable authority and will undoubtedly have some interesting and important things to say. Were the climate more favourable now, we would have further assistance on the Opposition Benches in the shape of my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady), who is indisposed with a complaint that he may have caught from his family, and the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) who is busy with a by-election. He will return in due course, in full form and no doubt with another success behind him.
<P>
There is a slight lacuna in respect of Wales on the Opposition Benches, which we shall endeavour to fill. I would not want the Wales Office Minister or his officials to think that we are entirely bereft in that respect; he will remember that my right hon. Friend the Minister for Cities of London and Westminster had a redoubtable Welsh mother who could see off most of the Government Front Bench single handed. I had better not say that my dear wife is equally redoubtable, but she comes from a long line of Welsh teachers. She is not Welsh speaking, unlike some of her cousins who teach in the Principality; the next generation is going forward. There will be things to say about Wales and interesting comparisons to draw.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. David Hanson):</B> No seats, lots of relatives.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> They voted Conservative, and will do so again
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Do they play rugby?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Not the female members. The Opposition have a good team and some material and important things to say. We have no wish to perpetuate the spirit of factionalism. The Government secured a Second Reading for the Bill and brushed aside our reasoned amendment, which they may live to regret. Nevertheless, we are embarked on course to lick the measure into shape and, as the Minister conceded, it needs careful scrutiny, which we intend to give it.
<P>
No one should be under any illusions about the importance of the matter; as the Minister said, a significant number of adults have learning deficiencies and some 6 million to 7 million are deficient in basic skills. In his more reflective moments, the Minister would concede that the problem is not new; it exercised his predecessors in the Conservative Government and there has been much achievement. For example, the full-time participation in education of young persons from 16 to 18 in the years 1988-98 rose from 34.9 per cent. to 55.1 per cent. of the age cohort. The figures for all education and training are 62.4 per cent. to 74.4 per cent.
<P>
I do not disagree with the Minister about socially excluded people who, to use shorthand, we agree are those who are not in education, training or full-time employment. They are a social and an educational problem but also a great resource, which should be tapped. In fairness to the Minister, we should probably start with the understanding that, although it would be desirable to have 100 per cent. participation, the curve is likely to slope asymptotically as we reach that figure, however hard we or the Minister try. We will never quite draw everyone in, but we have a common interest in involving as many as we can.
<P>
I invite the Minister to reflect on a point raised on Second Reading by my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster about the opacity of the overall figures. In broad terms, further education funding comes to nearly £4 billion, with another £1.4 billion from training and enterprise councils. Sixth forms also have to be included. I do not know whether the total figures add up to £5 billion or £6 billion. My right hon. Friend may wish to elucidate, but it is important for the Committee to have a common understanding early in our proceedings.
<P>
We are about to consider the Bill in detail. This is the first time in 10 years—and never from the Front Bench—that I have examined a Bill that has already been examined by their Lordships, which often creates a different dynamic. The Committee has to steer a delicate line between two approaches—not taking the slightest notice of anything their Lordships say on democratic grounds, and arguing that everything has been said in another place, so there is no need to say it again. We could imagine the Minister saying that.
<P>
Sometimes Opposition Members take a genuine interest in what Ministers tell their Lordships. We shall examine carefully whether the spokesmen for the Government in both Houses say the same thing about our concerns. We shall not, of course, wish to crawl over all the ground that was covered by their Lordships, though we are entitled to do so. On issues of principle, we shall expect the Minister to rehearse his position de novo and we shall wish to raise additional points that arise.
<P>
Our first concern on the Opposition Benches is to defend the territory already defended by their Lordships. I refer the Minister specifically to concerns about section 28 issues in clause 117, which deals with the proper form of the delivery of sex education and the regulation of public spending or public activity in relation to it. Their Lordships raised legitimate concerns and, as I said, we shall uphold their views about the Secretary of State's intention to remove legislative cover later.
<P>
Balloting for grammar schools is another important issue. We believe that, once the issue has been decided by parents, it is too intrusive to apply pressure by serial ballots. We shall debate that provision. We see a continuing role for grammar schools—as does the Secretary of State in his wiser moments—when they are in tune with the wishes of the local community. Grammar schools have a remarkably strong educational record.
<P>
We shall explain, articulate and develop our remaining concerns about the strategy of the Bill. They are real, and the Minister will note that we have tabled an amendment—a military amendment, as it were—to delete clause 1, which would effectively wreck the Bill. We are worried that the Minister's proposals, however well intentioned, would create and stoke up bureaucracy, and shackle and inhibit the delivery of education, rather than facilitate it.
<P>
We have a second concern about sixth formers. The Minister spoke warmly about sixth forms and said that they had an important role, but the safeguards in the Bill are not sufficient to deliver that, particularly if circumstances adverse to the sixth form are developed, and particularly when the Government appear to have an agenda that is less friendly to sixth forms. Then there is the issue of inspection. I interrupted the Minister once in his speech because I was nettled about the corner into which he had painted himself about the alleged deficiencies of the present regime, whereby sixth form colleges are inspected by the Further Education Funding Council inspectorate. They have nearly all found that tutelage helpful.
<P>
Even if the Minister has produced a different system, he has not produced a totally logical one. Having said that Ofsted should be involved up to the age of 19, he leaves aside the anomaly that workplace training for young persons below that age will be conducted by the adult learning inspectorate. The Minister must show us why the present arrangements, including the Training Standards Council, need overturning. He will not reduce the number of bodies effectively and he may well reduce the coherence of what he is trying to deliver.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Our fourth concern relates to ConneXions and social inclusion and exclusion. We want to secure, and to be sure that the Bill secures, a continuing right for all young people, irrespective of their degree of social exclusion, to proper careers guidance and support. Local authorities should be able to conduct informal education for all young people without what might loosely be called a morbid concentration on the socially excluded. If the Minister can find the additional resources to do that job as well, that may help, but they are not in the Bill and they have not been signalled yet. We need to see much more detail of how all this is to work. There are some genuine concerns about the role of personal mentors, their relationships with schools, parents and so on. Proper consideration should be given to checking out their bona fides.
<P>
Our third main area for debate is to pick up on the external representations that continue to gush forwards as they always do on these occasions from the careers service, national associations such as NIACE—the National Institute of Adult Continuing Education—and others. I am sure that there will also be points from the disability interests. It is important that those are considered collectively by the Committee. We should build in and take on board as many of them as is humanly possible. Those are the main areas that we should debate in this important Committee, and we shall seek to debate them constructively.
<P>
Two matters do not receive the attention that they deserve either in Parliament or in the wider debate. Although for the purposes of order they do not exist, it is nice to see people in the Gallery. There is a need to focus on further education. This is an area that has not always received the attention that it might. Perhaps it has had a boost from Conservative legislation, which identified a separate further education sector for the first time with a separate funding body, but there has always been a pressure between the twin millstones of what might loosely be called higher education on the one hand and schools on the other—I use the analogy only to be colourful—with further education somewhere in the middle, without its important role being identified.
<P>
Further education is and should be available for all our citizens: for young people leaving school and the compulsory years who want to lay the foundation for their careers, and perhaps want to go on to higher education, which can be a stepping stone for them; and for older people returning or wishing to pick up new skills. When I visit further education establishments, I am always struck by the immense range that they offer, their strong commitment to their staff and their principles, and the strong motivation of many of their students. Some people, whom we fail in school, can react like a button being pushed if they enter further education. The right motivations come together, and they are successful. The sector has a lot going for it. It is important to discuss it in a wider context, as the Minister would rightly say, because that gives a proper focus, and I hope that we can do that.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere is a real lawyer, whereas I am a barrack-room lawyer who had to teach himself employment law even to be that, but if the Minister feels that we are being pettifogging, picking nits and drawing false distinctions to make problems on the details, I cannot agree. That is proper for legislative scrutiny in Parliament. If I criticised the Government—although Labour Members would never suggest that I should—it would be, more than anything else, for their misunderstanding of the conversion of a press release into a policy.
<P>
It is all very well to say that they want to reform the structure of post-16 education in England and Wales. That may be a worthy aim, and the Minister may approach it with the highest motives and high hopes of success, but saying it is not achieving it. Achievement requires dull and detailed negotiations and administrative arrangements. Those issues will have to be debated while we put down the structure and legal framework, and when we consider subsequent implementation. In years to come, the Minister will no doubt be beset by such issues as the apportionment of the publicly owned assets of the training and enterprise councils and the privately owned assets that may be shifted to a residual company that may provide other facilities for the local community and economy. That will be a difficult task.
<P>
We will examine the details and worry about the nature of the chairmanship and whether the Minister should make appointments. We worry about plurisie and whether an additional person can serve. I have touched on just some of the issues raised by our amendments. The Minister should not think that those will be the last on the amendment paper. We are not indulging in some parliamentary game. It is extremely important that those matters are discussed and got right.

<P>

<B>Mr. Wicks indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am pleased that the Minister is nodding.
<P>
I have occasionally talked to Ministers and felt that I was talking at them, because they had a wider political agenda, although I was aware at the same time that a curve ball was going in the direction of their officials. The most frightening way of attracting the attention of officials is to mention judicial review. That wakes them up. In a law-driven culture, it is important for everyone that we get the details right. Ministers' arrangements should be seen to be fair, not oppressive, and they must work.
<P>
That was a short lecture on the importance of legislation. I will go to my grave believing in what I said. It is an added bonus to be able to apply those principles to further education, a real-world, important subject on which we are all keen to get things right. I am delighted to have the opportunity to serve on the Committee, and I welcome the sittings motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Willis </B>(Harrogate and Knaresborough): I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Benton. I had the pleasure of serving in a Committee under you before, and you were extremely fair and courteous. Having been the chair of governors at the Hugh Baird college of technology for 21 years, you will understand the passion that many of us feel about the further education sector and the Bill. I assure you and your co-„chair, Mr. Hancock, that the Liberal Democrats do not intend to waste the Committee's time. We will deal only with important principles that we feel should be debated.
<P>
I welcome, too, the hon. Member for Daventry; we are greatly honoured to have him on the Committee. His experience as a former Minister with responsibilities for the matters under discussion will be useful. I have spent some time looking at Hansard to see what the hon. Gentleman said in a former life on further education issues, and it will be interesting to report on some of those to the Committee over the next two or three months. That was a joke.
<P>
There is a wide array of talent on both sides of the Committee. I am disappointed that the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West is not present. Given his commitment to the grammar school cause, however, it might save us a great deal of time if we could deal with clause 98 today.
<P>
We support the sittings motion and have every desire to see the Bill go through as quickly and expediently as possible. Knowing on the Tuesday about a Thursday sitting that is to be cancelled would be a help to us in planning our diaries, however. Thursday is now a different sort of day in the House, and it is important that we make the maximum use of our time. We would not want to find out late on a Wednesday that a sitting had been cancelled, or had not been programmed. We are happy to make whatever arrangements are necessary through the usual channels for the Committee's timetabling. It would be useful if we were included within those channels and that it was not assumed that there was a bilateral agreement between Government and Conservative Members with which we would simply fall into line. I assure the Government Whip that that will not be the case, and that that assumption could lead to extremely long sittings.
<P>
A disappointment of the early exchanges was that the hon. Member for Daventry chose to raise the question of clause 98, which concerns the grammar school ballots. Frankly, I regard that as a debate that we should get through in five minutes. I certainly hope that the Government will see sense, abolish the nonsensical ballots and return the responsibility for admission arrangements to the democratically elected local authorities. I have no doubt that the Minister, having received a note from his officials, will already be planning an amendment to that effect. We must avoid the sort of horrendous situation that we recently saw in Ripon, in which one in four of those able to vote in a ballot were parents of students in private schools.
<P>
I apologise to the Committee for the fact that I was unable to attend Second Reading—I was in hospital at the time. When I read through Hansard and looked at some of the speeches on Second Reading, my heart sank. Some of the language that was used about clause 117 and the repeal of section 28 was disgraceful, and the hysteria that the Conservative party has engendered over those matters does not do any good whatever to the reputation of anybody in the House. We support the Government's intention to get rid of section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988. While we may dislike some of it, it is right that the Secretary of State should continue to be able to issue advice to schools when necessary on behalf of the Government, as has happened in the past.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
However, the sort of amendment that the Government introduced in the House of Lords would simply result in a legislative fudge. It is important that the Government issue proper guidance, but legislating for morality has no place in a civilised society. I hope that we shall be able to avoid taking that thorny path in the Bill.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hallam made our position on the rest of the Bill clear on Second Reading, as did Baroness Sharp and Lord Tope in another place. There is much in the Bill with which we agree. I have had a long association with further education and its aims and during their time in office, from the publication of Lady Kennedy's excellent report ``Learning works: widening participation in further education'', to the White Paper, and now the Bill, we have seen a Government who are prepared to put further education at the heart of the learning agenda. We compliment them on that.
<P>
The Minister is right to point out the massive skills deficit and all of us—including those involved in further education—should examine the failure of successive governments as demonstrated in the damning social exclusion unit report ``Bridging the Gap''. What an indictment it is that 9 per cent. of young people in one of the most affluent, civilised modern societies leave school with no qualifications, no plans to train, no job and no hope. They are excluded not simply for a few years, but for the rest of their lives. If there is anything in the Bill that tackles that problem—and certainly the expectations of mentoring are starting to show signs of being fulfilled—we shall support it.
<P>
The other major stumbling block for training is in the small business sector. If, again, we can make inroads into that, my colleagues and I will be delighted. I attended the national conference of the Federation of Small Businesses a few weeks ago, where we debated whether entrepreneurs are born or made. The Committee will not be surprised to hear that the overwhelming decision was that training is incidental and may or may not have an effect. That may be borne out in a recent survey that showed that 30 per cent. of people in small business do not even have level 2 qualifications. That is a criticism not of them but of a society and an educational system that believe that one does not need the education or training skills that will enable one to grow a business and make it more successful.
<P>
The Conservative party rightly claim the credit for expanding the number of students in the FE market between 1993 and 1997. There was a 30 per cent. increase in the number of students during that time. What the Conservatives do not tell us is that during that time we saw the loss of 20,000 FE lecturers. One third of student unit funding was lost at the time, leaving staff in the FE sector in a desolate state in terms of career and pay structures. One sadness of the Bill is that it contains nothing to deal with the career training structure of those lecturers. I hope that the Minister will address this matter, some other time if not today. It is not good enough to say that it is the colleges' job, and wash our hands of it. It is the responsibility of Government to encourage a proper career and promotion structure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I doubt whether I shall often rush to the Minister's defence in this Committee but perhaps he will note, first, that Opposition Members have warmly welcomed the establishment of a national training organisation for further education and, secondly—this is a gentle hint to the hon. Gentleman—that I would welcome a debate at some time, perhaps in Westminster Hall, on the future of FE lecturers' career structure and training, to which I trust all members of the Committee attach considerable importance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I am not being over-critical of the Government. But, according to recent statistics from NATFHE—the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education—60 per cent. of part-time lecturers have no formal qualifications. That is unacceptable, as is the fact that one in five full-time FE lecturers do not have them. We are talking about giving people quality experience.
<P>
Although the Bill contains important principles with which we agree, we are unhappy about a number of issues. The Committee will be pleased to hear that we do not intend to table thousands of amendments that are typical for such a Bill. However, we have tabled amendments that relate to some of its key provisions.
<P>
We do not oppose the creation of the Learning and Skills Council for England that is proposed in part I. It was disingenuous of Baroness Blackstone to suggest in another place that our amendment proposing nine regional learning and skills councils was a wrecking amendment, because it most certainly was not. We intend to move a similar amendment this morning.
<P>
In our opinion, a single council will be a new quango that will effectively control and dictate to the 47 regional quangos. Their 700 members, who are to be appointed by the Secretary of State alone, will simply absorb powers from local education authorities and schools, making the council, with its £6 billion budget, one of the United Kingdom's most powerful non-elected bodies. We believe that instead of simplifying an obsolete bureaucratic structure it will merely replace it with an equally bureaucratic and unwieldy one. We shall therefore attempt to amend clause 1.
<P>
We shall also seek to amend clauses 2 and 3, and in particular the arbitrary cut-off point of 19 years in the entitlement of young adults to education and training. Perhaps the Minister will explain later why 19 was chosen. The work of Baroness Kennedy and Chris Humphries in the third skills taskforce made it clear that there is a need to do something about skills training among under-25s, yet we seem to be locked into the old notions of the ages of 11, 16 and 19 in the education system. I hope that we can adopt a flexible approach and find a more innovative way of tackling these problems.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman note the importance of what I will call the key skill of computer literacy for adults generally? Does he agree that many people of his age group and mine, who did not grow up with the regular use of computers at school, would derive great benefit from reskilling themselves, and would be much more effective at their jobs and in society if they had done so?
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that comment, and I agree with him. In fact, I think that the measure in the Budget that gave 100 per cent. write-off for the purchase of IT equipment was an important start. However, there is the question of the training that goes with it and, as he said, the fear of IT among many people of his generation, and probably mine; and yet it is important.
<P>
We will not table any amendments on the issue of sixth forms; we will leave that to Conservative Members. However, the Minister could allay the fears of the Committee on a number of issues and prevent us from having lengthy debates on sixth forms. In particular, we have no idea what the formula will be for distributing money from the Learning and Skills Council to schools. Under clause 7, will the money be added to the school budget? Can a school use the money as it sees fit, within its overall spending plans, or must it—a little like the situation with the standards fund—allocate the money to specific sixth form activities? If so, it is a peculiar arrangement. The Minister has never been able to satisfy sixth forms, further education colleges or anybody on that point, thereby causing himself completely unnecessary problems. Perhaps he will respond to that.
<P>
If the Secretary of State, through the Learning and Skills Council, dictates to a school how it spends its money post-16, he will create a different animal from the one that exists now. One of the joys of sixth forms and FE colleges is that they are diverse: they offer a different product. Many people choose to go to schools with sixth forms, because of the ethos and added value that they offer. It is important that that point is resolved.
<P>
In addition, we need an explanation of clause 2(4)(e), which says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>disproportionate expenditure is expenditure that is wasteful or unrelated to the duties and functions of the Council, but shall not be taken to mean expenditure on provision that, by its nature, has higher unit costs than other forms of provision.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is at the heart of the sixth form funding debate, and we need an early explanation of what it means and what the Minister intends by it, because there is real apprehension among sixth forms. I am talking about, for example, large viable sixth forms in my constituency. They do not fulfil any of the criteria for closure, so I am not arguing from that point of view.
<P>
If we consider the unit funding for an A-level course at the further education college in Harrogate, and compare it with that of the sixth forms just up the road—at Harrogate grammar school, or St. Aiden's Church of England school, for instance—we find a significantly different figure. Who is to say that Harrogate grammar school and St. Aiden's C of E school are spending too much on their sixth forms, or that the Further Education Funding Council has got right the funding of A-level students within the college system? The clause says that we could go to the lowest common denominator. There is no doubt that Harrogate college, which I am using as an example because it is in my constituency, produces first-class A-„level results. Why cannot the grammar school or St. Aiden's school do that for the same unit cost? Perhaps the Minister will respond to that later.
<P>
On clause 13, we shall be looking for guarantees from the Government that the special educational needs Bill, which will be introduced later in the session, will be coterminous with this Bill wherever possible. The Minister, the Secretary of State and I are committed to achieving an inclusive education, especially for youngsters with special needs and disabilities. The hon. Member for Daventry shares that aim. We want to get this provision right. It should not be fought over as a party political issue. However, it is nonsense that the provisions will be repeated in the special educational needs Bill, which will cover disabilities and the school sector. How do the Government intend to dovetail the two Bills?
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
In my humble experience, having worked on inclusive education for many years, I was sad to learn that there was a real discrepancy between what schools and colleges provided. Each thought that what they provided was excellent, but the provision was often different and did not dovetail. The right provisions were often lacking.
<P>
Does the Minister accept that we need to discuss transport, especially as it relates to post-16 students with special educational needs, in our debate on clause 13? Transport costs are often the big inhibitor for youngsters with special needs, especially physical disabilities, who want to get into the learning set-up post 16.
<P>
The one-on-one mentoring support for such students should be included in the Bill. Will the Minister assure me that we will drop the farcical nonsense of establishing a post-16 system that is based on progression through qualifications? It is wrong that students with severe learning difficulties should operate in the system of qualification progression. There is an idea that further education colleges are cooking the books to ensure that students with special educational needs, especially severe learning difficulties, get a good deal. I compliment the colleges on that, but the system should be based on student need rather than a qualification structure.
<P>
We shall ask for clauses 19 to 24 to be removed because they are irrelevant. They will establish sub-„regional councils. The Wales Office Minister will be pleased to know that we are delighted with what is happening in Wales. The Welsh model is excellent. We do not understand why it should not be replicated across the English regions. If it is good enough for Wales, it should be good enough for Yorkshire, the Humber and the northeast in general.
<P>
Our principal concerns relate to part III and the confusion over inspection. We are pleased that the Government are proposing a new adult learning inspectorate, but they have downgraded that to a second-rate inspection system by making it second to Ofsted. Can the Minister produce a shred of evidence—the hon. Member for Daventry also made this point—that the FEFC did a bad job when it inspected further education institutions? None of it has been reported to me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am at one with the hon. Gentleman. Does he agree that the FEFC model of inspection was, interestingly, more consensual than the Ofsted model? Although the Ofsted model may be appropriate for schools in the compulsory years, most further education institutions felt that they derived considerable benefit from participating in the process to some extent. It is odd that Ministers are now removing that element of consensuality.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> That is exactly the point that I was about to make, and the hon. Gentleman made it well. We are seeing the No. 10 policy unit at work in the Bill, rather than the Department for Education and Employment. In light of the Education Minister's splendid background in this field, and his admirable leadership of the Select Committee, especially during the Ofsted inquiry, I cannot believe that he would sign up to the provision. I look at hon. Members who served on the Select Committee during the inquiry and I see them laughing with hysterical embarrassment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am trying to be as fair as possible, but I remind the Committee that we are still discussing the sittings motion. We have spent an hour considering the motion, and we seem to be straying into the Bill itself. I ask hon. Members who intend to speak to confine their remarks to the motion; otherwise, they should wait for the appropriate time to make their points.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I take your guidance, Mr. Benton, and I do not wish to contradict your wishes. I am, however, trying to save time, and I do not want to raise the issues about which I am talking later. I hope that the Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Employment, will deal with them now. Inspection is an important issue, and the Under-Secretary should explain as quickly as possible the reasons for opting for an observational form of inspection rather than the continual self-evaluation model proposed by the Further Education Funding Council.
<P>
Our other main concern is the careers service, which is dealt with in clauses 103 to 112. The Under-„Secretary knows that the Liberal Democrats are at odds with him on the division of the service into two parts: a young people's careers service for those up to the age of 19 and an adults' careers service. We should consider the Welsh model. I do not know about the present position in the Foreign Office of the former Under-Secretary of State, Welsh Office, the hon. Member for Neath (Mr. Hain), but he was superb in agreeing with the National Assembly for Wales and with the Secretary of State for Wales an arrangement that provided comprehensive careers guidance throughout the system. I do not understand why the Government now propose a two-tier system, and we shall explore their reasons for doing so during discussion of the careers service.
<P>
On ConneXions, of course we strongly support the introduction of a top-quality careers service, linked into a new youth service that is geared towards the 170,000 young people who are socially excluded. We must not, however, introduce a careers service that does not meet the needs of all young people, and we shall seek commitments about that.
<P>
I should like to raise two final issues. First, why on earth is higher education excluded from the Bill? How can we possibly have a vision for the future on lifelong learning but yet again impose the artificial divide between further education and higher education? Such division has exactly the effect to which the hon. Member for Daventry alluded by default. He referred to the two millstones of schools and higher education with further education in the middle, as a place that is neither fish nor fowl and where all sorts of problems are off-loaded. Further education should be part and parcel of a comprehensive and seamless education and training system that does not recognise barriers. Why should there be a foundation degree that can be delivered only through higher education establishments because the funding will come only from the Higher Education Funding Council and not through the Learning and Skills Council? Such arbitrary divisions are nonsense, and I hope that the Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Employment, will deal with them.
<P>
Secondly, the Liberal Democrats were disappointed that the Government did not include the university for industry in the Bill. How can we have a lifelong learning Bill, a Learning and Skills Bill, which does not interface with everything that is going on in this field? The Government have not seen fit to include either the university for industry or Learning Direct in the Bill. Is that because the initiative is being run by the Chancellor or by No. 10 rather than the Department for Education and Employment? This is a missed opportunity.
<P>
We shall be delighted to co-operate with the Government. I have expressed our support for much of the Bill. In an air of co-operation, I hope that I shall not take up too much time in Committee because I have had the opportunity of raising my points with the Under-Secretary already. I am sure that he will respond to them positively.

<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Benton. I have had the pleasure of sitting under you before. I once raised a point of order with you on procedure. I was wrong and you were right. I have not forgotten that.
<P>
I can reassure the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough that he will be able to move his amendments before the morning finishes—unless the Minister speaks for a long time—although there were moments in the closing stages of his speech when I thought that he might prevent us from moving on himself. You have awarded us a degree of indulgence to take the sittings motion wider and into Second Reading considerations, Mr. Benton. I said that I would be brief and I hope that I shall address my remarks solely to the sittings motion.
<P>
I see life through the filter of cricket. My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry will recall the opening overs of the Competition Act 1998, when I suggested that it was like the opening overs of a county match with a thin crowd. I suspect that the crowd today is larger than that in the parks of Oxford, given the present weather. This is the first time that I have been in a team of only three from my party in a Standing Committee. I realise that that is temporary.
<P>
My mind goes back 50 years to the occasion when England went into the test match with only three bowlers: F.R. Brown, Alec Bedser and J.J. Warr. F.R. Brown later received the MBE; he was possibly the only man born in Peru to receive that award. Alec Bedser was later Sir Alec Bedser. The read-across to our team is not perfect. The three of us were all educated at the university of Oxford, whereas Mr. Brown and Mr. Warr were both educated at the university of Cambridge. I am the oldest on our side and so have some qualifications for playing the part of Mr. Brown There is no question that I am a slow bowler; I have never been anything else.
<P>
F.R. Brown had a brilliant debut in the late 1920s and early 1930s, but his true fame came as captain, first of Northamptonshire and then of England, whose morale he revived in both cases. I supported Northamptonshire before he became captain and therefore have a further qualification for playing his part. However, my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry represents Northamptonshire and he is the captain of our side, so he should be Mr. Brown. I cede that role. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere—although his hands are not large enough—is clearly Sir Alec Bedser and deeply professional in everything that he does. That reduces me to the role of J.J. Warr, which is a plus because Warr, being a fast bowler, bowled only in short bursts. I reassure the Committee that I will do the same.
<P>
The Government have paid us a compliment—given that we are reduced to three bowlers—in assembling three Under-Secretaries and a Whip to face us. We take that as a compliment, particularly as J.J. Warr took only one test wicket for 281 in his career, so we cannot be regarded as formidable opponents. I cannot remember why we were reduced to only three bowlers in that test match 50 years ago, but I do know that it might have been due to illness, which is the reason for the absence of my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West.
<P>
It is right that he is not in Committee today if he has caught what I understand that he has caught, because there is a risk that the Government Benches would be decimated and we would win all the Divisions as a result of all the Labour Members being removed to an isolation hospital. However, I am sure that you would call me to order, Mr. Benton, were I to continue in that vein.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I move on to the terms of the sittings motion. I might not have heard the Minister correctly because one does not pay as much attention as perhaps one should to every ball of an opening over of a test match, or even a county match. I was not sure whether he said that we would sit both mornings and afternoons this week, but I am sure that he will clarify that.
<P>
I want to make one observation because once precedents are established there is always a hazard that they will become rooted. I have no problem with sitting on Tuesdays. I have not consulted my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry to find out whether he agrees with the motion, so I am speaking independently, but I note from the terms of the motion that whereas we shall have a three-and-a-half-hour gap between the two sittings on Tuesdays, due to the curious timetable for Thursdays, we shall have only a two-hour gap. As that two-hour gap is clearly intended to embrace whatever oral questions are scheduled to take place in Question Time that day—on at least one day, that will be questions to the Secretary of State for Education and Employment—as well as the business question, that leaves a very slender margin between sittings on Thursdays. As someone who has served on a Committee that sat at 2.30 pm rather than 1.30 pm, and as a 2.30 pm sitting can continue until 7 o'clock, I am slightly sorry that we shall sit at 1.30 pm.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry said that I had a redoubtable mother. I am diffident about saying this, but my mother is 92 and still alive, so she should not be referred to in the past tense.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I had a moment of sheer ignorance on that matter. I am delighted to know that my right hon. Friend is ahead of me, both in terms of his slow bowling experience and in having a mother of 92, because my mother will be only 90 this year.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention.
<P>
The Wales Office Minister—with whom I had the pleasure of serving on the Committee that considered the Housing Act 1996 four years ago, along with the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts)—asked my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry whether his children play rugby football for Wales. My mother did not play rugby football for Wales, but she took part in the first by-election after Munich, which occurred in Brecon, from which she takes her title. On one occasion, she took a large number of interruptions from the back of the hall from someone who was clearly a miner from County Durham. After several interruptions, my mother put down the piece of paper that she was holding and said that she had been happy to take interventions from the gentleman from Durham who had been asking why anyone should listen to a woman from London. She said quietly that her father had played scrum half for Wales and that if the gentleman at the back could claim a similar provenance, she was prepared to take further interruptions from him, but that her qualifications for speaking were probably rather better than his. My qualifications for speaking on Welsh matters are not inexhaustible and the Under-Secretary of State, Wales Office, need not think that I shall expand our debates on those subjects.
<P>
In response to my speech on Second Reading, the Education Minister kindly said that he would write to me about the points that I raised. I am not fussed that I have not heard from him yet, although the communication might be on its way.
<P>
On Second Reading, I mentioned that, as recently as 27 March, the figure of £5 billion was still being reported on the Department for Education and Employment website. I gather that, this week, officials have said that that should be £6 billion. I am happy to believe that and to give the Government the benefit of the doubt and accept that the sixth form figure was responsible for the discrepancy. I realise that the sixth form details do not need finally to be settled until a year or 18 months from now. As I am the oldest member of the Committee, I can temporarily play the role of the Dodo in ``Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' and agree that all have won and all shall have prizes. Although clarification from the Minister's lips would be helpful, I do not propose to return to the issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> It is important that we should now proceed and scrutinise the Bill. Several important points have been raised and I am tempted to respond to some of the concerns, which are, with all due respect, ill-informed, not least on our intentions for the ConneXions service and sixth form education. We regard that highly and our policy concern is to level up funding, in light of the discrepancies between school sixth forms, sixth form colleges and further education provision.
<P>
In view of the need to get on with scrutiny of the Bill, I shall not, if the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster will forgive me, respond in much detail to his important comments about the state of English cricket. A Minister inevitably focuses rather more on the early clauses and I think that those on English cricket must be in part VI—although the links between skills and training and the state of English cricket are obvious and therefore relevant. I am told that there must be a connection, in that, if I have understood the right hon. Gentleman's argument, F.R. Brown was born in Peru, the right hon. Gentleman's constituency is adjacent to Paddington, and Paddington bear came from Peru. I hope that I have followed the argument correctly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> The connection that I had in mind was that my honeymoon was in Peru. However, I am grateful to the Minister for introducing the Paddington element. Paddington station is in my constituency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> With bad luck, this could run and run.
<P>
I was struck by the reference from the Opposition Benches to older relatives. You may or may not know, Mr. Benton, that I am running a competition to discover England's oldest learner. It is necessary to be 85 or over to qualify, and I should be happy to send application forms to Committee members who think that a relative might qualify.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am disappointed that the Minister did not choose to respond to key issues that we raised. They will be raised again during our proceedings.
<P>
The amendments are connected. The principles are straightforward. Through amendments Nos. 16, 18 and 19, we want to reduce the centralisation that the Government seem determined on, by devolving power to the regions of England and not holding everything centrally. Amendment No. 17 would make consultation with the regional development agencies and local authorities mandatory and not optional, as it is currently. We want to reduce bureaucracy, by removing at least one tier of organisation; to ask the Minister for clarification about other tiers; to rationalise existing structures; to have greater regional and local autonomy; and to prepare the way for democratic accountability through future regional government. The amendments are far reaching.
<P>
Nobody could disagree that the Bill contains enormous centralising powers. Anybody who considers it and the Government's record will be aware that they have been the most centralising Government in a long while. The Department for Education and Employment has taken into its control additional expenditure worth £6 billion and is taking over duties and responsibilities for school sixth forms, adult and community education and the youth service. In addition, it is extending its other means of control of education with a £4 billion extension of the standards fund and other centralised sources of funding. We are considering devolving power to the most appropriate level—in this case, the regions.
<P>
The Government said on page 20 of their White Paper on post-16 education that the current organisation is a

<P>
We agree totally with that, but we seem to have had little but an attack on the training and enterprise councils and the creation of structures that are a smokescreen for giving the Secretary of State central control.
<P>
The Bill will result in a central Learning and Skills Council and 47 local learning and skills councils. The local councils will have virtually no powers unless the Secretary of State says that they may have them. The Secretary of State must agree their plans. They will have almost no funding arrangements—funds will be at the courtesy of the Secretary of State and the central council.
<P>
There will be 45 small business service areas, largely mirroring the sub-regional learning and skills organisations, which will take over from the plethora of different organisations. We broadly support the move—the provision of a Small Business Service makes reasonable sense.
<P>
The Government might not retain the 150 local education authorities. The Chancellor's statement on funding schools directly from the centre through the introduction of the standards fund and other mechanisms suggests that the LEAs are on the way out. We do not know what role they will have. They certainly will not be a mandatory consultee for the Learning and Skills Council or the sub-regional organisations.
<P>
The 103 local learning partnerships are not mentioned in the Bill, except by default. They have no place in the structure. They were created by the present Government, yet three years later they still are not part of the formal structure. What will happen to them? Where do they fit? Where is the democracy and the local accountability? It must be floating about somewhere.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
The other organisation is the careers service. The 66 careers service areas underpin the whole of lifelong learning, but they are not coterminous with local authorities, sub-regional councils, regional development agencies or anything else. Each of those other groups has its own organisation. Clause 1 gives the Government the opportunity to reorganise the structure—to make it simple, effective coterminous, and to ensure regional and local accountability.
<P>
The amendments pose the question, why not use the RDA structure to deliver lifelong learning? Why does not the Bill act as a building block for the future? The Regional Development Agencies Act 1998 set up nine agencies. They got off to a splendid start. They are responsible for the economic generation of their respective regions, yet they do not have the direct connection with the Learning and Skills Council that is necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden </B>(Blackpool, South): I have been listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman's rather lurid and florid attack. The fact that the Government set up the RDAs seems to have been forgotten. Does he not agree that he and the hon. Member for Hallam may, as Yorkshiremen, be blinded to the fact that the RDAs in some parts of the country—not Yorkshire, I hasten to add—are extremely inchoate? It would be foolish to define in the Bill an organic relationship that will inevitably change? The agencies will develop at different paces, and the Government will note their strengths and weaknesses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am surprised at that intervention. The hon. Gentleman will realise, when he reads his comments in Hansard, that what he said is nonsense. First, I am a Lancastrian, not a Yorkshireman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Marsden:</B> What is the difference?
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> It depends on which way you are going.
<P>
How can one argue that the new organisation should not be based on the RDA areas while saying that 47 sub-regional councils will be based on them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> As I am a Yorkshireman, may I ask whether the hon. Gentleman agrees that there is nothing at all organic about the region of Yorkshire and the Humber, least of all in cricket?
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I shall desist from making cricket analogies. However, I accept that Yorkshire is an exceedingly good cricketing area.
<P>
I take seriously what the hon. Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden) said, but he should remember that it was the present Government who introduced the Act that set up the regional development agencies. If the RDAs are flawed, it is due to a Labour Government. However, we agree with the Government about RDAs.
<P>
The hon. Member for Blackpool, South is right that it will be more difficult in some areas to get the sort of homogeneity that we have in Yorkshire and the Humber. Despite the comments of the hon. Member for Hertsmere, Yorkshire Forward has made a tremendous start in representing the region and it looks forward to increasing its gross domestic product. We argue that it should have the tools to do the job. We want our region to be used as the basis for dealing with the skills agenda not simply at level 2 or 3 but at university, at level 4 and at postgraduate level.
<P>
Instead of one centralised organisation being situated in London, with the Secretary of State's placemen on it, why cannot every region have a separate learning and skills council? In the debate on the Bill in the House of Lords, Baroness Blackstone said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In providing for nine separate regional councils they would increase the number of NDPBs significantly, and so require the continuous re-inventing of wheels as the separate regional councils strive independently of each other—or indeed worse, in competition with each other—to identify ways of tackling common problems. That cannot make sense.—[Official Report, House of Lords, 8 February 2000; Vol. 609, c.519.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is centralisation taken to its logical conclusion. The Government's response, in reality, is, ``We mustn't have diversity. The regions are all the same, there isn't a north-south divide.'' There is nothing that does not come from London, from the Secretary of State or from the Prime Minister. We cannot have that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hilary Benn:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> In a moment. The hon. Member for Leeds, East should know that some of issues—
<P>
<B>Mr. Benn:</B> Leeds, Central.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I apologise to the hon. Gentleman, I should have said Leeds, Central; it was most remiss of me. The hon. Member for Leeds, Central (Mr. Benn) should know more than anyone else that the problems in his constituency are different from those in the south-west. We want diversity; even Chris Woodhead, the Chief Inspector of Schools, says that he wants diversity. We want power to be given to the people so that they can have a say in how their local learning and skills council develops. I hope that the Minister will explain why there must be central control and why people in the regions cannot be trusted.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I listened carefully to the arguments advanced by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough. Although I do not support the amendment, and I do not agree with all his arguments, the hon. Gentleman made some important points. I do not share his enthusiasm for regionalism, which is a genuine political difference between us. The regions would not be the appropriate bodies to deal with learning and skills, not least because, as the hon. Gentleman said, there is doubt about whether Yorkshire and Humber, for example, is an organic region. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the slogan of the regional development agency, ``Yorkshire forward.'' I am not sure that it is greeted with universal enthusiasm in North Lincolnshire, the Humber part of the Yorkshire and Humber region.
<P>
In my constituency, which is in Hertfordshire, there is doubt that the region is the appropriate body to deliver learning and skills. Hertfordshire is part of what is described as the Eastern region; my constituents who commute 20 miles to London every day are part of a region that includes Norfolk and Suffolk. They have great affection for Norfolk—many of them take their holidays there—but Hertfordshire has little in common with the county. Training requirements in Norfolk will differ considerably from those of people in Borehamwood and Potters Bar in my constituency.
<P>
The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough mentioned centralisation, bureaucracy and the loss of local autonomy, important matters that were dealt with in another place. We shall return time and again to those issues, not least in respect of the Bill's democratic deficit. Centralisation is the right description of the top-down structure proposed in the Bill, because all power and authority will emanate from the Secretary of State. Members of the central Learning and Skills Council, whether there are 12, 16 or another number, will be appointed by the Secretary of State, as will the chairman and the chief executive under schedule 1. The Learning and Skills Council will not even be allowed to appoint its own chief executive—the Secretary of State will do that. The 47 local learning and skills councils will be appointed by the national Learning and Skills Council.
<P>
As the hon. Gentleman said, the Secretary of State's powers will ensure that those 47 councils are under his thumb. The Bill does not allow democracy to intrude—it is centralised, top-down and under the Secretary of State's control. The Secretary of State is not even required to consult other bodies—I note amendments tabled by Liberal Democrat Members requiring such consultation. Clause 1(3) merely states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In appointing a member the Secretary of State must have regard to the desirability of appointing a person who has experience relevant to the Council's functions.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I would hope that the Secretary of State would not consider doing otherwise. A Secretary of State could hardly be subject to a balder requirement—of course he will appoint someone of relevant experience. However, what will that experience be, and who else will have a say? Those are the important issues.
<P>
There have been occasions during this Parliament when I have been tempted to ask Labour Members to perform a role reversal. What would they have said if the previous Government had produced such a centralising Bill? There would have been howls and protests. The Bill suffers from a serious democratic deficit. The hon. Gentleman made his arguments well in that respect. We shall return to this matter time and again. More democratic accountability in the Bill would produce a better, less bureaucratic structure. We wait to see how the Minister will counter those arguments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): I shall speak briefly to the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough and me.
<P>
In the context of RDAs, the hon. Member for Blackpool, South spoke about regions evolving, which is not relevant to the agenda of RDAs. It is more relevant to the Government's view of regional assemblies. It would be desirable if the Welsh tripartite model were followed, whereby a democratically elected assembly, regional development agency and regional body responsible for lifelong learning worked together, and accountability ultimately rested in the assembly. We have not chosen to table amendments along such lines today. The RDAs are not inchoate or evolving—they have statutory responsibilities under the 1998 Act. No part of the country has an RDA that is different from those in other areas—certain regions may have a stronger identity, such as Yorkshire, but an RDA's functions in a region with less identity are exactly equivalent. No other body has those functions. There is no evolution.
<P>
The Government set up RDAs for the purposes of economic regeneration. We want them to be linked to learning and skills councils, which will have a major role in regional development. The bulk of objective 1 programmes to develop the south Yorkshire economy will be focused on education and training. Increasing the skills of the work force is a major part of development. It therefore seems illogical not to have a direct link between the body that has the primary responsibility for regional economic development and the body that will deliver education and training funding. That is clearer and more consistent than the Government's proposal for a separate structure with separate accountability from the RDA structure, which was only recently set up.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> On Second Reading, I referred to the role that training and enterprise councils had played in economic regeneration. Under the present dispensation, that is a role for the RDAs, but I suspect that small and medium-sized enterprises will look more to the learning and skills councils, because the funding lies with that body, not with the RDAs. I appreciate that the Liberal Democrats are in favour of RDAs, and their argument is comprehensible, not least in order to involve RDAs more.
<P>
I approve of the view that the Minister expressed that he should utter on matters as the clauses arise. That is logical, but I look forward to hearing why the Government are convinced that their scheme is a bottom-„up scheme. I fear that those on the Opposition Benches—I include the Liberal Democrats—regard it as a top-down scheme.
<P>
The Government have decided that 16 people should serve on the central council. I had the pleasure and privilege to know well the late, great John Garnett, former director of the Industrial Society, who took the view that, in terms of the ability to lead human groups, there was much to be said for the number that Our Lord had selected as his disciples. The maximum figure should be 15, as in a rugger side—John Garnett was not such an enthusiast for cricket as I am.
<P>
The Government have decided on 16, which takes us above the size of a rugger side. They might wonder why I have not tabled a probing amendment: the Liberal Democrats have enabled me to make the point that a council of 20 would not have been too large and would have afforded a greater opportunity to bring in the ranges of experience that such a body will need. As the Liberal Democrats have not proposed that the figure should move from 16 to 20, in this regard there is a degree of mutual internal self-contradiction in the amendment. The insistence that the Government consult any number of people before choosing them is made more difficult by having 16 rather than a larger number. There is no doubt that a larger number provides greater flexibility.
<P>
I shall not weary the Committee by describing the tests that I was set by the former Prime Minister to make recommendations for the Millennium Commission, where three people were appointed by the two major parties—two by the Government and one by the Opposition. For the remaining six places, he gave me some 15 different specifications that he wanted satisfied by those six people. Broadly speaking, we achieved what he was seeking. The Millennium Commission has stood the test of time. One of the landowners who was appointed has been knighted—presumably on the recommendation of the present Government—for his contribution to the commission. The commission has done well, but I think that a larger council would have been better. Had it been larger, it would have chimed more easily with the amendments that the Liberal Democrats have tabled.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I greatly enjoyed the discussion about the numbers of people serving on different bodies. In addition to you, Mr. Benton, there are 21 members of the Committee, so we can at least participate in some action research over the coming weeks to see how the number works in practice.
<P>
In not responding to the important points made by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough, I meant him and the Committee no discourtesy. He tempted us towards a Second Reading. We had a good Second Reading with excellent contributions from all sides. The Committee has the opportunity to consider the matters in the detail that they deserve.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 16, 17, 18 and 19 are linked in the proposition that, instead of a unitary body with 47 local learning and skills councils, we should have nine regional councils. We have already had those proposals from the Liberal Democrats in another place. The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough will not be surprised to learn that the Government's position has not changed.
<P>
The Bill represents the foundation for a framework to help us to identify the needs of the nation for learning and skills development and to create an organisation that is fit to ensure that the needs are met. Important work towards achieving that is already in hand. For example, the national skills task force has identified crucial areas for improvement in basic and key skills in intermediate, technical and supervisory sectors and in information technology. A national focus is needed. The Learning and Skills Council as a single organisation with a comprehensive remit to plan and fund post-16 learning provision across the board will take the challenge forward.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Willis:</B> The Minister has neglected one of our arguments that a vision of education and training should not just be about those who have not achieved even low-level skills. We accept what the learning and skills task force says about the need to equip those with few skills or no skills whatever. However, we must also continue to equip those already in work with the skills necessary for them to move on. If we limit our vision to dealing with the lowest generic skills, we shall miss a marvellous opportunity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The example I gave about basic and key skills was only one of many that I could have given about the need for a national strategy and focus. I agree with the hon. Gentleman about the wider issue, and the Bill agrees with him, as it provides a range of education and training opportunities for post-16s. Some opportunities are at the highest level, so we do not disagree with the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 16, 18 and 19 would remove the Learning and Skills Council's capacity to tackle issues on a national basis. Our arrangements contain a significant regional dimension and an influential role for RDAs, which it would be helpful to spell out. The Bill and further details published in the LSC prospectus set out the close relationship that the LSC at national and local levels will have with RDAs.
<P>
First, we hope that councils at national and local levels will include a senior RDA figure. Secondly, at national level, the LSC will be required to consult RDAs in drawing up guidance to local learning and skills councils. With all due respect to the hon. Gentleman, when he scrutinises the Bill in greater detail—clause 21, in particular—he will see that consultation with RDAs is built into the provisions. Thirdly, local learning and skills councils will be required to consult RDAs in drawing up their plans and to have regard to RDAs' regional and sub-regional economic strategies in doing so. Fourthly, RDAs will assess local plans and advise the national LSC that they are consistent with regional strategies. Fifthly, local learning and skills councils will work closely with RDAs and national training organisations—another important part of our structure—to develop appropriate skill packages.
<P>
At both national and local level, the regional skills strategies of RDAs will therefore inform, complement and be integrated with the LSC's plans and strategies. In turn, the LSC's lead in learning and skills issues will support the RDAs' work in sustainable economic development, regeneration and social inclusion. We need to strike a sensible balance between viewing skills in relation to the national strategy for economic development, to the regional dimension and to the impact on economic development of local skill needs which, we argue in the Bill, should be reflected through local learning and skills councils.
<P>
I had to contrast our approach, which combines the best of the regional and local dimensions, with the hon. Gentleman's amendments, which go much too far and would sweep away the significant benefits that will accrue from the more coherent national arrangements that we envisage. Our proposals will also provide local learning and skills councils with wide representation from outstanding people from many walks of life who have the relevant expertise to ensure that Government-supported learning meets the needs of individuals, communities and businesses locally.
<P>
Some skill needs are apparent at the most local level, and certainly at a sub-regional level, and can best be assessed by local learning and skills councils. They might be missed if a regional dimension alone held sway. One of the regions with which I am most familiar is the south-east. Despite the south-east RDA's excellent work, I cannot begin to imagine how it could have the local knowledge and intelligent systems fully to understand what can sometimes be quite micro-needs, for which a rapid response is often required. However, the local learning and skills council could. Sometimes, small truly is beautiful—and on that note I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I have never been described as small and beautiful—or either—but merely perfectly formed.
<P>
The Minister deludes himself if he believes that a sub-regional council of the size proposed will be local; it will not. What will be the role of local learning partnerships, which were created to do exactly that reconnoitre of local skills needs? Is that not exactly what the small business service will do, too? What will local learning and skills councils do that will add value?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The question obviously arises of how local a particular learning and skills council will be, as we may discuss, and, given the urban and economic geography in this country, some will be larger than others. It was more difficult to determine their size in Greater London, with which I am familiar, than in some shire counties, as is to some extent inevitable. However, it is plain common sense that, regardless of the difficulties involved—which we must crack, through the membership of the learning and skills council and the intelligent systems available for assessing local skill needs—learning and skills councils have more chance of doing that, to put it mildly, than would large regions if they were doing the work, which is what the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough seems to be arguing.
<P>
We place much emphasis on local learning partnerships, and, although they are relatively new animals, they are already doing much good work, and we regard them as helpful in assessing needs. Learning partnerships are essentially partnerships of providers, from schools, FE colleges and elsewhere, and we regard their role as helping us intelligently examine current provision and, where necessary, themselves making proposals for rationalisation and co-„ordination. We are determined to ensure a good fit between the role of learning partnerships and that of learning and skills councils.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 16, 18 and 19 would provide an inferior model to that which the Government propose. I hope that, having listened to what I believe has been a good discussion from—I cannot say both sides, as that would be immodest, but I hope that I am doing my best—at least one side of the Committee, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will consider withdrawing the amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 17 is inappropriate. We understand only too well the value of consultation. That is why we have sought to engage key partners in defining the criteria and job specifications for the LSC chair and members of the council. We have said repeatedly that Nolan principles will apply throughout the LSC appointments process and I am sure that all members of the Committee agree that that is right and proper. All appointments must be conducted in an open and transparent manner and on merit, which is why an independent assessor will be involved in the sift panels, making recommendations to the Secretary of State.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Does the Minister accept that we are concerned about such matters because of the recent revelations about, for example, appointments within the national health service? They suggest that serious problems exist that give rise to genuine concern about what has happened since the Government took office. For the Minister just to say ``Nolan'' is not enough to satisfy Opposition Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The Nolan principles are a guiding star. I assure the Committee that our only aim is to achieve a range of experience from the business men and women of this country and from other sectors to help us with such a difficult task. I give an absolute guarantee that we recognise that many of them will have no political affiliation, whereas others will have affiliations that are well known to us. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we want good people, regardless of their political party. I have recently written to all Members of Parliament asking them to recommend to those whom they know who could do a good job to apply to join learning and skills councils. We need much talent from many quarters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I accept the Minister's bona fides in the matter of appointments. Will he reflect on the answer that he gave to me recently about appointments to further education corporations? He said—and rightly so—that the political affiliation of those nominated has never been collected. If we are anxious to sharpen up on the Nolan principles, is it not right to be looking at that test, too, to satisfy everyone that everything is carried out openly and transparently?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I remember the hon. Gentleman's question. I set aside about a hour each day to answer the important questions that he asks as part of his responsibility to scrutinise the Government. My answer was that we do not track political affiliations. I want to be straight about the matter and, although I can give no promises about administration, I do promise to re-examine the issue to see whether, without imposing unnecessary bureaucracy—we would not want to be attacked for that—some monitoring could take place without too much trouble, so that not only will justice be done, it will be seen to have been done. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we shall look at the matter and communicate our deliberations to him and to other members of the Committee.
<P>
If we were to impose a requirement on the Secretary of State to consult specified bodies about the appointments, we are worried that that would be taken as a signal that he is willing to disregard Nolan principles and be influenced by other factors. We have said repeatedly that we expect the majority of those serving on LSCs to speak on behalf of the consumers—individuals and employers—in the learning system. We want to appoint the very best people to the LSCs from the candidates. We want to ensure that all members serve the interests of the LSC as a whole, rather than being representatives who speak on behalf of individual organisations. That is an important distinction to make. That is our intention and it is the reason why we reject the amendment. For those reasons, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I thank the Minister for his courteous and detailed response to our amendment We are not satisfied with it, however, because there is a point of principle between us. We might return to it on Report, but for now I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 2, in page 1, line 11, leave out from `State' to end of line 12.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 3, in page 1, line 12, after `as', insert `the first'.
<P>
No. 5, in schedule 1, page 58, line 9, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3A) The first chairman is to be appointed by the Secretary of State and to hold and vacate office in accordance with the terms of his appointment.
<P>
(3B) Each subsequent chairman is to be appointed by the Council on such terms as it determines.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My remarks on the subject of appointments to the chair of the council will not be protracted, and I recognise that there is no absolute science on the subject. It is hardly likely that a Secretary of State will not interest himself or herself to some extent in what is going on in the council, and it is clearly important that a chairman be compatible and congenial so that there is a good working relationship.
<P>
When I had the Minister's responsibilities, I had some for higher education too, and so dealt with the Further Education Funding Council and the Higher Education Funding Council for England. I had the most excellent service in relation to further education from Bob Gunn and Sir William Stubbs as chairman and chief executive respectively. I appointed neither of them—I inherited them—but they were excellent public officials, and I do not want any remarks that I make to be construed in any way as critical of them or the staff of the council. In fairness, I remind the Committee that on Second Reading, the Secretary of State rightly gave an encomium to the FEFC and its current leadership. We are not trying to get at individuals or arrangements now in place, or to subvert the Minister's process of appointment of council members based on public advertisements, and we are grateful for his efforts in trying to canvass people.
<P>
We need the Minister to pause for a moment or two, as we want to ensure the best possible quality of people. At the same time, we want to see that the Secretary of State or Ministers in the Department are not in a position to exercise undue influence on them. The proper role of Ministers is to set up ground rules, as we did in the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, and then to stand back from the process as much as is reasonably possible.
<P>
I am not here to generate heat on the Government Benches this morning. If I were to criticise the Government structurally, I would say that they have a tendency towards micro-management and interference with their officials, which is not always to be appreciated. I shall not go on about it, but I sometimes find that the idea of the Secretary of State for Health running the national health service or announcing yet another initiative is not always appropriate. Ministers and Government should stand or fall by the systems that they set up, and should have an adult relationship with people who serve in them.
<P>
I have conceded that there is inevitably an interface with Ministers—the Minister is nodding—and we must see how it should be derived. For the avoidance of doubt, I should say that we have moved on and that the matter is impossible to disentangle. Being mindful of your strictures, Mr. Benton, I would not want the Minister to disentangle the issue of the chairman of the council from that of the chief executive, with whom, strictly speaking, no amendment deals at the moment. It would help if the Minister could rehearse his thinking about that duet, if I may put it that way, and how the two of them are to work.
<P>
The amendments would make formal provisions. Amendment No. 2 would withdraw the Secretary of State from the process of the chairman's appointment altogether. Amendment No. 3 is a variant, intended to accommodate points made in another place about the possibility of the Secretary of State making the initial appointment, with subsequent appointments being made by the council from among its members. Amendment No. 5 is somewhat adrift because on closer perusal—having borrowed some wording helpfully provided from the Minister's schedule in relation to the chief executive—I have managed to muddle up the provisions of the chairman with those that are directed towards the chief executive. I hope that it will be easier for the Minister to reply to our concerns in relation to the chairman and the chief executive.
<P>
Whatever the form of the amendment or defects, in the case of amendment No. 5—the points that we are driving at are simple. For the council to be successful, it must have credibility. It must have high-quality people—those who command the confidence of the sector and the providers of education and training that they are of a high standard and that they are not the poodles or lapdogs of Government policies. It will be necessary from time to time to stand up to Ministers; they would be expected to do that, and it would be their duty to do so. That is important. Their rights will be protected under statute; their duties will be prescribed under statute.
<P>
The Secretary of State must stand back from that process to some extent, as he does even more explicitly in relation to higher education. We are bound to be sceptical until the Minister can answer successfully why he or his successors need to be directly involved in the process of the selection and nomination of a chairman and chief executive. The Government may need to get things going and to satisfy themselves that they have got the right people to start with, but it is not at all clear why, once the machinery is up and running, such functions should not be remitted elsewhere. There are not precise analogies to be made with a commercial company, but usually the chairman would be selected by the board and would have to command the confidence of that board. Any suggestion that the chairman was imposed from outside—for example, by a majority shareholder where there is still a significant Government shareholding—might well cause that confidence to evaporate. Therefore, the power or authority of the chairman or chief executive is not necessarily strengthened by the fact that they have been vetted by, put forward by, or even nominated by the Secretary of State. There is no exact science in this area.
<P>
Tensions are bound to arise. I am aware of what happened and I refreshed my memory by looking at the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. Obviously, at that time we explicitly took the power to nominate. Can the Minister explain, first, why he wants to configure things in that way and, secondly, what will be in his mind when selecting such persons for those two positions? What criteria will he wish to adopt? Will those vary at the time according to the development of this policy—not now, but perhaps on the first change of chief executive or chairman in a year or two's time? If the Minister can satisfy us that he has gone about this in a businesslike way, I shall not press the amendment to a Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I wish to make several points in support of the hon. Member for Daventry, who has put forward a good case. They concern, in particular, the nature of the people who are likely to be recruited to the Learning and Skills Council. The Minister has already said that the Government will be scurrying far and wide throughout the Kingdom looking for the best sorts of people, and if my local regional development agency is anything to go by, they will end up with some high-calibre people. We have chief executives of large businesses, for example, on the RDA for Yorkshire and the Humber, so I hope that we can see similar people on the LSC.
<P>
Questions must be raised about the extent to which one could foresee a situation in which the members of that board—people used to dealing in their own way with serious decision-making processes—have a chairman imposed on them. Many of them would feel uncomfortable about that and would be much more comfortable with the idea of electing their own chairman. If the individual chosen by the Secretary of State does not command the confidence of every one of them, that would create problems—it would not be an effective, functioning council.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The other point is that of independence, which the hon. Member for Daventry raised. The LSC may at some point wish to demonstrate independence from Government. I imagine that one of its roles would be to lobby, particularly for resources—it would be natural for it to lobby hard for more resources, for example where it identifies a skill shortage that is not filled within the existing framework. It is a natural suspicion that having the Secretary of State appoint the chairman might muzzle the LSC, and that the person appointed might therefore feel an obligation to toe the line of the Secretary of State on some of the sensitive issues; that is indeed a worrying possibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> Would my hon. Friend comment on the setting up of the police authorities? The previous Government tried to do exactly what the Secretary of State is trying to do now—to appoint centrally. There was a huge outcry about that by members of the Labour party when they were in opposition, but in the event police authorities successfully choose their own chairman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> My hon. Friend is right; the police authority experiment shows that when people are put on to a body—largely in a voluntary capacity—they expect to have the freedom to choose their own chairman and will function only in an environment where they can do so. People do not have to participate in the bodies; they choose to give of their time and, as is entirely appropriate, they expect some power over their own destiny. Selecting the chairman is a crucial element of that. I hope that the Minister will explain how he expects the Secretary of State to make the appointment. In the context of experiences where such an arrangement has not worked, will the Secretary of State be expected to take soundings and effectively have the board choose its own chairman, which he will then rubber-stamp, or will he try to intervene in the ways that we are worried that he may wish to do?
<P>
I also hope that the Minister can answer the point about independence. An example of a good independent person appointed by Government is the chief inspector of prisons, who has no fear of visiting prisons and saying what he considers to be good and bad—saying that the Government need to spend more money on sorting out slopping out, for example. Some functions within public policy are entirely state-owned but have within them people who are able to act independently. The LSC will not deal with quite the same issues, but I hope that it will have a level of independence whereby the council will want to stand up and be counted when things go wrong.
<P>
The Minister should recognise that there may in future be a Government of a different colour, who may not give the LSC the priority that he hopes that his Government will give it. If that happens, the Minister should feel proud that he has created a framework for a strong, independent chairman who will stand up on behalf of the consumers about whom the Minister has spoken—those who wish to learn and employers who wish to employ skilled people—when a Government deny the LSC the resources that it feels that it needs. Independence is very important. I look forward to hearing the Minister's attempt to satisfy us on it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> In J.J. Warr mode, I shall live up to my commitment to speak only in brief bursts. I understand amendment No. 5. The Government have been afforded the responsibility of choosing the first chairman; I support the proposal for the subsequent arrangements. That notable figure, Sir Leonard Peach, who performed the function of Grand Vizier, or the conscience of the Nolan principles, said in my hearing—when I was in a former capacity—in talking about the preparation that education gives for later life, that what business looked for in those whom it recruited might be compared to wild duck flying in formation; he went on to expand on why that is so. If a council is chosen on that basis—which I would welcome—it would be a mistake for the Government to choose the principal wild duck to organise the formation. There is no clear evidence when you look at wild ducks flying in formation that the Almighty has selected a particular duck; it is much more likely that a particular duck has evolved from within the group.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Purchase </B>(Wolverhampton, North-East): I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to be robust in replying. The hon. Member for Daventry said it all in his first sentence: these are not entirely scientific matters. The amendments do little to improve the quality of what is in the Bill. Indeed, a sensible Secretary of State will consult widely in ensuring that the right person does a particular job.
<P>
I would urge my hon. Friend the Minister to say, when talking about the accountability of a Government, that initially that must be expressed in the judgment of the Secretary of State and the people whom he chooses to carry out important tasks. The Secretary of State is entrusted with his job. He will consult widely, and I urge the Minister to recognise that independence is a great state of mind for those who have no firm views. There are firm views on both sides of the Committee. Ultimately, however, accountability must lie directly with the Secretary of State in choosing the person to carry out that job.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I feel that the proof of the pudding will be in the eating and I look forward to an occasion when we are able to announce who is leading not only the national council but local councils and the range of people that we have managed to attract to this rather challenging task. I hope that, at that stage, people will see that our intentions were indeed honourable. It might help if I send not only the hon. Member for Daventry but all members of the Committee our specifications for the job descriptions, and we undertake to do so. I hope that Committee members will see from those that we are anxious to attract the very best person to undertake this task. Indeed, some will find the job description so attractive that they may themselves be attracted. I understand that the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975 means that hon. Members cannot apply. However, despite that, we will search for the very best.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I take it that the Minister is referring to those hon. Members who are not already too busy being on the board of directors of famous department stores.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I shall not follow that, Mr. Benton.
<P>
The amendments all relate to the Secretary of State's role in the appointment of the chair of the council. There are good arguments in principle as to why the chair of the LSC should always be appointed by the Secretary of State. I will set those out when dealing with amendment No. 3. I note the comment that the hon. Member for Daventry made about his amendment No. 5. However, let me dwell for a moment on the immediate effect of amendment No. 2. It would give responsibility to the council alone for appointing its own chair, right from the outset.
<P>
There are important practicalities here. It is vital that a chair is appointed very early on to take responsibility for a range of issues associated with the establishment of the Learning and Skills Council. We also wish to involve him or her in the appointment of the chief executive, as it is obviously of paramount importance that there is a good working relationship between chair and chief executive. Together they will prepare the council to take on its responsibilities and ensure that plans for the council's first operational year are drawn up.
<P>
If we wait until all council members are appointed before there is a chairman or chairwoman in place to lead these activities, we shall inevitably build delay into the process of making the LSC fully functional and put at risk a smooth transition to the new arrangements. Amendment No. 2 is therefore unacceptable to us for those practical reasons, and perhaps for other reasons, too.
<P>
On the issue of principle—whether the Secretary of State should appoint the chair of the Learning and Skills Council—I should like to deal with amendment No. 3, which would restrict the Secretary of State's right of appointment to the first chair and would thereafter transfer responsibility for appointing the chair to the council itself.
<P>
I hope that no one would dispute that the role and task of the chair is a significant undertaking. The LSC will have an extremely broad and challenging canvas in taking over functions of 16 to 19 education and training, as well as adult training. That is no small task, and that is reflected in the proposed budget of around £6 billion a year. The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster will be receiving a letter on that arithmetic soon. Indeed, it has been dispatched. The Secretary of State is ultimately accountable to Parliament for the performance of the LSC and that includes expenditure. My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East (Mr. Purchase) made some points about that accountability.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> For the record, may I check that the chief executive remains the accounting officer for the accounts of the LSC itself?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Yes, that is the case. It is therefore vital that in establishing the new Learning and Skills Council we build a close working relationship between DFEE Ministers and its members. That must apply in particular to the working relationship between Ministers and the chair of the LSC. Indeed, in the very reasonable way in which the hon. Gentleman proposed his amendment, he recognised the need for that relationship between the Minister and the chair of such organisations. We will want a direct working relationship on critical issues and a joint approach to the over-riding mission of improving standards and participation in learning in this country.
<P>
It is right in these circumstances that the chair of the council should be appointed by the Secretary of State. To do otherwise would undermine the important position of the chair itself. There is nothing exceptional in our approach to these issues, as I think hon. Members have recognised. The right of the Secretary of State to appoint the chair is a quite standard provision in legislation that establishes non-departmental public bodies, which the hon. Gentleman recognised when he recalled the work of the previous Government, such as section 1(2) of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. More recently, the provisions for the establishment and constitution of regional development agencies under the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998 follow that example.
<P>
For those reasons, I cannot accept that our position is wrong and I hope, given the assurances that I have offered and the arguments that I have presented, that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That has been a helpful set of assurances from the Minister. He has at least expressed some of his thinking, although we look forward to studying the job specification that he has established. That will probably give us a bit more information about the kind of person he seeks. I am minded to withdraw the amendment and not to press it to a vote now, but perhaps I can ask for one further reassurance. The Minister clearly had more sympathy with amendment No. 3 than with amendment No. 2. I am anxious to ensure that the members of the council could not feel that they were being trumped or put out because an outside person was appointed over their head as the chair, when a well-qualified person was already a member of the council. If there is a good person who has done good work within the council, will he be given every possible consideration?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> We are talking about when the learning and skills councils are underway. That is a perfectly sensible point. I am happy to give that assurance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> In the light of that assurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Further consideration adjourned—[Mr. Betts.]
<P>
Adjourned accordingly at one minute to One o'clock till Thursday 13 April at Nine o'clock.
