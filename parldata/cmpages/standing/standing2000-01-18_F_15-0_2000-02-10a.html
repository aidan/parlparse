<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Jeff Rooker):</B> I welcome you to the Chair, Mrs. Michie. By the time that Mrs. Adams joins us, we shall have enough Chairmen to sponsor an early-day motion. I hope that you enjoy the Committee as long as you are here; we have clearly put off Mr. Winterton after one sitting.
<P>
I shall continue exactly where I finished, which was considering the combined effect of amendments Nos. 188, 191, 192, 195, 235 and 251 to 254. Everyone, no matter their earnings, would be given more in state second pension than they would have received under the state earnings-related pension scheme. Everyone would benefit from the higher accrual rate on the first £9,500 because there would be no clawback on band 2.
<P>
We assume that amendment No. 258 was intended to achieve that aim, but the way in which it was drafted would lead to higher earners losing out without any corresponding gain to lower earners. That is a small point, and I do not criticise it. With a smaller band-to-earnings bracket, the full increase would not be clawed back, even from someone at the upper earnings limit of £26,000.
<P>
Under our proposals, those earning £21,600 would receive the same in state second pension as they would have done from SERPS. I shall come to the point raised by the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson) in due course. Under the formula suggested in the amendments, people on £21,600 would receive 17 per cent. more than they would have done under SERPS. Money would be redistributed the wrong way, towards the higher paid rather than the lower paid. In contrast, lower earners would get no more than the extra help that we propose. It would all be for the long-term cost of almost £3 billion.
<P>
Most higher earners are already contracted out of SERPS. The majority are in well-funded occupational schemes and personal pensions. We would give added help to moderate earners who contract out into funded schemes such as stakeholder pensions. The moderate earner definition is roughly £10,000 to £20,000.
<P>
The amendments would make the decision about contracting out much harder for people. Indeed, I think that that was the thrust of the remarks of the hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) when she grouped some amendments. The idea was to give people an incentive not to contract out, but to stay in the second pension. We do not think that that helps. It is certainly contrary to the intention of the overall pension policy.
<P>
In contrast, amendments Nos. 230 and 232 would mean that, although moderate earners would receive more from the state second pension than under the Government's proposals, people earning more than £23,000 would receive less from the state second pension than they would have done from SERPS. We do not think that that is right either. So far as we can, we want to keep everything SERPS-neutral. The low earners—carers, disabled, those with broken records—need help to provide them with a decent income in retirement. Our proposals will do that while providing additional help to the moderate earners and maintaining the position of high earners, which is important.
<P>
I remind the Committee of the grand plan. When I began my speech, I mentioned that we wanted to change the ratio of state to private provision from 40:60 to 60:40, and this measure will fit with that. We have made no secret of the fact that, once people are no longer earning low wages, we shall want them to go into stakeholder or occupational pension schemes, or to make other second pension arrangements. We believe that that would be better. However, those who remain on the margin, for whom such decisions will be difficult, would lose substantially, and we believe that they would be better off with funded pensions.
<P>
I reinforce what I said this morning. The hon. Member for Beckenham said that our proposals would be a disincentive to earning more than £9,500. The chart from the Government Actuary's report that I have distributed to the Committee shows that people would still continue to gain, but at a lesser rate than if they were earning less than £9,500. Those who earn £10,000 would still continue to accrue more state second pension, but at a slower rate—10 per cent. instead of 40 per cent.—than on the first £9,500 of their earnings. It is not a hump.
<P>
We propose to provide a step up for everybody by giving the 40 per cent. accrual on the first £9,500, whether or not people earn more than that. Those who earn more will continue to accrue more state second pension. Overall, those earning up to the £21,600 limit will get more than they would have done under SERPS, and those earning over that limit will receive the same. As I said in response to the intervention of the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow), that is only the case in the first stage of the state second pension. In the second stage, those who contract out will continue to receive earnings-related rebates. The extra help for moderate earners will therefore continue, which is in line with the broad strategy.
<P>
The hon. Member for Tewkesbury asked about the chart that I distributed to hon. Members this morning. Up to £600 a week, which is about £30,000 a year, it still shows an apparent gain. One can see that SERPS has levelled out, because it has a maximum of about £124 a week. The chart is not misleading; it shows the assessments of the actuaries responsible. Before Christmas, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and I delivered a presentation in Westminster Hall on the state second pension and child support. I used some slides on that occasion, but I have not distributed them today because the Actuary's report is now in the public domain and that is more important. When we made that presentation, I showed the cut-off at £21,600, and I went no further.
<P>
By 2050, band 2 will have become compressed because its upper limit, which is £21,600, will have reached the upper earnings limit, which is price uprated, so there will not be a full claw back of the gain from the 40 per cent. band. It is possible that there could be ad hoc increases in the upper earnings limit above inflation as in recent Budgets, which could eliminate that effect. The problem is that some of the earnings limits are high, but the basic pension is calculated in line with prices. Even the limit of £9,500 is uprated in line with earnings. We are making assumptions. On our assumptions, we believe that there would be no gain from the state second pension for anyone earning more than £21,600, which is contrary to what the graph shows. That is based on the assumptions of the upper earnings limit and the compressing of the second band.
<P>
I am certainly not seeking to close the debate. I spoke in an earlier intervention about the totality of the Opposition's proposals. I say ``totality'', but one can mix and match, as the hon. Member for Beckenham said. I would not take a broad-brush approach and say that they would all work against the interests of low earners, but it depends on how they are compartmentalised.
<P>
Our intention is to shift the balance in favour of low earners, whereas the Opposition amendments would result in less provision for low earners, a bit more for moderate earners—people in band 2—and roughly the same, or slightly more, for higher earners, based on the latest figures. We do not believe that that is a better way to help lower earners.
<P>
I do not criticise the hon. Member for Beckenham. She said that her avowed intention was to provide an incentive for people with at least moderate earnings to remain in the state second pension scheme, which is directly opposed to our aim. Our intention is to ensure that the scheme is SERPS neutral and offers a bit more for moderate earners and no gain for higher earners, but provides a strong incentive for people who earn up to £20,000 to leave the state second pension scheme, with their earnings-related rebates, and join a stakeholder pension scheme.
<P>
<B>Miss Julie Kirkbride </B>(Bromsgrove): I am worried about how easy it will be for low earners to move to a different scheme when they become moderate earners. What will they be able to take with them, and to what extent will they be ghettoised because they have been on low earnings for some time, even though their earnings capacity has been transformed? How much flexibility will there be between the two systems to allow people to upgrade their pensionable rights?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Some assumptions must be made in answering those questions. I have been contradicted in the past when I have said that all high earners will at some time have been low earners, as it has been pointed out to me that some people start life as high earners, such as whizz kids, the landed gentry and the sort of people who would show me or the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) the door. [Laughter.] I was showing solidarity across the Floor.
<P>
By and large, the assumption is that most high earners have been low earners, but once people become high earners, they tend to stay moderate or high earners. I realise that they might fall back, especially if they are in heavy manual work in old-fashioned industries. The most problematic decisions will involve people at the margin, who earn £9,500 and reach £10,500 and believe that they will not earn much more, and might even drop back. Once people have left the state second pension scheme with their earnings-related rebates on the assumption that they are joining a stakeholder pension scheme or an employer's occupational pension scheme, by and large most of them will remain in that position. I am about to look round for a nod from my officials, but I believe that once people have left the state second pension they are unlikely to return. However, they may.
<P>
We want to encourage everyone to maintain the right to a second pension in addition to the basic state pension. People who will retain their entitlement to SERPS under the present system will be locked in and will have that as an additional pension. Some people who retire later this century will have a basic pension—a few people may still have graduated pensions, I suppose—and an additional pension that can be built up in two ways: SERPS and the state second pension, which together will form the additional pension.
<P>
People who leave the state second pension scheme will be able to take with them to a stakeholder or contracted-out occupational pension scheme their rebates from national insurance, so they would pay less national insurance, as is the case now. We can discuss the mechanism involved when we debate the relevant new clause at the end of our proceedings. It is not as though people will leave the state second pension scheme with nothing to take with them to put in their stakeholder or occupational pension pot. They will have their national insurance rebates, which, over a lifetime, can constitute a substantial contribution. They will not be cut adrift once they have left the state second pension scheme.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> My understanding of stakeholder pensions is that they are, at least to some extent, flexible with regard to reduced earnings and covering periods of unemployment.
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Oh, indeed. The stakeholder pension is designed to be so flexible that it can be switched on and off during the holder's working life, at will and at no cost. That applies whether it is being switched on or off and also when it is moved from one provider to another. One-off top-up payments can also be made, on top of anything that the holder has occasionally deducted from his or her earnings. It can cover periods when a holder wants to switch it off or if a holder is unemployed and wants to contribute. The holder does not have to be employed, because a stakeholder pension can be held when a person is not employed.
<P>
The stakeholder pension is extremely flexible and can be carried over from one firm to another. For people at the margin or for the holders of an occupational pension that cannot be taken to another job, a stakeholder pension can be switched off while they accrue benefits under the other pension. The calculating of resulting pension total at the end of their working life can be a bit complicated, but one thing is certain: the amount will be a bit more than income support. That is the beauty of being able to make sure that one is covered for a second pension, whatever one's working circumstances have been.
<P>
No one in any contracted-out employment will be worse off than he or she would have been under the state second pension because of the top-ups. That is the kind of thing that we will debate when we come to the new clause, which we have not yet tabled. If earnings drop below the £9,500 limit, the stakeholder pension, which will be topped up by the state second pension, can be retained or one can go back into the state second pension. The system is therefore very flexible. The assumption with the £9,500 limit is that a person is earning £9,500, which is the big difference between SERPS and the state second pension. That is why we were so conscious to ensure a low earners boost, which is very valuable for low earners, and that is why we wanted to ensure that the measure benefited low earners and did not get siphoned off to others.
<P>
<B>Mr. Desmond Swayne </B>(New Forest, West): I congratulate the Minister on his fair and lucid exposition of the clause and our amendments. However, notwithstanding what he said, and it having been some time since my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham moved the amendment, it is appropriate to remind my hon. Friends of the purpose of these amendments and to deal with their difficulty and technical complexity—there is no getting away from the fact that it is a difficult clause with difficult amendments. To test them out, I gave the clause and the amendments to my wife, who is something of an expert in pension matters, having sat an exam on pensions for the institute of insurers. I did not leave her alone with them; I also gave her the benefit of the explanatory notes. I draw the Committee's attention to the penultimate paragraph of page 60 of those notes, which begins
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``New section 45ZA(2) to (5)''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and then goes on, in some 200 words, to explain the clause. That is quite an achievement and it is fairly clearly written. I congratulate those who drafted it. Nevertheless, my wife made heavy weather of it.
<P>
Given some of the comments and questions raised by my hon. Friends during the exposition of my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham, I shall try swiftly to cover that ground in a slightly different way and to outline precisely the intention of our amendments. For seven years, between 1980 and 1987, I taught pure economics. Pure economics is the difficult bit—the bit with the sums in, such as the theory of diminishing marginal returns, the theory of firms' cost curves, and the relationship between marginal and average costs. I can honestly say that, if someone was prepared to pay a little attention to detail, I could ensure that they passed an exam in pure economics. I reckon that I could ensure that a labrador with, say, an IQ of about 70, passed it. If the Committee will bear with me, I shall attempt the same feat with my hon. Friends.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> What does my hon. Friend think of us?
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> I was casting no aspersions about the IQs of my hon. Friends. I was merely pointing out that even people of limited ability could perceive such matters. My hon. Friends should have no difficulty with the formula. On the face of it, it is intimidating, but it should not be so. I refer to table 1 at the bottom of page 26 of the Bill. As it stands, band 1 takes us to ``not exceeding LET''—the lower earnings threshold, which we know to be £9,500. It takes us from the qualifying earnings factor, which is the lower earnings threshold for national insurance contributions of £3,432 up to the LET at £9,500. That is a spread of income of some £6,068.
<P>
Amendment No. 201 would narrow that band of income from £6,068 to £5,068. That band of income is treated to an accrual rate of 40 per cent. plus 2N. Earlier, we heard grumbles about what on earth was meant by ``2N'', on which, I thought, the Minister gave a fair and lucid explanation. He said that it reflects the fact that SERPS, as currently constructed, is due to reduce from an accrual of 25 per cent. to 20 per cent. by 2009. The Bill includes a provision to reflect that, so there is a sliding scale to take us to 2009 where ``N'' is equal to 0.5 for every tax year in which a pensioner reached the age of retirement before 2009 and 2010.
<P>
What is extraordinary is that ``2N'' is in the Bill at all. If members of the Committee were to read politically correct history, they would discover that there was a wicked Government in the 1980s that adulterated the pensioners' strawberry jam with wooden pips and seized their benefits from them. Notwithstanding the undertaking in the Labour party's manifesto to preserve SERPS, the Government have decided to do away with it. However, the one bit that they have sought to preserve and have brought back into the Bill with the 2N provision is the reduction in accruals about which they complained so bitterly in the 1980s.
<P>
I shall move on to the next band of income. Band 2 deals with exceeding the lower earnings threshold, which is £9,500. However, for the purposes of my amendment, let us suppose that amendment No. 198 has been effected and that we are starting from a band of £8,500 with LET, and not exceeding 3LET-2QEF. Once again, let us not be intimidated by the formula: that is three times £9,500, which is £28,500, minus three times £3,432, which, of course, is [Interruption.]—no, two times £3,432 which is £6,864. Taking one from the other leaves us with an upper earnings threshold of £21,636.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Burstow </B>(Sutton and Cheam): I am enjoying the lesson so far, but I wish to clarify one point. The hon. Gentleman uses the £8,500 figure for the lower earnings threshold in one part of band 2, but uses £9,500 for the other. How can the two be reconciled?
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> The hon. Gentleman is correct. However, I took seriously the strictures of your predecessor, Mrs. Michie, who explained that it was appropriate to have a stand part debate in order to explain what the clause means before dealing with amendments that change it. I can explain to the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam that amendment No. 252 would alter the formula to 2LET, twice the lower earnings threshold, which, according to the amendments, would be £8,500 minus the QEF, which is £3,432. Twice £8,500 is £17,000, which, minus £3,432, gives us the much reduced upper end band figure of £13,568. The amendment would also narrow the second band of income. Whereas the original spread was from £12,136, amendment No. 252 would lower it to £5,068—exactly the same as the first band.
<P>
Amendment No. 188 would change the accrual formula from 10+N/2 to 20+N/2, which implies a cost. A more generous accrual is allowed for, but it applies to a lower level of income as a consequence of changes to the bands. I do not know exactly what the cost implications are, or whether Ministers can tell us. However, it is done for a purpose to which I shall return shortly.
<P>
We now move on to the necessary corollary of amendment No. 252 and its impact on the lower end of band 3. It would insert 2LET-QEF which, as I said, implies £13,568 for band 2 and a lower start for band 3. Amendments Nos. 191 and 195 would change the accrual applied to the band from 20+N to l0+N.
<P>
What is the purpose behind all this trouble to achieve a rebanding and changes in the accruals? I do not dispute the Minister's exposition or his stated intention of being generous to earners at the bottom end of the income scale. However, we were right to draw attention to the less generous treatment at the margin of those moving from band 1 to band 2. The changes attempt to ameliorate the problem and make it more attractive to those moving up.
<P>
The Minister was right to draw attention to the fact that our amendments would reduce the benefits for those in the lowest income band. That is undoubtedly their effect and it is necessary in order to make it more attractive for those in band 2 to remain in the state second pension.
<P>
On page 24 of the Library's research paper 99/109 there is a useful exposition and a table showing the impact of the clause.

<P>

<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I do not have the figures, but I have not used that table either today or on Tuesday because we believe that its figures are incorrect. The hon. Gentleman is free to use it, but we are checking the numbers with the Library. I have carried that paper around for weeks—my officials saw it for the first time on Tuesday—but it never crossed my mind to check the table; I had seen it and thought that it was damn good because it showed how the last lot had screwed up SERPS and what a bonus state second pensions would be. That just shows how emollient I have been, but the figures are wrong. We told Library staff about it this morning, but I do not know how soon it will be before they can do the calculations again. I say that only because I do not want the hon. Gentleman to drop himself in it by risking his whole case on a table that is a bit suspect.
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> I thank the Minister for that information. It will perhaps still be useful to use the table, but to treat it only as illustrative. Perhaps the Minister will write to us about that; after all, he appears to be writing to us rather frequently. His latest letter arrived only 10 minutes after the previous one. Perhaps we can look forward to a correction of the Library's figures.
<P>
Using those figures for illustration, the table is useful because it shows that across a fivefold increase in income from £5,000 to £25,000, the state second pension as currently constructed—albeit according to figures that were perhaps incorrectly computed by the Library—the difference in pension income is £13 per week. It is therefore appropriate to question the banding and ask whether it should be made more attractive to the middle range income earner—someone who has moved from band 1 into band 2, who will be disproportionately affected by the clause.
<P>
The reason for doing that is simple: we do not want the state second pension to become just a poor man's pension or a ghetto pension—something that everyone else wants to get out of. Our amendments would ensure that that did not happen. I fear that such an arrangement, whereby the state second pension is really for people on low incomes and is designed to made it attractive for others to go elsewhere once they move through the £9,500 threshold, will be treated accordingly by public policy. It will tend to be neglected. How long will it last if it is only for poor people? That is the attitude that I am trying to convey. Perhaps I am being too pessimistic, but it is an appropriate point for public policy to address.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I am intrigued by the line of thought that the hon. Gentleman is developing. On Second Reading, Ministers advanced arguments that would have been more consistent with the views of the hon. Gentleman's Front-Bench colleagues. They talked about trying to provide incentives and encouragement for people to move out of the state sector and into the private sector. The hon. Gentleman's comments seem to suggest the opposite of that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> I accept that two different cases are being made. I shall speak to amendments Nos. 229, 230, 232 and 235 shortly, but my briefing from my colleagues says that this first set of amendments are probing amendments. We have been probing the Government on this issue. The Minister has answered admirably. It is an important issue of public policy that members of the Committee would do well to consider and to explore.
<P>
As the clause stands, and when table 2 kicks in in 2010 and mimics the appropriate SERPS accrual, it will be legitimate to ask whether those under 45, who have a substantial part of their working lives before them and who have a reasonable level of income above the £9,000 threshold, will still be affected by table 2? If we look at the timetable given in the Green Paper, we see that it is expected that within five years of the introduction of the stakeholder pension they would have gone elsewhere. It is therefore appropriate to ask where those people will be when table 2 comes into effect.
<P>
The pension accrual entitlement to the state second pension is determined not only on the level of income but on the age of the person. That is an added complication to an already complicated formula. Amendment No. 196 would do away with the second stage and therefore with some of these complications.
<P>
I now turn to amendments Nos. 229, 230, 232 and 235. There should always be a choice, Mrs. Michie. You are a member of a party that has always espoused liberty and freedom of choice and there should be choice even for Government, so we have presented them with a choice. We add to the amendments that I have just described, the choice of these amendments, which provide a better alternative to the one I outlined, although the latter is more in keeping with the spirit of the clause as constituted.
<P>
Let us assume that the £9,500 lower earnings threshold stands. Hon. Members should erase from their memories amendments Nos. 118 and 201. We stay with the £9,500 threshold.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> No. 198.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> The Minister is right. It is amendments Nos. 198 and 201.
<P>
Let us imagine that that threshold remains and that we leave the lower band of income entirely as it is and reserve our change to the second band proposed in amendment No. 230, which modifies the accrual factor to 12.5 per cent. Amendment No. 232 scraps band 3 in its entirety. There are therefore only two bands as a result of the amendments.
<P>
If one looks at the resulting pension package in totality, one gets the existing old age pension and the state second pension under band 1, which itself will be a flat-rate pension that is independent of the level of earnings in that band. As long as one reaches the qualifying earnings factor one will get the same pension, whatever one's earnings level. It is, therefore, a flat-rate pension in effect. So one is getting the flat-rate retirement pension, a flat-rate second pension and an earnings-related second pension at incomes over £9,500. It is at that point that the matter becomes genuinely income-related.
<P>
Therefore, there is a simpler way of achieving the objective of the first group of amendments, although that is less in keeping with the spirit of the Bill. However, it would make a not wholly unattractive provision for people with incomes over £9,500 and would not drive such people into the stakeholder pension as a matter of policy.
<P>
We must decide whether that divide is desirable in terms of policy so that someone who breaches the £9,500 threshold gets out of the state provision into a private sector pension. As the Minister of State pointed out, our own policy is to encourage private provision. However, we should not go into the matter with our eyes shut; we should carefully consider all the policy implications.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I do not intend to go down the road taken by my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne), as I am not especially numerate. Indeed, my hon. Friend would have had difficulty helping me through A-level maths, although I was a bit better at economics. However, I do not need to woof.
<P>
I shall tackle the Government's general proposal and the difficulties implicit in the new pension arrangements. In an earlier Committee sitting, there was a bit of an altercation about the previous Government's record on pension policy. The Minister of State was, uncharacteristically, not generous about that and denied that we had established a good record on which to build.
<P>
However, the Government's promises about SERPS must be borne in mind. In the Bill they are going back on a manifesto commitment to keep SERPS. We are all dying to see what the Government will put in their next annual report. As the Opposition know, to their amusement, the Government are fond of ticking boxes about completing manifesto commitments. How will they reconcile SERPS maintenance with that record?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I alluded to that this morning. The state second pension still has an earnings-related element for earnings of more than £9,500 because people in it will accrue relative to their earnings, as the chart shows. If they leave the state second pension for a stakeholder pension, they will take with them earnings-related contracted-out contributions. So there is no problem—we will be able to tick the box.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> The Minister is rather sensitive about that. His intervention shows that I scored home and contradicts what the Government said about keeping SERPS. They are changing SERPS and may have good reason for doing so. However, that is not what they said that they would do, so they should stand corrected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Pickles </B>(Brentwood and Ongar): The Government have pledged an increase in the basic state pension. The only down side is that there is a time lag of about 50 years.
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> As my hon. Friend rightly says, we shall all be dead in the long run. Nevertheless, 50 years is a long time. Sadly, I shall be well into my pensionable years by then.
<P>
The Government have not kept SERPS and they have unfairly criticised us for circumscribing the benefit of SERPS when in office, but we did so because it was simply too expensive. The Under-Secretary laughs, but the Government have told us that their intention is to change the proportion of state-funded and private pensions from 60:40 state-private to 60:40 private-state. The Government could not have done that if they had kept SERPS or if they had tried to reinstate it.
<P>
If we are to respond to demographic changes—fewer children are being born, so fewer people will be able to support an elderly population—the Government are right that it is vital to change the proportion of state-funded pensions compared with those that have been privately invested. Perhaps a fairer Government would not criticise the previous Government for taking what was, in fact, a rational and reasonable decision on behalf of all citizens. After all, with an unfunded pension scheme, it is right and proper that the Government have a duty to taxpayers who pay out of current income the pensions of those who retire. No Government can escape from that equation.
<P>
We faced astronomical bills under the previous arrangements for SERPS. The Government had an opportunity to put matters right in the Bill, but they did not take it. They have gone down a similar road to the one that we went down; they have done what they reasonably can to encourage more people to contract out and arrange their own private pensions and to tackle the problems only of those on extremely modest earnings who will be guaranteed an earnings-related state pension. I understand why the Government have done that: demographic changes are staring them in the face, so that one in two, or one in three people will provide the tax base for a growing pensioner population. We do not know by how much the pensioner population will grow because we do not know how longevity will improve, which could make matters worse—if that is they right way to put it; I might be one of the beneficiaries.
<P>
The Government have proposed the right changes, but it is also right to point out how different their policies were in the luxury of opposition We, too, believe in trying to ensure decency and fairness for those who are on low pay, but in trying to do so the problem of incentives can arise. The figure of £9,500 is extremely low; it is slightly more than half the average earnings of £18,000 a year. The Government want to protect only those who are paid less than half the average earnings—a very low income. I do not disagree that their pay should be boosted. However, the problem is that people whose incomes are between the £9,500 and the £21,000 limits, for whom only those earnings between £18,000 and £21,000 qualify as being more than average earnings, still find it hard to raise a family and pay all the bills. However, the Government are not giving them much benefit and their pension accrual rates are low. I do not criticise the Government for that; I merely point out the difficulties that one can encounter when drawing up such plans.
<P>
People on modest incomes will see others getting something for nothing, because those on lower incomes will have a much higher accrual rate. Those earning less than £9,500—no matter how much less—will all have the same accrual rate; but the minute that they hit £10,000, which is still a low income, the accrual rate will be much lower. In addition, people on such modest incomes are expected to find the money from somewhere to put aside for a private stakeholder pension. That is an extremely optimistic scenario.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham suggested that the Government are creating a bit of a hump, and I understand why. Are people sophisticated enough to realise that they will receive no benefit from their income unless they take out a stakeholder pension? It would not be entirely irrational for those earning £12,000 or £15,000 a year to decide that tomorrow is a long way off—certainly pensionable age is a long way off—and that what they are earning today is needed to maintain a reasonable standard of living. They will not want to pay for a stakeholder pension when they can make do with what they would get on the first £9,500—with a teensy-weensy bit more income-related pension on their present salaries.
<P>
The Government are being optimistic if they think that people will move to a stakeholder pension. I understand why they shied away from compulsion, and I understand the political difficulties, but people on modest incomes will find it difficult to move to a stakeholder pension, however much the Government have rigged the system, because they are living in a high-tax, high-cost country.
<P>
I apologise for raising more difficulties than solutions. Another difficulty is that people on low incomes with families will also be drawing benefit. Those on low incomes will not be aware of the problem because many of their other requirements, such as the cost of housing and the council tax, will be mopped up by state benefits in the form of working families tax credit. That will be another incentive not to work more hours. People will not see the benefit because they will not be able to afford a stakeholder pension. They will gain nothing more if they do not take a stakeholder pension once they earn more than £9,500, which is another lack of incentive to working more hours to increase their salaries.

<P>

<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> This is a misunderstanding. The benefit of the second state pension is not frozen at £9,500. The hon. Lady will have seen from the Actuary's report that it continues to accrue above that figure.
<P>
The other trap that the hon. Lady falls into—when I first looked at these figures in the summer, I fell into the same trap—is to assume that everyone lives as an individual. We have to make assumptions. Assumptions about the average earnings of individuals will be above the means-test level, but the majority of people live as couples. The problem is that couples may have two stakeholder pensions or a stakeholder pension and a second pension, which puts them far above the means-test—the minimum income test. Their capital and savings will not be touched; they will be okay compared with an individual—a one-off case. One has to think of the future, about 30 years hence. If the woman has worked for most of her life, has reared children and has a modest second state pension or a stakeholder pension, and her husband has a stakeholder pension, even if their earnings were modest, they would be far above the minimum income guarantee level. It would certainly be a disincentive if their earnings were below the means-test level, because their savings would be taken into account.
<P>
Most people live as couples. Assuming that everyone is single creates a different scenario. It is much more productive to consider couples; one soon realises that it is not a disincentive to save for a pension. Saving for a pension keeps the taxman and the Government away from their savings. That is a consequence of the means test.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I thank the Minister for that intervention. I suspect that he is right that I am considering it from an individual's viewpoint. I presume that the second earner, usually the wife or female partner, will have had credits paid into her pension during her child-rearing years, and that the pension will have also been topped up because of her lower earnings—she may have stacked shelves in a supermarket so that she was able to care for the children. I can see that a couple could achieve slightly more together when they both become pensioners.
<P>
I understand why the Government want to encourage people to arrange their pensions as couples rather than as individuals. The fragmentation of relationships that happens nowadays does not help. A 10 per cent. accrual rate on such modest earnings is low, although I accept that accrual continues over £9,500.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Although it would be nice to live in an ideal world, where most people are couples, I am sure that my hon. Friend would agree—she has already referred to the fact—that society is fragmented. The other problem is that, even with improving longevity, the male is inevitably the frailer sex. It is the poor widow who is most likely to have to live on a state second pension as her only income once she is widowed.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> My hon. Friend is right. Although I welcome the fact that more women will have pensions in their own right, the tragedy of the present generation of women, who are retiring now, is that so many of them do not have pensions in their own right but are reliant on state pensions. In 20 or 30 years, those women will still have modest pensions, while the husband or former partner has an earnings-related pension.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> The point is that the means test works on the couple's income. A couple is a unit for income support purposes. One of them can be without an income because the other may be earning above the limit. Unlike poorer couples, a couple with a combination of pensions would move away from a means-tested pension. That is the key.
<P>
The means test applies to the couple's total income. If a couple has a combination of state second pension and a stakeholder pension, it will put them way above that means test level. In that sense they are treated as individuals, because they each have a pension. The income support limit for a couple is not twice that for a single person. That is why they will be much better off.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I am grateful to the Minister, because he is gradually persuading me of the merit of his proposals. I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham meant that many couples separate or one partner dies. It is often the woman who is left behind on a lower income. Having pointed that out to the Minister, I hope that the proposals will be combined with a serious publicity campaign so that people understand how they will be helped. I genuinely think that the Government will have trouble persuading people to take out the pensions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Surely the Minister is right and wrong at the same time. He is right to say that if people make adequate provision, they will keep away from the means tests and the state will not touch their assets. Everyone in such relationships assumes that they will last for ever but, from the social trends of the past 20 years, we know that a growing number of men and women live alone in their 50s—the decade before the reforms will bite. The situation that the Minister described will not come about, because people will find themselves alone and will not look towards joint income benefits, and there will not be interference from means tests.
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I take my hon. Friend's point. Fifty years is an extremely long time, and the difficulty with something so complicated that will have an impact over a long time scale is how it will act in the meantime. The Minister's argument is reassuring for couples who have working records during their working lifetimes. One of the Government's bigger failures, however, is their lack of support for couples who want to be traditional and want the wife to support the husband and stay at home rather than support the family income by going out to work. In that scenario, joint income would not be available. I accept that that life style is less available to poorer income families.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Legislation has gone through for pension splitting on divorce, which has not been a factor in the past. That will come into force next year. It is complicated, but it is a key element of the changing factors in social attitudes.
<P>
In the idyllic scenario that the hon. Lady described, the husband who goes out to work to earn a decent salary while wifey stays at home could buy a stakeholder pension for her. People do not have to be in work to have a stakeholder pension. That is one of its advantages. It can be purchased by the husband for the non-working wife.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I am glad that we can congratulate the Minister on telling us that welcome news, which will help women who want to choose the life that they lead and whether they go out to work. In my previous life on The Daily Telegraph, I was in favour of pension splitting. That was not because I thought that it was encouraging to know that we needed such legislation because of family break-ups, but because one cannot be Canute-like any more and refuse to accept the fact that many relationships end in that way. The law had to catch up, so I am glad that the Government have introduced proposals that, to be fair, were already in place under the previous Government. As we all know, they are terribly complicated and we have had to take time over them.
<P>
I have said what I want to say about these probing amendments. I think that there has been some welcome news in the Minister's valiant attempts to explain the complicated clauses to the Opposition. The provisions still have their difficulties, and I suspect that the Government have been optimistic about the take-up rate, but there are good intentions behind them. We are grateful for his patience and his full explanations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Welcome to the Chair, Mrs. Michie, it seems some time since your arrival. I do not wish to speak at length on the amendments, which explore possibilities which Conservative Members wanted to test the Government on. I remain unconvinced, on the basis of the argument so far, that we should support the Conservative amendments. Clarifying comments have convinced me that the amendments, defective or otherwise, do not secure objectives that we would support.
<P>
I thank the hon. Member for Beckenham for kicking off the debate and trying to shed some light on a complex problem. I am pleased not to be leading for my party on this particular group of amendments: initially, I thought that I might have to, but I am delighted to say that I did not. If clause 28, which we are technically still debating, is the gateway into the state second pension, clause 29, which most of the amendments address, is the engine for making it all happen. We are pulling the engine apart and trying to put it together again differently in order to achieve a better performance, but we do not know that we will secure the best performance for all the occupants of the vehicle, to take the analogy further. The amendments would not accomplish that: they would certainly not produce the best outcome for the key groups on whom we should be targeting help.
<P>
For some time, my party has advocated focusing our efforts on mechanisms for targeting the greatest help on the poorest of our pensioners. In particular, we have advocated age additions to the basic state pension as a means of achieving that. The Liberal Democrats might not pursue that specific mechanism if they were in government, but we recognise that it could provide a means of targeting resources at those most in need of them. It might help those to whom the Minister referred who have not reached the requisite level of income—people with caring responsibilities, broken records of contribution and so forth.
<P>
I am grateful to the hon. Member for New Forest, West for his exposition on the formula and how its algebra works out in practice. It helped to crystallise some of the reasons why I decided that I could not support some of the amendments.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> That was not the intention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Nevertheless, it was the effect and I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his help in clarifying my views on the clause. As we have heard, narrowing the bands would mean less help for the poorest, who would end up back on the minimal income guarantee sooner. Finding that out was most helpful. If I understand the £13,500 figure correctly—it is the product of putting the amendments through the calculator and applying the formula—it has the effect of pushing 4.4 million people out of band 2 into band 3. I remain unconvinced that that is a good idea. People will be confronted with a hard choice about the most efficient way of maximising their pensions at the end of their lives. The amendments would make that choice more difficult, which is another reason why narrowing the bands is dubious and a cause for concern. In the actuarial world, it is believed that £15,000 to £15,500 is an appropriate level of earnings to sustain a funded pension. We could debate that in later amendments, but I have heard that said by several people who work in the sector. Driving people below that threshold and potentially exposing people who may not be able to sustain it creates a yo-yo effect, so that people move in and out of state second pension, stakeholder pension and so forth. It may be cost free, but it could lead to mistakes about people's personal choices at different stages of their lives. It is not cost free to the extent that people could admit that they made a mistake and ask for a recalculation. It might be helpful if that were possible, but the Minister will, rightly, say that that would be incredibly complicated and burdensome. For those reasons, although the amendments help to elucidate the subject, they do not provide a practical way forward in trying to help those most in need.
<P>
The hon. Member for New Forest, West was right to flag up the public policy issue that Age Concern has raised. By reducing the stake that the population at large has in the provision of a state second pension because they are not beneficiaries, a future Government might find it easier to make subsequent changes to the state second pension that will worsen the outcome for its poorest beneficiaries. The Library brief quotes David Piachaud, Professor of social policy at the London School of Economics:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Security for old age requires a pension system that is adequate, fair and sustainable. There remain questions as to how far Partnership in Pensions will be adequate and fair: but it is the long-term sustainability that seems most doubtful. The plans of Crossman, Joseph, Castle, Fowler and Lilley that were to last for a generation are all no more. Sadly, the odds are that the name Darling will be remembered longer in association with Never-Never land than with pension reform.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I quote that not to be aggressive but to flag up a genuine anxiety that we are creating a pension package that will result in benefits 50 years hence, by which time we may have had 10 changes of Government and numerous opportunities to tinker with and change the system. The previous Government made numerous changes to SERPS, and a genuine anxiety has been expressed that an unfunded scheme of this sort is susceptible to similar changes.
<P>
For those reasons, we shall not support the amendments. However, as we are using them as an opportunity to have what is almost a clause stand part debate, I should like to touch on a few other points.
<P>
Much of clause 29, and the debate on it, is predicated on assumptions about the need for stakeholder pensions to be successful. I am unclear so far, and would like the Minister to give us more information, about the tests that the Government will apply to the stakeholder pension in determining the trigger for moving into stage 2. The point at which stage 2 takes place is crucial. All the graphs that the Minister has shown us today relate to 2051 and stage 1. However, we shall probably not reach 2051 in stage 1 but in a hybrid of stages 1 and 2, including SERPS for some people, too. The graph should be much more complicated and should probably be three dimensional to understand the relationships involved. Some objective tests should be conducted, not only when the Government make their decision, but for others to consider too, in order to understand whether we have reached a point at which the Government will trigger stage 2.
<P>
In an earlier intervention, the Minister referred to the fact that one in five pensioners are now on income support and that, if current policies continue, the figure will be one in three in 2050. He rightly said that, using the assumptions that the Government have made in analysing the policies, the figure would be reduced to one in four.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Angela Eagle):</B> One in five.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> That is interesting, because some of the briefing material that I have read refers to one in four.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I have not read any that gives the figure of one in four.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I shall pass the relevant document to the Minister in due course. I shall double check, and may correct myself.
<P>
That estimate, even if it is one in five, shows that we shall have gone full circle. We shall have travelled 50 years in time to return, proportionately, to where we started, but the number of people involved will be much greater. We are doing much in terms of legislative action, but in proportionate terms we are simply staunching the flow, which is a cause for concern. Only a short period will elapse before the many people who will become beneficiaries of the state second pension will have to return to the Benefits Agency and apply to have their means assessed to go on to the MIG.
<P>
The Minister rightly said that one of the Government's objectives was to keep people out of means-tested benefits for as long as possible, and I hope that we can find ways to do that. If we do not, it is not clear how the Bill's complicated formulae will deliver help to those people who are most in need but avoid putting them once again through the means test.
<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Laurence Robertson </B>(Tewkesbury): I want to begin with the hon. Gentleman's final point. First, however, I must apologise to you, Mrs. Michie, and to those Committee members who have spoken, for the fact that I kept nipping out of the Committee Room. It was unwelcome behaviour.
<P>
We want to design schemes and legislation that will deliver what is desired, but it is not always easy to do so. I shall not discuss the provisions in enormous detail—my hon. Friends have already done that more than adequately today. I was grateful to Mr. Winterton, who chaired this morning's sitting, for allowing our debate on the amendment to range as widely as a clause stand part debate. I intend to make broad points rather than discuss the precise details.
<P>
I have some concerns about the Bill, although I recognise that it will bring help to lower-paid people and to people who, through no fault of their own, do not earn anything. I am concerned about the state pension—SERPS, as it used to be—because it may involve exponential growth. There has been an increase in the number of people who are likely to claim it and a relative fall in the number of people who pay into it. I am not convinced that a pay-as-you-go scheme—we might call it an in-out scheme—is desirable. The fact that those schemes do not involve investment—one cannot take out more than goes in—means that a great opportunity has been lost. Moreover, the fact that those who are retired are dependent on others, on economic circumstances over which they have no control and on the Government, regardless of their political colour, may cause problems.
<P>
I dug out from the Library some figures of which Committee members might be aware. In 1951, there were 4.2 million pensioners, and in 1998 there were 11 million pensioners. In the face of such a change, any pay-as-you-go scheme, whatever the changes that are made to it, will struggle to provide an adequate level of pension benefit, and it will be even harder for it to secure prosperity. I am sure that all Committee members want to provide pensioners with prosperity or to help them to share in the prosperity that is enjoyed by the rest of the country. I have never been a great fan of SERPS for that reason—although it provided more income for some people, which was welcome, it appeared to add to the problem that was created by pay-as-you-go schemes.
<P>
I am concerned about the proposed changes because they will not involve investment—they are an extension of the pay-as-you-go scheme for the lower paid, which will make the overall problem worse. They will throw those people even more forcefully at the mercy of those who are currently working, and at the mercy of the Chancellor.
<P>
A couple of days ago, my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar, who is not in his place at the moment, talked about a scheme enacted in Chile. I am not familiar with that scheme—
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> It was our hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh).
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> I am sorry—it was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough. I am not familiar with that scheme, but I was in Mexico 18 months ago, where I familiarised myself with a system that the Mexican Government are adopting. Discussing it may contribute to our debate, because it contains elements of the stakeholder system that the Government are introducing for those on middle earnings.
<P>
The Mexican Government recognised the problems—design problems, as they described them—caused by demographic trends and a fluctuating economy. In 1950, life expectancy in Mexico was 49.6 years; currently, it is 71.9 years, so a similar problem arose. The Mexican Government were concerned that people who contributed for 30 years would get the same pension provision as if they had contributed for 10 years.
<P>
The Mexican Government have offered the option of opting out of the system and contributing to a private scheme in conjunction with the employer and the Government, which is interesting. Money is paid to private pension fund administrators, known as AFOREs, which then invest in private pension funds, known as SIEFOREs, which seems sensible. The Mexican Government recognise that there will be a shortfall. If people opt out and receive a rebate, there will be a shortfall because people who have retired still have to be paid. They said that they would rather face that difficulty now than risk future bankruptcy.
<P>
We can only guess the extra cost that the provision will incur, because we do not know how it will work. Nor can we predict future demographic trends, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride) pointed out. That is one of my great concerns, although I recognise that the provision will provide much-needed extra income for people who do not earn much money. However, there is surely a better way in which to arrange matters.
<P>
I am also worried about the provision's enormous complexity. I do not claim to be a pensions expert, but neither am I completely ignorant of the subject. I have spent hours poring over books, papers and ministerial letters that, as my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West said, arrive regularly, and for which we are grateful. I am not implying anything controversial, but if one's earnings remained below £9,500, I doubt whether the various options would be examined. However, if one is in the middle income bracket, those options exist. To make an informed decision, people need to understand the scheme in which they are participating and the scheme in which they could participate. The provision is enormously complex and will not help people to make the right decision.
<P>
Let us consider the way in which the figures have been reached. As my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West said, one presumes that insurance companies arrived at the band 1 threshold of £9,500. Below that threshold, private schemes would not provide an enormous benefit. Band 2 covers those who earn more than the low earnings threshold, but less than three times the low earnings threshold minus two times the qualifying earnings factor, rounded to the nearest £100. I doubt whether such matters are discussed every night in the pubs of Tewkesbury.
<P>
The provision need not have been this complicated. The greater challenge is deciding how to fund pensions, and moving people from state dependency to the private sector. That is crucial, and the Minister has accepted that we should move from a 40:60 ratio to 60:40. I would prefer to see a bigger gap than 60:40. The challenge is not to make it as complicated as it seems to be.
<P>
I am grateful to the Minister for helping us to understand the formula. His early intervention was extremely useful. However, I stress those two points: first, the formula does not need to be so complex and, secondly, I am concerned about the cost to taxpayers of continuing, and making worse, unfunded pensions.

<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I shall not repeat the points that I have made in interventions in an attempt to keep the debate chugging along.
<P>
I am grateful to the hon. Member for New Forest, West for referring to the penultimate paragraph on page 60 of the notes on clauses. I almost read it into the record. The hon. Gentleman congratulated the person who wrote it, and I echo that, because that paragraph is a model of clarity and explains the way in which the formula works. Indeed, the first full paragraph on page 61, which begins with the word ``surpluses'', is also a model of clarity, without the aid of tables or charts. Therefore, I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's remarks.
<P>
I shall deal in reverse order with some of the issues raised. The hon. Member for Tewkesbury was the last to speak. I am in a slight dilemma, because there is not a concert party on the Conservative Benches: there are many instruments, which are playing different tunes. Therefore, it is difficult to respond.
<P>
I realise that this is a mixed bunch of amendments. I have not tried to divide them up or lump them together, but I am hearing different voices. On the one hand, the hon. Member for New Forest, West wants to keep more people locked into the state system, which might be bad for them and on the other hand, the hon. Member for Tewkesbury wanted to keep them out, and thinks that our aim of 60 per cent. private and 40 per cent. state provision does not go far enough. I suspect that if the hon. Member for Gainsborough had been here, he would have wanted a 0:100 ratio. Therefore, I have a dilemma. As the hon. Member for Beckenham has said several times, she wants to make it easier for people to stay in the state second pension, whereas we want to encourage them to come out at a certain time.
<P>
In response to the hon. Member for Tewkesbury, it must be better for low earners and carers, people with disrupted working lives or long-term low earnings to rely on a state promise of a good pension than on a state promise of a bad one, which is the position under SERPS.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> I did not mention it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I know that, but for those people SERPS is a bad bet. However, we have to live in the world as it is. We know how many pensioners there will be in 2050: they are alive today. We do not have to invent the figures.
<P>
There has been a great deal of chopping and changing. The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam recited a list of the people whose names have been attached to pensions, from Crossman onwards, none of whose plans have seen final implementation. People do not trust the Government or the state, because of all this messing around. That is why we are seeking to build a consensus around this package of the basic state pension and an additional pension, through the state second pension for low earners and stakeholder, occupational and personal pensions for the majority. Above all, we want to ensure that everybody gets the message about the need for a second pension.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I am sure that the Minister is aware of some of the research that his Department has done on people's attitudes to pensions. I remember reading last year that, although people did not believe that there would be any state provision of pensions in the future, they wanted the state to stay in the pension sector. Therefore, although there may be distrust, they want the state to remain involved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Yes. I suggest that 40 per cent. is quite high. That is what we are working towards.
<P>
I understand from my reading over the past couple of days that amendments have been tabled to explore the conditions in which a flat rate would become applicable. We do not want to incorporate a date in the Bill. That will depend on the success of the stakeholder provisions.
<P>
The question is, how do we measure that success? We shall examine the take-up in the target group, who do not currently have a second pension. I am not interested in measuring the success by those who have come out of another pension into a stakeholder pension. We shall examine the number of providers, and the spread throughout the industry over a period. At conferences, I have suggested a period of five years, off the top of my head. We shall certainly review after three years the exemption for small firms to give access. In the meantime, the people who work in those small firms will still be encouraged to acquire a stakeholder pension as a retail product. They will not be excluded. Many factors must, therefore, be taken into account.
<P>
I must make a point that I have made a couple of times before, possibly inadequately. Table 2 is not stage 2. Stage 2 is contained in subsection (6). It is unfortunate that the Bill had to be drafted in that way, but we had no choice. The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam said that table 2 would come into effect only from 2009. That is not the case. We are dealing with two groups of people. People who retire after 2009 will begin to accrue state second pension credits according to the rates in table 2 from the start of the scheme—that is, from 2002. Table 1 applies only to people retiring before 2009. That is because of the change in the accrual rates of SERPS that was legislated for in 1986. It is unfortunate that we have not had a clean break at the start of the new scheme. That has added to the confusion.
<P>
<H5>4 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Bromsgrove made a point about low earners not having enough money to put into stakeholder pensions. That is debateable. However, the amount of stakeholder pension for someone on £9,500—the break point—would be as much as someone earning £15,500 would get from SERPS. If a person earning £9,500 a year took out a stakeholder pension, the rebate that they would receive would be equivalent to that received now by someone earning £15,500. We shall discuss this issue later. Low earners may not have enough to put into a state second pension, but the rebate system has to be taken into account in that respect.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> Can the Minister tell the Committee what monthly payment those people would have to make to that stakeholder pension?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> No, I cannot. We are dealing with the state second pension, not stakeholder pensions. There are some figures for stakeholder pensions in the previous Bill and the White Paper, but I do not carry them round in my head. We shall publish detailed regulations shortly, when the stakeholder pensions are launched; the pension providers will be involved and we shall give examples with decision trees. People will then be able to decide for themselves.
<P>
I want to make a final point. The hon. Member for Tewkesbury referred to costs. I refer again to the Government Actuary's report relating to the Bill. Based on the assumptions that the Government Actuary has made, the combined employer's and employee's national insurance contributions will, as a result of the Bill, be lower than they are now by 2050. The cost of contributions will go down from a combined figure of 20 per cent. to about 17 per cent. Those figures are in the report. It is part of the transfer—[Interruption.] The tables in the report, and I can show the hon. Gentleman how the Government Actuary's Department arrived at those figures on the assumptions made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> I have not seen those figures. I may be approaching this issue in a simplistic way, but I cannot understand how, if no one is to lose out and many are to gain, that will end up being cheaper.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I do not want to open up a new debate. If we were not introducing a state second pension, and were leaving everything as it is, because of the cuts in SERPS that were made in 1986 and 1995, the need for national insurance contributions would fall dramatically. In other words, there will be cuts in national insurance contributions, but they will not be as great as they would have been. The difference will provide the money for the state second pension, which, given the net costs in 2050, will be about £5.5 billion to £6 billion. I shall probably receive notification that my figures need correct.
<P>
Not only is the situation under control, it is diminishing in terms of impost on the taxpayer. It was strange what the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam said about the one in four figure. I did not refer to today's pensioners—the 1.6 million people on income support. I said that, if there was no change in policy, in 2050, one in three people would retire on to the means test. Under the package of stakeholder and state second pension, it is estimated that one in five will so retire. The figure will be cut from 33 per cent. to 20 per cent, so there is no misunderstanding: the two total absolute figures of pensioners are dramatically different. It must be appreciated that the 20 per cent. figure is 20 per cent. of a much higher figure than the present day number of pensioners.
<P>
I refer to the table on page 24 of the Library research paper and shall take, for example, the earnings figure of £15,000, for which the original SERPS figure is shown as £99.40. Our corrected figure is £120. In the Library brief, SERPS 86 is cut to £86.80. In reality, it is £89. It shows SERPS 95 as £65; it is actually £83. State second pension in shown as £94, but it is £95. The figures are different, but the scale is about the same. There is an incentive to get out of state second pension, the higher up the earnings scale that people go.
<P>
Even on £9,500, original SERPS would have given £63 to the real low earners. Under the current law, SERPS is down to £47, whereas stakeholder pension will bring the figure up to £94. The original SERPS was no good for low-paid workers. Even the Library brief shows it as £52 to £90. Earnings-related SERPS was no good, which is why the thrust of the proposal would have a redistributive effect on that earnings sector, but with a built-in incentive to come out of it to help make private provision based on state help with tax relief and rebates.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Having taken up so much of our time this morning, I promise that I shall be brief. I am sorry that this debate has been so mind-bogglingly complex, but it was only by tabling amendments that we could explore the sheer difficulty of the Government's new pension proposal. I am enormously grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West for putting the argument much more simply and clearly than I could ever do. I promise him that, if we ever do something like this again, he can have my job—temporarily.
<P>
I return to the basic philosophy of what the Government are doing. The Opposition accept the argument for providing the low-paid—those on up to £9,500—with a better pension provision. We have arguments about the interrelationship with minimum income guarantees and all the rest of it, but we do not have a problem with that philosophy. We accept all those arguments in a sense.
<P>
We differ on the sheer practicality of people going into private provision. The right hon. Gentleman said quite openly that the Government wished to transfer people quickly into stakeholder pensions. As the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam pointed out, there is great affection for the state provision. I wish that there were not. My hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury made precisely that point and I have great sympathy with his argument, but one must acknowledge the reality. There is affection for the state provision and the Government are transferring people far too quickly on to stakeholder pensions.
<P>
We do not know whether stakeholder pensions will work. They are very flexible, and if it is possible to produce that flexibility in a pension fund I hope that the City and the providers can do it. Some of the costs of flexibility will make it difficult to get decent returns. As I hope we have brought out in the debate, it will be hard for people with more than £9,500 to afford stakeholder pensions, even with all the rebates and the help through the system. Would they be best advised to do so? It is because of that concern that we tabled our two sets of amendments: one set fits in much more closely with the Bill as laid out in the tables and the other is a much more open, free-fall option which would bring out the debate and put a Conservative philosophical point of view much more clearly. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment, but we shall press amendment No. 229 to a Division.

<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 141, in page 27, line 9, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(b) In a case where a person meeting the conditions in section 44A(2)(b) and (c) retires before 6th April 2015 the accruals rate shall be taken as double that produced by the relevant table in subsections (4) and (5) above.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have spent most of the day debating this clause, so I shall not repeat the main points. However, I want to explore two themes arising from the amendment. The first is the rate at which the state second pension will accumulate a significant value and thus become worthwhile in terms of boosting a recipient's income. The second is about those who will have entitlement under the Bill but who have already been discharging the responsibilities that will give them that entitlement for many years. I refer principally to carers.
<P>
The amendment would provide that those carers—particularly those who care for children—who have come into the state second pension under the provisions of clause 28 should be the beneficiaries of an even greater rate of accrual for a short period. We are proposing that because we have learnt from a series of written answers that it will be impossible to back date the state second pension because the records will not allow it. In fact, we have tabled an amendment to explore that, which we shall come to later.
<P>
We wanted to see whether there may be another mechanism to reflect, at least in part, the value that the Government and certainly the Liberal Democrats place on carers, especially long-term carers. We are concerned that of the 370,000 carers who are in receipt of invalid care allowance, about 120,000 of them have been caring and receiving ICA for five years or more; indeed, some 32,000 carers have received it for more than 10 years. Those years of caring that have already taken place, although they are recognised by the payment of benefit, are not recognised by the state second pension. I understand from the answers that we have had that that is partly because of the difficulty of recording the data. What can we do now to assist that group so that when they retire—in some cases that is likely to be not that far into the future—they receive a better rate of accrual, albeit for a relatively short period? About 1.7 million people are heavily involved in caring, which would generally include those who are engaged in 20 hours or more of care per week. In the benefits system, the key test is 35 hours of care. About 855,000 people provide more than 50 hours of care per week.
<P>
A substantial group of people are not beneficiaries of the ICA system, and may not be passported into the system, or clock up any credits at all. We have debated that previously. I now want to focus on those who have passed the test, and are clocking up credits, but are likely to retire fairly early in the life of the state second pension, and would not have been beneficiaries of SERPS because the scheme was not set up for them. As a result, they will retire on a very small state second pension. That relates to the point about the rate at which the benefits clock up, which has been made on several occasions.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I have been following the hon. Gentleman's argument closely. If we accept that many people will retire on very small pensions, at what point would they be expected, under the amendment, to accrue extra credits in order to have a better pension income under the state second pension than under the minimum income guarantee? What year are we talking about?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> That is a very good question. My answer, at least in part, is that this is intended to be a probing amendment. We have not done the detailed modelling that would be necessary to understand where the lines cross. I anticipate an attempt to cost and provide figures. It may not be immediately forthcoming, but it would be useful to obtain an idea of the cost consequences for potential beneficiaries of such changes. Some of the parliamentary questions that I have tabled do not relate directly to MIG, but attempt to find out some of the different possible cost consequences of different accrual rates over different periods of time. The relevant written answer appeared last week. The amendment is not formulated to mirror any of the data modelled for that answer—it was necessarily tabled well before we received the answer. However, it revealed a substantial lift in the amount of income that a state second pensioner would receive, much earlier in the life of the new pension. It would bring forward, and, arguably, substantially increase the costs of operating the scheme. I dare say that that will be one of the reasons why the Government will not be able to accept the amendment, although one lives in hope.
<P>
In relation to the minimum income guarantee, the net income of a single pensioner in the bottom fifth of income distribution would be £85.20 under the current pension arrangements. That information comes from a written answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb), on 25 October last year. Under the Bill, the same person would receive £86.50—in 2025, I hasten to add. By 2025, the proposed legislation for the state second pension would have put an additional £1.30 per week into that person's pocket. That is the product of the parliamentary question tabled by my hon. Friend.
<P>
The Minister spoke earlier about the fact that many people, especially retired people, live as couples. By 2025, the current provisions would put £169.50 into a retired couple's pocket. The measures that we are discussing would increase that to £172.40, which is an extra £2.90 a week. Although such sums will be welcome, they are not substantial. The rate at which the state second pension will build up to produce a useful sum, which will provide people with a decent quality of life when they retire, is very slow. As the hon. Member for Beckenham said earlier, the lines will not cross until 2029 in terms of the minimum income guarantee and of the combined basic state pension and state second pension. What that does not take into account is the fact that once that crossover point is reached, one starts to drop back because of the effect of earnings linking with the minimum income guarantee and the potential price linking to both the basic state pension and the state second pension.
<P>
The amendment, and the next amendment, is designed to get the Government to look again at the group of people whom they are including for the first time. We very much welcome the fact that the new second state pension will for the first time include carers of all categories. That is a welcome and substantial improvement. However, we ask for recognition that a mechanism should be included in the early stages of the pension that can boost more substantially the income of people retiring in those early stages.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The state second pension is designed to help those who need it most. We agree with the theme of the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam that the proposed accrual rates, which we have discussed at great length, strike the right balance between providing extra state help with ensuring prudent levels of public expenditure. Everybody in the state second pension will get at least twice the amount of additional pension, compared with someone in SERPS who currently earns £9,500. I thank the hon. Gentleman for his acknowledgement that that is a great advance for those who have been excluded from the benefits of an additional pension. I shall comment on the amendment in more detail later.
<P>
The additional pension accrued by low earners will be more than double that under SERPS—that is, the 40 per cent. figure of less than £9,500 that we have been discussing. However, carers get a boost to £9,500 to start with, a figure that many will not be earning. They then get the double accrual, which is what enables them to qualify for the first time, with their broken work records and the caring that they have done, to qualify for an additional pension.
<P>
Carers and long-term disabled people with broken work records will benefit even more because they are not entitled to any additional pension under SERPS. The state second pension will provide them with a second-tier pension for the first time. Each year of caring will give that carer extra pension of about £1 a week. It is good to bear that figure in mind, rather than 49 years in accrual rates. So someone who has cared for 10 years would get an extra £10 a week, for every week for the whole of their retirement. Almost 2 million carers, mostly women, will benefit under the state second pension by building up additional pension which they would not have got under SERPS. Many of those women will be in a household with a total income which would take them above the level of the MIG, so any additional pension which they get will genuinely benefit them, on a weekly basis. They will not lose pound for pound with other benefits.
<P>
The nub of amendment No. 141 would further double any additional pension accrued under the state second pension by increasing the accrual rate from 40 per cent. to 80 per cent. but only carers who retired before 6 April 2015. Clearly, to have different rules for one specific group would not be fair to a large number of other people. Low earners with exactly the same income might be treated very differently under the amendment. Similarly, a disabled person may have exactly the same income as a carer, but because that person is disabled rather than a carer, he or she would receive a very different pension. I am not sure how the hon. Gentleman would justify that; I would have some difficulty in doing so.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, there would a difference between carers who retired before the amendment's cut-off date of 2015 and those who retired after it. That difference could be even more unjustifiable. I shall give an example of two people, caring over the same period, who would get very different amounts of state second pension, depending on when they retired. A carer who retired just before 6 April 2015 would get £48 a week additional pension from SERPS and the state second pension combined, but a carer who retired a few days later would get just £32 a week, despite having cared for exactly the same period. That is inherently unfair.
<P>
Although I accept that the hon. Gentleman has good intentions towards those who are caring now, and is attempting to give them a boost, I do not know how he could justify the differences and anomalies that the amendment would create. I acknowledge that the benefits in the state second pension take time to build up; unfortunately, that is inherent in the long-term nature of pension provision. The benefits of SERPS have taken a long time—about 20 years—to build up, and the state second pension is similar in that respect.
<P>
We inherited a situation in which a wide range of people—such as low earners, carers and disabled people—had absolutely no hope of a decent income in retirement. Nothing had been done to provide them with any form of additional pension. Our response to that has been twofold. The stakeholder pension schemes and the state second pension will ensure that in future those who have been unable to save for their retirement can do so. To provide additional help to pensioners who have been unable to save, we have introduced the minimum income guarantee. That strategy delivers help where it is most needed, and strikes the right balance between providing that help and the cost of providing it.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam said that retrospectivity might be another way of dealing with the situation. During Tuesday's proceedings, we confirmed that the state second pension starts when it starts; it does not apply retrospectively for any group of people. It would certainly not be our intention, even if it were possible, to apply it retrospectively for particular groups that we might want to single out. There are three reasons for that: first, it would be unfair to other groups; secondly, it would be extremely expensive to do it for everybody, so one cannot get around the problem of unfairness by applying it across the board; and, thirdly—the hon. Gentleman alluded to this—it is administratively impossible.
<P>
Because of the way in which our records were constructed, they do not allow us to go back very far to see who is on ICA. Records are destroyed after a set time. We do not keep them for 50 years; we have enough of them already. Although a credit might have been flagged up on NIRS2, or its predecessor, in the past, it would not have been flagged up as an ICA credit, because it did not have to be. If a credit has been flagged up, we cannot tell by looking back at our records why it is there. Clearly, when the state second pension comes in we will have to change the computer system to provide more detail about what credits are there for. In the past, when no such benefit has been available to any of these people, there has been no need to record it, so the information is not there. Even if we approved of retrospectivity, which we do not, or could afford it, which we cannot, it would be impossible to achieve in administrative terms.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Is the Under-Secretary talking solely about inactive records, or about active ones as well?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> We have records of people who are on ICA, which we have kept in the form of their original application forms. However, they are destroyed after a set time. We certainly do not keep ICA records going back to 1978, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman would not expect us to do so. If any HRP or credits have had to be put on the national insurance computer, they have been, but they have been flagged up as a credit rather than a benefit. There was no reason in the past to identify them as a benefit, because there was no extra benefit to be gained from them. In addition, ICA recipients often have overlapping benefit entitlements, which it would be impossible for us in future years to take apart and check. That information has not been gathered, because it has not had to be.
<P>
When the state second pension comes in and confers these new entitlements on carers—be they child benefit recipients, ICA recipients or any of the others on the list—we shall record them as that, but we cannot do so retrospectively. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that and seek to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> That was a useful response from the Under-Secretary, which clarified some of the points that the amendment was intended to clarify. It is interesting to note that the amendment would give a carer retiring before the cut-off date in it a £16 boost. I can understand the inequity that the wording would cause.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment was to raise the principle that many carers who are caring through the early stage of this new pension will, as a consequence, retire to a state second pension with little or no SERPS and very small state second pensions or additional pension packages. That causes many people outside the Committee to worry about the value of the proposals.
<P>
I have listened closely to the Under-Secretary. We shall think further on this matter, particularly on how we can reduce the inequalities and unfairnesses that may arise between and within groups. We shall further explore tapering—a matter which we explored in a written question but on which we did not table an amendment.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 160, in page 27, line 9, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5A) Where a pensioner is entitled to a full additional pension and a full basic state pension, and in the event that they do not, when taken together, equate to or exceed the current rates of income support, the additional pension payable shall be increased by a sum equivalent to the difference.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment goes to the heart of our debates so far on this clause, and indeed on clause 28. The Government's objective, stated today by Ministers and also in the Green Paper, is to avoid the need for means testing. I think that the Minister referred earlier to keeping people off means testing as long as possible. We established earlier, through a Library brief, that it is 29 or 30 years before a person's entitlement to state second pension plus basic state pension is equal to or greater than the minimum income guarantee, because of the way in which the two are calculated and uprated. If the amendment were accepted, someone who had accumulated an entitlement to a full additional pension as well as a full basic pension should be protected for the life of that joint package from having to claim minimum income guarantee.
<P>
Because of the way in which the systems are being set up, the necessary records will exist, but we also know, from some of the paperwork that we have received, that some years after going on to their pension package, people will see themselves dropping back to the level at which minimum income guarantee applies. The figures vary depending on the circumstances of the couple or individual pensioner. Given that we are setting up this system to avoid dependency on means-tested benefits and to record who the people are, what their incomes will be and what will be paid, we want to build into the system a means of ensuring that they will not fall below the minimum income guarantee at any point in their life.
<P>
This probing amendment is intended to establish whether that is technically feasible, whether the Government believe that that is a possibility or whether they could give effect to our intention in another way if the amendment is not the right vehicle to do so. The amendment is intended to explore ways of protecting people from the MIG. We hope that the Government will consider our approach and respond positively to it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> It is not clear whether the amendment's intention is technically feasible or achievable, but it is undoubtedly desirable, and I congratulate the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam on it. In principle, the proposal should not be more expensive because it will provide through the pensions system what would otherwise be provided in benefits by the MIG. However, in practice, the proposal would be more expensive because many benefits currently go unclaimed. That would not change significantly if the campaign to persuade pensioners to claim their entitlements were launched, although that appears to have been put on the back burner for the moment. People may not claim those benefits out of ignorance or out of inclination—perhaps I should say disinclination—
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> If the Government's campaign to persuade people to claim was successful, the amendment would not be more expensive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> That is right. In principle, the amendment would be cost neutral. In practice, it will have a cost, but that cost is worth paying for the desirable outcome that it will achieve.
<P>
We return to what people thought they were being offered when the MIG was first proposed. As I understood it, the MIG was to be a payment, not merely a statement of the obvious fact that one can claim income support and not fall below the level of entitlements that are available under the benefits system. Entirely different processes are involved when one claims benefits in the ordinary way through the social security system and when one receives payments because one is a pensioner.
<P>
The amendment has the more desirable objective of offering what is intended to be a minimum income guarantee—and we will not subsequently discover that it involved nothing more than the ability to claim benefits. The amendment is therefore thoroughly desirable, but it is for the Minister to explain whether it is technically feasible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> The amendment is technically feasible, but it is economically and socially undesirable. The hon. Members for Sutton and Cheam and for New Forest, West suggested that the ``guarantee''—in this context, it is important to use that word with inverted commas—would exist irrespective of savings and assets, but that beggars belief. The proposal's consequences are ridiculous. The amendment is designed to accelerate the impact of the state second pension and to ensure that everyone who retires with a state pension and an additional pension will get more than the sum that is associated with the MIG.
<P>
I have had copious correspondence with Committee members. One of my earlier letters, which is dated 31 January, contained a table and referred to couples. The minimum income guarantee is a fallback for those who cannot save enough to provide a decent basic income. It is a safety net and no one has ever said anything different.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> A means-tested safety net.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Yes, it is a means-tested safety net for those who have been unable to provide adequately for themselves. It must therefore include assets. Whatever limits are fixed, there will always be an asset test, otherwise the system would be ripped off. That provides security for those who cannot save for retirement. However, those who can save have a responsibility to do so. That is the bottom line. We are not equivocating about that.
<P>
The state second pension is the centrepiece of the reforms. SERPS has its strengths, but is earnings related, so there are difficulties. The state second pension will give much more help than SERPS to the lowest earners. We have given many examples of that. The reforms will ensure that anyone who spends his or her working life in the state pension system will retire on an income above the level of the minimum income guarantee.
<P>
The state second pension recognises that many people take breaks from working. It therefore enables carers and disabled people with broken work records to continue to build up a decent second pension. It also provides an essential underpinning for the pension system, encouraging people to save for their retirement. Those who save above the compulsory level can do so in the expectation that their savings will raise their standard of living and keep them off the means test.
<P>
The state second pension is the right vehicle for low earners. I do not want to go over the debate about people with funded pensions not being cost-efficient and not having the necessary pension. Moderate earners are in a position to save more than the compulsory minimum and to build up funded pensions that can lift them clear of the minimum income guarantee. We want to give those people an opportunity to save in stakeholder schemes. Those who do so will benefit from additional help provided by the state second pension, as they will have the option of contracting out and having a rebate paid into their funded pension. We accept that the benefits of that will take time to accrue. That is why MIG was introduced: it gives practical help to pensioners now before they build up a pension.
<P>
The chart that I mentioned shows working life circumstances, the pension under SERPS rules and the pension under the state second pension. It contains examples showing a man earning £180 a week throughout his working life and his wife or partner earning £120 a week when working, although there are different scenarios for when that person is not working. Those people are above MIG for 13 to 16 years. That is a consid1
which is why I mentioned couples when responding to the hon. Member for Bromsgrove, whose positive attitude I appreciate.
<P>
MIG is a means-tested safety net. Means testing involves income and assets. The amendments would be economically and socially undesirable. There would be a disincentive for people to save and people who did save would be unfairly treated. I am sure that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam accepts that.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> On a point of information, if a couple needing to apply for MIG owned their own house, would that be an asset that they would have to sell?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> No. They do not have to do that now.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I was just checking.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> The hon. Lady knows what I mean by the word ``assets''—savings, other income and cash.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> A house is an asset.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> A house is a disposable asset only when it is no longer needed. The arrangements will come into effect only when a house is disposed of, and people will not dispose of their houses while they are alive. Of course, the houses in which people live are not assets to be taken into account for the means test. Having said that, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The Minister has almost persuaded me. I shall not press the amendment because, as I said, it is a probing amendment. However, even in the examples to which the Minister referred, someone who retires above the minimum income guarantee at 65 will return to means-tested benefits by the age of 80. Under the amendment, we want to ensure that those who have paid the full contributions into their basic state pension and their state second pension, not those with a broken contribution record for the state second pension and without a full entitlement, are recognised under the minimum income guarantee.
<P>
Perhaps more important, the Minister needs to consider further those who are in band 1 and on the lowest incomes. They cannot make extra provision for themselves and, consequently, they are likely to fall within the minimum income guarantee, even according to the examples that the Government have given. My colleagues and I especially want to ensure that people in that group are assisted so that they avoid the need to be means-tested later in life. We believe that there is a way, even if the amendment is not the means, in which to achieve that and ensure that at least some people will not come under the minimum income guarantee at any time in their lives.
<P>
The hon. Member for New Forest, West rightly mentioned the fact that some people would not choose to undertake a means test. According to the Government's research, about 35 per cent. of those who do not currently claim said that they would probably never do so. It would be interesting to learn more about the rationale for saying that. However, that factor may change. Perhaps some of the Government's policy changes will alter that behaviour. If not, in 2050 or 2025, some people will find themselves on very low incomes, without the benefit of the minimum income guarantee, when they are 80. We are concerned that they will be no further forward, but we have the opportunity to prevent that from happening. Having said that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Michie. I understand why amendments Nos. 196 and 169 were grouped, but I should explain that amendment No. 196, under which we recommend that stage 2 of the state second pension should be not be introduced, was to have been taken with the amendment to clause 28 on which the Committee divided. Your predecessor, Mr. Winterton, agreed this morning that, provided we referred only to amendment No. 196 in passing, it could be included in that debate.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> In that case, amendment No. 196 is not moved. I call Mrs. Lait to move amendment No. 169.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 169, in page 27, line 16, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`This subsection shall not apply to those working for companies with fewer than five employees.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to exempt from stage 2 of the state second pension people working in companies with fewer than five employees. That is because on 10 January the Government exempted from the provisions stakeholder employers with fewer than five employees. I remember debating that during proceedings on the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999, which first introduced stakeholder pensions. We welcomed the Government's decision, because we were concerned about the extra administration and regulation that would be involved if employers with fewer than five employees had to offer them a stakeholder pension.
<P>
The problem that the amendment addresses is the possibility that those employees may not have access to stakeholder pensions, despite the best efforts of everyone involved—I include in that the Government, those who are selling the products and, indeed, well-meaning employers. That would have the effect that we have discussed regarding the flat rate of stage 2 of the state second pension. Employees in companies with fewer than five employees could therefore find themselves hit by a double whammy: first, they would not have access to a stakeholder pension and, secondly, they would not get a good deal under the state second pension. That might be a fairly arcane matter, except that sole traders make up 64 per cent. of all businesses in this country and companies with fewer than five employees, including sole traders, make up 89.2 per cent. That is a huge percentage. Needless to say, it is a much smaller percentage of employment—about 23.6 per cent.—but it is still a large chunk of the labour market.
<P>
We have tabled the amendment to tease out from the Government how they expect to be able to benefit those employees who miss out on stakeholder pensions and are disadvantaged because of stage 2 of the state second pension. As we have frequently pointed out, that could well mean their being forced back on to the minimum income guarantee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> I am sorry to interrupt my hon. Friend as she is winding up, but from the figures that she has given, does she agree that quite a few people in the categories that she mentioned would earn the kind of money that would mean they were adversely affected by the changes?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Indeed, it is generally reckoned that many people who work in small businesses are at the lower end of the earnings scale. I agree with my hon. Friend. I emphasise that that group could be badly dealt with and miss out. For that reason, I hope that amendment No. 169 will be accepted.
<P>
Debate adjourned.—[Mr. Kevin Hughes.]
