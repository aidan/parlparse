<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. 
Hon. Members may remove their jackets if they wish to 
do so. We now resume our debate on schedule 1.
<H4><center>Schedule 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Limitation of Council Tax and Precepts</center></H4>
<P>
Amendment proposed [23 February]: No. 207, in
page 17, line 33, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4A) the Secretary of State shall publish a statement of the set 
of principles for each financial year on or before 31st December in 
the preceding year'. [Mrs. Spelman.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be 
made.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Local Government and Housing (Ms Hilary Armstrong):</b> Amendment No. 207 would 
mean a return to the crude and universal capping policy 
of the previous Administration. We made a commitment 
to abolish such capping because we wanted local 
authorities to take responsibility for deciding their own 
budgets in light of their spending needs and the available 
resources and for local people to have more influence 
on those decisions.
<P>
In the past, local authorities tended to set their budget 
requirements at the level of the capping limit. We want to 
improve financial accountability, and for that to happen, 
local authorities will have to take more responsibility for 
their budgets.
<P>
As I have already made clear, we hope that the best 
value changes implemented under the part I of the Bill 
plus other changes, such as implementing new political 
management structures, improving local democracy and 
introducing a new ethical framework will help local 
authorities to modernise and improve. We hope that we 
shall not have to use the reserve powers to limit council 
taxes and precepts. Having to publish those capping 
principles under those circumstances would be redundant.
<P>
I also point out, in a spirit of friendliness, that there is 
no requirement under existing legislation to publish the 
capping principles. However, the previous Administration 
chose to do so in most, but not all the years during which 
they implemented it.
<P>
The amendment is unhelpful, and I ask that it be 
withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford </B>(Mole Valley): I listened to the 
blithe words of the Minister and her "have more faith in 
me"	 comments this morning, but even at this early hour, 
I have considerable difficulty with that.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and 
Ripon (Mr. Curry) and I when we worked in what was 
then the Department of the Environment, published the 
principles of capping to make sure that local authorities 
were aware of how universal capping was and of where 
they stood: now they do not. The Government should 
understand that, whatever they might say about previous 
capping.
<P>
The point of the amendment is to try to persuade the 
Government to recognise that there is a lot of 
underground spluttering going on with good reason 
about schedule 1, and that local authorities are being 
left entirely in the dark. They can be clobbered in any 
of four ways without notice. I had hoped that the 
Minister would think carefully again, recognising that 
even some of her Back Benchers will be dragged 
kicking and screaming to vote for it.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> indicated dissent.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> The Minister shakes her head. I 
wish that she would sometimes look over her shoulder. I 
realise that the hon. Lady will drive the measure through, 
which shows how long ago she was last involved directly 
with local government.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Caroline Spelman (Meriden):</B> We shall not be 
pressing the amendment. I beg to ask leave to withdraw 
the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Hayes (South Holland and The Deepings):</B> I 
beg to move amendment No. 42, in page 18, line 30, after 
`may', insert `by order'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to 
discuss the following: amendment No. 43, in page 18, line 
34, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4) No order shall be made, under this section unless a draft 
has been laid before, and approved by resolution of, each House 
of Parliament.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
New clause 4 Approval of capping principles by 
affirmative order 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`. (1) None of the powers contained in sections 52 B L and 
P of the Local Government Finance Act 1992, as inserted by 
Schedule I, shall be exercised unless the relevant order has been 
approved by affirmative resolution of both Houses of Parliament.
<P>
(2) Such an order shall specify the principles referred to in
Clause 52 (B)(2), 52(L)(2)(b) and 52(P) of that Act.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Before Mr. Hayes continues, I note that amendment
No. 43 is fairly wide ranging. It may be convenient to 
treat this selection of amendments as a debate on the 
Schedule as a whole.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> Given your advice, Mr. Gale, I want to 
return to the fundamental issue that has divided the 
Committee throughout our debates. I speak of the 
Secretary of State's increased powers, implicit in the Bill, 
and the challenge to local choice and discretion that they 
present. This group of amendments illustrates that 
difference. Under the amendments, the order that 
selectively cap, target or pick on local authorities would 
be laid before Parliament. It is almost unarguable that that 
should not be so.



<P>
The orders should be open to parliamentary scrutiny, 
unless, of course, it is thought that either the authorities 
picked out for special treatment I use that term 
euphemistically or the parliamentary process is 
unimportant. Perhaps the Bill is a combination of both 
those opinions. The Government place a relatively low 
priority on local democracy. Perhaps the Bill is further 
evidence that they do not want Parliament to have an 
opportunity to debate such matters either.
<P>
Our debates have been civilised, and I have tried to take 
account of the fact that the Minister has limited practical 
experience of local government. I have conceded that 
point in a spirit of generosity. Rather than being 
theoreticians, other members of the Committee have been 
at the sharp end.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I have.
<P>
<B>Mr Hayes:</B> I know, for a couple of years cursorily.
<P>
I know that the Minister will say that such matters were 
not put before Parliament when the previous Government 
introduced capping. However, as my hon. Friend the 
Member for Mole Valley (Sir P Beresford) has said, the 
very universality of the previous arrangements meant that 
authorities were not targeted in the way that I have 
described. As my right hon. Friend the Member for 
Skipton and Ripon said during a previous sitting, the 
publication of guidance and criteria in advance added 
fairness and comprehensibility to the process. That meant 
that it was less necessary to have an additional check and 
balance than it is now, given that authorities may be 
picked out at the Secretary of State's whim. It has been 
suggested, by my more draconian hon. Friends, that that 
might be done for political reasons. An authority that does 
not find favour from a partisan perspective might be 
picked on and given special treatment again, I use that 
term euphemistically.
<P>
In those circumstances, it is only fair and reasonable that 
Parliament should have a chance to scrutinise the process. 
To do otherwise would be to place into the Secretary of 
State's hands arbitrary power. That is the chilling aspect of 
the Bill. The Minister says that the Government had added 
only 25 new powers, but the depth and breadth of those 
powers are unprecedented. No hon. Member would now 
dispute that point certainly, it is not disputed outside the 
Committee. The unprecedented transfer of powers to the 
Secretary of State is widely acknowledged. I am sure that, 
in the spirit of generosity with which she began the sitting, 
the Minister will acknowledge that, too, in her reply.
<P>
These important amendments would introduce an 
additional check and balance. One of the amendments is 
largely technical, the other draws attention to such 
matters. They will be warmly welcomed by all members 
of the Committee and by local government. If the 
Government were to accept the amendments, they would 
show that they have listened to the arguments of the past 
few days.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Curry </B>(Skipton and Ripon): You said
Mr. Gale, that the debate on this group of amendments 
would serve as the debate on the schedule as a whole.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Let me clarify the position. I said that 
it might be for the convenience of Members to treat this 
as a debate on the schedule, as a whole. It is up to 
Members whether they curtail this debate and debate the 
schedule or whether they want to range fairly freely on 
this group of amendments. I am simply saying that 
Members should not expect this Chairman to allow them 
to do both.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale, for that clarification.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Opposition Members want to provide 
that the Secretary of State or, I presume, the National 
Assembly for Wales May exercise the powers to 
designate or nominate an authority only if an order has 
been made and approved by resolution of each House of 
Parliament, and that such an order should contain the 
principles used to decide whether budget requirements 
are excessive.
<P>
That is rather different from the existing procedure, 
introduced and operated by Opposition Members when in 
government, whereby no requirement exists for an order 
to be laid before the Secretary of State can designate an 
authority. Under existing powers, if a local authority is 
designated, it can challenge the maximum amount set by 
the Secretary of State, who will consider any relevant 
information provided by the local authority before 
deciding whether to cap it. It is only at that point that an 
order setting out the maximum amount, or cap, which 
might be different from that proposed when the local 
authority was designated, will be laid, providing for a 
debate in the House of Commons, but not in the House of 
Lords, because it is the custom of the House that financial 
matters are not debated in the Lords. Obviously 
Opposition Members want to change that.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bernard Jenkin </B>(North Essex): Governments 
always try to pretend that a Bill that relates to tax raising 
is, necessarily, a money matter and therefore exempt from 
being considered by the House of Lords. That custom 
relates to the Government's tax-raising powers, not 
powers over local authorities. The Minister would have 
difficulty in persuading the House of Lords that it had no 
right to discuss such a resolution. For example, in the past, 
although Governments claimed that European Community 
financial Bills are financial matters, the House of Lords 
has nevertheless rightly discussed them. It is a spending 
matter.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I said that it had not been the custom 
for the House of Lords to discuss 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The Minister is wrong.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I said that it had not been the custom, 
and it has not. Previously, designation for capping 
authorities has been a matter for the House of Commons, 
and has not been discussed by the House of Lords. 
Perhaps Opposition Members want to change that 
practice; perhaps they are trying to do so through the 
amendment. It has not been the custom to date, and we 
therefore did not want to change that custom.
<P>
We intend to follow the procedure that was established 
by the previous Administration in exercising the new 
reserve powers, for the following reasons. First, I remind 
Hon. Members that, especially when an authority is 
designated for a financial year that has already started, 
time is very important. To add an additional requirement 
for a debate in both Houses would delay the designation 
procedure, and make it much more difficult for a local 
authority to reduce its budget requirement during the 
financial year if that proved necessary. Even if a local 
authority were being designated before the start of that 
financial year, we envisage that that would take place at 
around the time of the announcement of the provisional 
settlement, with any limit being set after the approval of 
the settlement; and again, there would be little time for an 
additional, unnecessary step to the procedure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> I hear what the Minister says about the 
timetable and about the previous system, which I 
anticipated in my remarks, as she will remember. The 
difference in this case is that because particular local 
authorities will be singled out, hon. Members whose local 
authorities would be affected will take an especially keen 
interest in such matters, and might therefore want to 
scrutinise them in greater detail than would have been the 
case under a previous, universal regime.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> We have not yet moved to a position 
whereby Members of the House of Lords represent 
constituencies and therefore represent a particular area. 
The hon. Gentleman's point is therefore not pertinent to 
the current constitutional settlement.
<P>
Secondly. I cannot agree that it is sensible to debate the 
issue in either House before the Secretary of State has 
received any relevant information from the local authority 
concerned. Under existing capping legislation and the new 
reserve powers, authorities that are designated or 
nominated may challenge the maximum amount set by the 
Secretary of State. In doing so, they provide information 
to the Secretary of State that may lead him to revise his 
opinion of the maximum amount. It may even lead him 
to decide not to proceed in which case there is no need 
for a debate.
<P>
Thirdly, the existing legislation does not provide that 
the principles have to be published before authorities can 
be designated. If an authority is designated or nominated 
under the new powers, it will be informed of the reason, 
which will be based on the principles. If Opposition 
Members wish to know those reasons, I am sure that they 
will ask. In any event, there will be plenty of opportunity 
to debate the reasons if the Secretary of State decides to 
propose a cap or notional budget for the local authority.
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
I stress that, if an authority is designated or nominated 
and does not accept the view of the Secretary of State, an 
order will be laid and there will be a debate in the House. 
That is the sensible time for a debate: after the local 
authority has had an opportunity to consider and respond 
to the Secretary of State's view and after, not before, 
the Secretary of State has had the opportunity to consider 
the information put forward by the local authority and 
decide whether or not to proceed, not before.
<P>
The measure deals with the difficult question of where 
the balance between local authorities and the House 
should be struck. It is important that the authority be given 
the opportunity to look at the principles and decide 
whether it is prepared to act within them before the House 
does so.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> One thing that the Minister has 
not put into a timetable is the possibility that the House, 
in Committee or directly, will examine the order and 
reject it. That would leave an authority that has worked 
on the assumption that the order will not be rejected in 
something of a quandary; it may even have got as far as 
printing its billing and so on. How would the Minister fit 
that into the timetable and allow for the additional costs 
that would initially apply but then be revoked if the 
Committee rejected the Secretary of State's proposal?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> That is always a problem in dealing 
with local government and constitutes part of the 
relationship between this place and local government; it 
is a problem that the hon. Gentleman had to face when he 
was a Minister. It is why I am keen that we do not 
establish a relationship in which Parliament is master at 
every step of the way. We want local government to take 
more responsibility in its actions and decisions, 
recognising that Parliament will ultimately have a say in 
agreeing the overall settlement and in agreeing specific 
elements of the settlement, which may go as far as 
designating one or more authorities. The amendments are 
unnecessary and in many ways unhelpful to local 
government and I ask the hon. Member for South Holland 
and The Deepings to withdraw them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> The Minister has made some positive 
remarks about the need to encourage local government, 
but she has not dealt with the issue of Parliament's ability 
to study the matters more carefully. She says that the 
House of Lords would not have a local interest, but 
members of that House, including those of her party, have 
backgrounds and interests in particular parts of the 
country; they will therefore take a specific interest if that 
area has been designated for the penalty. I agree that it is 
a matter for Parliament and local Government, but it is an 
exaggeration to say that the measure does local 
government any favours. From the point of view of 
designated local authorities, the fuller the debate at all 
stages of the process, the better.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I must take issue with some of the 
Minster's remarks, which rather surprised me. First, the 
idea that the capping powers are in any way similar to 
those inherited from the previous Administration is 
sophistry. Nobody outside the Committee believes that; I 
do not think that any Labour Member sitting behind her 
believes it; nor do I think that even she believes it. It 
behoves her to treat the Committee with respect, instead 
of carrying on the pretence that the measure is some sort 
of relaxation of Government authority over local 
authority finances.
<P>
Secondly, the powers in the Bill are far from being 
overt and fair, which is what our capping powers sought 
to be. They are secretive, because the principles are not 
published in advance; they are retrospective, because they 
apply only after councils have set their budgets; and, they 
are selective, because different classes of authority can be 
treated differently, and any matters can be taken into 
account. There is a real case for holding the Executive to 
account more effectively than simply allowing Ministers 
to exercise powers without holding them to account.
<P>
The Minister introduced the most extraordinary red 
herring. When we suggested that there should be an 
affirmative resolution of both Houses, the Minister said 
that that would break with custom. The capping powers 
that she inherited from the previous Administration do not 
provide for an affirmative resolution of both Houses, so 
the House of Lords has never discussed the matter of 
capping individual authorities. We can hardly say that that 
is a custom. There has never been occasion for the House 
of Lords to discuss such matters. The House of Lords can 
have authority over how money is spent in the same way 
as the House of commons, but the other place does not 
have locus over the money that is raised. Jurisdiction over 
supply is, by custom, denied to the other place.
<P>
The measure is not a matter of supply , but about how 
Government moneys are spent and how much autonomy 
local authorities have over their own affairs. It is a 
legitimate matter for the other place to consider.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I shall give way in a minute.
<P>
Whenever the other place upset the apple cart on local 
government matters under the previous Conservative 
Government, I am sure that the hon. Lady was one of the 
first on her feet to say what a good thing that was and 
that the House of Lords had more democratic credentials 
than the House of Commons, with its Conservative 
majority. That shows the humbug that consumes the 
Labour party about the House of Lords. The Minister is 
blinded by her prejudices about the House of Lords, and 
I am surprised that her civil servants allowed her to make 
such comments.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> As the hon. Gentleman is talking 
about humbug, why did his Government cap 20 
authorities in 1990 without pre-signalling the principles? 
Why did they cap 14 the following year, without 
pre-signalling? The House of Lords was given no 
opportunity to comment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The House of Lords was give no 
opportunity to comment, and nor was the House of 
Commons because no affirmative resolution was required.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> There was a debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> A debate on a matter may have been 
raised by the Opposition, but there was no requirement 
for an affirmative resolution. However, we improved the 
position. The present arrangements require pre-signalling 
because it was unsatisfactory not to have it. It is the Local 
Government Association, which is so well represented on 
the Labour Benches, that wants a system of pre-signalling. 
It is unhappy with the arrangements. The Minister said 
that that will be only a matter of time. However, she will 
be the first to agree that the system will have failed if 
such powers are used. Throughout this Committee, she 
has been dreaming of the harmonious relationship 
between central Government and local government. 
However, that relationship will not have come about for 
those authorities on which these powers will be exercised.
<P>
Those local authorities will have had plenty of time to 
get their budgets in order. They will know that capping 
orders are coming, and will judge whether such orders 
have parliamentary support. They do not need to wait 
until orders come into force before taking action. The 
measure gives the Secretary of State an opportunity to 
pounce on local authorities without warning. He or she 
may do that without pre-signalling or without apparent 
rhyme or reason.
<P>
Debate would not necessarily cause great delay. If the 
Department of the Environment, Transport and the 
Regions was properly organised, it would not be taken by 
surprise by authorities likely to break the rules.
<P>
The Minister said that there would be plenty of 
opportunity to debate the reason for capping at a later 
date. However that would be after the event. The House 
of Commons should not pile more powers on the 
Secretary of State, to be used at his discretion, and without 
proper accountability.
<P>
Our amendments concern democracy and 
accountability, about which the Government know 
precious little. They think that their focus groups are more 
important than Parliament.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> I will briefly endorse everything that my 
hon. Friend the Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) 
has said.
<P>
The Minister said that the vast majority of councils will 
never come close to capping. Those singled out for 
capping will feel so isolated that they will expect full and 
proper debate at every stage of the process, and not 
merely after the event. They will feel that they deserve 
that on the grounds of accountability and proper scrutiny.
<P>
It is nonsense to say that our amendments would give 
more power to Parliament, rather than local government. 
The amendments raise the question of whether Parliament 
should study the matter or whether the Secretary of State 
should take more power. However, under the 
circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the 
amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Opposition Members indicated that 
they would like a debate on schedule 1. Committee 
members should therefore be aware that they should not 
raise the issues that have just been debated.
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the First 
schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The last seven Administrations have been 
concerned with the management of local government. 
Underlying philosophies over that period have been 
similar, irrespective of the mechanisms that have been put 
in place: that applies to the current Government and the 
previous Government, in which I served. Both those 
Governments have in common a tendency to become 
increasingly anxious about how to create an efficient local 
administration. The cost of doing so has been a retreat 
from the concept of local government. Local 
administration is not the same as local government.
<P>
The Government mock my party's suggestions that we 
should consider our policies. They are daft to do that, 
especially as they had to invent new Labour etiquette to 
demonstrate the extent to which their policies had 
changed. The process of parties considering what they 
represent is part of a mature political debate.
<P>
Occasionally, we must ask ourselves whether we 
believe in the institutions of representative democracy. If 
we do, we must take risks and allow freedoms. There must 
be a right to get things wrong and be inefficient and, 
perhaps, occasionally, to be corrupt but then there must 
also be an obligation to pay the penalty prescribed by law.
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The previous Government were preoccupied with 
service provision, the efficient measurement of services 
and value for money a phrase which the Minister 
reproduces constantly, for reasons that we all understand. 
We were concerned about ensuring the most efficient 
means of providing services. In a sense it was more 
important for those means to be efficient than for them to 
be democratic. Not only did we ask local authorities to 
externalise services or go in for tendering, but in some 
cases we even pushed the provision of services down 
through the democratic layer, so to speak, into the 
community.



<P>
The community may be virtuous, but it is not 
necessarily democratic. A school board is not a 
democratic body, to all intents and purposes. Most parish 
councils are not very democratic, in that it is often 
necessary to scratch around to find people willing to serve 
on them. The number of contested elections to them must 
be tiny in comparison to the number of posts. 
Increasingly, the emphasis was placed on administration. 
The concept of government tended to disappear. That is 
taken even further in the Bill. There is no point in the 
Minister claiming for the Government a new 
philosophical departure with respect to local government, 
or a new validation of the concept of local government. 
That is baloney. All that is offered is a different 
mechanism to achieve the same end efficient local 
administration.
<P>
The Government have introduced a colossal panoply of 
compulsory inspections partly self-inspection, but with 
the back-up of an array of external inspections which 
come into play if the self-inspections are not carried out 
satisfactorily. The Secretary of State is to have the right 
to give those instructions. Measurement will be against 
national standards. We introduced national standards and 
the Audit Commission the present chairman of which is 
a lady whom I appointed to serve on it. I agree with my 
hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The 
Deepings (Mr. Hayes) that the imposition of national 
standards is a push towards a concept of administration 
rather than of government. It tends towards the 
minimisation of local particularities.
<P>
What is the reason for the Government's intention to 
create a uniform electoral system for local government, 
prescribed from the centre? Why should not local 
authorities be able to decide whether to elect on a 
four-yearly, everybody-out cycle, or a third and a third 
and a third? The reason is of course to reduce the risk of 
councils with permanent majorities. However, if the 
electors decide that they want that and are prepared to run 
the risks that go with it, is it necessarily for us to say that 
it should not happen? They pays their money, they takes 
their choice.
<P>
We are also to have a nationally prescribed code of 
ethics, and the Government will encourage new forms of 
administration. The Prime Minister talks of elected 
mayors. That will make good entertainment, at any rate. 
Forms of cabinet government will be introduced. Those 
are further instances of the national Government 
prescribing what freedom local authorities should enjoy. 
Earlier, during an interesting debate, the hon. Member for 
Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead) and I agreed that 
local government's authority was handed down to it by 
national government, not entrusted to it by what we might, 
without going into definitions, broadly describe as the 
community.
<P>
The assumption is that local government must be 
controlled, monitored, surveyed and checked in all its 
aspects. It does not matter what rhetoric is used. Any 
Government are bound to take a view on what happens to 
25 per cent. of national expenditure. That was a phrase 
that I used repeatedly when I was in her position. It is the 
overriding pretext for this form of top-down control.
<P>
Schedule 1 is the heart of this part of the Bill. However 
whether capping powers are described as crude and 
universal or sophisticated and partial, they remain capping 
powers. They exist for a particular purpose to pre-empt 
the decision of local authorities. The Minister admitted 
that there could be circumstances in which the national 
interest as defined by the Government might be deemed 
superior to a local interest, even if that interest were 
expressed in a referendum. The local authority of the hon. 
Member for Milton Keynes, North-East (Mr. White) has 
just carried out a referendum, which resulted in a council 
tax increase of around 9 per cent. The Bill may create 
good local administration, but marks another step in the 
retreat from local government  and we need to reflect 
on that.
<P>
I am not making another speech about Europe. I want 
you to know that, Mr. Gale, because I want to remain in 
order and do not want you to think that I am pursuing a 
particular hobby horse, known in French as a violon 
d'Ingres. I mention that because there is an extremely 
good Ingres exhibition in London for my money, better 
value than the Monet exhibition.
<P>
Under the impulse of devolution, the United Kingdom 
is moving towards a federal structure. The Government 
are talking about new structures in England, and the 
problem of what form of governance is appropriate for 
England will emerge. We may become like Washington 
D.C. the only territory run by the federal Government 
without having its own powers on a grand scale. So we 
need to think about what we mean by representative 
democracy and real government.
<P>
We are moving beyond the stage at which the 
Minister's proposals can be relevant to the new structures 
of the United Kingdom. I hope that when the Government 
ponder the new constitutional structures in Britain, they 
will think again about how our government is carried out 
an dhow people can be represented at that level. We must 
not end up merely with effective administration.
<P>
I have no doubt that Brussels could administer us 
effectively. However, many of my colleagues

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The fact that the right hon. 
Gentleman tells me that he is in order does not mean that 
he is in order. We must focus our debate on the principles 
of schedule 1. I understand that the right hon. Gentleman 
wishes to put them in context, but I have given him a 
great deal of leeway and that has now come to an end.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I am grateful, Mr. Gale. I was simply 
pointing out that there is a seamless web in the concept 
of government and administration. Many people close to 
me believe that the spider at the heart of that seamless 
web is Brussels. We have to decide on the principles of 
government in an age that is experiencing movement 
upwards to wider structures the process of 
globalisation and downwards through devolution. It is 
unclear whether either of those will provide the sort of 
representative government that people feel provides true 
accountability.
<P>
How we achieve a form of government based on 
accountability that enables us to entrust people to take 
decisions including mistakes is at the heart of the 
constitutional question to which all sensible people in this 
House should be devoting their attention. The debate on 
the schedule is a symptom of it; the wider issue will not 
go away.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> There is a touch of echo between 
my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon 
and myself, but the difference is that he is eloquent and I 
have difficulty with English as a second language.
<P>
I want to follow a similar theme but rather narrower, 
which I suspect will relieve you, Mr. Gale. The Minister 
spoke as if some of the credit for her proposals is due to 
the actions of previous Conservative Governments. If we 
go back further, we can understand why those 
Governments took those actions. There is an oft-quoted 
statement it has now become tedious by the former 
Labour Minister Crosland about the party being over. That 
set the scene for a confrontation between the then Labour 
Government and local government, and for a series of 
Conservative Governments who tried to bring the 
economy of this country into line. Twenty-five per cent. 
of Government expenditure is local government 
expenditure, which is probably rising today. That is also 
reflected in the Minister's frequent statements about 
looking at national issues.
<P>
In those early days there was a considerable battle. The 
Government had to be fairly heavy handed. I was in local 
government at the time and I watched the increasing 
leaning the introduction of SSAs, capping, the Audit 
Commission and the chasing of errant local authorities 
and their members. Anyone who lived in Derbyshire, next 
to Lambeth or in Lambeth itself would have recognised 
the difficulties and the reasons for them. Targets were 
brought in which have eased over the last few years, 
particularly while my right hon. Friend the Member for 
Skipton and Ripon and I were in the Department of the 
Environment. I know those individual local authorities 
and few of them were hit. Those that were recognised 
why, but there was a progressive easing.
<P>
<B>Dr. Alan Whitehead </B>(Southampton, Test): Can the 
hon. Gentleman cite any pieces of legislation that eased 
the matter for local government over the last years of his 
Administration?
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> The hon. Gentleman does not have 
to look at legislation, but at the way it was acted upon. 
The Minister accepted that herself when she talked about 
the way that we published it. We gave fair warning and 
respected the fact that local authorities had points to make. 
They came in to see us. We had deputations about SSA 
times which, I hasten to point out, have been cut out. We 
listened to them. There were changes and movements in 
the right direction.
<P>
<B>Dr. Whitehead:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman saying that, 
although there were no changes in the worst case scenario 
legislation, there was a substantial change in atmosphere 
in the relationship between central and local government?
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I know that the hon. Gentleman 
will find it difficult to accept, but there was. There was a 
considerable movement and it was two way. Local 
government recognised that it had an important role to 
play nationally. One could see that in the way in which 
local authorities set their budgets. Many of them set them 
at capping, but many did not. Many shifted and changed 
and were allowed to make mistakes as my right hon. 
Friend pointed out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Was not an important part of that change 
in atmosphere reflected in the change in attitude of local 
government? Those powers were introduced at a time 
when the hard left in places like Liverpool and Lambeth 
used local government as a platform to challenge the basis 
of democracy. The Greater London council used to talk 
about the superior mandate, for example. Those powers 
were brought into try to stop local authorities thwarting 
overall Government economic policy. Now that the 
Labour party has changed, as everyone acknowledges, and 
there are far fewer such local Labour party politicians 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. First, this is not relevant to the 
schedule and, secondly, it is an intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I think that my hon. Friend got the gist 
of it.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> Yes, I did. Many of the Labour 
Back Benchers will recognise that. Some of them 
struggled with neighbouring authorities. The hon. 
Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) must have 
had considerable difficulties with her neighbour, a fact 
that benefited me and my local authority as it 
demonstrated how idiotic local government could be. But 
generally it was not. We are now dealing with the exact 
opposite. There has been a complete step backwards. We 
have seen that in the manipulation of the SSA, the moving 
of funds north and the games that are being played there.
<P>
The schedule is the heaviest machine gun loading on 
local government that I have seen. As my right hon. 
Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon said, whatever 
one calls it, it is capping of a particularly vicious form. 
The paper entitled "The Reserve Powers" presented at the 
previous sitting sets that out and proves my point, that 
there are four different versions, one of which is the 
current sole option.
<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Minister keeps saying that we should have faith. 
The faith of Labour Back Benchers will be reinforced by 
the party's machinery, but local government is writhing. 
It does not like the fact that the schedule will enable the 
Secretary of State to cap any authority's budget in the 
current financial year and in the next one, and to set a 
target for reducing that local authority's budget over 
several financial years.
<P>
It is an understatement to say that the Secretary of State 
will have considerable discretion over the selection of 
authorities. He will be able to pick and choose because 
schedule 1 will enable him to select an individual council 
for whatever reason he wishes. I do not expect that to 
happen it had better not happen, because there will be 
an uproar but he will have the ability to do so.
<P>
The Minister tells us that everything will be all right 
and that we should have faith, but that is not good enough 
and local government knows it. In my 20 years in local 
government I have never seen it placed in such a position. 
To use a topical metaphor, the proposal is a potential 
avalanche: if the weather on either side of the relationship 
changes slightly, it will be extremely destructive to local 
government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I want to discuss the proposal in the 
context of its politics, especially those of the Labour 
party. The schedule reeks of the hypocrisy of new Labour. 
In Opposition, the party pledged to do away with "crude 
and universal"	 capping; most people probably understood 
that to mean that they would get rid of capping, not just 
crude and universal capping. Those who heard the 
resolution before the Labour party conference in, I think, 
1994, thought that crude and universal were words that 
applied to capping itself and that the Labour party would 
get rid of it, because it was crude and universal. They did 
not realise that the words crude and universal were merely 
a qualification and that the sub-text of the conference 
resolution was, "and we're going to implement a different 
kind of capping"	.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian White </B>(Milton Keynes, North-East): The 
manifesto stated clearly that reserve powers would be 
retained. It was spelt out in black and white.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> If it had been in the resolution 
[Interruption.] The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, 
North-East says that it was in the resolution.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are debating schedule 1, 
not the Labour party manifesto, or Second Reading.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful, Mr. Gale. [Interruption.] I 
appreciate that the Government Whip may not like this 
part of the debate, but the schedule is a betrayal. If the 
hon. Lady is pretending that the Labour party did not try 
to create the impression in Opposition that it was against 
the principle of capping, she is living in cloud cuckoo 
land, or deliberately misleading herself.
<P>
The proposal implements a new kind of capping and, 
as my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley said, it 
implements several different types. I draw on the 
comments made by my right hon. Friend the Member for 
Skipton and Ripon to explain why we are opposed to the 
schedule. Now that local government is not challenging 
the government's authority to set economic parameters, it 
is not seen as a bastion of Marxist revolution, as it was 
in isolated pockets [Interruption.] The hon. Member for 
Milton Keynes, North-East chuckles. Does he remember 
what happened in Liverpool? Is he proud of his party's 
record in that city? Of course not. One of the bravest 
things that a leader of the Labour party did in recent years 
was to take on the left of his party in places such as 
Liverpool, with the result that local authorities now 
behave more responsibly. The time has come for all of us 
to [Interruption.]

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Government Members are muttering away 
because they do not like what I am saying. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is for the Chair to decide 
what is relevant. I am making sure that the hon. 
Gentleman is in order. He is speaking to schedule 1; if he 
ceases to do so I will call him to order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Labour Members do not like it when their 
party is laid bare before their eyes.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I want to thank the hon. Gentleman 
recognising that the changes have nothing to do with the 
previous Administration and everything to do with how 
the Labour party understands local government and works 
with it. An overwhelming number of local councils in the 
north, south, east and west are Labour controlled. The 
Conservative party cannot match that because it is seen 
as anti-local government and irrelevant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Lady is glossing over quite a lot 
and putting words into my mouth.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> What the Minister said is 
astonishing. She should remember the behaviour of 
Derbyshire, whose leader was checked only by the powers 
of the previous Administration, not by the Labour party. 
They were not the draconian powers that we see in this 
Bill; there was a progressive easing in the last few years 
of the Conservative Government.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is inevitable in a party 
political system that there will be differences between the 
parties and inevitable that those differences will intrude 
upon debates from time to time. The hon. Gentleman 
made his point and I have allowed the Minister to reply 
to him and to make her point. May we now please return 
to the schedule? If we do not, I shall rule the hon. 
Gentleman out of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale.
<P>
The capping powers in the schedule are part of a career 
structure that the new Labour party has constructed for its 
councillors in local government. The career structure in 
the Labour party is about discipline; it is about not causing 
any embarrassment. What the Labour party wants in order 
to maintain a presentable facade to the British public is to 
be able to discipline its own members because no 
Conservative authorities will be capped. Conservative 
councils generally have much lower council tax; it is the 
Labour authorities that cause the problem. It is ironic that 
when the Conservative party was on the ramparts trying 
to control the worst local authorities the Labour party was 
nowhere to be seen. The Labour party started tackling the 
issue when it realised that it had to control its own 
councillors and local authorities to make the Labour party 
an electable force. Labour Ministers want the proposed 
powers to control Labour local authorities so that their 
potential candidates can claim expenses and so on in local 
government without embarrassing the party at 
Westminster.
<P>
<B>Ms Sally Keeble </B>(Northampton, North): Does the hon. 
Gentleman accept that his party has a long record of 
disciplining local councillors? In the 1930s, thousands of 
Labour councillors were surcharged for providing school 
meals. The reason the reserve powers are just that is that 
the debate about local government has shifted on. Those 
powers are required as reserve powers, but, generally, 
capping is not required because the debate has moved on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I would love to believe that it had. As my 
hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley said, we felt that 
it had, but, as he also reminded us, the existing powers 
are effectively maintained in the Bill, although with less 
control. There is less discipline on the Secretary of State, 
and no obligation on him to notify local authorities. The 
Secretary of State has taken additional powers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"designate the authority for the following year",
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"set a notional budget requirement to be used for the purposes of 
comparisons instead of the actual budget"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"designate the authority over a number of years".</ul></font>
<P>
The hon. Lady may think that the Secretary of State 
taking extra capping powers is moving on. We think that 
the schedule is going down the wrong road. There may 
be all sorts of party political reasons why the Labour party 
wants to be particularly tough on its own councillors: after 
all, it has a track record of its own councillors being an 
embarrassment to the party.
<P>
The Conservative party is eager to try to rekindle the 
sort of civic pride and local autonomy that local 
authorities enjoyed in the 19th century. It has become 
unfashionable to talk of Victorian values because of the 
association with Thatcherism. In fact the 19th century 
model of local authority autonomy is the sort of vision 
that we need for local authorities, but it is miles away 
from the provisions in the schedule.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Curry:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the 
concept of hostels for unmarried mothers might well be a 
Victorian concept one which the Home Secretary 
appears to have rediscovered?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am looking at the frown on Mr. Gale's 
face. I understand what my right hon. Friend says.
<P>
If we agree that we should rekindle local autonomy to 
enable local authorities to lead their communities instead 
of just being agencies of central Government under 
supervision from the Audit Commission and umpteen 
supervisory powers and ultimately having their budget 
supervised from Westminster as well if local 
government is to mean something and we are to attract 
the right type of people to it instead of career politicians 
passing through on their way to Westminster we need 
to pause for thought before giving the Secretary of State 
all these new powers.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks 
(Mr. Hague), the leader of our party, has made it clear 
that we want to move autonomy and local decision 
making down to local authorities because we think that 
local people should have more control over their affairs. 
As my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley said, we 
attempted to do that in the closing stages of the previous 
Government. The schedule is a major step in the wrong 
direction. Labour Members, who shake their heads sadly, 
know that. They know that the provision is a betrayal. 
They know the stance taken by the Local Government 
Association, which says that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Association remains firmly opposed to the capping of local 
authority budgets."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
They know that the LGA hoped that they would not 
continue capping and that it is deeply disappointed that 
their Government are doing so. They know too that the 
LGA want the key principles governing capping written 
into the Bill and that that betrayal has also come to pass. 
This is a Government who were elected on aspirations and 
promises that they never had any intention of delivering.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> This part of the Bill is central to the debate 
about the nature of local government that some of my 
hon. Friends have just touched upon. Of course there is a 
tension between national Government and local 
government; there always has been. It has always been a 
dynamic relationship, the parameters of which, have 
shifted. This part of the Bill is the mechanism, or tool, 
with which all Governments have chosen to control local 
government. However, it is time to concede, and to 
move on.
<P>
I acknowledge that over the past several years, a 
combination of capping and standard spending 
assessments has forced authorities into the margin as 
regards their inability to spend on services that they 
considered appropriate to their community. We forced 
that margin ever tighter, so that authorities had less room 
to innovate. In this respect, the Bill could have been an 
opportunity to move on from that process, which, as my 
hon. Friend the Member for North Essex said, was 
necessary, given the background that was inherited. It 
could have provided for the evolution of thinking by both 
local government and national Government for a 
foundation from which to move on, rather than a 
tightening of the screw.
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The detail of schedule 1 lest anyone is unclear about 
it reveals a tightening of capping. The suggestion that 
universal capping has gone is merely a soundbite. In 
practice, the schedule will allow local authorities to be 
picked off identified and targeted by the political will 
of the Secretary of State of the day. It would not 
necessarily be a Labour Secretary of State for all time: 
these measures will be used by any politician at the centre 
who has no feel or passion for local democracy. The 
Secretary of State may take powers to nominate or 
designate a local authority if he or she deems the 
budgetary requirement for the year under consideration 
excessive or to set a notional amount for that authority, 
and to do so without reference to both Houses of 
Parliament. It is true that these powers will be taken after 
some discussion, but there will be no real opportunity for 
a local authority or Parliament to have a key say in the 
process, nor a commitment that the criteria will be 
published in advance. The extraordinary part is the 
secrecy, as my right hon. Friend the Member for North 
Essex said. [Interruption.] Sorry, I mean my hon. Friend 
I was anticipating.
<P>
Both my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and 
Ripon and my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley, 
who, in their time as Ministers were responsible for the 
capping regime, made brave speeches stating that they 
would have looked for an evolution or development of 
capping. Both spoke of how attitudes had changed and 
moved on both in Government and local government. 
That opportunity has been missed, and targeted local 
authorities will resent that bitterly. While the provision 
may succeed this has to be acknowledged in limiting 
the risk of another Lambeth or Liverpool, it will also limit 
the ability of local authorities to innovate. It will penalise 
excellence and stop authorities differentiating themselves 
for good, as well as for ill. I do not want uniform, 
mediocre local government; I want a flowering of 
diversity in which different local authorities do different 
things that are relevant to their communities, and, in the 
end, are judged by their communities. The people, not 
the Government or the Secretary of state, are the ultimate 
arbiters in this process. The Government will, through the 
schedule, deliver a uniformity. They will say what local 
government does, when, at what cost, and who is to carry 
out the task. They will than audit, and, if they do not like 
what has been done, they will punish authorities. That is 
what the schedule is about. As my hon. Friend the 
Member for Mole Valley rightly said, that represents an 
unprecedented attack on local democracy.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and 
Ripon said that, previously, Government had focused on 
service delivery. The previous Government focused on the 
process of service delivery rather than on defining what 
they wanted to go in or come out and then telling people 
that if they did not conform to those norms they would 
be penalised. That was a very different agenda. We cannot 
have the freedom to excel unless we have also the 
freedom to fail.
<P>
It is a plain truth of local democracy that if people elect 
a local authority that fails, the authority is ultimately 
answerable to the people. We do not deny that the 
Government have a financial responsibility with their 
overall control of the public purse. That is why I said that 
it is a dynamic relationship. There is an inevitable tension 
between that legitimate concern and the ability of local 
government to have the opportunity to differentiate itself, 
but the Bill goes further than pervious legislation, and 
schedule 1 is the instrument and tool of central control.
<P>
I talked about a flowering of diversity. That must be 
anathema to the Minister. She does not want diverse local 
government. The Government do not want plural local 
government; they want it to be uniform, dull, mediocre, 
controlled and restricted. Local people should understand 
that once that happens, once it has become law, the 
opportunity to change it will be minimal.
<P>
Throughout our debates, I have argued a strong case of 
local democracy [Interruption.] I have argued a strong 
case for local democracy; it is on record. I must tell those 
hon.. Members who find it amusing that when their 
constituents and probably their councillors and local 
authorities read the record, they will be bitterly 
disappointed that their Member of Parliament did not raise 
as much as a small flag.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Does not it say something about the new 
Labour party that when anyone mentions local democracy 
it raises a guffaw of laughter? The sad thing is that Labour 
Members do not realise the irony of their situation, as they 
press ahead with a schedule such as this.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> I was about to say that they have not raised 
even a small flag for local government, let alone waved a 
big banner. That will be seen in the public record.
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> The hon. Lady has raised a little flag. I 
shall now let her raise another.
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> As someone who worked for an extremely 
popular authority that was scrapped by the Conservative 
Government it was just across the river I think that the 
hon. Gentleman should recognise that the Government are 
giving extra powers to local government, creating extra 
levels of local bureaucracy and empowering local people 
in a way that the previous Government would never have 
dreamed of?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> I claim neither the charm nor the 
incisiveness of the hon. Lady, but I have read the Bill 
thoroughly and I have found no evidence that it gives 
local government more power. I do not deny that it could 
oblige local authorities to think more clearly about how 
they deliver their services and that it will oblige them to 
undertake some self-analysis and scrutiny, but it does so 
in a vanilla-flavoured way. that is not untypical of 
Governments since the war, because Administrations of 
both parties have used similar mechanisms. It is an 
on-going process; local government has increasingly 
come under the thumb of central Government, but the Bill 
takes this still further. The false gods are equity and 
comparability.
<P>
The idea that we need to compare all local authorities 
to common standards and criteria is highly questionable. 
It has not been questioned by Labour Members, but its 
usefulness to me in South Holland and The Deepings 
<P>
<B>Dr. Whitehead:</B> rose 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> I will give way, but I want to stick tightly 
to the schedule, Mr. Gale, as your implored us to do. I 
shall give way to the hon. Gentleman provided he sticks 
to the schedule.
<P>
<B>Dr. Whitehead:</B> I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman 
can enlighten the Committee. When did he start 
questioning that "highly questionable"	 proposition? How 
recently did he start questioning the idea that all councils 
should be comparable? Was it last week perhaps?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> I put that intervention down to enthusiastic 
naivety. I was a local councillor from the age of 27. I 
have never changed my perspective on local government. 
I studied politics at university and specialised in local 
government. Throughout my 25-year political career I 
have taken the view that local government is a 
fundamentally important part of our democratic 
infrastructure, that local people should be able to make 
local choices that are appropriate for local communities 
and I have made numerous speeches, in numerous forums, 
to that effect. So I am delighted that the hon. Gentleman 
has given me the opportunity of regaling the Committee 
with that breadth of experience. That will look very good 
on the record or rather it will not, because the record 
cannot convey irony and self-deprecation. When, the 
following day one reads comments that were made in that 
spirit, they always seem flat and plain.
<P>
I have looked at the debates on local government that 
took place in the previous Parliament and which dealt 
with matters similar to those we are debating now. I found 
that, on more than 20 occasions, Labour Members 
attacked capping purely on the grounds that it was 
anti-democratic and unfavourable to local choice and 
discretion. I had not realised how far the Labour party had 
travelled in terms of antipathy towards local choice and 
local diversity. There can be no choice unless local choice 
and local diversity. There can be no choice unless local 
authorities and parties within them are able to differentiate 
themselves, yet the schedule does not allow for that. That 
message needs to ring out from the Committee to the 
whole country.
<P>
The Minister says that her party controls councils up 
and down Britain, from south to north and east to west. 
She would be wise to be more cautious about that 
statement before the coming local government elections; 
I would not be surprised if her party lost up to 500 seats 
in those elections. [Interruption.] My local authority 
already has only a handful of Labour members; it will 
have even fewer after the elections.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Until now the hon. Gentleman 
has commendably remained in order, in a way that some 
other hon. Members have not; I would be disappointed if 
he blemished his record.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> Blemishing my record with you, Mr. Gale, 
would be one of the worst things that I could do.
<P>
I think that I have made my points clearly and firmly; 
I hope that I have made them honestly and in a 
non-partisan way. Much of what I have said could be said 
by people from all political parties or none.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> It is difficult to follow the born-again 
devolution from the Conservative Benches, but I will try 
because I think that the Liberal Democrats have a 
worthwhile contribution to make on the schedule and on 
local government in general. Traditionally, there has been 
two-way suspicion between central and local government 
because of the difficult constitutional relationship. It was 
ever thus and probably always will be. Much of that 
suspicion focuses on the financial relationship and the 
belief that decisions, whether on grants or the power to 
cap local authority budgets, are made in a partisan way.
<P>
I agreed with everything that the right hon. Member for 
Skipton and Ripon said in his analysis of the relationship 
between different levels of government. I found it 
uncomfortable to be agreeing with Conservative 
Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> New politics.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> It is not new politics, it is because the 
words were [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have already made it plain that I do 
not appreciate sedentary interventions, if only because it 
is a gross discourtesy to the Hansard reporters, who find 
it difficult to record such remarks accurately.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I found it difficult to agree with 
Conservative Members because while the words that they 
used were ones with which all members of the Committee 
would probably agree, I was a councillor for eight years 
under the Tory Government and witnessed their 
systematic undermining of local democracy. You would 
rule me out of order, Mr. Gale, if I listed the litany of sins 
that they committed and which they seem to be recanting, 
but the key point is that the control that was exercised 
during 18 years of Conservative Government did not 
work; it blurred accountability.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The less freedom local authorities had to set their own 
budgets and determine their own priorities, the easier it 
was for local government to blame central Government. 
Therefore, people who voted in local elections did not 
know what they were voting for. They did not know 
whether they were voting for a council that would deliver 
better services at reasonable cost; whether they were 
voting for a council that would cut services; or whether 
central Government were forcing those cuts on the 
council.
<P>
All of us who have campaigned in local elections have 
thrived because of that blurred accountability. As a result, 
an increasing number of people either voted Labour or 
Liberal Democrat during those 18 years. At their nadir, 
the Conservatives ran 13 councils.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> Will the hon. Lady acknowledge that it 
became harder to attract people to serve in local 
government because they thought that they would only be 
going through the motions? If local government simply 
becomes an agency of central Government, exciting, 
innovative, dynamic people will never take part because 
they will simply be expected to carry out the Secretary of 
State's whims.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman. It has 
become harder to attract people to stand in local 
government elections. In Somerset, the Conservatives are 
advertising for candidates in the local press. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I appreciate that hon. Members 
have been provoked to some extent this morning. That is 
the stuff of politics. We cannot have private conversations 
in Committee. If the Under-Secretary and the Government 
Whip wish to have a discussion, will they please do so 
outside. I, if no one else, want to hear the hon. Lady.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. I am glad that 
someone wants to listen to me.
<P>
The previous Government's policies have meant that 
turnout at local elections has decreased. The Government 
have spoken abut that in another White Paper. Those of 
us who knock on doors know that people often say, "What 
is the point of voting? You can't change the colour of the 
council around here", because people always vote for a 
certain party; or they say, "The council has little power, 
so what is the point of voting for it? Everything is done 
by the Government."	
<P>
I must not stray too far in talking about the 
Conservative's record, but it is difficult to resist that 
temptation because of what Conservative Members have 
said. We can judge them only by their actions. What they 
have said this morning will be on record, so we shall hold 
them to their promises, if they are ever in government 
again.
<P>
The control of finance and the matters dealt with in 
schedule 1 are at the heart of the debate. When we 
mention capping, Minister repeatedly refer to what the 
Labour party manifesto said about retaining reserve 
powers. They say that Labour Members stood on that 
manifesto. Opposition Members did not, of course, stand 
on that manifesto, so we are entitled to criticise it not 
everyone voted for it.
<P>
If the Government were to renege on their manifesto 
promise, no one would march in the streets or make an 
outcry. In fact, local authorities would give three cheers 
and the Local Government Association would be happy, 
as would most members of the Labour party. They can 
afford to renege on that manifesto commitment without 
losing too much face.
<P>
As I have said before, the Liberal Democrats are 
fundamentally opposed to capping. However, the 
Government are determined to replace universal, crude 
capping with what they call sophisticated, targeted 
capping. Therefore, it is even more important that they 
put before Parliament the criteria that they use. I am sorry 
that they would not accept the amendments that we 
debated earlier.
<P>
The Government say that they want a partnership
with local government, yet the Local Government 
Association now Labour controlled is also 
fundamentally opposed to capping. If capping must 
continue in any form, the association wants to have checks 
and balances on the approach adopted by the Secretary of 
State. Labour Members think that a Labour Secretary of 
State will always be benign, but there might not always 
be a Labour Secretary of State. We are not legislating for 
the next two or three years only, but for the foreseeable 
future. A Secretary of State of a different political 
persuasion may take another attitude to local government.
<P>
We have not talked about the new power to nominate 
councils a measure that was not mentioned in the White 
Paper. I hope that the Minister will explain why that 
provision is in the schedule. In a previous sitting, she 
referred to local authorities making budget decisions on 
the basis of what they thought central Government would 
allow, or what the capping level was, rather than on how 
they perceived the needs of local people or local priorities. 
Nomination and designation powers, and the continuation 
of capping, will carry on that process of local authorities 
trying to second guess where the Government are coming 
from, which will further weaken local accountability. It 
will not help to attract more good people to stand for local 
councils, nor will it increase the turnout at local elections. 
I hope that whatever is in the Government's manifesto, 
they will have second thoughts about this proposal.

<P>

<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> We have had an interesting debate. 
The record will show the differing contributions that there 
have been and the different contributions from the 
official Opposition. It is always difficult making U-turns 
and finding a consistent line, but I am sure that if the hon. 
Member for North Essex works hard at it, he will 
eventually get there.
<P>
The contradictions in his speech this morning were 
staggering. He says that he is interested in going back to 
the Victorian era, and we got to the heart of that. When 
talking about democracy, he finds it difficult to include a 
whole group of people who never had to be considered at 
that time. I am referring, of course, to women, who neither 
had the vote, nor could they be representatives. The 
contributions this morning demonstrate that Conservative 
Members still find it enormously difficult to come to 
terms with full and open democracy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. The hon. 
Lady has just implied that I am in favour of taking away 
women's votes. She is misleading the Committee.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point of order for me.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The hon. Member for North Essex is 
clearly feeling very sensitive. I understand the mental 
strain that he is experiencing in trying to explain what he 
voted for and supported in the previous Administration.
<P>
The speech of the right hon. Member for Skipton and 
Ripon was interesting. I covered much of the ground in 
speaking to amendments last week. I put those powers in 
the context that the Government have set for the 
modernisation of local government. I do not intend to go 
over the arguments again, but it is true that local 
government is not in the healthy state that we would wish. 
Simply by looking at the level of turnout in local elections 
tells us that we cannot afford to be complacent. That is 
one of the reasons why we need modernisation of local 
government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The hon. Lady illustrates the dilemma. She 
is saying that local government must be modernised, but 
that national Government must do it. However, there is 
an alternative thesis. Perhaps national Government should 
take their hands off local government and let it evolve. 
That would be the prescriptive approach; it would 
represent a continuity between the two regimes, on which 
we must both reflect. It is not intention that matters.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I understand what the hon. Gentleman 
is saying. I hope that he will reflect on what I said last 
week and am trying to say now. We must encourage and 
give incentive for innovation, good practice and good 
governance, while ensuring that procedures exist to deal 
with the one or two local authorities that may try to spoil 
it for all the others and bring local government back into 
disrepute. That is what we are trying to do with the 
schedule and why we refer to reserve powers. The hon. 
Member for Mole Valley has a rather chequered memory 
of history, which I shall not explore. We must learn the 
lessons of history. A few authorities had the opportunity 
to bring the rest of local government into disrepute. The 
measures that the previous Government took, designed to 
clobber those few, clobbered everyone, to speak 
colloquially, which I usually try to avoid. We have 
therefore shifted the regime. Capping must be put in the 
context of those other determinations. The Liberal 
Democrats have always opposed any controls of any 
nature. In the current circumstances, that might lead us 
back to difficulties that neither I nor the hon. Member 
for Taunton (Jackie Ballard) want local government to 
experience again.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> Does the Minister accept that what 
she is saying can be considered conversely? Under the 
previous Administration, SSAs and capping applied to a 
class of authorities. Application was not subjective. One 
of the difficulties with the schedule relates not necessarily 
so much to its application to individual authorities, but to 
the fact that other individual authorities in the same class 
as one that is subjected to capping will not be. The 
opportunity for pork barrel politics definitely exists.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The hon. Gentleman enters dangerous 
territory, where I do not want to go. Even working with 
classes, the existing system could be manipulated. We 
made those accusations before the election; we know that 
that capability exists. The system has become so complex 
that it is difficult for people outside to understand what is 
going on and how decisions are reached. The schedule 
deals with categories precepting authorities as well as 
billing authorities. Included in those new precepting 
authorities will be new local government units such as the 
Greater London authority which cannot be in a class with 
any other, because it is different. However, we want to 
have the opportunity of giving incentives to authorities to 
become good performing authorities and be taken entirely 
out of the reach of those reserve powers. The categories 
may, therefore, cross classes, and may not include all 
unitary or district authorities, but may include authorities 
that have clearly demonstrated that they have 
overwhelming support from their local public, and whose 
local public feel that, in developing performance 
indicators, they have a unique relationship with their local 
authority, which they want to support and be seen to 
support. I realise that we play political games, but I hope 
that the hon. Gentleman understands that I have a vision 
not of uniformity but of great diversity in local 
government, which I shall work as hard as possible to 
achieve. The hon. Gentleman may not agree with our 
methods, but I hope that he accepts that we are genuinely 
trying to achieve that aim.
<P>
We want to provide incentives, we do not want to treat 
every authority as if it is potentially the most horrendous 
challenger to central Government and local council tax 
payers. The current system does that.
<P>
The process will not be secretive. A designated or 
nominated local authority will be informed about the 
principles that have been used, the category to which 
those principles apply and the category to which the local 
authority belongs. That will be clear when Parliament 
debates the matter. I shall explain the way in which the 
reserve powers will operate.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Secretary of State will first have to decide whether 
the budget requirement is excessive. He will be able to 
determine the set of principles that he will use to decide 
whether the budget requirement set by a local authority is 
excessive. The set of principles must contain a 
comparison with the budget requirement of a previous 
year. He may also determine categories of authorities and 
use a different set of principles for each category.
<P>
In our previous sitting, I said that councils that make 
representations about capping and their SSAs do not 
understand why it is not possible to consider the previous 
year. The law provides that that is not possible, but no 
one in local government can understand or explain that. 
Local government representatives have stressed that to us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> What difference would being able to 
consider the previous year make to, for example, 
Derbyshire, which was capped? Which authorities would 
be capped if the measure was already at the Minister's 
disposal?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I gave examples in our previous sitting 
of matters that would be examined. I am not prepared to 
name local authorities in Committee in a way that makes 
them feel that I am being vindictive. We are trying to 
establish more rational ways in which to work with local 
authorities, so that they understand our perception of the 
national interest, and what we mean when we say that 
they do not listen to local people, for example, in the year 
after an election.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am trying to deal with the 
intervention of the hon. Member for North Essex.
<P>
It is not fair for a Minister to name authorities that may 
be affected by the schedule. I have no idea of the identity 
of those authorities. I do not have a target list. The hon. 
Member for Mole Valley continually suggests that we 
have such a list. I wonder how he acted when he was in 
government if he believes that we have a list. We do not 
keep a list of goodies and a list of baddies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I accept what the Minister says. However, 
Labour Members constantly imply that we had a target 
list when we were in government. That is not practical. I 
did not keep a list; she does not keep a list; no one can 
do that.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I certainly accept that the right hon. 
Gentleman did not keep a list, and I know that I do not, 
but I do not accept that that was the case throughout the 
previous Administration. History has still to be written 
about that.
<P>
If the Secretary of State decides that the budget 
requirement is excessive, he will be able to designate the 
authority for the year under consideration or for the 
following year. Where an authority is designated for a 
year, the Secretary of State will inform it of a target 
budget requirement and a maximum amount for that year. 
In some cases the target and maximum will be the same 
because the Secretary of State will consider the local 
authority capable of reducing its budget requirement to 
target in a single year. However, if they are different, the 
intention will be to designate the authority over several 
years until the target is reached. The Secretary of State 
will state how many years he thinks it may take to reach 
the target. That figure will be updated as necessary for 
example in the light of inflation.
<P>
Opposition Members rail about how dreadful the power 
is. Its purpose is to enable authorities to work towards 
control of their budgets. Conservative Members have not 
yet quite understood what we mean by three-year 
budgeting. The hon. Member for Mole Valley accused us 
of not receiving delegations, but that is not right. We have 
said that we want stability in the allocation of SSAs over 
three years. We shall of course meet representatives of 
local government as necessary in that time, during which 
we shall also conduct the reviews of SSAs and of whether 
a different method can be found of allocating and 
redistributing central Government grant and the uniform 
business rate. However, there will be no need for councils 
to make representations annually about SSAs, as they 
have done. They will know that those SSAs will not be 
changed for three years. Dialogue will, emphatically, take 
place. In fact, I have a meeting this afternoon with the 
Local Government Association, within the partnership, 
and regular meetings take place for discussion.
<P>
Local government will have the power to manage 
budgets more effectively in the relevant period. Both the 
private and public sectors consider the present opportunity 
to be very important. They want local government to 
grasp it. It has been overwhelmingly welcomed by local 
government.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> Does the Minister understand that what she 
has been talking about is a further emasculation of local 
government? As she knows, it works on the basis of an 
annual budgeting process and discussion of its priorities. 
Of course, it may have a long-term view, but by extending 
capping over time the Minister will further damage a local 
authority's opportunities to come to terms regularly with 
its local priorities, to articulate them to her and to obtain 
funds from Government to deal with them. She has 
outlined a further extension of Government power over 
local government.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I must simply disagree with the hon. 
Gentleman. I do not know of any kind of business or 
public organisation that does not feel that now, at the 
beginning of the 21st century, proper budget control and 
management over a period is better than responding 
annually as councils must now. The current situation is 
deeply unsatisfactory and the reserve powers have been 
developed as a result of the representations that have 
been made.
<P>
An authority may be nominated by the Secretary of 
State, instead of being designated. The hon. Member for 
Taunton raised that point. In that case, the Secretary of 
State may set a notional budget requirement for the year 
under consideration. That requirement will be taken into 
account, instead of the actual budget requirement, if that 
year is used to make a comparison when considering 
whether future budget requirements excessive.
<P>
That is a yellow card, warning the council that the 
Government disagree with it. The council is warned that 
its budget requirement is becoming excessive and that it 
is reaching the point at which it may be designated in 
future. The Government will be telling the council: "This 
year, your budget should have been set at this level; you 
have set it too high"	.
<P>
Such advice should be taken into consideration. Of 
course, the council will have an opportunity to make 
representations and argue that particular events, not 
considered by the Government, should be taken into 
account. When we designate the following year, we will 
have to take into account the previous year's budget. That 
was what I was saying when the hon. Lady had to leave 
the Committee.
<P>
Such consideration is partly needed to get over some 
of the problems that every authority experiences. Indeed, 
your authority experienced such problems when you were 
part of the delegation in the first year in which we 
implemented capping outlined by the previous 
Administration. When your authority came 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is not my authority.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> When the hon. Lady's authority came 
to me, it argued that we had to take into account 
reductions in budgets over the years. My response was 
that we were not legally allowed to do that. In future, we 
will have to take into account the previous year's budget 
when we designate. That is why we will set a notional 
budget, which will be part of the following year's 
consideration.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> Last week, the hon. Lady said that she 
objected to the process under the Conservative regime, 
whereby councils deliberately set a budget at cap and did 
not have a real debate about budget setting. They simply 
went with what they knew the Government would allow.
<P>
Does she accept that that process is the same as 
nominating and telling an authority that its budget should 
have been set at a certain level, which should be taken 
into account the following year?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> From the outset, I have said that 
having to use powers shows that a local council will have 
failed to take control of its budget and take responsibility 
for it in ways that recognise its own course of action and 
the needs of local taxpayers. The hon. Lady disagrees with 
that position. None the less, it is logical.
<P>
The hon. Lady was anxious that nomination was not 
included in the White Paper, "Modern Local Government: 
In Touch with the People"	. However, that document states 
that reserve powers could be used to require councils
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to reduce their budgets over a number of years".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We must find technical means for doing that. 
Nomination enables us to do that without bringing 
authorities into the designated category, which is the next 
tier up. We need three different kinds of card: red cards 
at the top, followed by yellow and purple cards.
<P>
Nomination is the statutory point at which to designate 
in a future year or years. I accept that the hon. Lady does 
not like that. However, I do not agree with Conservative 
Members who implied that such powers are more punitive 
than their exercise of the existing measure. That measure 
has little validity left. It does not allow genuine debate 
between central and local government when decisions are 
made. That is not in anyone's interest.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The procedures for designation are nevertheless similar 
to those in current legislation. Powers are held in reserve 
but our determination to push on with the rest of local 
government modernisation should ensure that it is 
unnecessary to use them. We want improved performance 
and governance from local government. However, we are 
determined to ensure that the vast majority of councils 
that are getting on with the job do not get caught up in 
legislation that is a simple, single club but might end up 
damaging the whole of local government. We want to be 
able to discriminate between councils that are meeting the 
needs of local people and councils that are ignoring them 
and bringing the whole of local government into 
disrepute.
<P>
We have had a wide debate and I recommend that the 
Committee adopts the schedule.

Government amendment No. 238.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Clause 24 provides that the Secretary 
of State or the National Assembly for Wales may 
determine whether the budget requirement of a major 
precepting authority is excessive, and that he should 
inform the authority of his opinion during the financial 
year. We accept that it would be preferable for local 
authorities if the Secretary of State were able to inform 
major precepting authorities of the criteria used to decide 
whether an amount were excessive before the start of the 
relevant year.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 235 and 236 allow the Secretary of 
State to announce that a budget requirement that exceeds 
a specified guideline is excessive, and lay the regulations 
requiring the payments to billing authorities, before the 
financial year begins. In practice, we would aim, as this 
year, to announce the provisional guideline with the 
provisional settlement and to lay the regulations at the 
time of the announcement of the settlement. Amendments 
Nos. 237 and 238 provide for the first year of the scheme. 
For 1999-2000, the Secretary of State can base his 
opinion that the budget requirement is excessive on the 
guidance already issued.
<P>
Turning to the amendments from the Hon. Members 
opposite, amendment No. 201 would restrict the Secretary 
of State to a set of principles that is the same for all 
authorities in deciding whether the budget requirement is 
excessive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. The clause 
and its amendments relate to regulations that are laid 
elsewhere in this place. May I ask the Minister, through 
you, Mr. Gale, to explain the purpose of the regulations? 
Without a proper explanation, our discussions will be 
Kafkaesque and meaningless.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a matter for the Chair. It 
is up to the Minister to decide how best to present her 
arguments. She has heard what the right hon. Member for 
Skipton and Ripon says and will respond if she so wishes.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am happy to explain the purpose of 
the clause and why other aspects are left to regulations. 
The clause is simply a means to enable precepting 
authorities that set their council tax at a level that means 
that they have to contribute to council tax benefit to 
transfer that liability to the billing authority. The law does 
not allow that at present.
<P>
The council tax benefit subsidy limitation scheme 
announced in the settlement debate will be the subject of 
a Delegated Legislation Committee later this month, so I 
am cautious about going too far into that. The principle 
of the scheme is that, where local decisions lead to large 
council tax increases, and thus council tax benefit, some 
or all of the costs of the extra council tax benefit should 
be met locally rather than nationally. We believe that that 
will make councils take more responsibility for decisions 
about council tax.
<P>
The guideline is a 4.5 per cent. increase in council tax 
which, as the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon 
correctly points out, is part of the regulations, or such 
higher increase as is necessary to give the council an 
increase in its budget requirements equal to its cash SSA 
increase. It is the same for all billing and major precepting 
authorities. In other words, the criteria that we have 
announced this year are the same for all authorities.
<P>
Councils budgeting prudently and setting council taxes 
up to the guidance level will continue to receive subsidy 
as now. Individuals' benefit of entitlement will not 
therefore be changed. But the fact that the national 
taxpayer currently picks up the full results of council tax 
increases through council tax benefit subsidy should be 
shared at local level if that goes above a particular level. 
I hope that does not mean that I am out of order. I simply 
seek to inform hon. Members about the precise context of 
the clause.

<P>

<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Are the details of this scheme identical in 
England, Wales and Scotland?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> No. We are entering into devolution 
and the Welsh Assembly will play a significant role in 
implementing aspects of the Bill. Because of the 
differences in the local government finance systems in 
Wales, and more especially in Scotland, the schemes will 
be different.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Is it true, therefore, that in Wales and 
Scotland the amount clawed back from councils, in the 
event of what the Government regard as an excessive 
interest, will be less than the amount clawed back from 
English councils in identical circumstances?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> It is difficult for me to give a straight 
answer on that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The answer is yes.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am not convinced that that is so 
because the systems are so very different and will operate 
in different ways.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. Perhaps the 
Minister could be informed on that.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I was about to say that if I am wrong 
I will come back to the Committee. I do not have 
responsibility for Scotland and Wales. My responsibility 
is to put to the Committee what we are doing in Scotland.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> If it turns out that my right hon. 
Friend is correct, what will be the hon. Lady's reaction?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I have made it clear that my 
responsibility is for England. I am content that the scheme 
that we have proposed for England is fair and right for 
our structure.
<P>
Amendment No. 201 argues that the principles should 
be the same for all authorities when deciding whether the 
budget requirement is excessive. I understand where 
Opposition Members are coming from, but at some stage 
we may want to have a different scheme for a precepting 
authority than for a billing authority. In normal 
circumstances that might not be true, but if something 
happened in the fire service one year, we might want to 
exempt fire authorities. Therefore, I resist the amendment, 
so that if that proved necessary we could use the 
affirmative resolution.
<P>
This year we have used the same set of principles for 
all authorities and we currently intend that that should 
continue. In their responses to the consultation on this 
year's scheme, some authorities have said that the scheme 
should differentiate between types of authorities or that 
certain exclusions, that would affect a particular type of 
authority, should operate. We therefore felt that we should 
at least leave open that possibility and not state in the 
Bill that every authority should always be treated in the 
same way.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> There is another possible 
approach. The hon. Lady used the fire authorities as an 
example. They would be called a class or category and 
could be treated differently through their SSA and their 
revenue support grant. That would offset the difficulty 
that she describes.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> They could be, but that is precisely 
the point that I am trying to make. I do not foresee many 
circumstances when it would be appropriate, but local 
authorities have put the point to us, and we have, 
therefore, responded by resisting the amendment. 
I understand where hon. Members are coming from but I 
am not persuaded that we should not at least retain the 
option. I hope that, on reflection, hon. Members will agree 
not to press the amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 100 would require the Secretary of 
State to publish all the factors that he takes into account 
when setting criteria to determine if the budget 
requirement is excessive. The criteria themselves will be 
published, as they have been this year, as part of the 
settlement and the Secretary of State will defend them as 
necessary. The criteria will be based on the Secretary of 
State's views of what is reasonable to be borne by local 
taxpayers, which is a matter of judgement. I hope that 
the Hon. Members will be reassured and will not press 
the amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 39 does not make sense. As the right 
hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon said, the requirement 
for authorities to raise the tax for the scheme has been 
given effect by regulations made under the Local 
Government Finance Act 1992. Thus, provision is already 
made for it to apply to the next financial year.
<P>
Clause 24 merely provides a technical fix to ensure that 
the burden can be spread fairly between the local 
authorities responsible. Preventing the clause from having 
effect for 1999-2000 would not reverse the scheme; it 
would simply produce a shortfall on the collection fund 
for the first financial year of the scheme a shortfall that 
would have to be met by the major precepting authority 
that had exceeded the guideline, as well as the billing 
authorities, which may not have done so.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> What the Minister says raises a significant 
matter. If clause 24 is not carried into law, the hon. Lady 
will, of course, carry on as though the other regulations 
will still be carried into law. However, if clause 24 is 
not carried into law, she will have to withdraw the three 
regulations on the council tax benefit limitation scheme, 
which are currently before the House, because the scheme 
could not possibly operate without the clause being in 
place. Will the hon. Lady confirm that, if the Government 
were to lose this part of the Bill, she would withdraw the 
other regulations? If she does not, she will be imposing a 
completely perverse situation on local authorities.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The hon. Gentleman knows that we 
are acting and following the usual procedures of the 
House. We have every right to take the regulations 
forward, and they will stand. They have to be debated in 
Committee, but, none the less, they came into effect the 
day after they were laid.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> With respect, that is not the question that 
my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex asked. We 
do not dispute that the Government can lay regulations. 
My hon. Friend said that, if the clause were to be removed 
from the Bill, the Government could not implement their 
regulations, because they would not have a mechanism 
to redistribute resources between local authorities; that is 
because precepting and billing authorities are not the 
same. In practice, therefore, the Government would have 
no alternative but to withdraw their regulations. It would 
not work.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am not convinced of that, but time 
will tell.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> No. I have made the position 
absolutely clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I wish to raise another point about the 
amendment.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> It would delay the scheme for a year. If it 
were carried, it would be perfectly reasonable for the hon. 
Lady to delay her whole scheme for a year. It would be 
utterly perverse if she were them to exercise powers under 
those regulations that could clobber unfairly the authority 
that was not overspending and put the burden on the 
authority that was trying to pay the council tax benefit. Is 
she seriously suggesting that that is what she would do?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I did not notice the hon. Gentleman 
raising a new point.
<P>
Amendment No. 99 proposes that the Secretary of State 
should agree with the Local Government Association the 
factors to be used in deciding whether the budget 
requirement is excessive. As hon. Members know, we 
attach great importance to the partnership that we have 
developed with the LGA. We shall continue to meet the 
association and discuss with it issues that affect local 
government. However, we will not abrogate our 
responsibilities; and we accept that that is a Government 
responsibility.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> Does the hon. Lady not accept 
that her responses to my right hon. Friends the Members 
for Skipton and Ripon and for North Essex indicate the 
opposite? If the proposal goes forward, she will hit one 
section of local authorities and not the other; she will 
totally turn back the partnership that she speaks about.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I do not accept that we shall lose that 
position. Therefore, I am not prepared to speculate or start 
hares running in the way that Opposition Members 
want that would create uncertainty outside and I am not 
prepared to do it. I will not have Opposition Members 
trying to push me down that route. I am being honest; the 
measure, which is part of a Government legislation, will 
be implemented this year and the regulations for it have 
been laid. I will therefore not concede it before we have 
even got through the debate.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> Perhaps the Minister is saying that 
because she has is mind the fact that many Labour 
Members are strongly opposed to the council tax benefit 
limitation subsidy, as are the Local Government 
Association and the 196 local authorities that responded 
to the consultation exercise. If the Minister now admits 
that losing the clause would mean that the system could 
not go ahead this year, she may face a rebellion among 
her Back Benchers. Is that not what she is frightened of?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I did not realise that I seemed 
frightened I am far from frightened. I am saying that 
local authorities are setting their budgets; the Department 
has been informed of the budgets of more than 20 
authorities. Those budgets have taken the regulations into 
account and it is not my job to set hares running by 
responding to speculative questions from Opposition 
Members. Tempting as that might be, I will not do it.
<P>
Amendment No. 99 proposes that the Secretary of State 
should agree with the LGA the factors to be used in 
deciding whether the budget requirement is excessive. We 
want to work with the LGA but we do not expect to put 
Government responsibility on to its shoulders; it has a 
right to argue and to disagree with Government and that 
will clearly occur in this case. Agreeing a mechanism with 
the LGA would put it into a difficult position; presumably, 
it could continue not to agree and we would then have to 
find other ways of putting the principle that we are 
applying into place.
<P>
The Government have implemented the scheme 
because we want to make councils responsible for the 
implications that budgets will have on their taxpayers. We 
do not believe that councils that levy high council taxes 
should be able to rely on the national taxpayer to pick up 
the full bill for the resulting additional council tax benefit. 
As Opposition Members know I am in no way hiding 
it the LGA opposes in principle the wider council tax 
benefit subsidy limitation scheme. That is its prerogative 
and I have discussed the matter with its members in 
partnership meetings and at the full assembly group 
meeting.
<P>
However, that does not mean that we accept the 
reasoning of the LGA. Building in delays to give the 
LGA and the Secretary of State time to try and reach 
agreement on the factors for forming an opinion would 
not realise the Government's aims. We hope that 
councils will budget prudently and that the council tax 
benefit subsidy limitation scheme will remain as it is 
with the Government and the national taxpayer picking 
up 95 per cent. of the cost. One way in which we can 
ensure that councils budget prudently is by 
strengthening local financial accountability so that 
increases in local taxation are borne locally. I cannot 
accept the amendment.
<P>
My hon. Friends tabled amendment No. 196 with the 
aim of introducing a "sunset"	 element into the clause. We 
discussed many aspects of the principle of the amendment 
last week, in relation to other amendments. As I have said, 
the scheme is given effect by other regulations. If it 
proved necessary or desirable to end the scheme, that 
would have to be done by altering the regulations and that 
is the route that we would take. The clause would have 
no effect without a scheme being in force and, in such 
circumstances, could be repealed in good time.
<P>
Although I appreciate the evident hope of all hon. 
Members that local authorities will budget prudently in 
future and will not fall into the purview of the scheme, 
we want to ensure that, if it needs to be operated at all, it 
is operated effectively. For that reason, I cannot accept 
that the enabling clause should be subject to a limit that 
we would not want to risk for the rest of the scheme.
<P>
I appreciate that members of the Committee want to 
debate the scheme as a whole. There will be an 
opportunity to do so in Standing Committee when the 
regulation is debated. The clause is an enabling clause to 
allow the precepting authorities to pay the billing 
authorities. At present, it would be illegal if the billing 
authorities insisted that they did so. That is why the clause 
is in the Bill and why I have spoken to the amendments 
in the way that I did.

<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we continue the debate on the 
amendments, I remind hon. Members that the Committee 
will sit until 11.30 this morning. In the absence of other 
directions, it will be up to hon. Members to make 
individual arrangements, through the usual channels, if 
they wish to leave in time for Prayers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I feel a bit sorry for the Minister having 
to deal with social security matters. She is not an expert, 
and neither am I, and the regulations are near to being 
incomprehensible, as such regulations often are. She said 
that the corpse is buried elsewhere; we are simply trying 
to describe the coffin.
<P>
If we were to delete the clause, it would not necessarily 
stop the regulations, but it would stop them working. The 
Government would then have no practical option but to 
pull them. I am not setting a hare running; I am trying to 
talk sensibly about how things work in the real world. In 
local government, the people who precept are not the 
same as those who bill. The purpose of the clause is to 
allow the penalties for what the Government describe as 
excessive taxes to fall back on the person who has done 
the levying. That power does not currently exist, so the 
regulations could not go ahead without the clause. Indeed, 
under the present law, people would have a perverse 
incentive to take advantage of the lacunae. It would be a 
marvellous opportunity to make somebody else pay for 
one's own virtues or sins, depending on how they were 
seen.
<P>
When we discussed the local government finance 
settlement, the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien), 
who may be with us this afternoon, made a powerful plea 
against this regulation. He described the problem by 
suggesting that the regulations fell disproportionately on 
local authorities with a large number of band A council tax 
properties in other words, those with the poorest 
house-owning council tax payers. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"If a council in the poorer group of local authorities tried to 
increase its council tax over its budget requirement to sustain 
services, the application of the council tax benefit subsidy limitation 
scheme would be devastating, because of the clawback of the rate 
support grant.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The council tax benefit is payable to help people who cannot 
afford to pay their council tax. It is a social benefit and, I believe, 
it should be the responsibility of the Government to meet the cost. 
Such direct welfare costs should not be a charge on the resources of 
local authorities. I emphasise that I am speaking of the poorer 
council group in local government."	 [Official Report, 4 February 
1999; Vol. 324, c. 1152.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Member for Normanton asked the Minister 
for a meeting to talk about the Government reconsidering 
the scheme. I do not know whether such a meeting took 
place, but clearly the representations of the Minister's 
hon. Friend had no effect because we are now faced with 
these regulations.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is worth while spelling out what the regulations 
mean. I raised a point of order because we cannot debate 
the clause unless we understand to what it relates. If we 
did that, the discussion would be meaningless. I shall pay 
great attention to keeping in order, but I want members 
of the Committee to understand what we are discussing.
<P>
The council tax benefit limitation scheme aims to 
create an offence of excessive increase above threshold 
council tax. The threshold is last year's council tax plus 
4.5 per cent., or a calculation of incredible algebraic 
complexity, which would allow a council that wished 
to spend its cash SSA increase to do that without 
breaching the threshold. Once the threshold is hit, a 
taper determines how much of the excess will be paid 
by councils in other words, council tax payers rather 
than the Government. Therefore, if a council spends
0.5 per cent. above 4.5 per cent., the taper represents 
an eighth, which will be paid out of local resources, 
and spending 1 per cent. above 4.5 per cent. means 
that a quarter will be paid out of local resources. 
However, if 3.5 per cent. the source of those figures 
is a mystery to me above 4.5 per cent. is spent, the 
local taxpayer will have to pay the whole cost.
<P>
The sum that is to be clawed back is calculated 
according to a formula, which is based on more algebra: 
C represents the council tax that the council wants to levy; 
N represents the threshold council tax; T represents the 
tax base, and B represents the proportion of council tax 
yield from benefits or from 16 per cent. if the real figure 
is above 16 per cent. that percentage constitutes another 
crucial part of the arithmetic. I see that my hon. Friend 
the Member for North Essex is catching on. Finally,
Z represents the taper.
<P>
I know that you, Mr. Gale, with your long experience 
in the House, will understand all that. My hon. Friend the 
Member for Mole Valley caught on immediately. It means 
that highly geared local authorities are most affected. For 
local authorities that need big council tax increases to 
provide an incremental budget increase, the less 
favourable the gearing ratio, the more easily they go 
through the taper. That is the key point. I do not claim 
that the Government have not introduced some 
equalisation, but that it is not sufficient.
<P>
For a given increase in budget, local authorities hit a 
higher level of taper, or clawback, more easily. Mole 
Valley, is the archetypal well-heeled local authority. The 
area has been cited as being relatively affluent. In 
practice, that local authority would be affected 10 times 
less than Liverpool, Hackney or Newham by the 
regulations.
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> Does the right hon. Gentleman accept the 
basic principle that local authorities that comprise many 
people on low incomes have a particular responsibility not 
to increase the council tax suddenly? The local authority 
that I led froze the council tax for three years. That policy 
was hugely popular locally because people did not want 
big increases in council tax, even though most of them 
received council or poll tax benefit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I agree with the hon. Lady, but her 
comments support my points. Places such as Newham, 
Hackney and Liverpool have many properties in the lower 
bands and many people on council tax benefit. Those in 
bands A and B, who constitute the tax base in those areas, 
will be hit to cover the clawback, or the self-financed 
element.
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that 
we are considering the effect on people with small 
disposable incomes of what we would call small increases 
in their council tax? That is why this measure is right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I accept that it is the Government's 
intention as it was the previous Government's to try to 
establish a mechanism to discourage local authorities from 
increasing council tax if that burden would fall on the 
national taxpayer. The Government claim that they have 
established an equalisation scheme that resolves the 
problem that I have described. My argument no doubt 
this will be bashed out in due course in the relevant 
Committee is that it will not work. It can work to an 
extent, but not sufficiently. It will not prevent the major 
burden of the financing of that part of the increase that 
devolves back on the local authority from falling on 
people in the lowest council tax bands. That is because of 
the gearing effect of the finances of the relevant local 
authorities, as well as their social geography or sociology.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> Will my right hon. Friend pursue 
further the line of thought suggested by the remarks of 
the hon. Member for Northampton, North and consider 
the local authorities which, because of the way in which 
the regulations will be applied, will have their limits set 
at below SSA? I am thinking of Brent, Ealing, Lewisham, 
Newham and similar authorities. The hon. Lady should 
consider the other side of the matter expenditure on 
services.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I absolutely agree. Of course, local 
authorities for which the gearing is favourable, of the sort 
with which my hon. Friend will be familiar, will 
encounter a completely different order of problem much 
less than those to which he and I have been referring.
<P>
Three keys are involved in sorting out this issue the 
gearing, the taper and the proportion of council tax yield 
from benefits, even at the 16 per cent. average. The 
regulations that we shall be helping to bring into effect 
let us be clear; if we do not pass the measure, they will 
not work will put the burden of financing the very poor 
on the nearly poor. Support for people in the council 
house will fall disproportionately on people in the band A 
and B properties, simply because of the nature of the local 
authority in which they live.
<P>
That is why this is a nasty piece of legislation, I am 
sorry that we shall have to give it fair wind I imagine 
that that is what will eventually happen but it should not 
happen without a protest about its effects. It will hit the 
poorest people and it is interesting that it comes from a 
Government who have spent so much time talking about 
combating social exclusion.
<P>
I asked the Minister about the difference between 
Scotland, Wales and England. An item from the Local 
Government Chronicle of 5 February, headed "LGA 
dismay at Prescott tax plans"	 states, among other things, 
that the LGA
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"wanted the maximum amount of subsidy clawed back pegged at 
0.5 per cent. of a council's budget requirement instead of 1 per cent., 
to bring England into line with plans for Scotland and Wales."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I know that we now have devolution, and I am not 
against it, but I would be worried were it increasingly to 
result in different burdens falling on people in the 
different parts of the United Kingdom, causing people to 
feel that there is not a level playing field in that respect. 
That will increasingly happen. I should like a reply to my 
question about whether the burden on local authorities in 
Scotland and Wales will be less than that on exactly 
equivalent local authorities in England taking exactly 
equivalent steps.

<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I want to speak to amendments
Nos. 99, 100 and 39, but also to agree with the right hon. 
Member for Skipton and Ripon that the clause is a 
particularly nasty one. Opposing it would not prevent the 
council tax benefit subsidy limitation scheme from 
becoming law. It would, however, mean that the billing 
authorities could not reclaim if the precepting authorities 
exceeded the guideline. That would be a recipe for 
disaster in local government, and I cannot believe that the 
Minister or the Secretary of State would want it to happen. 
For that reason, if there were to be a vote on clause 24, 
and if by some happy chance Labour Members who were 
unhappy about it voted against it and it was defeated, that 
would be the end of this nasty scheme.
<P>
Clause 24(3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Secretary of State may base his opinion on such factors as 
he thinks fit".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Government amendment No. 235 introduces a welcome 
mention of criteria rather than opinion. We support that. 
Our amendment No. 99 would replace the whim and fancy 
of the Secretary of State with the requirement to reach 
agreement with those partners of which we keep hearing, 
the Local Government Association. We do not believe 
that that would be an abrogation of the Government's 
responsibility; we think that it would give proper teeth to 
the partnership on which the Government are so keen.
<P>
Amendment No. 100 requires the Secretary of State to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"publish all factors he takes into account in reaching his opinion",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
a refrain to which we keep referring in an attempt to 
increase the clarity and accountability of the Secretary of 
State's actions. It would be nice to think that the Minister 
would change her mind and take the amendment on board.
<P>
Amendment No. 39 would roll forward the date to the 
year 2000. The Bill will not be through the House before 
April 1999. Therefore, this is retrospective legislation 
which we are told local authorities, now have to take into 
account when setting their council tax, although I 
understand that the impact of this scheme, as we heard 
from the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon, differs 
throughout the country.

For example, Vale of White Horse district council, will 
have a council tax rise of approximately 8 per cent. It is 
not worried about the scheme because it will have 
minimal impact there they will lose a very small 
amount whereas East Sussex county council, which I 
accept is a different tier of authority with a much higher 
budget, will suffer a loss of 250,000, according to what 
I last heard about its planned council tax rise. Some 
authorities will not need to worry because they have so 
few people on council tax benefit that they can set council 
tax at 8 per cent. and not suffer an impact, but there are 
others for which a rise of 1.5 per cent. above the guideline 
will have a major impact. That cannot be fair, transparent 
or accountable.
<P>
In a previous debate about best value, we tried to move 
the repeal of CCT backwards, but that was resisted by the 
Government. It would be nice if they could balance that 
resistance by not resisting amendment No. 39, which 
would move forward the date for the scheme to begin. I 
accept that if we were successful with the amendment, it 
would not reverse the scheme because of the requirement 
for an amendment to the regulations also which Liberal 
Democrats have prayed against and on which a debate 
will take place elsewhere.
<P>
We are told constantly about how intent the 
Government are on sticking to every jot and tittle of their 
manifesto. But this proposal was not in the Labour party 
manifesto.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Has the hon. Lady noticed that, whenever 
we speak about something that is not in the manifesto, the 
Minister talks about going beyond it, as if whatever it is 
were simply a natural extension of it. There is no sign 
whatever that anything as nasty as this would be in the 
manifesto.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> There was indeed no sign of anything 
as nasty as this provision. The Government will say that 
it fits in with their phrases such as replacing crude and 
universal capping with sophisticated and targeted capping, 
keeping reserve powers and having some control over 
local authority budgets. What they will not say is that the 
provision is a fundamental attack on the notion that 
central Government rather than local government should 
be paying for poverty. That is what the hon. Member for 
Northampton 
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Normanton, in south Yorkshire.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> My geography is not that good.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The hon. Lady is going to be leader of 
her party.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> Geography is a subject that one can 
always learn in the job.
<P>
The proposal was not in the Labour party manifesto 
or the White Paper. We shall oppose it fully, but if the 
Government are determined to push forward with it they 
have force of numbers if not that of intellectual argument 
or morality on their side delaying it a year would at least 
give local authorities a better chance to reflect the 
proposals in their future budgets.
<P>
The so-called sunset amendment, which would not have 
the desired effect unless it also applied to the regulations, 
shows the extreme unhappiness on the Labour Benches 
about the purpose behind the clause.
