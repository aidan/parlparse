from the Electoral Commission, both of whom I most warmly welcome to

Wardle:</b></i> Thank you. I am the chief executive of the
Electoral Commission. With me is Lisa Klein, the director of our party
and election finance

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110661000220"></a>The

No.</div><a name="08110661000014"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110661000221"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Excellent. Before calling the first hon. Member
to ask a question of our witnesses, I remind all members of the
Committee that questions should be limited to matters within the scope
of the Bill. In view of time constraints, I request that both questions
and perhaps the answers of our witnesses should be
succinct.</div><a name="08110661000015"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
102102</b><a name="08110661000222"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jonathan Djanogly</b> (Huntingdon) (Con): Good morning. I want
to talk about schedule 1 to the Bill, but before doing so I wish to ask
whether there are any particular points that the Electoral Commission
would like to discuss this morning, because we can address them as
well.</div><a name="08110661000016"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Wardle:</b></i> Thank you. I am sure that members of the
Committee will want to ask us about a number of items. There are two
particular areas on which I hope to give the commission&#146;s views,
the first of which is our concern about the proposals on the
composition of the Electoral Commission, in that the Bill has departed
significantly from the recommendations of the Committee on Standards in
Public Life. Secondly, I am sure that we shall be asked about it, but
we certainly want to talk about the concerns that have been raised
about the proposal in respect of the commission&#146;s investigatory
powers.</div><a name="08110661000017"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
103</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000223"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Right. That is a fitting point on which to
start. In terms of size, schedule 1 takes up well over half of the
Bill, so it is an important part. There is some confusion about who
actually prepared or wanted what has now become schedule 1. Some of it
clearly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column42" />Column number: 42</div>comes from the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000,
some seems to have been proposed by the Electoral Commission and some
seems to have been proposed by the Ministry of Justice. It might be
helpful if you could go briefly through the schedule and identify the
new powers, and say who proposed
them.</div><a name="08110661000018"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Wardle:</b></i> If I may, I shall ask my colleague, Lisa
Klein, to explain the current position, the changes and our views on
the
changes.</div><a name="08110661000019"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Lisa
Klein:</b></i> Schedule 1 and clause 1, with one exception,
replicate the current investigative or monitoring powers. Those powers
enable us to request documents and obtain explanations from regulated
entities, such as political parties, third parties and regulated
donees. The current powers under PPERA also provide for us, in our
monitoring role, to enter premises on notice to inspect documents
relating to financial information. That is limited at present to
political parties, third parties and permitted participants in the
context of a referendum. That is replicated in the Bill, with the one
exception that the ability to enter premises upon reasonable notice is
extended to all other regulated entities. The provision reflects the
current commission role in terms of monitoring and inspecting the party
finance regime. It provides the type of powers that one would
anticipate having in any inspectorate-type monitoring
authority.</div>
<a name="08110661000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that
the Bill also clarifies and extends the commission&#146;s role as a
regulator, paragraph 2 of the schedule refers to the powers that we
would have in  the event that we were wearing our investigative
hat. It is subject to the caveat that there is reasonable suspicion
that a breach has occurred. We are then into the realm not of
monitoring, not of inspecting, but of investigating. In that context,
the law is broader in that it enables  us to obtain information
and documents, and to have representatives of entities or anyone who
may have information relevant to the allegations attend for
interview.</div>
<a name="08110661000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill also
provides for the commission to obtain a warrant to enter premises to
seize documents. In discussions with MOJ officials, what I wanted,
given my prior experience as a regulator of party and election finance,
was a mechanism so that if we issued a notice and it was not
voluntarily complied with, there would be some way for us to enforce
it. There are different ways in which that can occur. The one selected
in the Bill is the ability to seek, through a justice of the peace, a
warrant for entry. In my home jurisdiction it was handled through a
notice that would be issued if there was a lack of compliance, and that
would be through the judicial process. We would put the arguments to
the court as to why there should be an order compelling compliance with
that notice, and if that court order was not adhered to, the individual
or entity would be held in contempt of court. There are two different
avenues and one has been chosen. If there is a preferred alternative, I
am sure that we would be able to work with
that.</div>
<a name="08110661000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
104</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000224"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Can you explain to what extent you differed in
approach from the MOJ? You have mentioned having a court process rather
than a magistrates process. Are there any other areas that you had a
difference of opinion
on?</div><a name="08110661000023"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Wardle:</b></i> May I clarify that? There are two areas where
there have been concerns. The first relates to our current monitoring
and inspection powers. For example, a time when we use, or could use,
those current powers 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column43" />Column number: 43</div>is when we go into the political parties that receive policy development
grants, on roughly an annual basis, to audit their documents and
records, because we have a duty to assure Parliament that that money
has been spent in accordance with the terms of the grant. That is
inspection and audit; we do it already and we think that the current
powers are adequate for that.</div>
<a name="08110661000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first
major concern that we have heard is about the extension of the power to
enter to inspect documents&#151;in that context, two regulated
donees&#151;and we are open to arguments about that. We feel that the
current powers are adequate to do the job we need to do regarding
inspection. One can see why, for completeness, the powers have been
extended, but we are not convinced that we need those powers. If
Parliament were to have concerns about that particular aspect, we would
be relaxed provided that the current powers are preserved so that we
can continue our inspection and monitoring
role.</div><a name="08110661000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second area of major concern is the one that Lisa has just explained,
which is the mechanism for securing compliance with a reasonable
request from us when we are undertaking an investigation. The mechanism
in the Bill is essentially that if somebody refuses to answer our
questions, we apply to a magistrate to go with a constable and see if
we can find the answers for ourselves. That is one approach, but there
are others. Lisa mentioned the approach in the United States, which
would be to ask the courts to order someone to answer the question,
provided that the courts were satisfied that the request was
reasonable. Either of those would be fine from our point of
view.</div><a name="08110661000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
105</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000225"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> A number of people are asking whether the
proposed powers will be justified. Do you think that they are justified
in terms of the number of people on whom they are likely to be used?
Also, how will the commission be held to account for the decisions that
it takes with the new
powers?</div><a name="08110661000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Lisa
Klein:</b></i> With respect to the first question, I do think
that they are warranted. If you are to create a credible regulatory
regime, you need to have the power to require information in instances
when the need arises. I should step back for a moment and say that our
philosophy, and my approach, is that in the first instance we want to
provide really good advice and guidance so that we do not get into the
situation of having to investigate potential breaches. Shy of that, if
we do have something that we have to investigate, we should do so in a
voluntary way to the extent that that is possible. Shy of that, we
should have resort to notices of more formal nature, and there should
be a mechanism in the regime for seeking enforcement of them. The UK
system is very good generally, and we want the system to be able to
apply in all instances. That was the first question. And the
second&#151;</div><a name="08110661000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Wardle:</b></i> The second was about how we would be held to
account for our use of the
powers.</div><a name="08110661000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Lisa
Klein:</b></i> There are a couple of mechanisms. Within the
legalistic framework, we would always be subject to judicial review if,
in the exercise of that power, it was felt that we had stepped beyond
the
mark.</div><a name="08110661000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
106</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000226"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Right, and through parliamentary scrutiny? Could
you explain to the Committee how that works?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column44" />Column number: 44</div><a name="08110661000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Wardle:</b></i> The Bill provides in general terms, although
principally in relation to the provisions on civil sanctions elsewhere,
that we should consult on and publish guidance on our entire
enforcement policy for those whom we regulate. That is the first point.
We would certainly intend to make that guidance as full and as clear as
possible, because this is a change of the
regime.</div><a name="08110661000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
would certainly consult the political parties and interested people in
Parliament. For example, I would be very surprised if the Select
Committee on Justice were not to take an interest in that approach.
Before we can begin to use any of the civil sanctions&#151;I am
talking about the civil sanctions aspect of the Bill&#151;there has
to be an order in Parliament in relation to each category of those
sanctions. So at each stage, before we can start to use any of the new
sanctions, there has to be parliamentary scrutiny. I am sure that
Parliament would want to examine the extent to which our consultation
on the guidance on our approach had been welcomed or opposed by the
people whom we had consulted.</div>
<a name="08110661000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The main
check on our use of our investigation powers is through the judicial
system rather than the parliamentary system, because we are acting as a
regulator. I think that that is the appropriate approach. The judge has
to be satisfied if we apply for enforcement of our investigations, and
people can always appeal through the judicial review process if they
think that we are behaving
wrongly.</div><a name="08110661000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110661000227"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Mr. Djanogly will have one further
question, then I will call any other member of the Committee who wishes
to ask a question on investigation powers, so that we can deal with
this tidily. Then I shall move on to David Howarth, who wants to ask
questions on
triggering.</div><a name="08110661000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
107</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000228"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Thank you, Sir Nicholas. If I can stick to
parliamentary scrutiny for my final question, are you saying that you
think you should be more responsible to the MOJ on this matter rather
than the Speaker&#146;s Committee? There will be concern among
Members of Parliament that these new powers, which are extensive, will
be adequately reviewed by Parliament on an ongoing basis. When you have
made a decision that hon. Members want to question, how do you see that
going through the
system?</div><a name="08110661000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Wardle:</b></i> I am absolutely not saying that the
commission should be responsible to the Ministry of Justice. There is a
good case for the Justice Committee being interested in the work of the
commission, as it is already. We have appeared before and given
evidence to the Justice Committee on a number of occasions in the
past.</div><a name="08110661000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
commission is, as you say, accountable in Parliament to the
Speaker&#146;s Committee. That important principle needs to be
adhered to carefully in anything to do with the commission. Parliament
deliberately set up the commission not to be responsible to the
Government, but to Parliament, through the innovation of the
Speaker&#146;s Committee. I think the Speaker&#146;s Committee,
over the four years in which I have had dealings with it, has
increasingly seen its role as exercising scrutiny of the commission. I
welcome that. It is important for the commission&#146;s reputation,
as well as for Parliament&#146;s, that there is seen to be proper and
close parliamentary scrutiny of the commission&#146;s work.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 45</div><a name="08110661000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would have
no difficulty explaining our approach to the use of investigation
powers&#151;indeed, our whole enforcement policy&#151;to any
Committee of the House of Commons, including, certainly, the Justice
Committee or the Speaker&#146;s Committee. I should say that, in
general, the Justice Committee has taken the lead on the policy issues
relating to the commission&#146;s work and the Speaker&#146;s
Committee has done so in relation to the commission&#146;s broad
priorities and resourcing; it would be more likely to be the Justice
Committee.</div><a name="08110661000039"></a>

108</b><a name="08110661000229"></a><b class="B">Tony
Lloyd</b> (Manchester, Central) (Lab): I will want to return
more generally to themes in clauses 8 and 9 and sources of donations at
a more appropriate stage, Sir
Nicholas.</div><a name="08110661000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Specifically
in the context of investigation, may we have some comments on the
Electoral Commission&#146;s own views in the paper that it sent to
us? Paragraph 20 discusses the changes in the audit process with
respect to donors and unincorporated associations. In this regard,
specifically, the commission argues that these changes will not add
materially to transparency. Have there been instances where the lack of
investigation powers has prevented the removal of the veil of the
unincorporated association or discussion of the vexed question of
foreign donors? Are investigation powers enough now? Will the new
powers make this a more straightforward
process?</div><a name="08110661000041"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Lisa
Klein:</b></i> Without the new donation transparency
requirements as set forth in the Bill, in the context of an
investigation under the current set up, we do not have the authority to
require documents or to obtain information from individuals. So in the
context of foreign donations, in the abstract, if we were to
investigate that type of matter we would be doing so at the discretion
of the voluntary co-operation of the donor in providing the
information. Under the new Bill, it would go further than that. If we
had a reasonable suspicion that there was a failure to comply with the
law, in terms of the ban on foreign donations, we would be entitled to
pursue that through a formal notice and to ask those questions of the
donor.</div><a name="08110661000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
109</b><a name="08110661000230"></a><b class="B">Martin
Linton</b> (Battersea) (Lab): I want to ask about the
provisions, both in the existing Bill and the new Bill, to deal with
unintended errors. Obviously, the main part of your work is searching
out intended deceit and corruption, which is important, but equally it
is important to know how the commission deals with honest mistakes,
when it comes across them. As I understand it, section 167 of the
Representation of the People Act 1983 allows people to seek relief if
they make an honest mistake. Should there not be a similar provision in
your investigative powers? If you come across a case where you do not
believe that there was any intention to deceive or to fail to comply,
but nevertheless a mistake was made, will you have sufficient latitude
under the Bill to say that because there was no intention to deceive,
you do not need to
proceed?</div><a name="08110661000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Lisa
Klein:</b></i> It is difficult to answer that in the abstract
because different offences require different levels of intent, and some
do and some do not. However, the Bill is helpful not so much in respect
of investigative powers but in determining an outcome within loose
groups of sanctions. It is precisely because of the large number of
inadvertent or negligent errors that it would be better and more
appropriate to address them through the suite 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 46</div>of sanctions that are available in the Bill. The goal would be to ensure
that political parties&#146; systems are robust enough to meet their
obligations and to address the minor administrative errors that
occur.</div><a name="08110661000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
110</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000231"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> You are saying that a sanction is necessarily
appropriate if there is an unintended error. Surely, for many
unintended errors, you would not want a
sanction.</div><a name="08110661000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Lisa
Klein:</b></i> Obviously, that is true, but a sanction may be
a compliance order or an undertaking to revisit some of the systems. I
am using &#147;sanction&#148; in terms of our ability to suggest
that some corrective action could be taken to prevent a recurrence of
an administrative
order.</div><a name="08110661000046"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
112</b><a name="08110661000234"></a><b class="B">David
Howarth</b> (Cambridge) (LD): Thank you, Sir Nicholas. Clause
10 proposes to bring back the system of triggering so that instead of
there being a clear date for when election expenses start, there will
be different dates for different people depending on whether they
behave like candidates. I believe that you said in September that it is
important in this area for lines to be drawn clearly in legislation,
otherwise there will be great scope for confusion and avoidance. The
last time we had this type of rule, many people said that it was
unenforceable because it was so
unclear.</div><a name="08110661000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
is your view of the present state of the Bill? How clear is it, and to
what extent will you have to give supplementary guidance, as you are
invited to do in the Bill, before the measure can effectively be put
into
operation?</div><a name="08110661000051"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Wardle:</b></i> Before I say anything else, it is well known
that the commission has taken the view that the current trigger point
is undesirably close to the date of a general election. We put forward
a proposal to extend the period to four months before the general
election, acknowledging that that was not a perfect solution. The
matter was debated extensively when the Electoral Administration Bill
was under consideration in 2005 and 2006, and, for understandable
reasons, Parliament concluded that there may well be a better way of
addressing the general concern about the very short period for
candidate expenses to be regulated in the run-up to a general
election.</div><a name="08110661000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposal in the Bill, as one of the witnesses who will appear later
today characterised it, moves from a single trigger point to 650
trigger points, multiplied by how ever many candidates appear. Clearly,
from the point of view of regulators, candidates and agents, that does
not fill us with joy, in terms of our ability to be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 47</div>very clear about the precise circumstances that will apply in each case
and also our ability to follow up any potential
infringements.</div><a name="08110661000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
passing, I should say that, of course, it is not just the Electoral
Commission that gets involved in these offences, because they are
Representation of the People Act 1983 offences and not offences under
the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. Local police
might also take a view on whether or not the law has been
broken.</div>
<a name="08110661000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, in
general terms, when we looked at this issue previously it was for that
reason that we suggested a single trigger point, but we also suggested
that one further away from the date of the election would be preferable
all round, because it would be clear.</div>
<a name="08110661000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, we
have made it very clear that it is for Parliament to determine the
right way forward on this matter. As a good regulator, we will always
seek to provide as much guidance and clarity as we can about what must
be done to comply with the rules, as set out in clause 1, and what, if
anything, we would like to see in terms of best practice beyond basic
compliance with the rules.</div>
<a name="08110661000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will do
our best to produce guidance that is helpful. I am sure that we will
have to update that guidance on a fairly regular basis, to take account
of new issues that are put to us or new developments that emerge. It
will be available to candidates, agents and others to help them to
interpret the
rules.</div><a name="08110661000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the Secretary of State said when he appeared before the Committee on
Tuesday, there is some history and some case law in this area, although
not all of it is directly relevant because things have changed since
the regime that was previously in place.</div>
<a name="08110661000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should also
say that, of course, Electoral Commission guidance will not overrule a
decision of the courts. There are very few judgments in this area and
people will not be able to rely conclusively on our guidance at any
stage. Ultimately, it can all be tested in the courts.</div>
<a name="08110661000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">For that
reason, we have made the comment consistently since the Bill was
published that the clearer that Parliament is about what it intends to
achieve with the Bill, the easier it will be to provide the guidance
and the easier it will be to comply with the rules. A number of
questions have been raised in this Committee and elsewhere on
particular situations and how the rules would apply to them. Those
situations are very good examples of the sort of things that we would
want to address in guidance. However, I could not sit here today and
say that I am confident that we will be able to produce an absolutely
clear answer in 100 per cent. of those situations. We will certainly do
our best.</div>
<a name="08110661000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
113</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000235"></a>David
Howarth:</b> On the assumption that the Bill stays as it is,
how long do you think that it will take to produce the best guidance
that you can produce in the circumstances, after the Bill becomes
law?</div>
<a name="08110661000061"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Wardle:</b></i> There are lots of questions about the Bill at
the moment. We are already beginning to try to work out what our
guidance would look like and we would hope to have that guidance in the
public domain by January. I do not think that it is possible to get
anything useful and in detail in the public domain before then. I have
said to Members of the House elsewhere, when I was asked this question
before, that I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 48</div>would certainly hope that we would be able to finalise the guidance as
soon as possible after Parliament has finished its consideration of the
Bill, and that, subject to the number of last-minute changes, the
responses that we receive to consultation and so on, we would certainly
aim to finalise the guidance and make it available to people in a
definitive form, as far as we are concerned, as soon as possible. We
definitely welcome the indications that the Secretary of State gave to
the Committee on Tuesday that he was considering trying to align the
date on which the new provisions bit with our ability to get properly
consulted guidance into circulation.</div>
<a name="08110661000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
114</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000236"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The Secretary of State said that one of the
reasons why the situation was clearer now was that the law had changed
on what counted as an expense. Does that help you to issue the guidance
or does it make it more difficult because, in a way, it wipes out the
previous case law?</div>
<a name="08110661000063"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Lisa
Klein:</b></i> I would tend to agree that the earlier case
law becomes more questionable, and therefore some of the guidelines
become less reliable.</div>
<a name="08110661000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
115</b><a name="08110661000237"></a><b class="B">Mrs.
Eleanor Laing</b> (Epping Forest) (Con): Continuing on the
same subject, on Tuesday, the Secretary of State seemed to agree with
the Committee that unclear law is bad law. He appeared to suggest that
the relevant part of the Bill would not come into effect until after
the Electoral Commission had produced its guidelines. That puts an
enormous onus on your organisation. Given the current lack of clarity
in the Bill, do you have specific recommendations for improving the
drafting, so as to make your task of producing clear guidelines more
possible?</div>
<a name="08110661000065"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Wardle:</b></i> In the written memorandum that we submitted
to the Committee, paragraph 25 gives a couple of specific examples of
things that would help candidates and the regulator if they were
written more clearly into the Bill. Those issues have already been
discussed. The current provision is very general.</div>
<a name="08110661000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">We mentioned
two issues. One was the question of a candidate who is already selected
at the time that the provisions kick in. The Secretary of State made it
clear that the intention of the Bill was not to count back. However,
there are other questions about a candidate who might have stockpiled
election literature which they then bring into use after the triggering
point. In such cases, we would need to look at how much of the cost of
producing that literature is picked up when it is deployed, as opposed
to the cost of producing new literature.</div>
<a name="08110661000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is also
a question about the general promotion of an individual candidate.
Every Member of the House who commented, leapt upon the point that in
the previous situation, people found ways of talking about themselves
without mentioning their names. That is a tricky problem that guidance
might not resolve.</div>
<a name="08110661000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
116</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000238"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> Thank you for that. We are also concerned about the
retrospective nature of the Bill. Last Tuesday, the Secretary of State
clearly told the Committee that it was not his intention for the Bill
to be retrospective, and he agreed in principle with the point that
retrospective law is bad law. As the Bill stands, do you think it
likely that there will be a retrospective effect 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 49</div>if it goes through? It might not be the intention of the Secretary of
State, but will it be a fact arising from the
Bill?</div>
<a name="08110661000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110661000239"></a>The
Chairman:</b> This is interpretation, Mr.
Wardle.</div>
<a name="08110661000070"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Wardle:</b></i> I will choose my words as carefully as
possible. Given the concerns about the impact of the provisions on
candidates who have already identified themselves as such before the
date on which the new provisions commence, it might be helpful for
Parliament to put beyond doubt the question of how those situations
will be affected by the
Bill.</div>
<a name="08110661000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
117</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000240"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> Thank you. That is very helpful. If we take that a
step further and consider the Bill&#146;s possible retrospective
effect&#151;whether intentional or not&#151;I am also concerned
about its disproportionate effect. If our democratic process is to be
respected, it must be seen to be fair. It would also appear that, if
the Bill in its current form becomes an Act of Parliament, candidates
will be disadvantaged by comparison with sitting Members of Parliament.
Is it possible that a situation could arise whereby a candidate could
be deemed, at the point of triggering, to have already spent to the
extent allowed for election expenses, and would therefore not be able
to campaign at all during the election
period?</div><a name="08110661000072"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Wardle:</b></i> The answer to that question depends very much
on the answer to your previous question. One interpretation of the Bill
clearly says that the spending of the candidate who declared before the
proposals in the Bill take effect would be caught. I do not think that
that is the Secretary of State&#146;s interpretation. My
understanding was that he was seeking to say that, effectively, the
clock starts in such cases when the Bill comes into effect. However,
given the lack of clarity, as I said before, that seems to be an area
where it would probably be helpful if Parliament were able to put
beyond doubt the answer to that
question.</div><a name="08110661000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110661000241"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> That is very helpful. Thank you very
much.</div><a name="08110661000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
118</b><a name="08110661000242"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Alan Reid</b> (Argyll and Bute) (LD): To pursue the last
question, the Bill talks of expenses being incurred. What is your
definition of &#147;incurred&#148;? For example, what if a
candidate contracted with a printer for, say, four leaflet runs for the
whole constituency and paid before Royal Assent? If the money was
handed over before Royal Assent, would that be a loophole in the
present wording of the
Bill?</div><a name="08110661000075"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Wardle:</b></i> That is one of the areas in which we have
said that there needs to be more clarity. Certainly, if you look at our
guidance on the existing rules on candidate expenditure&#151;if it
would be helpful, I could make available to the Committee the relevant
extracts&#151;the question of accrual versus cash accounting is
relevant.</div><a name="08110661000076"></a>

119</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000243"></a>Mr.
Reid:</b> Existing legislation allows you to recommend
increases in the expenses limit. If the Bill is passed, so that
expenses limits cover a much longer period, would you recommend an
increase in the expenses limit? If so, have you given any thought to
what that would be?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 50</div><a name="08110661000077"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Wardle:</b></i> We would certainly recommend an increase in
the expenses limit, in principle. When we recommended that serious
consideration should be given to a four-month period, we made such a
recommendation. I am afraid that I cannot remember whether we gave a
precise figure, but we certainly said, broadly speaking, that, if
quadrupling the period, it would be foolish to stay with the existing
limit. We would have to acknowledge that this was over a longer period.
May I just add to that? It is slightly more difficult to come up with a
number if you are talking about an indeterminate period. The beauty of
the four-month period was that it was
clear.</div><a name="08110661000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
120</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000244"></a>Mr.
Reid:</b> Finally, in paragraph 25 you raised the problem of
transport, and how that could be apportioned for election expenses. To
give you an example from my own constituency, as a sitting MP, I fly
out to one of the islands to hold a surgery and, while I am there,
distribute some leaflets about voting for me at the next general
election. The literature itself is clearly election expenses, but how
do you apportion the travelling expenses? If my main purpose for going
was to hold a surgery but, in addition, while I am there, I incur
election expenses, how do you apportion the
travel?</div><a name="08110661000079"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Wardle:</b></i> That is a good question. It is not a question
particularly triggered by the Bill&#146;s proposals&#151;the
question arises already, if in the regulated
period.</div><a name="08110661000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110661000245"></a>Mr.

Wardle:</b></i> Yes. We have guidance. It is not easy, and we
have attempted to address that question in our existing guidance. I am
afraid that I do not have that, chapter and verse, but we can follow
that up in a note to the
Committee.</div><a name="08110661000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110661000246"></a>Mr.

subject, and I want to help the Committee. We have three other
important areas to cover: the composition of the commission, donations,
and registration. Will hon. Members who wish to ask a brief question
under this heading of triggering do so
quickly?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
121</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000248"></a>Tony
Lloyd:</b> This relates back to ambiguity about the timing of
the impact of candidacy. I have been surprised by Peter Wardle&#146;s
remarks so far, because clause 10(5) on page 9
states:</div><a name="08110661000191"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
amendments made by this section do not apply to any expenses incurred
before the commencement of this

there really any ambiguity in
that?</div><a name="08110661000086"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Wardle:</b></i> As Sir Nicholas noted, I was being invited to
give an interpretation of the law. I carefully sought to avoid doing
that. What I said was that there is more than one interpretation. I
heard what the Secretary of State said, and it seemed clear to me, but
some people are unpersuaded and there are one or two issues. The one
that Mr. Reid raised about contracts entered into but not
discharged&#151;the standard period&#151;may be one on which it
would be helpful to have the position clarified. It is a transition
issue, and when something is introduced you sometimes need transitional
measures, perhaps simply to put something beyond doubt rather than to
change something in the original Bill.</div>

commission&#146;s composition? I call, first, David
Howarth.</div><a name="08110661000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
123</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000253"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The commission has expressed concern about the
proposal to add to the commissioners some who would be exempt from the
normal rule that people involved in politics recently cannot be
commissioners. I think there has been some change of emphasis or change
in the way that the commission expresses its objections, so will you
put on the record your present thoughts on that
proposal?</div><a name="08110661000093"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Wardle:</b></i> The first point is that the commission
understands and endorses the underlying aim of the proposals. Its work
should be informed by a clear and current understanding of how
political parties work. There can be no question about that. We very
much welcome in principle the ability to employ staff with more recent
involvement in party politics than the current 10-year ban allows,
although we think the blanket relaxation to one year, except for the
chief executive&#146;s post, may go too far. For example, I am not
sure that all political parties would welcome the appointment as
director of investigations someone who, 18 months previously, was
closely identified with one political party or another. However, if
that is understood, the commission can make its own sensible decisions
on when it takes advantage of the relaxation on staff and when it does
not.</div><a name="08110661000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
concern about the proposals for the commissioners is where the
proposals in the Bill have departed from the principles set out by the
Committee on Standards in Public Life in its report on the commission.
First, there have been frequent references to the fact that new
commissioners nominated by party leaders will always be in a minority.
In that context, neither the CSPL nor anyone else recommended, before
the Bill was introduced, that there should be a reduction in the
current 10-year ban for the other commissioners who are not party
nominees, yet clause 7 reduces the length of that ban from 10 years to
five. In principle, that means that, of 10 commissioners,
you could have four who were MPs a year ago and six who were MPs five
years ago. That seems to be a significant departure from the principle
of introducing political experience to the commission that the CSPL set
out, and it gives me some concerns about the extent to which the
balance between independent commissioners and political nominees will
be
maintained.</div><a name="08110661000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure that people will say that I have painted an extreme scenario,
that that would never happen, but it seems that that is the effect of
the Bill. I have not yet understood the rationale for the reduction
from 10 years 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 52</div>to five years for the non-politically nominated commissioners, alongside
the introduction of party nominees. That is my first
point.</div><a name="08110661000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second concern is that the CSPL clearly said that the process for
appointing commissioners with recent political experience should
somehow reflect the provisions of the code of practice for public
appointments. It is difficult to see how the process set out in the
Bill does that. The point to note is that, up till now, the
Speaker&#146;s Committee has consistently taken the view and insisted
that the process for appointing electoral commissioners should be
clearly in line with the code of practice for public appointments. I
suppose that I am making a plea on behalf of the Speaker&#146;s
Committee, which gets the job of implementing this, for Parliament to
be as clear as possible about expectations for the appointment process
so that there is no confusion, and so that people do not try to invent
a process that is different from what Parliament
wanted.</div><a name="08110661000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly,
a more technical point: it seems that there is no provision in the Bill
to deal with the possibility that one party or another might fail to
nominate. That does happen from time to time when parties have the
right to nominate to organisations. If that were the case, there is a
risk that the Speaker&#146;s Committee could find itself in quite a
dilemma, because, without a nomination from a party, or from more than
one party in some cases, it cannot get on with the next stage of the
process. That is a procedural point, but it would be good to consider
it.</div><a name="08110661000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
are my main concerns. It is important that Parliament thinks about them
rather than simply sending the measure through on the nod, because your
colleagues on the Speaker&#146;s Committee will be given the job of
implementing
it.</div><a name="08110661000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
124</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000254"></a>David
Howarth:</b> On the first concern, which is the reduction from
10 to five years for the non-political commissioners, the response that
has been put to me is that since those appointments will still be Nolan
appointments&#151;we are talking about the code of practice for
public appointments&#151;the situation is not as dangerous or as
risky as you are saying. That will be taken into account in the
appointment procedure, and it will not involve the new rather awkward
process that you described for the appointment of political
commissioners through the Speaker&#146;s Committee. How do you
respond to
that?</div><a name="08110661000100"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Wardle:</b></i> Yes, provided all of that happens, but there
is nothing in the Bill to ensure that it does. As I understand it, the
decision to follow the Nolan process is a decision that the
Speaker&#146;s Committee has consistently insisted on, and that is
absolutely right, but I am not sure that the Bill mandates that for the
other appointments. What it does is reduce the disqualification that
currently applies on the basis of party political involvement from 10
years to five

125</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000255"></a>Tony
Lloyd:</b> I would like to turn specifically to clauses 8 and
9, which deal with the source of donation. For the record, may I ask a
simple question? Does the commission consider that it has a primary
duty to encourage and insist on transparency of the ultimate
donor?</div><a name="08110661000102"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Wardle:</b></i>
Yes.</div><a name="08110661000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110661000256"></a>The
Chairman:</b><b class="B"> </b>By the way, we have moved on to
donations.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 53</div><a name="08110661000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110661000257"></a>Tony
Lloyd:</b> Yes, I did say that, Sir
Nicholas.</div><a name="08110661000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110661000258"></a>The
Chairman:</b><b class="B"> </b>But I was under the impression that you
wanted to come in under composition of the commission. So, for the
information of members of the Committee, we are on
donations.</div><a name="08110661000106"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Wardle:</b></i> If I may just add to my answer, yes, so far
as the law requires it. We cannot insist on transparency or disclosure
of identity beyond what the law requires. That is
self-evident.</div><a name="08110661000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
126</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000259"></a>Tony
Lloyd:</b> Indeed. The commission in its paper to the
Committee
states:</div><a name="08110661000192"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
welcome the Government&#146;s decision to look beyond unincorporated
associations&#148;,</div><a name="08110661000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">but
you go on to say
that</div><a name="08110661000193"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
benefits of these proposals may be quite limited, since the law already
prohibits concealing the source of a donation by channelling the money
through
others.&#148;</div><a name="08110661000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">You
then say that they are effectively restricted because</div>
<a name="08110661000194"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the new
declarations which donors are to be obliged to provide to donees will
not be sent to the Commission or made
public&#148;.</div><a name="08110661000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
unincorporated associations, such as dinner clubs, it is difficult or
impossible for the commission to bring transparency forward. You are
saying that, as drafted, the Bill does not do enough to allow you take
away the veil that restricts public knowledge of the ultimate donor.
What powers do you seek that would allow you to strip away the veil
provided by incorporation or the dinner club
structure?</div><a name="08110661000111"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Wardle:</b></i> It is not a question of the
commission&#146;s powers, but of changing the framework that we
regulate. Currently, whatever my powers, I can only require and
investigate allegations of non-compliance with the law as it stands. As
everyone knows, the purpose of clause 8 is to underline what the law
currently requires and ensure that, in the transaction between donor
and recipient, that point is specifically addressed, but it is only the
point that is currently in the law. If Parliament wanted to go beyond
it and change the law, we would be getting into the much bigger area of
how wide the net of transparency is cast, and that goes back to the
debates that the House had on Second Reading and in some of the
evidence sessions involving the Secretary of State on Tuesday about the
extent to which Parliament wants to change the underlying framework
that we regulate. Whatever powers we have will make no difference if
the underlying law stays the same.</div>
<a name="08110661000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
127</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000260"></a>Tony
Lloyd:</b> But there is a question of power. At the moment, if
an agent operates on behalf of a unincorporated association, he has a
duty under the law to say that the donations comply with the law. There
is no ambiguity in the law about that. You are saying that we need to
change the nature of the total structure to require an agent to
declare, for example, that the donations are legitimate and within the
law, such as that the donors are UK nationals and comply with the
donation limits. What would you need to pursue that
matter?</div><a name="08110661000113"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Lisa
Klein:</b></i> Currently, with unincorporated associations,
the law of agency applies if the donor is a friend of party x and is
saying to the unincorporated association, &#147;Please give this
donation to party x or to candidate y.&#148; It is set out in
legislation that the agent is required to disclose to the recipient
party or candidate the identity 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 54</div>and details of the source of the donation. That is then reported by the
party in reports and returns filed to the Electoral
Commission.</div><a name="08110661000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
under the law of agency as set out in the Bill, there is a spectrum
and, at the other end of the spectrum, a lot of broad discretion might
rest within the unincorporated association for deciding to whom the
donation is made and the amount of the donation. In that case, under
those basic principles, there would not be an obligation because the
unincorporated association is making the decision about the disposition
of the funds. We could envision a framework that changed that to the
extent that it required greater transparency of funds received by the
unincorporated association, but that is not how the law is set up under
the
Bill.</div><a name="08110661000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
128</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000261"></a>Tony
Lloyd:</b> Specifically, would the Electoral Commission seek
that change in the law to strip away the scale of
unincorporation?</div><a name="08110661000116"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Wardle:</b></i> The commission has not expressed a view that
the law should change. That is because, until very recently, all those
issues were effectively up for grabs, in the context of the inter-party
talks on party funding. Frankly, we did not think that the commission
would necessarily be listened to terribly hard, although we were
consulted by Sir Hayden Phillips to see whether we would pick out
particular
issues.</div><a name="08110661000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
the extent that a wider solution has not emerged from those talks,
clearly there is a range of areas&#151;you have mentioned a couple of
them&#151;where there is a case for changing the rules. However, I
acknowledge that this is a difficult issue, about which the Secretary
of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor, as well as the Front-Bench
spokesmen of the other parties, have all expressed a wish in principle
to proceed by
consensus.</div><a name="08110661000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the particular issue of the unincorporated associations, as Lisa Klein
has explained, the difficult element is where there is a grey area
about who took the decision on where the money would go. There have
been suggestions mooted that there should be some concept of where the
controlling mind of the unincorporated association is, which takes the
decision on where the money goes. In principle, that would lead to
greater transparency in the area that you are talking about, but it is
not without its
pitfalls.</div><a name="08110661000119"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
129</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000262"></a>Tony
Lloyd:</b> But to be clear, what you are saying at the moment
is that an unincorporated association could have the doubtless
unintended consequence of totally disguising the fact that the ultimate
source of a donation was one that would not be permitted if that donor
gave the money directly to a political party.</div>
<a name="08110661000120"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Lisa
Klein:</b></i> I am sorry; I did not fully hear the
question.</div>
<a name="08110661000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
130</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000263"></a>Tony
Lloyd:</b> I am saying that the consequence of the way that
the law would stand even if the Bill was passed would be that an
unincorporated association could be a channel so that money could go to
a political party, which, if given directly by the ultimate donor,
would not be permissible under our laws.</div>
<a name="08110661000122"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Lisa
Klein:</b></i> I do not fully subscribe to that
view.</div><a name="08110661000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
131</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000264"></a>Tony
Lloyd:</b> How could that not be the case?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 55</div><a name="08110661000124"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Lisa
Klein:</b></i> If the unincorporated association was used as
a device with an intent to channel money that would otherwise be
impermissible, it would be in violation of section 61 of the Act. The
Bill does some very significant things in terms of improving our
ability to investigate such a violation; in fact, such a violation
would be subject to the extended investigative powers in the
Bill.</div>
<a name="08110661000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
132</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000265"></a>Tony
Lloyd:</b> I have a final question, which is almost about the
area that Lisa Klein has just taken us into. You said in an earlier
answer that the investigative powers that you have are not adequate. On
the problem of the unincorporated association and the question of the
foreign donor&#151;for example, whether the foreign donor is
registered in the UK for tax purposes or for elections, which of course
would mean that they were a permissible donor&#151;will you have
enough powers after the Bill has been passed properly to investigate
allegations of impropriety in both those
cases?</div><a name="08110661000126"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Lisa
Klein:</b></i> The short answer is yes. The slightly longer
answer is yes, but we will have to work within the untested framework
of the definition of &#147;carrying on business etc.&#148;, which
is incorporated in the current
law.</div><a name="08110661000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110661000266"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We have approximately 20 minutes left. On the
issue of donations, three other Members have caught my eye and want to
ask questions: Andrew Tyrie, whom I will call first; Martin Linton; and
Mr. Djanogly.</div>
<a name="08110661000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
133</b><a name="08110661000267"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Tyrie</b> (Chichester) (Con): I think that, perhaps
inadvertently, a large part of what I wanted to ask has already been
answered in your response to questions from Tony Lloyd. We are at one
in wanting to ensure that these intermediaries are not permissible and
cannot be used. The question is, what framework of law is most
appropriate for dealing with
them?</div><a name="08110661000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like you to summarise your views. What you are saying is that the
proposals will not extend the existing legal restrictions and will not
add materially to transparency, but they will impose an extra large
compliance burden. Is that correct?</div>
<a name="08110661000130"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Wardle:</b></i> Yes, I think that summarises what we have
said in the written memorandum, which is our view on the
clause.</div>
<a name="08110661000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
134</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000268"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> Therefore, is the clause worth the
candle?</div>
<a name="08110661000132"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Wardle:</b></i> That is a decision for Parliament. We are
more concerned about its impact on political parties than on the
Electoral Commission. Most activity that the clause will require
involves a transaction between parties and their donors. I am aware
that all three political parties have raised concerns about the burden
of complying with the clause as
drafted.</div><a name="08110661000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
135</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000269"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> But it sounds like you would not dissent from the
summary that, in a nutshell, the clause is at best a waste of
time.</div>
<a name="08110661000134"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Wardle:</b></i> Those are your words. Our words are in the
written memorandum to the Committee.</div>
<a name="08110661000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
136</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000270"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> While I have the floor, may I quickly ask you for a
piece of information about an issue mentioned earlier, which I have
been thinking about? Perhaps you will send it to us in writing. You
said that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 56</div>the triggering rules will generate a huge extra administrative burden by
creating 646 bodies that will need to be monitored, as opposed to one.
Can you give the Committee an estimate of the administrative burden
generated by the existing law and let us know, in cost terms, what that
will rise to as a consequence of the implementation of the
proposals?</div>
<a name="08110661000136"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Wardle:</b></i> I will be happy to attempt something like
that with the caveat that we look directly only at the impact on the
Electoral Commission. As I said earlier, the other factor to consider
is the extent of the impact on candidates and
agents.</div>
<a name="08110661000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110661000271"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> Sir Nicholas, I have questions on individual
registration, but perhaps we shall come to that
later.</div><a name="08110661000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110661000272"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Mr. Wardle, if you feel that you
would like to answer Mr. Tyrie&#146;s questions with a
written submission that perhaps gives rather more information than you
have been able to provide off the cuff, the Committee would be pleased
to receive
it.</div><a name="08110661000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
now move from Mr. Tyrie to Mr. Linton. We want to
get registration in, so I hope that the questions from you,
Mr. Linton, and from Mr. Djanogly will be
relatively
succinct.</div><a name="08110661000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
137</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000273"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> I want to understand exactly how clause 8 will
work and I am not quite there yet. In principle, the purpose of the
Bill is that the identity of donors who give over &#163;200 should be
disclosed. In some cases, unincorporated associations have been used as
a device to transfer money without disclosing the name of individual
donors. Is that
accepted?</div><a name="08110661000141"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Lisa
Klein:</b></i> Donations of over &#163;200 have to be
confirmed and verified, and a donor identified so as to ensure that
they are a permissible donor, by the party. Then that first part of
your statement would be more accurate. In other words, they are not
published. A party has the obligation to ensure that any donations over
&#163;200 come from permissible donors, and therefore they have to
verify the source of the
donation.</div><a name="08110661000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
138</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000274"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> The identities and names of donors must be
disclosed&#151;</div><a name="08110661000143"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Lisa
Klein:</b></i> Yes, the figure is over &#163;5,000 for
political parties.</div>
<a name="08110661000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
139</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000275"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> Nevertheless, with some unincorporated
associations giving well over &#163;1 million, it is likely that
there are donors of over &#163;5,000 who use such associations to
channel their
donations.</div><a name="08110661000145"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Lisa
Klein:</b></i> That is possible. If presented with a factual
scenario in evidence of that, or that something had been circumvented,
or that the proper information had not been given, or that the donation
was working as an agency donation, that is something we should
look
at.</div><a name="08110661000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
140</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000276"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> But the amendment that clause 8 will
make is simply that the secretary or chairman of that unincorporated
association will have to write a declaration with the names of donors
of over &#163;200 and give it to the donee. Is that
right?</div><a name="08110661000147"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Lisa
Klein:</b></i> My understanding of the operation of the
provision is that for any donation of over &#163;200, the donor will
be requested by the recipient to fill out a declaration form that
states the identity of the source of the funds. That will then be sent
back to the political 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 57</div>party, and it will be a requirement in order for it to accept that
donation.</div><a name="08110661000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
141</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000277"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> And that declaration will then be sent to
you?</div><a name="08110661000149"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Lisa
Klein:</b></i> No, it will be retained by the political
party, but we could obtain it upon
request.</div><a name="08110661000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
142</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000278"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> Would you do
so?</div><a name="08110661000151"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Lisa
Klein:</b></i> Given the number of donations that might be
affected, probably not on a routine basis, but on a for-cause basis,
yes.</div><a name="08110661000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
143</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000279"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> Do you not think it would be better if all
donations of more than &#163;5,000 were disclosed
publicly?</div><a name="08110661000153"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Lisa
Klein:</b></i> I have no problem with that,
no.</div><a name="08110661000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
144</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000280"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> If you receive a declaration from a party showing
that there are many donations of more than &#163;5,000 through
unincorporated associations, which have not been declared publicly,
would you not think it a good thing if you were able to publish the
names?</div><a name="08110661000155"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Lisa
Klein:</b></i> Yes. I would go back to Mark Sweeney&#146;s
evidence to the Committee on Tuesday. The question of agency is
factual. If it determined as fact that donations resulted from agency,
with the donor donating more than &#163;5,000, that should be
disclosed,
yes.</div><a name="08110661000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
145</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000281"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> Even though it is through an unincorporated
association.</div><a name="08110661000157"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Lisa
Klein:</b></i> Under the law, if the unincorporated
association is being used as an agent for the actual donor, the
publication of donors of more than &#163;5,000 would be required,
yes.</div><a name="08110661000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
146</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000282"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> Would it not be simpler if, as we amend the
Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, we wrote that in
for all donations of more than &#163;5,000? You would have it within
your power to publish the names of such donors, but there could be an
amendment so that it was automatic that donors of more than
&#163;5,000, even through unincorporated associations, should be
identified.</div><a name="08110661000159"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Lisa
Klein:</b></i> There certainly could be ways to extend it. I
have left my drafting pen at home, but there are definitely ways that
one could extend it if Parliament chose to do
so.</div><a name="08110661000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
147</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000283"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> On clause 8, I am just having a look at your
October 2008 memorandum. You
state:</div><a name="08110661000195"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;On
the other hand, the changes will impose potentially substantial new
administrative burdens on parties and donors. Political parties have
expressed reservations to us about the impact of these compliance
requirements, particularly on their volunteer
officers.&#148;</div><a name="08110661000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Do
you think that the implication of clause 8 could be to dissuade people
from wanting to be donors because of the administrative and
bureaucratic
implications?</div><a name="08110661000162"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Wardle:</b></i> What we are doing here is bringing to the
Committee&#146;s attention the concerns that have been expressed by
the political parties. I am not sure whether I would want to speak
beyond that for the political 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 58</div>parties. You have an opportunity to ask them yourselves later today. I
am simply reporting to you what they have said to us so far, and I
suspect that they may say it again if they are asked the question this
afternoon.</div><a name="08110661000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
148</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000284"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I was moving beyond what you have heard from
political parties. I was asking whether you have a view on what donors
to political parties might think of the
proposals.</div><a name="08110661000164"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Wardle:</b></i> I do not have a direct view on that, because
I have not surveyed donors. What the political parties have represented
to us reflects conversations that they have had and their views on the
likely reaction of their donors, as well as of the parties themselves.
I would not seek to interpret beyond what we have reported to you,
which is what the political parties have said to
us.</div><a name="08110661000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
149</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000285"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> And what did the political parties say to
you?</div><a name="08110661000166"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Wardle:</b></i> The political parties have said to us what is
in our note, which is that there are general concerns about the impact
of the compliance requirements. The particular issue that they have
raised with us is about their own volunteer officers. We have not had
any detailed evidence from the political parties about their view on
what their donors might or might not think about the
clause.</div><a name="08110661000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
150</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000286"></a>The
Minister of State, Ministry of Justice (Mr. Michael
Wills):</b> I, too, want to dwell on that point, and perhaps
return you to the briefing that you helpfully provided for the
Committee. May I first check that you are aware, of course, that the
Government have indicated that we are willing to be flexible about the
limits? We absolutely accept the need not to overburden volunteers who,
in the overwhelming majority of cases, are engaged in a noble voluntary
activity.</div>
<a name="08110661000168"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Wardle:</b></i> Absolutely. The Secretary of State has made
that clear on a number of occasions, and you, Minister, have also made
that clear to us. The briefing was written at a point of time, and I
acknowledge that things have moved on since then and that they show
signs of moving further in the process of the Bill&#146;s
development.</div>
<a name="08110661000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
151</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000287"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> Thank you. May I direct you to the words in your
briefing? Under the heading &#147;Sources of donations&#148; you
say that you believe the benefits of these changes will be
&#147;quite limited&#148;. That is not to say that they will have
no advantage at all, is
it?</div><a name="08110661000170"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Wardle:</b></i> No, it is not. We would not dissent, being an
organisation that has been set up to encourage transparency, from any
attempt to underline the requirements on transparency, which is what
the clauses are trying to do. What we are saying in the briefing is
that you have to set against that the potential disbenefits. In terms
of what is in the Bill, we are concerned that the potential disbenefits
in practical terms may outweigh the benefits; we are not saying that
the whole idea is completely unworkable, but that it is not desirable
as it currently stands.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
152</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000288"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> So that we are absolutely clear, I think that we
can accept that there is a consensus about the need to strike a balance
between overburdening volunteers and dissuading donors from making
legitimate 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 59</div>donations on the one hand, and ensuring transparency on the other.
However, I think that I have just heard you say, although I would be
grateful if you confirmed it, that there is merit in measures that draw
attention to and focus both donor and recipient on the need to show
that they have complied with the
law.</div><a name="08110661000172"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Wardle:</b></i> Yes, that is right. As you said, we do not
say that there are no benefits to the measure; we say that there are
some benefits. As the Bill is currently drafted, we think that the
disbenefits outweigh the benefits, but it may be possible to change the
balance of the argument so that the benefits of the clause are
achievable without unacceptable detriment to the parties
themselves.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110661000289"></a>The
Chairman:</b> May we move on to
registration?</div><a name="08110661000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
153</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000290"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> I just want to ask you about individual
registration. I am confident that you heard Sir Christopher&#146;s
remarks in our first evidence session, that the introduction
of postal voting on demand, combined with the retention of householder
registration, generates conditions where the electoral system is
&#147;fundamentally flawed&#148;. I would like you to comment on
whether you agree with that conclusion of the chairman of the Committee
on Standards in Public Life. What is your view?</div>
<a name="08110661000175"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Wardle:</b></i> Yes, we agree with the chairman. The
commission has been calling for individual registration in Great
Britain since 2003. Lots of other people&#151;I will not rehearse
them&#151;have agreed with us. The Government made it clear when they
responded to the report by the Committee on Standards in Public
Life that they support the principle of individual
registration, but they are concerned about how that could be introduced
without significant numbers of people falling off the
register.</div><a name="08110661000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">The case for
individual registration is about basic rights and responsibilities for
individual citizens and the fact that it is not right, in the 21st
century, to maintain an electoral system where the head of household
influences who is enfranchised and who is disfranchised. Changing to
individual registration with personal identifiers would also deal with
the current lack of integrity and confidence in the process. We need a
proper system. In our view and in the view of many others, only a
combination of individual registration and a system of personal
identifiers will provide end-to-end security in the electoral system,
because the electoral register is the bedrock of that system.</div>
<a name="08110661000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are legitimate concerns
about the impact on the comprehensiveness of the register if we
introduce individual registration with personal identifiers, but in my
view we can and should address those concerns and should not make them
a reason for continuing to put off the introduction of individual
registration and thereby putting off addressing the accuracy and
integrity of the register. The two things are not mutually exclusive;
they are both problems that need to be addressed. In the
commission&#146;s view&#151;it has been the
commission&#146;s view for some years now&#151;a 21st-century
modern western democracy ought to be able to address both the integrity
and accuracy of the register and its comprehensiveness, but we will
make no progress on either of those things unless we get
started.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 60</div><a name="08110661000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
154</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000291"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> That is a pretty clear answer. Just to make it
crystal clear, do you think that there are at the moment any practical
or technical obstacles to which you do not readily see a solution, and
which might not command general support, that lie in the way of
beginning this process of implementation? How long would that process
take?</div><a name="08110661000179"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Wardle:</b></i> I do not think there are any fundamental
practical or technical obstacles. The biggest problem is the one I
referred to before, about which the Government are understandably and
legitimately concerned, which is that eligible people might, for
various reasons, fail to appear on the new register. There are many
ways of addressing that and we have made it clear what those are.
First, sufficient resources need to be put into a public information
effort. Probably some things might need to be done that were not done
when individual registration was introduced in Northern
Ireland&#151;principally, combining the introduction so that, on
implementation, there is some sort of safeguard so that there is not a
cliff edge for people in the first year of individual registration to
fall off and then that is it; instead, they should be identified as
potentially falling off and followed up, because we need their personal
identifiers before we move
forward.</div><a name="08110661000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second thing is to look seriously at data sharing, so that, for
example, if one part of a local authority knows that a family has moved
in or out of the authority area, the electoral registration officer
should somehow get a trigger to take action on his or her own account
to ensure that the register is up to
date.</div><a name="08110661000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a not insignificant change; the commission has never made any secret
of that. This is a major change that effectively requires all
registered electors to re-register and provide their personal
identifiers afresh. That will make the register more secure and will
give them an individual stake, in every case, in their electoral
registration. There are certain categories of the community who are
going to be harder to reach. We need to make sure that enough effort is
put into finding them. There need to be safeguards so that people do
not fall off overnight. This is not something that can happen
immediately.</div><a name="08110661000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
answer the second part of your question, we think that if there were
movement in the legislation now, the earliest that you could attempt to
build a new register on the basis of individual registration would be
in the 2010 renewal canvas. Almost certainly you would not have a
comprehensive set of personal identifiers from that exercise, and until
you have a comprehensive set of personal identifiers you cannot start
to use those personal identifiers to guarantee, for example, the
security of the voting process in the way that we would like to see. So
we are probably looking at a two to three year gradual process until
the register is complete and has a much greater degree of integrity, in
that there are personal identifiers for each person registered. This is
not an overnight fix. I think we are realistic about the time it will
take. We acknowledge the concerns that the Government and others have
put forward. But our view remains that it is better to get started on
it now than to delay
things.</div><a name="08110661000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110661000292"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Two hon. Members have caught my eye: David
Kidney and David Howarth. If they put a question for a yes or no
answer, I hope that one of our witnesses will be able to
respond.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column61" />Column number: 61</div><a name="08110661000184"></a>

155</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000293"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> Mr. Wardle, can we
achieve a single registration of donations and benefits to Members of
Parliament in place of the current system without changing this
Bill?</div><a name="08110661000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110661000294"></a>The

question.</div><a name="08110661000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
156</b><b class="B"><a name="08110661000295"></a>David
Howarth:</b> To come back to individual registration, you have
answered most of my questions, but on one practical point, you would
agree, would you not, that there are certain practical difficulties in
simply translating the Northern Ireland legislation into Great Britain?
For example, the three-month rule that was brought in for a particular
reason in Northern Ireland would not necessary apply in
Britain.</div><a name="08110661000187"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Peter
Wardle:</b></i> The answer to Mr. Howarth&#146;s
question is, yes, there are problems with simply translating the
Northern Ireland provisions. The answer to Mr.
Kidney&#146;s question is, not quite. Some minor changes are probably

<div class="Column"><a name="Column62" />Column number: 62</div>needed. That matter is currently under discussion between the Ministry
of Justice, the commission and the Standards and Privileges Committee.
But the intention is clearly to ensure that most donations to most
Members of Parliament for most purposes are no longer subject to the
dual reporting problem that we currently
face.</div><a name="08110661000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08110661000296"></a>The
