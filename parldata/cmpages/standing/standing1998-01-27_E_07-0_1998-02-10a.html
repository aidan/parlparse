<H4><center>Clause 8</center></H4>
<H4><center>Regional consultation</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed [this day], That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Yeo (South Suffolk):</B> I would like to return to some of the questions raised by members of the Committee before lunch. A number of those questions have not been answered by the Minister at all.
<P>
First, I would like to turn to the question of stakeholders. The White Paper states that, to be designated as a regional chamber, a body must
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``provide a regional voice which includes all the regional stakeholders.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the light of that statement, it is necessary to repeat the earlier question: who do the Government envisage as stakeholders? The clause gives the Secretary of State total power to decide on the bodies that are to be designated as regional chambers. The Minister must therefore have some idea of what should constitute a stakeholder for the purposes of satisfying the Government's requirements for organisations that want to be designated as regional chambers. Even if the Minister cannot name all the stakeholders, I hope at least that he will name some. I suggest that he does so in relation to the eastern region.
<P>
I am sure that the Minister does not want to fall into the same position as the hon. Member for Wallasey (Angela Eagle) fell into last week. She was not able to name a single person whom she thought the Secretary of State might wish to consult to satisfy the requirements of clause 2(3)(b) and (c) in relation to appointments to RDA boards. It would be reasonable for Parliament to be given some insight, through the workings of this Committee, into the Government's thinking on what should constitute a stakeholder. I hope that the Minister's reluctance to name stakeholders in his earlier reply is not a sign that the Government have not done any thinking on the matter.
<P>
A second straightforward question, which I asked the Minister earlier, concerns the size of a regional chamber. How large should such a chamber be? I assume that the Government have no wish to be prescriptive on this matter, but they must have some parameters in mind. Will the Minister tell us what the lower and upper limits for the size of a chamber might be? If not, perhaps he could give some guidelines. Will he also say what factors or circumstances in a particular region might lead the Secretary of State to prefer a larger regional chamber or, conversely, a smaller one?
<P>
A third equally straightforward question, which was raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) and by Labour Members, concerns the precise intentions the Government have for the representation of groups such as the churches and voluntary sector organisations. Will such groups be considered stakeholders? If so, will they be represented in regional chambers? If they are to be represented, who will represent them?
<P>
A fourth question, which is one that I raised, is that if the question of gender and ethnic balance is important enough to be singled out in the White Paper, what does the Minister regard as the appropriate gender and ethnic balance in a regional chamber? We need guidance on this matter, as there is no other evidence of what the Government have in mind.
<P>
A fifth question concerns the balance referred to in paragraph 11.4 i of the White Paper, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The local authority element of the chamber should reflect regional, local and political balance, and type of authority''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Minister say, this time, whether the local authority element in this context includes parish councils? In some parts of the country, parish councils perform an important role and are highly regarded by the local communities. Will he also say what balance should be established in a chamber in the Eastern region between county councils and district councils?
<P>
I do not ask these questions with any desire to trip the Minister up or to trap him into saying something that he may subsequently regret, but simply in a spirit of inquiry. We have no information about these matters. The White Paper has touched on them--
<P>
<B>Mr. Anthony D. Wright </B>(Great Yarmouth): I am somewhat surprised at the comments about the chambers. My region is also the Eastern region, and the councils and all the organisations seem to be getting on with the job admirably. There was a meeting of the Eastern region officers support group to discuss the details of the chambers--their size, other stakeholders, which they name, and the proportion of local authority to non-local authority membership. I am surprised that the hon. Member for South Suffolk (Mr. Yeo) is asking these questions, when clearly, contrary to what Opposition Members believe, local authority members welcome the initiative to create RDAs and chambers.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I must ask the hon. Gentleman to keep his interventions brief and direct.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wright:</B> I take your guidance on that, Mr. Benton. May I quickly ask the hon. Gentleman what negotiations or discussions he has had with local authorities and officers about this proposal, because he seems to be completely out of touch with those officers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> As it happens, I have recently discussed these matters with both the chief executive and a number of councillors on Suffolk county council.
<P>
The question for the Minister is not what some councillors in East Anglia may or may not think is the appropriate size for a regional chamber, but whether he is willing to tell the Committee what the Government have in mind. The Committee is supposed to examine the Bill. It is not about exploring the views of councillors in one part of the country; it is about establishing what the Government intend in the Bill.
<P>
The Bill is not well drafted. It creates bodies which are ill defined; in fact they are scarcely defined at all. It bestows upon those bodies considerable powers. The Government have published a White Paper which sets out the importance of the role that the Government believe the regional chambers should perform, and it is for the Minister to tell the House, through the Committee, a little more about what the Government have in mind for those chambers.
<P>
Will the Minister tell the Committee on what basis the political balance in the regional chambers will be measured? Will it, for example, be measured by reference to the share of the popular vote cast for different political parties? If so, will that be the popular vote cast at the most recent general election, the most recent local elections or a combination of the two? Will the political balance be calculated by reference to the number of Members of Parliament or councillors in the region and, if so, which councils will be taken into account? Again, these are matters on which the Opposition seek the Government's view. At this fairly late stage in the proceedings the Government should start to share some of their thinking with those who are interested in these issues.
<P>
A further question concerns what is described in the White Paper as the non-local authority element. Which industries does the Secretary of State expect to see represented on a regional chamber? By whom will those industries be represented? What arrangements should bodies hoping to be designated as regional chambers make for changing their own composition to reflect changes in the regions that they seek to represent? The Minister has acknowledged that it may be several years before the regional chambers are replaced by directly elected regional assemblies. During that period, the character of the regions may undergo significant change. How will such change be reflected in membership of the chambers? Is that to be left entirely to the discretion of the chamber itself?
<P>
The Minister said that the local authority element of chambers should be ``a majority''. Does that mean that he agrees with the Local Government Association view, expressed by Sir Jeremy Beecham in a letter of 13 August 1997, that local authorities should comprise 70 per cent. of a regional chamber? Is that about right? Is it too high, or too low?
<P>
How are regional chambers to publish their views? The White Paper says that they will, but does not say how. There is no need for prescription, but I would like to know the Minister's thinking. As has been pointed out from the Opposition Benches, individual members of chambers may have different views.
<P>
I must return to costs. There are areas in which the private sector will offer to fund a regional chamber, and the Minister indicated that that would happen in London. However, who will pay the costs in areas where private funding is not available? Will local authorities have to cover costs from existing budgets? Will the Minister say, roughly, what he expects the costs of regional chambers to be? Some upper or lower estimates would do.
<P>
If the private sector meets the costs of a particular chamber, might not a possible conflict of interest arise? Is the Minister concerned, in view of the significant role expected of the chambers, about the possibility that a company may pay &#163;50,000 towards the cost of a chamber and its chairman, a prominent figure in the region, may be invited to serve on it?
<P>
These questions were raised by the White Paper, but have not been answered by it. The Government have not offered many clues to their attitude. The questions are important and timely and answers could shed some light on what has, hitherto, been an obscure aspect of Government thinking. We ask them in a constructive spirit and I hope that the Government will take the opportunity to tell us--even if in an indicative or illustrative way--a little more about what the chambers are likely to look like.
<P>
<B>The Minister for the Regions, Regeneration and Planning (Mr. Richard Caborn):</B> I will answer those points question by question.
<P>
I have already said that stakeholders are outlined clearly on page 49 of the White Paper. To repeat, they are:

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am not sure how familiar the Minister is with his own White Paper. He has just quoted from the chapter that deals with the structure of regional development agencies. The paragraph in question does not mention ``stakeholder'' or ``regional chamber''. If he is saying that that paragraph should have been reproduced in the following chapter and that those are the areas from which stakeholders will come, we are moving towards an answer. However, it is not what the White Paper says.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> The hon. Member for South Suffolk clearly lives in a fantasy world. I cannot imagine a regional development agency being set up with one set of stakeholders and a regional chamber containing a different set. They will be trying to do the same job--to deliver a strategy to address the economic weaknesses of a region. The RDAs will be assisted by the regional chambers. The same type of people will be active in the RDAs and the chambers. If the hon. Gentleman wants that paragraph to be reproduced in, I think, chapter 14 of the White Paper, we can do so. However, most people will have realised what we were talking about.
<P>
On the hon. Gentleman's second question, the general composition of the chambers will be broadly similar to what is in place now. North-West Partnership can be broken down to show its various partnerships. We can also show how Yorkshire and Humberside region developed its strategy.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for South Suffolk should speak to the sensible people in the regions, who are trying to do a proper job, to get a real feel of what is happening out there. For the types of people who will serve on the boards, I suggest that he refers to what is in operation, such as the North-West Partnership and in Yorkshire and Humberside region. The developments that they have introduced have gone beyond those of local authorities in their involvement of stakeholders.
<P>
The chambers will be voluntary organisation. We cannot prescribe from the centre. We can, however, recognise certain types of chamber, as set out in the White Paper. In the eight English regions outside London, people have not wanted what the hon. Member for South Suffolk has asked me to introduce because they are already getting on with the job. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee know that those people are working in the real world.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Great Yarmouth (Mr. Wright) hit the bull's eye when he asked whom the hon. Gentleman had consulted. We have gone up and down the country since 1 May to consult a series of stakeholders. We have ensured that the consultation is real. When the hon. Gentleman was challenged by my hon. Friend's perceptive question, he revealed his absolute weakness, which is the type of people whom he has consulted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> Among the people whom I have consulted in relation to East Anglia are English Nature, the Environment Agency, the National Farmers Union, the Country Landowners Association and Friends of the Earth. I have clearly demonstrated that the Minister has consistently ignored their views.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> We only need to read the record. It shows how ill informed the hon. Gentleman is. He cannot remember what he said five minutes ago. When my hon. Friend the Member for Great Yarmouth asked his question, the hon. Gentleman was talking not about the wider issues of stakeholders but about the Local Government Association. He quoted Sir Jeremy Beecham a few minutes before that. It is not enough merely to consult local government, half a dozen councillors and a chief executive. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we consulted a much wider audience, from all political parties at all levels of government. We have the consent of the LGA to move in the direction that we are taking. That is a firmer foundation than the one that the hon. Gentleman put to the Committee.
<P>
Local government, which has given us support at all levels, is asking for flexibility. There are different structures in local government in various regions. We will leave those structures flexible and we will discuss them with bodies representative of local government across all parties. We have set up that dialogue with the LGA.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman wanted guidance on the size of chambers. Again, we will leave that to the sensible approach of the people in the regions. The Welsh Assembly, for example, will have 60 members. The North-West Partnership and Yorkshire and Humberside region provide examples of the mix of members and the proportion of public and private involvement. There is plenty of evidence in the regions to show what shape and type of structure the chambers might take.
<P>
We have consulted 1,500 people and bodies who are interested at national, regional and local levels. The consultations pointed to a general direction.
<P>
We will continue to consult industrial representatives at national and regional levels. The type of industry will vary from region to region. It will not be from a particular sector. We want to create an infrastructure to help with competitiveness and wealth creation. We are talking about partnerships between higher education, further education, academia and inward investment. All those sectors should be considered. They will not draw on a specific sector, but will bring in skills to both the chambers and RDAs.
<P>
On the composition of the chambers, a natural evolution tends to occur in such bodies. We believe that they will be sensible enough to ensure that those who serve in chambers are broadly representative of their regions and bring with them a knowledge of how to resolve the problems that face them. Sir Jeremy Beecham's comments in his letter of 13 August broadly conform to our target of 60 to 70 per cent. from the public sector and 30 per cent. from stakeholders.
<P>
I do not think these bodies need any encouragement to issue reports. The 10-year strategy mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton) has already been issued by Yorkshire and Humberside before vesting day. That document, ``A Strategic Framework for Yorkshire and Humberside: The Next Ten Years'' has already been published. We do not need to instruct people because they want to get on with the job. They have been in a straitjacket for 18 years, unable to use their flair and abilities to deliver, but we will give them the toools, powers and resources to get on with the job. That is just a taste of what is to come when we start addressing the real issues in the regions.
<P>
One minute the Opposition say that chambers are insignificant and the next minute, that chambers are significant. They are schizophrenic. The implication is that chambers are significant because the private sector is involved, so they might be swayed by corruption, but the Government are not good at lecturing people on corruption and we expect people who serve the public interest to have moral integrity. Nevertheless, people will have to adhere to the rules that we lay down.
<P>
I cannot say what the cost will be, but as I said earlier, we will find out what the costs are for the Yorkshire and Humberside Development Association and the North-West Partnership, both organisations that are up and running. Before the end of the Committee, I shall bring along their accounts showing the breakdown of costs. However, costs will be kept within the funding of the private or public sector. That is agreed and understood by the LGA. I think that I have dealt with all the questions that I wrote down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> It may be all the ones that the Minister wrote down, but it does not answer all my questions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Give me the ones I have not answered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I will.
<P>
On the last point about costs, I think the Minister said--he mumbled somewhat, perhaps not surprisingly--that no additional resources would be made available for the costs of operating regional chambers. Therefore, if there is no contribution from the private sector, the full burden will fall on local authorities and there will be no revision of the revenue support grant to meet those additional costs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> That is right. We have consistently said that spending will be from within our own resources. We expect partnerships to develop between the public and private sector. In the case of Yorkshire and Humberside, all the local authorities, including the Conservative authorities, contributed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> Of the other questions that were not dealt with, one related to the role of parish councils, but parish councils did not feature in the Minister's reply. There is also the issue of gender and ethnic balance, which is mentioned in the White Paper, and so I should like to expose a little more of the Minister's thinking on that. What does the Minister regard as appropriate gender and ethnic balance?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I said that we would have discussions with the LGA about representatives of local authorities. I presume that parish councils come within that group. We can agree on that, if not on much else. We will have discussions with the LGA, which represents all political parties active in local government.
<P>
On the issue of ethnic and gender balance, we expect the chambers to take a sensible view of what a proper reflection within their region would be. Regions vary, especially in terms of the ethnic minorities that they contain.

<P>

<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 80, in page 8, line 4, after `Chamber' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and all local authorities in the area covered by the agency.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 81, in page 8, line 6, after `Chamber' insert `or local authorities.'.
<P>
No. 82, in page 8, line 9, after `Chamber' insert `and local authorities.'.
<P>
No. 78, in clause16, page 7, line 27, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2) A regional development agency shall provide each local authority within its area such information and advice as they may require.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 79, in clause 17, page 7, line 31, after `State', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and to each local authority within its area'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The amendments are a return to what is becoming quite a familiar theme--the plea from Opposition Members for the Bill to be strengthened by the inclusion of a recognition of the position of local authorities.
<P>
The Bill threatens local authorities: later clauses give the Secretary of State the power to remove important functions from them. I shall be interested to hear how the Minister reconciles some of his earlier comments with the provisions in the clauses from clause 24 onwards.
<P>
Despite the rebuffs that we suffered earlier, Opposition Members are trying to build into clause 18 a proper recognition of how local authorities should be consulted, informed and engaged in a proper dialogue and relationship with the regional chamber. This is, therefore, a fresh opportunity for the Government to show that they are willing to take account of the anxieties of local authorities. To anticipate a question that the Minister will no doubt want to ask, there are genuine anxieties in Suffolk, for example, among local authorities about the possible consequences of the structures that the Bill creates.
<P>
The clause gives the Secretary of State the power to require RDAs to respond in various ways to demands from regional chambers. The first three of my amendments, Nos. 80, 81 and 82, would give local authorities, which are for the time being, and perhaps for a long time to come, the only elected bodies in those regions, a similar right to information from RDAs.
<P>
Unlike clause 8, clause 18 does not recognise the possibility that the Secretary of State may not find a body to designate as a regional chamber. Therefore, in theory, RDAs in some regions might not have to answer any questions. Even when regional chambers are designated, I cannot see any objection to giving local authorities a power to ask such questions to seek information. The clause empowers the Secretary of State, rather than the regional chambers, and amendments Nos. 78 and 79 would enable local authorities to seek advice and assistance on matters that are not mentioned in clause 18.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is hard to believe that even this Minister wants to prevent regional development agencies from advising or assisting local authorities if asked to do so. I hope, therefore, that my amendments will be accepted.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions </B>(Angela Eagle): Clause 18 makes provision for regional scrutiny of RDA activities by chambers and gives the Secretary of State specific powers of direction to set a framework for RDA-chamber relationships. It also sets a framework for RDA relationships with the Secretary of State, which follows, as has been said many times during our proceedings, the structure of non-departmental public bodies in the first instance.
<P>
The amendments relate to the obligations of a regional development agency to give account of itself and to make information available. In particular, they relate to the position of local authorities. The amendments seek to put local authorities in the same position as the chambers and the Secretary of State. Local authorities are not the same as the chambers, nor are they the same as the Secretary of State. They have a specific role and place in the relationship with each other envisaged in clause 18. The amendments would confuse that relationship.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 80, 81 and 82 relate to clause 18, which is fundamental to establishing the special relationship between an RDA and the chamber. The amendments would require the RDA to deal with all the local authorities in its region on the same basis as the chamber, but chambers are not the same as local authorities in that context. The amendments would require them to be treated in the same way as regards the provision of information, answering of questions and giving an account of themselves as directed by the Secretary of State.
<P>
As I have made clear in relation to other amendments proposing similar requirements, we expect RDAs to provide local authorities with such information and to answer such questions as local authorities require. I hope that RDAs and local authorities will together work out arrangements that best suit their needs, without the necessity of putting those arrangements in the Bill in intimate detail, as amendments Nos. 80, 81 and 82 would require. If necessary--for example, if there were a breakdown, which we do not anticipate, in relations between local authorities and regional development agencies--powers under clause 31 enable Ministers to intervene.
<P>
I have made it clear that we envisage a special relationship between the chamber and RDAs which will not be the same as that between the RDA and local authorities. Within the framework of non-departmental public bodies we want to provide a measure of accountability at regional level. That is what has been missing until now. To do so, we need a body at regional level and that must be the chamber that represents a coming together of the relevant regional interests to express a regional view. Clearly, individual local authorities cannot express that view. We would expect them to express the views that are prevalent in their own local authority areas, but when they come together in the chamber--my hon. Friend the Minister said that it will have a 60 per cent. or 70 per cent. local authority membership--we would expect them to take a more regional and strategic view. Therefore, the regional view of local authorities will find its expression through the chamber. For those reasons I believe that amendments Nos. 80, 81 and 82 are misguided.
<P>
Amendment No. 78 relates to clause 16, which concerns the provision of information by the RDA to the Secretary of State. As I said in relation to an earlier amendment, clause 16 is an important link in the chain of accountability to Ministers and Parliament. The Secretary of State should have access to such advice and information as he thinks necessary to maintain that accountability.
<P>
The amendment says that the RDA should provide such information to local authorities as they require. We intend that local authorities should have the information necessary and appropriate to their involvement in the RDA's work. We will expect RDA's to adhere to the best principles of open government and to develop a constructive working relationship with the local authorities in their area. We hope that they--the RDA and local authorities--can work out for themselves how information should be provided. It is not helpful to give local authorities the upper hand in deciding what information should or should not be provided. Nor should we be too prescriptive about what should be provided or how the relationship between the RDA and the local authorities in its area should be conducted. We have the powers under clause 18 to intervene if necessary, but we hope that the local authorities and the RDA can sort out their relationships without interference from the Government.
<P>
Amendment No. 79 provides that a copy of the RDA's annual report should be sent to each local authority in the area. I entirely agree that that should be done. However, we believe that it is not a matter for primary legislation. We expect it to be done, but we do not want to prescribe in the Bill how an RDA should circulate its annual report. We want it to be widely circulated, we want there to be discussion about it and we want it to be open and accessible to all, but we do not want a list in the Bill of those who should receive it, because inevitably some people will be missed off the list, which might imply that they should not receive it. We do not want to prescribe how the RDAs should behave. However, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will take at least some comfort from my assurance that we expect RDAs to provide local authorities with a copy of the annual report.
<P>
Given what I hope the hon. Gentleman will see as reassurance on his points, I hope that he will to seek to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am still concerned, particularly about the last part of the Under-Secretary's answer. She appears to be equating the role of local authorities in relation to the work of RDAs with that of any other organisation that might or might not be named in the Bill. I do not accept that. There is a clear distinction between the status of the local authorities in a region and the relationship that they can legitimately expect to have with an RDA, and it would be helpful to recognise that in the Bill.
<P>
I am not suggesting that the Bill should include a long list of organisations to whom reports should be sent or information made available. It is simply a matter of acknowledging that local authorities are worried about what the Bill is doing, and one way of alleviating those worries would be to include in the Bill phrases that recognise the distinct position of local authorities. I regret that the Under-Secretary seems reluctant to allow that to happen. As I say, it is not clear to me what the disadvantage of the amendments is, other than the fact that they were not included when the Bill was introduced. Therefore, I intend to press the matter.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I shall quickly reassure the hon. Gentleman again. The local authorities and the RDAs clearly have a special relationship, which must work properly if RDAs are to be successful. We believe that the structure in the Bill strikes the right balance by avoiding over-prescription while setting a framework within which RDAs will know they have to operate. It also gives as many signals as possible that we want relationships between the RDAs and local authorities to be co-operative and for their mutual benefit. That special relationship is properly recognised and interwoven with many aspects of the Bill. If the hon. Member for South Suffolk cares to remember, he will know that the special position of local authorities is recognised in the fact that four members of the RDA boards will come from local authorities. Chambers will be local authority-led, too.
<P>
The Bill appropriately notes the special position of local authorities, and we need be no more prescriptive than that. There will be significant local authority presence on the RDA executive and in the chambers. I hope that that reassurance will prompt the hon. Gentleman to realise that we do not have to prescribe everything and to reconsider his determination to put the amendment to the vote.

<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I merely observe that clause 18 is highly prescriptive. The timing of public meetings must be dictated by the Secretary of State. The period of notice for the meeting is referred to in the Bill, and is dictated by the Secretary of State. The manner of publishing notice of the annual meeting is included in the Bill, and is decided by the Secretary of State. Even the way in which the meeting is to be conducted has been referred to in the Bill. All that detail is in the Bill, although Ministers are keen to avoid the Bill becoming so prescriptive that local authorities must be more closely involved. There is a contradiction in the Under-Secretary's defence of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Day (Cheadle):</B> Can my hon. Friend explain why Ministers are reluctant to put their express intentions onto the face of the Bill? That might provoke the answer that he has so far been unable to receive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> My hon. Friend tempts me. I wish that I could provoke an answer on the real reasons for the Under-Secretary's objections.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I reassure the hon. Gentleman that I am giving the real reasons.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> These amendments, like others with similar aims, would improve the Bill. They do not undermine the Bill or take away the powers that the Government wish to retain in the hands of the Secretary of State. They do not weaken the powers of the regional development agencies or the chambers. They would, however, send a valuable and positive signal to local authorities about the Government's intentions. The Under-Secretary has given assurances, but accepting the amendment would give a stronger signal.

<P>
Mrs. Jackie Ballard (Taunton): I beg to move amendment No. 100, in page 8, line 13, at end insert-- `(2B) A regional development agency for which there is a designated regional chamber under subsection 8(1) shall organise any public meeting for the purposes of this section in conjunction with the chamber.'.
In an earlier debate, my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed) and I suggested that the RDA should hold a public meeting when discussing changing its name. Unfortunately, that amendment did not receive a positive response. We are pleased that the annual report should have to be presented to a public meeting. I also hope that RDAs will be advised to hold public meetings to discuss regional economic strategy, as I feel that the public and other stakeholders--to use the jargon--would have a greater opportunity to get involved if they were able to look forward rather than backward through the publication of the annual report. However, the amendment is not designed to ask for more meetings to be open to the public but to give the regional chamber a role in organising the public meeting that will be required after the publication of the annual report.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The amendment deals, as the hon. Lady said, with the arrangements for the meetings to be held by regional development agencies. The Bill provides that there should be such public meetings, and the amendment seeks to involve the regional chambers in the arrangements for those meetings.
<P>
I am not sure whether subsections (2), (3) and (4) of clause 18 are designed to give effect to the commitment in chapter 11.5 of the White Paper, which refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an annual hearing to discuss its corporate plan.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Under-Secretary tell us whether those subsections relate to that hearing? I am not sure what the difference is between an annual hearing and a public meeting, but perhaps the Under-Secretary can enlighten us. Perhaps subsections (2), (3) and (4) are about something else altogether. If they do relate to the hearings, however, there is some merit in the amendment. [Interruption.] I hear a comment about public meetings from my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon, but as the Bill already provides for public meetings we should ensure that they are as well organised as possible. The Bill would give the Secretary of State his usual powers of absolute dictation over such a relatively minor matter, some aspects of which are perhaps more significant.
<P>
Clause 18(2) allows the Secretary of State to say when the meeting will be held. It would be helpful if the Under-Secretary gave an assurance that the meeting would be held within not more than a month of the publication of the annual report. Such an assurance would be better than having to rely on the whim of the Secretary of State.
<P>
Clause 18(3) provides that the Secretary of State shall specify what notice should be given, and how that notice should be published. As the Secretary of State would be retaining such detailed powers, the involvement of the regional chamber could not be unhelpful. Subsection (4) allows the Secretary of State to dictate, as I have mentioned before, how the meeting should be conducted. The Committee will recognise a familiar pattern: the Secretary of State would appoint the board members, dictate the strategy that they should follow, decide what functions they should perform and tell them whom to consult. It is therefore hardly surprising that the agencies are not even to be entrusted with the responsibility of organising their public meetings without the Secretary of State's involvement.
<P>
The Government do not seem keen to leave much to chance, but I hope that they will at least consider that it might be helpful for the regional chamber, a body which itself is subject to the Secretary of State's prior scrutiny approval, to be involved in this process.
<P>
When the Under-Secretary replies, I hope that she will address specifically how soon after publication of a report the annual meetings should be held, the way in which it is intended that those meetings should be publicised--the Secretary of State will decide that--and what form the meetings will take. Some information about the way the meetings will be conducted, whether the public will be allowed to ask questions during them, what the arrangements will be for the press to ask questions and other relevant details of that sort would enlighten the Committee.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The amendment relates to the requirement in the clause for an RDA to hold a public meeting. It would place an obligation on the RDA to organise the public meeting.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``in conjunction with the chamber.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall return to that in a minute.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Suffolk asked whether the clause fulfils the commitment in paragraph 11.5 of the White Paper to hold a hearing. The answer to that question is yes, as the hon. Gentleman suspected: that is indeed what the meeting is about.
<P>
We are in full sympathy with the sentiments of the amendment--that will sound familiar--which is something that we see as good practice. It is right that an RDA should involve the chamber in organising the public meeting envisaged in the clause, but we do not know what the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``in conjunction with the chamber''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
means. We have looked at the dictionary to see what it means, as judges tend to do when issues crop up on the meaning of words in primary legislation. The ``Oxford Dictionary of Current English'' offers the following definition:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``the apparent proximity of two heavenly bodies to each other''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am not an export on heavenly bodies, but we are not sure that the words in the amendment quite achieve what Opposition Members intend. However, I hope that they will be reassured to know that we envisage the chambers and RDAs being on such wonderful speaking terms that they will be able to liaise about the public meeting and themselves decide to bring it about in a mutually acceptable way.
<P>
With that reassurance I hope that the hon. Member for Taunton will seek to withdraw the amendment. Its purpose will be fulfilled anyway, but its wording is less than helpful.
<P>
In answer to the questions asked by the hon. Member for South Suffolk, this is an annual public meeting that we envisage will be open to all. Although we do not want to set rigid guidelines about the way in which the meeting should take place, we expect, say, the chairman and the chief executive to give an account of the annual report in public. I would expect anyone who has a sensible collection of briefs and some enthusiasm for the matter to be able to answer questions from the public and the press at such an event. It is envisaged that it will be an open and fully participatory event, but we do not want the Bill to contain the requirement that the RDA must act
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``in conjunction with the chamber.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> This is another example of Ministers apparently having great sympathy with Opposition amendments, but always refusing to allow a wording that reflects that sympathy and brings it into action. If the wording of the amendment is incorrect, or not to the same standard as professional draftsmen would have achieved, why cannot the Under-Secretary introduce on Report a suitably drafted amendment to achieve the same objective? She said that she was in full sympathy with the purpose of the amendment, and when she said that she was smiling sweetly and looking quite pleasant and friendly. It would be pleasant if that could, for once, be acted on by allowing the Opposition to make a constructive contribution to the Bill. If the Under-Secretary is genuinely sympathetic to the objective of the amendment, which has the support of both Opposition parties, it would be a helpful gesture if she instructed her officials to draft a suitable amendment to achieve the objective that she has declared we all share.

<P>

<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I fear that we have run into the philosophical difference of opinion that has recurred since the beginning of our proceedings--and, I suspect, will do so again before our proceedings finish. It concerns whether what we want to happen should be stated in primary legislation, or in subsequent guidance to be issued by the Secretary of State or by Ministers, who will ensure that what will intitially be non-departmental public bodies conduct their business in the way in which we expect and report back to Parliament on their relationships and interactions with the partners in their regions.
<P>
The hon. Member for Cheadle (Mr. Day) was correct in recognising that there is no disagreement in the Committee on the advisability of a public meeting being held in co-operation with the regional chamber, but we believe that it can only create complications to put that in primary legislation. Again, I assure the hon. Gentleman that that is the purpose of the part of the clause to which the amendment refers, but we simply do not want to be too prescriptive in primiary legislation about the mechanics of how the provision will work. We believe that it is better to do that in subsequent guidance to be issued by the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> It is still not clear to my why the Under-Secretary believes that setting out in the Bill something with which we all agree in principle will complicate the matter. Surely the Bill should reflect what the Government say is their aim?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The problem with putting such detail in primary legislation is, as Conservative Members who spent 18 years on the Government Benches know, that it may be restricting and create inflexibility. We expect matters to evolve before the end of the century, and harmful rigidity would set in if the details were stated in primary legislation. If it became necessary to make changes as the evolutionary process continued, we would have to return to primary legislation. If the details are set out in guidance, they can be changed more effectively and efficiently in line with events.
<P>
Hon. Gentlemen are expressing the frustration of being in opposition as they see their amendments dealt with in this way. Perhaps there will be later amendments to which we can be more sympathetic, or which we can even accept. We shall have to wait and see. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept my assurances on how we see RDAs and chambers working in respect of public meetings and other areas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> Is the Under-Secretary giving way?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I have finished.
<P>
5.30 pm.
<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> The point that I cannot understand is that the Under-Secretary says that the situation is ``sometimes'' complicated if the Bill is too detailed. That may be so. What she has not explained is how this Bill will be complicated. I take her general point, but she has not explained why it will be a problem in this case.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> We do not think it appropriate to set out in primary legislation how RDAs should liaise with chambers in setting up a meeting. We expect them to be adult enough to do that for themselves.
<P>
<B>Mr. Colin Breed </B>(South-East Cornwall): For my edification, will we, at some stage during the proceedings that we are spending hours and hours on, find that all the stuff being consigned to guidance will be published? An awful lot of what is in the Bill could be consigned to guidance. The Bill could be down to two pages and we could be away from here. I understand that there must be a balance in what goes into the Bill, but will the guidance mysteriously appear at some future date when the legislation has been enacted, or will we get a chance to see it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The hon. Gentleman has put his finger on one of the Bill's flaws. Far too much of the Bill is left to subsequent guidance. It is a serious failing to allow Ministers a hugh amount of latitude and discretion and I fear that the House will not have an adequate opportunity to scrutinise the guidance and directions through which the Secretary of State will effectively control most of the activities of regional development agencies.
<P>
I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for her helpful explanation of how the many meetings dealt with in the clause will work. In similar terms, will she say how long after publication of a report she expects the meetings to take place?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> In answer to the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall, we will consult. Guidance is not just written in some room at Eland house and dispatched from there. We will consult on drafts with those who will use it and will then polish and amend it, perhaps changing some aspects. That is a well-worn way of proceeding with all NDPBs which have guidelines on their work.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman is reassured that the guidance will not simply pop up out of nowhere, set in concrete. There will be plenty of time to deal with drafts when they are produced and to have a dialogue about how they should be changed. The essence of guidance is that it can change without primary legislation if unexpected problems or rigidities appear as a result of practical use. Time on the Floor of the House is at an absolute premium in this Parliament and it would probably take a long time to change rigidities in any Bill. We think it prudent to keep flexibility in the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Suffolk asked about timing. There is no set view, but we expect annual meetings discussing reports to take place in reasonable time, not several months after the report has been published. Time should be allowed for appropriate arrangements to be made.
<P>
Different RDAs may have different ways of reporting back to their regions; some may want much closer contact with the population. We do not want to be too prescriptive about how those meetings take place. We may see some innovation in accountability in how RDAs want to interact with the population in their regions. If there is to be meaningful dialogue about an annual report, it must take place within a reasonable time of the publication of the annual report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> I hate to drag the Under-Secretary back to the point that I made earlier, but I must. It is important and indicative of the Government's attitude to the amendments.
<P>
When pressed on the specific implications of including the amendment, the Minister retreated to the use of the word ``appropriate'', which, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon said, the Minister used before. I am sure that he remembers using it. We were told that on this occasion the amendment was not ``appropriate''. That is in no way a description of why the Government refuse to return with a properly worded amendment on something of which they have declared themselves in favour in principle. I hope that the Committee and the Official Report will note that, so that it will be made plain to anyone who reads the proceedings of the Committee in future that, despite the fact that the Government were in sympathy with the amendment, there was no adequate, practical explanation of why a suitably worded amendment to achieve the same objective could not be tabled.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> I am please that such a nice little amendment should have led to such a long debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The length of debate is usually in inverse proportion to the importance of the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> I thank the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon for that patronisation, or whatever the right term is.
<P>
I was getting quite excited when the Minister started to respond, because he used phrases such as heavenly bodies, full sympathy, good practice and so on. I thought that we were getting somewhere.
<P>
I came to the Committee with two preconceptions. The first was that my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cornwall and I would be on a learning curve, and that we would probably not get our amendments right in the first place; that we may even have them ruled out of order. I thought that we would learn as we went along.
<P>
My second preconception--one that the Government led me to have--was that the Government genuinely believed in open government and pluralism. I expected a Government who keep telling us how much they believe in open government to be open to considering very small amendments that improved the Bill, with which they had full sympathy and that they thought were good practice. I thought that they would look at those very small amendments and be open to accepting a few of them. I notice that later on we shall be discussing some amendments that the Minister has tabled himself. Clearly, he does not think that the Bill is perfect.
<P>
I am disappointed that, despite being in full sympathy with the amendment, the Government feel that they cannot accept it. It is not a retreat or an admission of defeat to say that perhaps another political party, someone who is not on the Government side, has come up with a very small amendment that would improve the Bill. To press the amendment to a vote might embarrass the Government into having to vote against their own sympathies. [Hon. Members: ``Do it.''] That would be terrible for them. So, because I am a generous person, I would rather allow them the chance to go away, think again, and return to the issue on Report. They should open another dictionary because there are other meanings of the word ``conjunction''. They could open a thesaurus and come up with a word that has nothing to do with heavenly bodies and will help the amendment to achieve its purpose. We shall withdraw the amendment now and hope that, by Report stage, they will have seen the light and shown that they really do believe in pluralism. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Is it the pleasure of the Committee that the amendment be withdrawn?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I do not intend to detain the Committee for long, but a couple of points need to be made.
<P>
First, I want to register my concern about the clause, which remains unamended. This is yet another clause that greatly enhances the power of the Secretary of State. It is another aspect of the control regime that the Government seem so keen to establish for regional development agencies and regional chambers. It is a pity that there is no chink in the armour. Hon. Members who have served on the Committee and not made a single protest through their votes or speeches about the blanket of central control that is built into a policy that was originally claimed to be one of decentralisation, may live to regret their actions.
<P>
My purpose in seeking clarification of clause 18 is to probe an area that was not debated in relation to the amendments. The clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Secretary of State may by directions require a regional development agency''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that in itself is a weakness that was identified by the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``. . . to supply the chamber with information of such description as may be specified in the directions''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What sort of information is envisaged? It is clearly not information that the Government wish to identify in advance by including it in the Bill, but I understand why they may not wish to do that. However, it would help members of the Committee decide whether the clause should stand part of the Bill if they had some insight into what sort of information the Secretary of State will tell RDAs to pass to the chambers.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Clause 18 is crucial to our aim of making RDAs give an account of themselves to the regions. Many hon. Members know the way in which non-departmental public bodies work. They are accountable first to Ministers and then to this place. They are also accountable to the Public Accounts Committee and the National Audit Office for the money that they have spent. That line of accountability for NDPBs is well established and well used. All members of the Committee know how it works. The Bill deals with the initial stages of an RDA and how it will account for the public money that it spends.
<P>
The idea of the clause is to ensure that there is another aspect of accountability and information, and that there is regional scrutiny of an RDA's activities. Although initially there will be no direct accountability for money spent, because the regional chambers are not given statutory existence in the Bill, we want to provide a meaningful and genuine way of developing regional scrutiny by a chamber of an agency's activities. That is what the clause sets out to present.
<P>
The Secretary of State may direct an RDA to supply its chamber with any specified information and to answer questions that the chamber may have about that information in a way that may be determined by the Secretary of State. The clause has been deliberately written to ensure maximum flexibility to respond to problems or issues that may crop up in a relationship between a chamber and an RDA. Although it does not look like the most enlightening of phrases, the provision is in the clause to provide the maximum flexibility--
<P>
<H5>5.46 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.
<P>
<H5>6.5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Before the Division, we were talking about clause 18(1). I was explaining the Secretary of State's power to direct a regional development agency to supply its chamber with specified information or to answer questions that the chamber might have about that information. Those powers are in the Bill as a last resort.We expect RDAs and chambers to make such provisions for themselves and to work out how to deal with such issues. There may be variations in how they do so.
<P>
We do not want clause 18 to go beyond the good principle of a stopgap power. That safeguard will ensure that if there is a problem in relationships between a particular RDA and chamber, which we do not expect, the Secretary of State will have the power to intervene to set up what will almost be a Select Committee to make sure that the chamber can bring the RDA to account. Established and well used methods exist to make NDPBs accountable to Parliament. Clause 18 begins to create that level of accountability for regional chambers. We hope that Bills yet to come will strengthen that further.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for her response. I should have mentioned one point, relating to what was said by the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall, when I spoke previously, but forgot to do so. Can the Minister say when--or if--directions to lay these requirements on RDAs are likely to be issued? In anticipation of the directions, and following her earlier response about consultations before they are issued, will she tell us a little more about what sort of consultation will take place?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> As I have said, the clause provides a safeguard that we hope not to have to use. We expect RDAs and chambers to work out issues of regional accountability, and it is evident that they are already beginning to do so in their embryonic forms. In the unlikely event of a complete breakdown between an RDA and a chamber, the powers could be called on, but there would clearly have to be a history of a breakdown in communications, which would be well known to all concerned. The Secretary of State would have to consider how best to make it clear to the RDA that it had to have a dialogue with the chamber. We do not expect that to happen. If it does, it will be after a breakdown that is open and obvious to all. In that unlikely event, there can be a debate about the powers.
<P>
As I have said, the provisions on specified information and answering questions are there so that the chamber can act almost as a Select Committee, calling for papers, asking questions and taking evidence. We envisage that kind of arrangement, but very much hope that the Secretary of State will not be called on to require it anywhere.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 18 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 104, in page 4, line 18, after `agency', insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(aa) with the approval of any chamber designated in respect of an agency under subsection 8(1).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may also take amendment No. 106, in clause 14, page 6, line 34, after `State', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or a chamber designated under subsection 8(1).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> Amendment No. 104 ensures that when the Secretary of State determines the RDA's financial duties the regional chambers, as well as the Treasury, must give their approval. Amendment No. 106 requires the RDAs to keep proper accounts, as we know they will--RDAs must comply with the Secretary of State's requirements concerning those statements of account--and ensures that the RDAs also comply with requirements from the regional chamber.
<P>
Both amendments are designed to give regional chambers a more powerful role, this time in relation to financial arrangements, which in many respects will be at the heart of much of the RDA's work. Again, we are trying to give the chambers influence on what could otherwise be private matters arranged between the Secretary of State, the Treasury and the RDA, leaving out the chambers. Clause 18, which dealt with the RDAs' accountability to chambers, was perhaps not strong enough, although I accept the Under-Secretary's argument.
<P>
The fundamental difference between our position and the Government's in this respect is that we want the chambers to be able to shape the RDAs' actions in advance of those actions--in other words, to have a real input. The accountability in clause 18 gives chambers a hindsight role in monitoring the existing operations and procedures. The elected chambers will have major responsibilities, and we believe that they should not simply monitor but have direct involvement in the RDAs' operations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> We now come to the clauses dealing with the agencies' financial competencies. I wish to raise a number of issues, but I want mainly to ask the Minister for some information and to make sure that in the sittings that deal with these matters he has the information to hand.
<P>
I want first to draw attention again to the singular unhelpfulness of the notes on clauses. Clause 9(1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Secretary of State may--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) after consultation with a regional development agency, and
<P>
(b) with the approval of the Treasury,
<P>
determine the financial duties of the agency; and different determinations may be made for different functions of the agency.''<P>

I realise that one does not always find Shakespeare's English in the Bill, but knowing the Department, I though that the notes on clauses would be expressed in a more mellifluous and helpful way. Unfortunately,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Subsection (1) enables the Secretary of State, with the Treasury's approval and after consulting an agency to determine its financial duties. Differing determinations may be made in relation to different functions of the agency.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
does not take me much further down the road. If the notes on clauses could tell us something about what the clause is trying to do, instead of being a precis which is even more impenetrable than the clause, they would do us all a service. That is just by way of a preliminary remark.
<P>
As to the substance of the clause, we need to know what financial powers and budgets the agencies will dispose of. I accept that to some extent we do not know that, because the Bill goes on to talk about borrowing powers and other means of securing approvals, but as the clause embarks upon the agencies' financial duties it would be helpful if the Minister spelled out what budgets he expects them to have. We know where their powers are coming from. They do not have a power of precept. The role of English Partnerships, the regeneration programmes and the rural development programmes will fall to the agencies. Those are quantifiable sums.
<P>
It should be possible for the Minister to say what budget he expects the Yorkshire and Humberside development agency to dispose of on the basis of last year's or this year's expenditure. I realise that further sums will come from borrowing, as specified in the clauses that we are about to debate, but it would be enormously helpful to have that information.
<P>
Secondly, not all the regions will have the same funding. The region that the Minister and I represent is an old industrial area and is relatively rich in regeneration and English Partnerships funds.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The right hon. Gentleman's remarks are going wide of debate. His comments would be more appropriate to the clause stand part debate. Will he please keep to the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> You are very kind, Mr. Benton--I was trying to help the Minister. I did not want to ask him questions that he could not answer. Knowing how helpful he is, I realise that he will want to be armed with the answers. I merely wish to point out that it would be helpful to come to the Committee with the probable budgets of the development agencies, such as they exist already in the form of transferred funds. I understand that additional funds may be raised later through measures specified in the Bill, and we will want to explore those. That information would help us enormously to discuss the measure constructively.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I entirely endorse my right hon. Friend's comments. The clause stand part debate on this and possibly the next clause will give us an opportunity, which I hope that you, Mr. Benton, will regard as proper, to investigate the implications of the powers being given to the Secretary of State. Indeed, it will be fascinating to know what the Minister has to say about the size of the budgets of the regional development agencies and the source of the funds, other than borrowing. I look forward to those debates with even greater eagerness than I do to many others.
<P>
The amendments appear to be another attempt to enhance the role of regional chambers. Instinctively, I welcome almost any change to the Bill that aims to curb the tendency of the Secretary of State to secure by law the position of an absolute dictator over the RDAs and their work. I fear, however, that relying on the regional chambers in this context will not be a satisfactory means of achieving that. The lack of clarity that exists even after our debates early this afternoon and which surrounds much of the activities, composition and method of working of regional chambers, is a considerable handicap in assessing their effectiveness as a check on the Secretary of State. I fear that the very existence of regional chambers may be at the beck and call of the Secretary of State.
<P>
Although I sympathise with the aim of the amendment, I fear that in practice it may not be effective. It seems that it is essentially flawed. No doubt the Minister will explain why it is not necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> These are not private arrangements. Financial duties will be set out in the financial memorandum, which is a public document. I want that to be on the record.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> Would the arrangements in the financial memorandum result from discussion and then be published?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Yes, in the public domain. The hon. Member for South Suffolk knows the line I shall take. These are NDPBs. There is a tried and tested way to ensure accountability in NDPBs. The amendments concern public funds for which Ministers are accountable. I can assure the Committee that we take such matters very seriously.
<P>
Clause 9 allows the Secretary of State to set the financial duties of the RDAs. It allows us, in consultation with the RDAs, to set a proper framework in which they can spend money on programmes. The public would want the provisions to be effective. I certainly do.
<P>
Amendment No. 104 would undermine one of the fundamental principles of financial accountability. It would require the Secretary of State to reach agreement with the appropriate regional chamber before determining the financial duties of RDAs. In practice, that would amount to no less than providing the chambers with a veto over the financial structures of the RDAs.
<P>
The chambers will be an important mechanism for providing regional accountability. However, money for RDAs will come, in the first instance, not from the regions, but from Parliament. Ministers will be accountable for how it is spent. Giving regional chambers an opportunity to set the financial duties of an RDA would give them a power for which they would not be accountable, and that cannot be allowed.
<P>
As we have said, we will give the people of the English regions the right to determine whether they want directly elected regional assemblies, as we have done in Scotland and Wales and will do in the capital. If they do, there will be a role for assemblies in setting financial arrangements for the RDAs, if it is the main source of funding. However, until then, Ministers must remain solely accountable for the financial activities of RDAs.
<P>
It is equally important that the use of public funds by RDAs be fully reported and subject to external auditing. Clause 14 provides that the RDA must keep proper accounts and produce a statement of accounts giving a true and fair view of the state of affairs and the income and expenditure of the agency. Clause 14(2) allows the Secretary of State to set format and content of the statement of accounts. Amendment No. 106 would extend this power to the regional chamber.
<P>
I can assure the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall that this is not necessary. Normally, the requirements of the Secretary of State mirror the requirements of the Companies Acts and the Accounting Standards Board. In short, RDAs will be subject to the same strict accounting requirements as any other organisation established under the Companies Acts. Any additional requirements imposed by the regional chambers would be an unnecessary burden on the RDAs. I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I thank the Minister for his explanation. I accept what he has said about the regional chambers and the Secretary of State. We need to ensure that chambers are involved in the financial shaping of the RDAs, but I accept the Minister's views and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 105, in page 4, leave out lines 34 to 37.
<P>
Much of our debate has been about what is written on the face of the Bill versus what should appear in guidance, and about the extent of the Secretary of State's reserved powers. It seems that when one side wants more of one thing, the other wants less of the other.
<P>
Amendment No. 105 removes subsection (4), which gives the Secretary of State the power to direct an agency to give him any or all of a surplus. The subsection says that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Where it appears to the Secretary of State that a regional development agency has a surplus, . . . he may''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
direct that it be paid back to the Treasury. There is no detail of how the Secretary of State will come to that judgment. For example, a large capital project may demand a carry-over of capital from year to year to meet its own requirements. Does that mean that the Secretary of State will be second-guessing the judgment of the RDAs, which are being set up specifically to represent the majority of business interests in the region and to be in charge of the region's economic development?
<P>
Our amendment would allow RDAs to build up surpluses--which they might be building up for a specific reason--without fear of their being purloined by central Government. That would provide RDAs with more stability and would allow them to plan for the long term. The Bill provides the Secretary of State with enough powers to ensure that the RDAs are spending public money properly: we have already heard mention of the auditing system. RDAs should spend that money on economic regeneration rather than squirreling it away for the future for no good reason.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I suppose that we cannot be surprised at the inclusion of subsection (4) in clause 9, given the Bill's overall philosophy of total control. I cannot say that I am hopeful, even if the amendment were successful and subsection (4) were deleted from the Bill, that the amendment would change a great deal. It would be helpful if the Minister explained the circumstances in which the Secretary of State would take back any surplus generated by the RDA. RDAs will not be encouraged to operate with maximum efficiency and to make savings where possible if they think that the surpluses generated will have to be handed back to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
<P>
Will the Minister tell us what effects the Government believe that subsection (4) will have on the motivation of the management of RDAs? Will the Minister also explain--I am sure that the Treasury has given him some guidance--the purpose to which the surpluses, once they have been gobbled back by central Government, will be put? Will they be recycled to those RDAs that are less efficient at managing their affairs? If so, not only would the efficient be penalised but the inefficient would be rewarded and rescued. That philosophy underpinned the recent changes in the distribution of funds to local authorities: the profligates were rewarded and the thrifty placed at a disadvantage.
<P>
Will the Minister also say what opportunity the boards of RDAs and the regional chambers will have to express their views on whether surpluses should be taken back before the Treasury grasps the cash for its coffers? Will local authorities that have contributed in any way to the running costs of RDAs be reimbursed by the Treasury if it takes money away from the RDAs?
<P>
Lastly on this point--at least for the time being--what effect does the Minister think that subsection (4) will have on the enthusiasm of private sector partners, whose contribution to the success of RDAs the Minister has been at pains to stress on several occasions? Will they start to suspect that entering partnerships with RDAs might be another hidden form of taxation? There are enough hidden forms of taxation these days, and this might be another example. A private sector partner might find that the effect of putting up cash for particular projects is to allow RDAs to send surpluses back to the Treasury. These are matters of real concern.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Caroline Spelman </B>(Meriden): I speak in support of the amendment. I still do not understand clearly how RDAs will be financed in the first place. That makes it difficult to talk in theoretical terms about what will happen when the budgeting goes wrong.
<P>
Subsection (4) describes a situation in which a surplus has arisen, and perhaps some practical illustration would make it easier to understand how that might occur. Would it arise simply as a result of poor budgeting and, if so, has the Minister any measures in mind to ensure that good budgeting practice is an integral part of the way in which RDAs operate? Will that be part of the general, rather amorphous guidance, or will there be specific measures to ensure that a better model of good budgeting practice can be achieved?
<P>
I have difficulty in understanding why funds should be allowed to flow back to the centre. That will give rise to poor practice, which will be the fault not of the RDAs but of arriving at a deadline with a surplus in hand.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
My concern is that we shall see a continuation of the poor model that we have had in the public sector in the past at the year end, when public bodies have suddenly had to spend remaining money on projects that may not have been necessary or appropriate. The last thing we want is that public or private money should be frittered away on RDA projects or initiatives that have not been well thought out, simply because a deadline approaches when the surplus would be taken away.
<P>
I support the amendment and ask the Minister to give practical illustrations of why subsection (4) is considered necessary and worth while.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I should also like to know a little more. Will the Minister tell us how the surpluses will occur? I suppose it is possible that a development agency might receive money from English Partnerships and the Rural Development Commission; it might raise money under the loan provisions that we shall debate later and might be given a grant by the Treasury. Would the surplus arise if it did not manage to spend that money during the year? As my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) said, the first law of any organisation is to ensure that its budget is spent, or someone will take it away. The problem for most public bodies is wanting to spend a lot more than their budgets, but end-of-year flexibility is an indispensable tool and provides lubrication to enable them to run efficiently.
<P>
Will surpluses arise from cash flow or, alternatively, from capital projects or commercial partnerships? Would it be possible for a development agency to enter into a commercial partnership with a business concern--perhaps by providing regeneration land which is has brought to the point at which it can be developed and taking a venture capital share in the land which then starts to yield profits that accrue to the agency?
<P>
We need to know how surpluses will occur. We are discussing exceptional circumstances which are not covered by the normal management cycle. We are not discussing simple questions of cash flow which, by denying an agency the ability to be flexible, might push it into unwise spending decisions to clear its books at the end of the year. It would be helpful to know which will be the case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I should have thought that the right hon. Gentleman would know more about the clause than I do because he has been a Minister and the clause has been on the statute book in various forms covering non-departmental public bodies and English Partnerships. I am surprised that he probed so deeply a measure that he himself has administered.
<P>
The amendment, like the previous one, raises issues of public accountability. Clause 9(4) allows the Secretary of State to recover surplus money from the RDAs. The same power is available to the Secretary of State in respect of English Partnerships, but has never been used. I hope that the power in clause 9(4) will also never be used in respect of RDAs. However, while the Secretary of State remains accountable to Parliament for the RDAs' money, it is vital that the power remain in the Bill. Amendment No. 105 would remove it. RDAs will be non-departmental public bodies. Normally, those bodies receive their grant in aid from the Government on a monthly basis, which ensures that they do not carry large amounts of public funds at the start of the year that could be used by the Government for other purposes. That is one way to ensure that most efficient use is made of a public resource. However, despite that, the body could still have a surplus of funds if, for example, a large project were delayed or more receipts than expected were collected. In such circumstances, the most efficient use of those public funds, subject to some flexibility, would be to return them to the centre for other programmes. In those circumstances, I would expect RDAs voluntarily to return the funds to the Government. However, as the person responsible for the RDAs' financial action, the Secretary of State could not leave that to chance. Therefore, the Bill contains a safety provision, under which RDAs would be directed to pay any surplus to the Government. The amendment would remove that provision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Where would the receipts come from? In relation to English Partnerships or the development organisations' regeneration programmes, I cannot immediately think of programmes that generate capital receipts for those organisations. Will the Minister give an example of a project that might generate a receipt, which might then require the Treasury to intervene?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> The sale of land would be a receipt and would go to the RDA after the transfer of the regional organisations of English Partnerships to RDAs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> But most of the time English Partnerships does not sell land because it cannot get a receipt for it. It puts money into the recovery of land, which may be contaminated, so that it can be developed, but a piece of land would not often be capable of generating large capital receipts. If it did, English Partnerships would not be involved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> That is not true, and the right hon. Gentleman knows it is not true; English Partnerships does own land. For example, in Sheffield, when the Government announced the United Kingdom Sports Institute, the land around some of the stadium for the institute went up in price considerably within 24 hours. English Partnerships owned some of that land. The decisions of Government, companies and major organisations can considerably affect land prices, and that would produce a receipt. As I have already said, that would happen only in exceptional circumstances and I do not envisage the provisions being used, but they are a safeguard. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman would agree that we should take prudent measures when we act on behalf of the public purse. Clause 9(4) allows the Secretary of State to direct RDAs to pay him any surplus of standard provision to NDPBs, but it is a power and not a duty. That does not mean that an RDA will be forced to pay to the centre all funds it receives in private financial support. Indeed, in general, we shall not use the power or any other power available to the Secretary of State in a way that would discourage private sector partnerships with RDAs. On the basis of those remarks, I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> My right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon has started to uncover something that we had not previously fully appreciated. The Minister explained how a surplus might arise that the Treasury might want to take back. He quoted an example of land prices rising substantially in Sheffield. We shall debate the planning powers that RDAs may be given by the Secretary of State, but are we not now beginning to see what is in the Government's mind? An RDA acquires land on its own account. It is then given planning powers by the Secretary of State. A change in the planning consents relating to that piece of land is granted by the RDA and thereby--
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> This is a nice exposure of how Tory minds work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> It is not my theory. The Minister said only minutes ago how land prices rocketed in the space of 24 hours of a certain decision being made, and the Bill will give the agencies the power to do many things. We shall deal shortly with clauses giving powers to acquire land. An RDA can acquire land with money borrowed from the Treasury under clause 11. It can than be given planning powers over that land by the Secretary of State. It can then use its planning to give itself planning consent. The value of the land, as the Minister said, could rocket in 24 hours and then, lo and behold, perhaps it will be sold. In such circumstances, the Treasury may suddenly rub its hands and get the surplus.
<P>
That appears to be a possibility, and it was clearly in the Minister's mind, because it was his reference to land prices rocketing in Sheffield in 24 hours that suddenly exposed what may be at the heart of the Bill. Will the Minister respond to that fear, which may become quite widespread?
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> Similar thoughts have crossed my mind and I want to intervene on almost the same point.
<P>
I do not want to repeat the scenario, but subsection (4) refers to the agency having a surplus
<P>
``whether on capital or revenue account''.
<P>
Thus the surpluses will always be of a cash nature. If an RDA was thinking of getting into a situation in which it might be presumed that it had surplus cash, the agency could acquire assets which would enable it to retain, albeit in another form, the value of the potential surplus. As the clause is worded, any such surplus would have to be in cash; it is not intended that the Secretary of State would look at surpluses in any other of the asset registers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I say to the hon. Member for South Suffolk that I am amazed that people who have been in the house for so long, and who have been members of a Government who put English Partnerships on to the statute book, can display such ignorance. They are ex-Ministers, yet they are ignorant of the planning regimes that operate in this country. I find their ignorance and short memories unbelievable. The same powers were given to English Partnerships. They are no more and no less than those which operated under the previous Administration. The Tories put the body on to the statute book.
<P>
I do not want to be dragged too much into the subject of planning powers, which we shall come to later, but if the RDAs were given planning powers, they would be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and would have to conform to the development plans. If they move outside that, they will be called in. Opposition Ministers, with their wealth of knowledge as ex-Ministers, should know how the planning system works. The same ignorance prevails in the green belt debate. In Government, the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon and the hon. Member for South Suffolk dealt with the same matters as those on which they speak in Opposition. They have been in Opposition only nine months, but I find amazing their change of mind and the ignorance that they display about the planning process, the way in which English Partnerships operates and the legislation that they put on to the statute book.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The Minister refers to planning policy. As we have seen, the Government are willing to ignore the views of local councils, willing to ignore the views of local communities and willing to override the decisions of independent planning inspectors and panels considering structure plans, so those assurances are not worth much. However, we may have another opportunity to examine those issues elsewhere.
<P>
Is the Minister arguing in his rejection of the amendment that the planning powers in the Bill are no wider than, and cannot be used on any land other than, that which is currently available to English Partnerships?

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> The answer to that is clearly no.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> So it is wider?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> It is exactly what I said: power will be taken from English Partnerships and given to RDAs. Those powers will be exactly the same as those that the previous Government put on the statute book. The Secretary of State will have to return to Parliament for that to be cleared, and those powers will have to conform with urban development plans or local plans. Safeguards are in the system. The previous Administration decided to give those powers to English Partnerships; we are now giving them to RDAs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> So, to be absolutely clear, is the Minister telling us that the Bill does not allow RDAs to exercise planning powers over any areas of land that are not currently available to English Partnerships?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Yes. We are moving English Partnerships into RDAs. Depending on how English Partnerships wanted to exercise its powers--although it would technically be RDAs that exercised those powers, as it was their money--it would be responsible for that urban regeneration. That is a clear remit: it is for that purpose that English Partnerships is being moved into RDAs. That is what it is committed to do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> Perhaps the Minister will clarify that statement in the light of the note that he has just received.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> English Partnerships is developing and can use powers only in urban areas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> And the same restriction will apply to all RDAs?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> We shall return to planning powers later on. English Partnerships' regional sections are now being incorporated into RDAs. It is that area--land use planning--that applies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> In an attempt to justify his rejection of the amendment, the Minister has said that we need not fear that surpluses will suddenly build up in the Treasury because all that the Bill does is transfer the planning powers that are currently exercised by English Partnerships.
<P>
It is not my understanding that that is all that the Bill does. My understanding is that, potentially, the Bill grants planning powers that could be exercised over land that would never be of interest to English Partnerships.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> I should like to ask the Minister to clarify the matter again for me, as I seem to be quite simple about these things. I understood that RDAs were potentially to have planning powers for rural areas that were not currently inside urban regeneration projects and were therefore not subject to English Partnerships' planning permission.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We should not deal with planning at this stage. I remind hon. Members to keep to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The urban development corporations had specific planning powers. English Partnerships must, surely, operate within the framework of local authority planning? I am not sure that we are not chasing a red herring with planning powers associated with English Partnerships. Perhaps the Minister at an appropriate time--to use one of his favourite words--might be able to tell us what English Partnerships' planning powers are. I am not sure that I recognise that phrase in relation to English Partnerships.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I shall return to clarify that point. RDAs will take the powers that English Partnerships was given for urban regeneration. The hon. Member for Taunton is absolutely right that RDAs will have the power that English Partnerships had, even in rural areas. The regional powers that English Partnerships had will be available for the RDAs to deal with urban regeneration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> It seems that the Minister has literally shifted his ground by including rural areas. That implies that the powers being granted are more extensive than in the previous cases that he has mentioned.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I am sorry to be persistent, but urban development corporations can grant themselves planning power. It is specified in their constitutions that power is granted to them, and members of local authorities sit on their boards. However, I am not aware that English Partnerships can grant itself a planning permission, which is what a planning power amounts to and which is our problem in defining planning powers. Will the Minister clarify what we are talking about?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> The rt. hon. Gentleman is confusing the question. We shall reach his point under a later clause. The point raised about English Partnerships concerned the acquisition of land. The English Partnerships powers moved to the regional organisation that will still be charged with urban regeneration. The regional development agencies will be responsible for the whole region, including rural areas, and those powers will be given to the RDAs. We are talking specifically about EP, which is where the misunderstanding probably arises.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> And compulsory purchase orders.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> And CPOs. EP had CPOs in terms of its urban regeneration role. The RDAs will have a wider role for the region. We were asked specifically about EP. I have answered that question.
<P>
The hon. Member for Taunton later asked about the wider role of RDAs. Yes, they will have the powers she mentioned, even in rural areas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> English Partnerships would not exercise compulsory purchase powers unless it already had planning permission. To do so would be a waste of money. It has to get planning permission from the planning authority first.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> That is exactly the point that I made earlier. It would have to conform to the UDP or the local plan. EP was different from the urban development corporations, which had such powers. EP did not. It had to conform with UDPs. There were two safeguards in the system. First, EP had to come to the House to get permission through the Secretary of State. Second, it had to conform with the UDP or the local plan. The hon. Member for South Suffolk is, in his usual mischief-making way, trying to say that these are draconian powers, without checks or balances for local authorities or the democratic system at the House of Commons. That is utterly untrue.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> It seems that the role of the Liberal Democrats is to table helpful amendments that raise extensive debates on all sorts of unexpected matters. To return to surpluses, which are what the amendment was about, regional development agencies are to be business-led, are to have a majority of board members from businesses in the regions and are to be run in a businesslike way. Their purpose we have been told over and again is economic regeneration of the regions. Businesses are generally able to carry funds over from year to year to allow flexibility and to build up funds for large projects. The threat that the Treasury might grab RDA surpluses may discourage sensible long-term planning.
<P>
The Minister said, worryingly, that surpluses could be returned to the Treasury if, for example, a large project was delayed. Throughout our debates we have talked about RDAs working with regional chambers and local interests to build up the local partnerships that the Minister and others desire. I can imagine circumstances in which the Treasury, desperate to save money to put up tax rates or some such thing, will take back the surplus built up by an RDA to distribute it in the next year to others. We would be flying in the face of a locally and regionally agreed large project for which a surplus had been built up. Our debate has made me even more worried that we may discourage private sector finance partnerships with RDAs.
<P>
<B>Mr Caborn:</B> May I clarify this matter? There is no intention to take back every penny. The powers will be used in exceptional circumstances. Indeed, they have been available to English Partnerships and have not been used. The track record is clear.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> That was English Partnerships' track record, not the Government's.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Yes, but equally, where there has been a need to carry over agreed surpluses that conform to reasonable accountancy rules which show a proper use of public funds, they have been carried over. With the agreement of the Treasury, that is what would happen and the mechanisms exist. We are talking not theoretically but practically. Windfalls and money from big schemes could be used for other reasons and for the good of the public purse, but it is difficult to see circumstances in which that would arise. To date, one cannot foresee how that might happen. Proper management of NDPBs would allow surpluses to be carried over, but only if there was agreement and if public funds were being used sensibly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am interested that the Minister has used the argument that because powers relating to English Partnerships have existed in previous legislation that justifies them for RDAs. The origins of English Partnerships could not have been more different. We have been told time and again how RDAs symbolise the Government's determination to decentralise decision making, how they will take account of regional concerns and how they will develop regional characeristics. Yet this centralising measure is hard to reconcile with the claim that RDAs will embody the transfer of power away from the centre.

<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I can only answer that those powers were used sparingly in relation to English Partnerships. We expect that to continue. They were introduced for urban regeneration. We are moving the regional aspect of English Partnerships to RDAs. We believe in the wider context of RDAs. They will be able to deliver better standards of urban regeneration than if they stood on their own. That is what RDAs are all about.
