                           </span> It is a pleasure to
serve under your chairmanship, Mr Rosindell, and to introduce clause 1
of what, I hope, is an uncontroversial Bill. Clause 1 makes two minor,
technical amendments to the Coinage Act 1971, which governs the
striking of coins by the Royal Mint, and includes various standards
with which the coins must comply. Those standards include a
coin’s weight, fineness, composition and dimensions. The Act
also makes provision for permitted variations from those
standards.<a class="bkMark" name="110316106000011">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
drafted, section 1(6) of the Coinage Act requires that the variation
from the standard weight of any coin be measured as the average of a
sample of not more than 1 kg of that coin. That is perfectly fit for
the purpose for which it was originally conceived. The weights of UK
circulating coins range from the 5p coin at 3.25 grams to the £2
coin at 12 grams. When the Coinage Act came into force, a sample of a
kilogram was therefore a perfectly reasonable sample size for the
purposes of measuring the tolerated variation from the standard weight
of coins. However, as with any industry, consumer demand evolves and
expands and, since 1992—some 21 years after the Coinage Act came
into force—international mints have produced 1 kg coins to cater
for the growing collector market. Since then, it has become apparent
that the provision is no longer fit for purpose, which is why we have
introduced the clause to try to change that, so that we can mint 1 kg
coins for the Olympics and other such events as are deemed suitable in
future.<a class="bkMark" name="110316106000012">&#160;</a>

this is an uncontroversial Bill, and I congratulate him on steering it

so on, but I would like to think that when those commemorative coins
are issued they could mark in some way his efforts to introduce the
legislation. Perhaps if there was a series depicting him taking part in

Hon. Members may know that the Royal Mint is located in my great
constituency of Pontypridd, in the town of Llantrisant, where I live.
It employs 850 people, and it has been there since the 1960s. It is a
great symbol of our Great British nation—Welsh coin being
produced for the British realm in Wales. I know that the people in the
Mint will do a great job in supporting the Olympics and striking
another fantastic set of coins, so I thank the hon. Gentleman for
introducing the Bill, and I offer it my fondest
wishes.<a class="bkMark" name="110316106000014">&#160;</a>

there at the time, but I understand that the 1952 coronation proved to
be a landmark occasion not just in its own right but as a significant
event that took us out of the doldrums in the wintry aftermath of the
second world war. It was a sign that Britain was indeed moving forward.
I suspect that the 2012 London Olympics will do the same, given the
economic climate that we face. It is right that in addition to hosting
the wonderful games we should mark them with the striking of a
commemorative coin. I underline my congratulations to my hon. Friend on
bringing the measure to the attention of the

far. It is extremely important, and I have no problems with it

The Bill itself does not say that it applies to the Olympic games,
although that is the reason for its introduction, as the explanatory
notes make clear.<a class="bkMark" name="110316106000017">&#160;</a>

simple question for the hon. Gentleman. This is a good thing to do.
Will the Bill facilitate, for example, the minting of a kilogram
coin—for example, to commemorate the 2014 Commonwealth games? It
would be the right sort of thing to do if it were deemed necessary. I
understand that it will be a revenue spinner as well, which is always a
good thing. It strikes me that the general nature of the provisions
would certainly allow such a coin to be minted, and I would be grateful
for confirmation that that is the case.<a class="bkMark" name="110316106000018">&#160;</a>

Rosindell. I add my voice in congratulating my hon. Friend the Member
for Milton Keynes North on steering the Bill through the Commons.

                           </div>The Government, too, support the Bill. The Royal Mint is a cornerstone
of British manufacturing industry. As we have heard, it plays a vital
role not just in Llantrisant, where it is based, in creating employment
but in everyone’s everyday life in the UK. Besides producing our
own circulating coin, it is the world’s leading export mint, and
has a thriving commemorative coin business. Last week, the Royal Mint
unveiled the commemorative coin for the royal wedding—just one
of numerous events of historical and cultural importance that have
been, and will continue to be, commemorated by the Royal Mint in that
long-standing and enduring tradition.<a class="bkMark" name="110316106000019">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">By removing
a technical, legal obstacle, the clause offers freedom and flexibility
to the Royal Mint, as we have heard, to join its international
counterparts in offering exciting and innovative coins to commemorate
significant events. As we have heard, one of the first will be the
London Olympics next year. I welcome the amendments to the Coinage Act
made by the clause, and reiterate the Government’s support for
the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="110316106000020">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank hon. Members for their contributions to
the debate, especially the Minister and the hon. Member for Bristol
East. I must tell the hon. Lady that while I would welcome the
opportunity to participate in many Olympic sports, having spent Sunday
doing my combat fitness test for the Army—8 miles carrying 25
kilos—I do not intend to do any more exercise for a long time
while my body recovers.<a class="bkMark" name="110316106000021">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I thank my
hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth East for his supportive words
and, of course, the hon. Member for Pontypridd, who is doing a sterling
job—forgive the pun again—in supporting the Royal Mint.
It was clear that people thought highly of him when we visited, and I
know that he will continue to support that institution, so I offer him
my congratulations. The only substantive question to arise in the
debate was asked by the hon. Member for Dundee East. The short
answer

                           </div>is yes, but technically that would be a matter for Her Majesty and the
Chancellor. However, the measure would certainly open the way for
further such coins.<a class="bkMark" name="110316106000022">&#160;</a>
