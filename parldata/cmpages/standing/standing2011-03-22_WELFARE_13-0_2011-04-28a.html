different question about whether disregards will be additive? I remind
him that the evidence from the Disability Benefits Consortium suggests
that it is concerned that the disregards may not be additive. As we

are not additive as a financial support—the

want to address several other points. The hon. Member for Stretford and
Urmston asked about the analysis of levels of in-work child poverty in
couple households as a result of the proposed changes. We expect child
poverty to fall by as many as 350,000 children on a steady basis as a
result of the entitlement changes and increased take-up. On top of
that, we believe that there will be the dynamic effect of encouraging
people not only to move into work, but also to take on more work by
removing the cliff-edge points that exist within the current
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000032">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I was just coming to that, and we have
undertaken an analysis of it, which shows that the vast majority of
families with children who move out of poverty as a result of the
reforms are in-work families and not families where no one is in work.
That is unsurprising given that the impact assessment makes it clear
that couples are one of the main groups that gain from universal credit
and given the overall progressive impact of the reforms on people in
work. Since the analysis is static, there are clearly additional
potential benefits to be gained from dynamic
effects.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000034">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
shadow Minister also asked about second earners and the impact of the
reforms on them. The hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston raised the
question of whether the reforms created a financial disincentive that
may discourage women from participation in the labour market and asked
what mitigating steps the Government proposed to take. Both those
questions start from the position that our proposals would
substantially reduce the financial incentive for second earners to take
a job. In making that argument, the right hon. Member for East Ham
compared the position of a family on working tax credit now with the
same family on universal credit. That misses the reality of the current
system, in which a family can be receiving several different benefits.
Although we accept that many families with second earners may have
higher earnings, and therefore be less likely to face simultaneous
tapers, universal credit, which of course includes support for housing
costs, can actually increase the work incentives for second earners in
low-income families. The marginal deduction rate for a second earner in
a family that is currently receiving tax credits, housing benefit and
council

                           </div>tax benefit can be as high as 95.8%, which is substantially higher than
our proposed 65% taper, so there are
beneficiaries.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000035">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
other point that I make to the right hon. Gentleman is that the
position of the second earner is no different from that of a single
person. We are not providing two disregards, but we do not believe that
that disadvantages the second earner when compared with a single
person.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000036">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Of course, we have to finalise the detail of the
devolution of council tax benefit. In the analysis we have done in the
Department, looking at likely impacts, one of the things we are
ensuring is that we do not create a major disincentive as a result of
the council tax benefit changes. We are working on that detail; we are
pretty confident we can deliver that and we are providing more details
in due course. We do not believe that universal credit will, through
the devolution of council tax benefit, create the kind of disincentives
about which the hon. Lady for Glasgow East is concerned. However, the
95.8% that I have just cited relates to the current system, as opposed
to the system that we will
introduce.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000038">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
the impact assessment, we made it clear that we accept that the
marginal deduction rates will increase for some second earners. But the
impact assessment also makes it clear that the universal credit has
very little overall effect on the participation tax rate for second
earners. That means that the incentive for second earners to start a
job will be broadly the same under our proposed reforms as under the
current system. The key point is that the universal credit increases
the options open to families to strike the right work-life balance for
their own circumstances. In the current out-of-work benefit system,
there are no additional disregards for second earners; similarly,
working tax credit makes no additional provision for second earners. It
is true that members of a couple may qualify for disability elements of
working of tax credits if both are working and disabled, but equally,
when the disabled person is not in work, no disability element can be
paid and working tax credit may not be payable at
all.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000039">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady for Glasgow East asked several questions about the disability
disregard in universal credit. It is important in responding to those
points to understand that our proposed earnings disregard represents a
substantial increase in the support available to many people on low
incomes. In the current system of out-of-work benefits, the standard
earnings disregard is only £20 a week, with benefit withdrawn
pound for pound by any income in excess of that amount. A lone parent
who is also disabled will receive only one disregard. It is, of course,
true that some people on employment and support allowance may be able
to benefit from the permitted work rule—which, as she knows,
allows for a disregard of up to £95 a week—but that
provision is available only for one year, after which the disregard
returns to £20 for most claimants. We have proposed in the White
Paper that a disabled person should have a disregard of 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 542<a class="bkMark" name="Column542">&#160;</a>
                           </div>up to £7,000 a year, equivalent to more than £134 a week.
The taper would apply only to earnings that exceeded that
amount.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000040">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For
someone with net earnings of £200 a week, that would result in a
reduction of only £42.50 in a claimant’s universal credit
entitlement. To put it another way, a claimant in this position would
potentially be £157.50 a week better off in work than a claimant
who is not working. Even with the disregard floor of £40 a week,
a disabled claimant earning £200 a week would be £96 a
week better off than someone who was not working. Overall, that is a
sensible approach, and we think that it is beneficial to those with
disabilities.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000041">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady asked about the impact of changes to disability benefits on
the disregard to universal credit. Since access to the disregard will
be based on the work capability assessment, not on entitlement to other
benefits—just as the disability test in working tax credits is
not based on entitlement to other benefits—disregards are not
affected by the abolition of DLA and the creation of
PIP.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000042">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
she asked about how we will implement the disability disregard and
whether there will be consultation. We have made it clear that we need
to undertake further work as part of the implementation of universal
credit to develop a process that accurately identifies individuals with
enduring health conditions that limit their ability to provide for
themselves fully through work. There will certainly be an opportunity
to work with external stakeholders to do this. It is not exactly the
same as the work capability assessment, because we are looking at
people in work as opposed to those who have the potential to return to
work. However, there are clearly intellectual roots that can be used to
build the foundations of an approach to assess that particular group of
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000043">&#160;</a>

                           </div>The general picture, as far as I can see, is that

significantly lower than is currently the

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Dover asked me a question on Tuesday about the costs of
a second earner disregard. I want to tell him, on the record, about the
Minister’s answer of 28 February to my question on that point.
The cost of the second earner disregard would depend on how much that
disregard was. If the second earner disregard was £500, the cost
to the Exchequer would be £130 million; if £1,000, the
cost would be £280 million; if £1,500, the cost would be
£430 million; if £2,000, the cost would be £600
million; if £2,500, the cost would be £780
million—which was about the level that he mentioned in his
contribution—and if the disregard was £3,000, the cost
would be £970
million.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000049">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
costs to the Exchequer, therefore, could be substantial if we
introduced a second earner disregard at the level we expect for the
first earner disregard—we do not yet know exactly what that will
be, either. However, it would be possible to introduce a modest but
helpful disregard for a cost that would not be prohibitive, given the
advantages of having such a disregard in the
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000050">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
also want to comment on an intervention by the hon. Member for West
Worcestershire when my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow East was
speaking on Tuesday. She rightly drew attention to the fact that not
having a second earner disregard introduces a significant new couples
penalty. For example, the first earner in a couple has a significant
disregard—we do not know what it will be, but it might be worth
£3,000, or more with children in the family, and more still with
disability in the family. The second owner gets no disregard at all.
However, if the couple were to split, both members could get a
disregard.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000051">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                           </strong> It is important to understand that we do not
believe that the position of a second earner is any different from that
of a single person. Of course, if a couple broke up, both members would
not have access to the child element, for example—our benefits
system recognises one carer rather than both, unless they are living
together. I am not sure, therefore, that the issue to which the right
hon. Gentleman refers will genuinely arise. Thinking logically, our
focus, as he knows, has been on the first earner in the household and
on lifting households out of poverty—that is a conscious policy
decision. We believe that such an approach allows households to balance
their situation depending on their
circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000052">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am not sure that I completely follow that. Let us
consider the example of a couple with three children: if they split up
and one child went with one of the parents and two with the other,
presumably both parents in their separate households would have access
to the full lone parent disregard. That would be a substantially more
generous arrangement than if they were living together and only one
couple disregard were
available.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000053">&#160;</a>

against couples penalties, yet now it is inventing a new

Gentleman that one of the biggest penalties for working couples with
children is child care. One of the biggest reforms that needs to
happen—I hope it will—is that the number of child care
places, which has been static at 1.3 million since 2003, is increased
and more affordable, and that the number of child minders, which has
fallen massively since 1996, is also increased. That would make child
care more easily available and more doable for hard-pressed
parents.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000057">&#160;</a>

report set out some positive ways forward, including increasing the
amount of child care—something we

progress in reducing child poverty in the early years of the previous

week now, we are due a further update on the child poverty statistics.
My expectation is that they will show that at the end of the term of
the previous Government, because of decisions in the 2009 Budget, there
will have been a further significant fall in child poverty. We look
forward to seeing what those figures show. None the less, there
certainly was a period towards the end of the previous Government when
there was a relatively modest rise after a dramatic
fall.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000066">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Amendment 116 relates to schedule 2.
Together with new clause 2, it would insert in the Bill an alternative
arrangement for the recovery of overpayments from the one set out in
clause 102. The current rules on the recoverability of overpayments,
which apply to most benefits, and I think to all benefits that have
been the responsibility of the DWP, provide for recovery when
overpayments have arisen because of misrepresentation or failure to
disclose a material fact by a claimant or by any other
person.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000076">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That is a
fair test; it has been in place for many years and has been tried and
tested in case law. Its purpose is to allow recovery of an overpayment
that has arisen as a result of the claimant’s actions or
failures, whether those are innocent or fraudulent in intent. The test
protects the claimant in cases when the overpayment arose because of
official error on the part of the authorities; in other words, it
sanctions recovery in the case of negligence by the claimant but offers
protection in  the case of negligence by the state. That
reflects the responsibilities of claimants to notify correctly their 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 547<a class="bkMark" name="Column547">&#160;</a>
                           </div>circumstances when claiming benefit, and of the benefit authorities to
calculate and pay awards correctly based on the information that is
available to
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000077">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
102 proposes to allow recovery in all cases regardless of culpability.
The Committee will recognise that that is a very significant alteration
in the balance of responsibilities in favour of the state to the
detriment of benefit recipients. For example, it will mean that a
claimant could be presented with a large bill for repayment amounting
to many thousands of pounds many years after the overpayment occurred,
even though the overpayment was entirely due to error on the part of
the benefit authority. Is there not a very strong argument that in
return for providing accurate and up-to-date information, a claimant is
entitled to the accurate calculation and payment of entitlement by the
benefit authorities, and that the state ought to bear losses caused by
its own
negligence?<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000078">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government appear to have recognised the justice of such a settlement
by indicating in a code of practice on recovery that they will provide
for non-recovery in cases of official error. If that is the intention,
and I hope that the Minister will be able to confirm that it is, surely
that provision ought to be statutory, so that an aggrieved claimant has
a right of appeal against recovery to an independent tribunal. The
Government have pressed the view that the introduction of universal
credit will reduce significantly the scope for official error, and I
hope that proves to be the case. However, if the Government believe
that, surely they should extend the statutory safeguard that benefit
claimants have at the moment in law and not abandon them, as the Bill
proposes. If it is the case that official error will be sharply
reduced, why are the Government withdrawing the protection in statute
that benefit recipients have at the
moment?<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000079">&#160;</a>

tax credit system has a great many virtues, but even its biggest fans,
among whom I number myself, would not claim that its handling of
overpayments was one of its most successful features. The Committee
needs to be aware that the system of automatic recoverability being
proposed by clause 102 is precisely the system that applies today to
tax credits. In other words, while many of the very valuable features
of the tax credit system are being abandoned for universal credit, its
encouragement for saving, for example, and its support for
self-employment, which we discussed on Tuesday, the part of the tax
credit system that has been the most problematic is being imported
wholesale into universal
credit.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000080">&#160;</a>

imagine that the Minister will tell us in a moment that real-time PAYE
data will solve that problem and that there will not be overpayments in
future because of the approach that is being taken. In theory, that is
correct. I support the approach that is being taken with the use of
real-time PAYE data, but that will require the IT to work flawlessly
every time and from day one. As we shall discuss on an amendment later
this morning, I do not share the Government’s optimism that that
will in practice be the case. For now, suffice it to say that the most
problematic feature of the tax credit system is being adopted wholesale

                           </strong> My hon. Friend makes a good point. She is right.
Indeed, there will be other changes of circumstances that will not be
picked up by the real-time PAYE system, and overpayments could result.
We have a serious problem. Our proposed new clause 2 provides for the
offset of underlying entitlement when calculating overpayments. That
mirrors an existing provision in the housing and council tax benefit
regulations that ensures that only the true amount of excess
entitlement is recovered. That provision is particularly needed in the
case of universal credit because there is a requirement for the benefit
to be claimed by either a single claimant or by both members of a
couple, and as with tax credits, that results in many notional
overpayments when there is a change of status from single to joint
claims and vice
versa.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000083">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
Financial Secretary to the Treasury before the election, responsible
for HMRC and the tax credit system, I worked with the representative
bodies over a long period, leading to the non-statutory introduction
from January 2010 of the offset of underlying entitlements in tax
credit cases. One or two members of the Committee, wearing different
hats to those that we are wearing now, were involved in those
discussions. I want to press the Minister to confirm that it is also
his intention to provide offset of underlying entitlement in universal
credit on a non-statutory basis, because that, at least, is a very
important back-stop.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000084">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The amendment
will provide for offsetting on a statutory basis, just as there is for
the whole Department for Work and Pensions system—for council
tax benefit, for housing benefit and for the income-related
benefits—and will ensure that the offsetting is applied fairly,
openly and consistently. All of us are familiar with serious problems
that have arisen with overpayment of tax credits, but there could be a
much bigger problem with universal credit because the whole of
people’s support—support for their housing and council
tax, as well as their child care and in-work support—will be in
a single figure. The amount of money will potentially be a good deal
larger. Overpayments, should they arise, are likely to be larger,
too.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000085">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Currently,
there are two approaches to dealing with overpayments. The first is
used in the benefits system and works well for claimants. The other is
used for tax credits and, to put it generously, has worked less well.
The Bill introduces the tax credit method for dealing with overpayments
of universal credit. That method now applies to the entire system, not
just to the tax credit system. It is something of a mystery, to me at
least, why the Government, who understandably miss no opportunity to
criticise the way that overpayments for tax credits were dealt with,
are importing precisely that system into the legislation for universal
credit. I would have thought that they would at least have listened to
their own rhetoric, but apparently not. It seems a recipe for serious
trouble. We are once again providing the Government with an opportunity
to avert the consequences of their errors, and I hope that the Minister
will take that opportunity by expressing an interest in, and perhaps
even support for, the amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000086">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Let me take the two items in reverse order. We
basically agree with the right hon. Gentleman on new clause 2. We
intend to make that provision, but we will simply introduce regulations
under clause 102 to do so. We do not intend people to be unable to
receive the benefit that they would have received anyway. Where there
has been an overpayment or error, or where something has gone wrong in
the system, clearly people should be able to receive their original
entitlement. We intend to include such a provision in the regulations.
I assure him that we do not intend to change the system that has been
in place until now. I hope that gives him the reassurance that he wants
on that
front.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000087">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Where
we differ is on amendment 116. The point that the right hon. Gentleman
misses is that his amendment would put into statute a provision that
states that people are not liable to make a repayment in the case of
error. I would remind him of the admirable recent case of an employee
in the west country who, rather to his surprise, received from his
employers a sum in excess of £1 million in his
monthly pay packet. He immediately went back to his employers and said,
“I’m not sure you’ve got this right.” He
got into the papers as a result—he was employee of the
month—and gave the money back immediately, which is all very
laudable. Are we actually saying that, in the unlikely event of the
Department for Work and Pensions paying £1 million into
somebody’s bank account by mistake one month instead of the
£67 standard amount of jobseeker’s allowance
or universal credit, that amount should not be recoverable? Nobody
would seriously think
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000088">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is important to say that we intend to take a grown-up approach. We
recognise that errors were made previously, and we certainly do not
intend to recover all money in all circumstances—that lesson has
been well learned from the mistakes in the tax credit system—but
I am not convinced that it is sensible to have a provision that goes to
the other
extreme.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000089">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister describes amendment 116 as
going to the other extreme, but I refer him to its wording. At the end
of a list that includes “child benefit” in paragraph (f),
it would add paragraph (g), “universal credit”. It simply
states that the arrangement for universal credit should be the same as
the arrangement that currently applies to all other benefits, such as
child benefit. Surely that is not an extreme
suggestion.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000090">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The problem with the right hon.
Gentleman’s amendment is that it would make overpaid universal
credit recoverable only in instances where the overpayment has arisen
due to a misrepresentation or failure to disclose by the claimant or a
third party. Universal credit is replacing our existing benefit system,
and we have put in place a new overpayment recovery test, which is set
out in clause 102. Overpayments of universal credit will be recoverable
whether or not there has been a misrepresentation or failure to
disclose by the claimant. That will include overpayments that result
from official error. Alongside that, however, the Department naturally
has to take responsibility for its mistakes. The reality is that if we
make a mistake, it does not automatically give people the right to keep
taxpayers’ money to which they are not entitled. There will, of
course, be cases in which we use our discretion, where we have got it
wrong and somebody, through no fault of their own, has got 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>themselves into the kind of precarious position that we have sometimes
seen through the tax credit system. We think that our emphasis is the
right one, however.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000091">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The new test
will also apply to the recovery of overpaid jobseeker’s
allowance and employment and support allowance. All other DWP benefits
such as disability living allowance, or non-working-age benefits such
as pension credit, will remain, as now, only where there has been a
misrepresentation or a failure to disclose. For universal credit, which
will be a substantial sum at the heart of our benefits system in the
future, we do not want to accept a statutory provision that prevents us
from recovering money where a visible and noticeable overpayment has
been made—where, frankly, somebody should have noticed the extra
money coming into their bank account. That would not be the right thing
to do, which is why I cannot accept the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000092">&#160;</a>

persuaded, however, by the argument that he has just put to us. He
described my suggestion as extreme, although I am simply suggesting
that the arrangement that currently applies to the benefits system
ought to apply to universal credit as well. He spoke as though there
was something rather ludicrous about that, but we are talking about the
position that has always applied to benefits such as jobseeker’s
allowance, income support and child benefit. I am disappointed that the
Minister is unable to give us the assurance that the existing practice
in the benefits system will apply to universal credit. He is simply

                        <p>Are
we to understand that the views received were that, far from being an
offer, it should be a pretty draconian restriction on the availability
of pension credit? Secondly, why did they not announce the major change
properly, rather than just slipping it into schedule 2? Thirdly, how
much do the Government expect to save by removing support from
pensioners in this way? Fourthly, will there be transitional protection
so that a person receiving pension credit now whose spouse is below
pensionable age can continue to receive it, or will they lose it under
this measure? Fifthly, how does he justify discriminating against
pensioners on the basis of their spouse’s
age?<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000105">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
seems curious to propose that, for people in otherwise identical
circumstances, one will receive pension credit because their spouse is
above pensionable age, but someone else, whose spouse happens to be
below pensionable age, will not. Is the Minister confident that it is
legal to proceed in this way? The Government have told us that they
oppose age discrimination, so they are removing employers’
ability to compel people to retire when they reach state pension age. I
sympathise with that; it is a good proposal. However, they are
proposing that the pensions system should discriminate against people
on the basis not of their age, but of their spouse’s age. That
strikes me as a very peculiar arrangement, which is likely to be liable
to
challenge.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000106">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Lastly,
returning to the point that the hon. Member for West Worcestershire
made on Tuesday, is this not yet another new couples penalty, when
everybody understood that the Government were against couples
penalties? It is a peculiar form of couples penalty whereby somebody of
pensionable age and in a couple will not get support because their
spouse happens to be below pensionable age. If they did not have a
spouse, or were living separately from them, they would receive pension
credit. It is a very rum provision across which to stumble, and I am
eager to hear the Minister’s answers to those seven
questions.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000107">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> As the right hon. Gentleman said, the amendment
seeks to remove the restriction on eligibility for pension credit for
couples where one member is below and the other above the pension
credit qualifying age. As a result of the amendment, couples in this
position would continue to have access to the pension credit. I think
it would help if I explained to the Committee why we are taking the
powers in schedule 2, and why we think they are
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000108">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Paragraph
64 of schedule 2 requires both members of a couple to reach the
qualifying age for pension credit before they can claim it. As a
result, couples with one member below and one member over the pension
credit qualifying age will be required to claim universal credit until
and unless they reach that age, if they need support through the
benefits system.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000109">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Why are we
doing this? The Government think that it is an important principle
that, in return for receiving support from the state, working age
people should look or prepare for work. The flaw in the current system
is that it allows someone of working age—who as a single person
would be required actively to seek work to receive state
support—to avoid looking for work simply because their partner
is above the pension credit qualifying age. We do not think that that
is right or
fair.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000110">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
pension credit is a means-tested extra support payment for people on
the lowest incomes to enable them to top up their income. If there is a
couple in a household, one of whom is still of working age, and we are
paying that means-tested payment, but the person of working age is not
required to work, that does not stack up. Why should we not say to the
person of working age, “Your household is on a low income, you
need more money, get a job,” rather than, “Here is an
extra means-tested payment from the state without the obligation to
look for a job”? This is a sensible change that puts an
appropriate balance into the system. Benefit claimants of working age
should be working when they can. Universal credit will provide the
support that is needed to help people into work. It will also provide
support, where appropriate, to people who are in work, but—this
takes on one of the key questions raised by the right hon.
Gentleman—we recognise that it is important not to undermine the
stability and outcomes for existing pension credit customers. The
change, therefore, will apply only to new claims, not to couples who
are already entitled to pension credit. I reassure the Committee that
work-related requirements will be imposed only on the working-age
partner.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000111">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">This
is not a saving measure as such. We have not calculated a saving out of
it, so we have not produced a number that is now scored somewhere to
say that it will be a consequence of this extra measure. This is simply
a common-sense step. It does not seem right for the state to say,
“We will provide you with some money to top up your household
income, because you are on a very low income,” while at the same
time saying that that it is fine for somebody who is of working age not
to be looking for a job in such a
situation.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000112">&#160;</a>

the older person, they will receive support through other benefits via
the system’s existing caring provisions. That financial support
would arrive via a different route. It may be, in such a situation,
that the couple would be better off through the universal credit system
than through pension credit, which, after all, is not a substantial
amount of
money.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000114">&#160;</a>

level of pension credit will be higher than that of universal credit in
the situation to which the hon. Member for Aberconwy has rightly drawn
attention. He raises an important point that requires further
reflection. It sounds to me as though people involved in caring will,
potentially, be significantly worse off under this provision than they
would if pension credit were available.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000115">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I do not think that that is necessarily the
case. Universal credit offers a variety of support to people with

issue is not at all the same as the question about whether universal
credit should apply beyond the age of 65 if people continue in work.
That is an entirely separate question. This is simply about addressing
a potential anomaly in the system, whereby the household of somebody
who is of working age but chooses not to work can still receive state,
means-tested support without any obligation to try to replace that
support by getting a job. The provision is entirely reasonable and
sensible, and I hope that the Committee will support
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000117">&#160;</a>

the case. It is a significant change that should have been properly
announced in the ordinary way. It should not have just appeared,
without anyone mentioning it, in a schedule to the Bill. Moreover, the
Minister has not even begun to answer the central question: how do we
justify discriminating against pensioners on the basis of the age of
their spouses? How can it be right that, everything else being equal,
somebody who is 67 can get pension credit if their spouse is 59 and a
half, not 60? A peculiar new element is being introduced into the
system and he has not started to give us a justification for it. I ask

intend to give a detailed explanation of all of them, but they arise
from two changes that have taken place. First, they follow from the
result of the Welsh referendum, which will lead to changes in the
legislative framework of the Welsh Assembly. As a result, several
technical changes must be made to the Bill and related measures to fit
in with that new legislative framework. Secondly, they relate to
Scotland, because the commencement of part 2 of the Interpretation and
Legislative Reform (Scotland) Act 2010 has an impact on several Bills
and Acts, including the Welfare Reform Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000151">&#160;</a>

amendments are purely technical and do not change Welsh or Scottish
Ministers’ ability to make provisions under clauses 33 and 89,
in relation to universal credit and the personal independence payments
for matters where they have competence. They simply reflect the updated
position. I hope that that explanation is sufficient for the Committee
to accept the amendments without further
ado.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000152">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I want to ask a few questions specifically about
subsection (1)(e), which relates to the abolition of council tax
benefit. We are in a slightly odd position in that we are legislating
for the abolition of council tax benefit, but not for its replacement.
There is quite a lot of uncertainty about the form of that replacement
and when it will be provided. We know that every local authority will,
we think, be free to set its own council tax benefit system on a basis
that may be entirely unconstrained.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000158">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">When will the
abolition of council tax benefit take effect? It may be that by
studying the Bill sufficiently carefully I could answer that question
myself. Will the new arrangements, whereby every local authority has
its own council tax benefit system, affect new applicants from October
2013, as with the rest of universal credit? As the Bill does not
legislate for a local authority council tax benefit scheme,
when will the Government legislate for that? Will
there be an announcement about any constraints or obligations that
might be placed on local authorities in bringing forward their own
council tax benefit schemes? Will the Minister confirm, as the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 556<a class="bkMark" name="Column556">&#160;</a>
                           </div>Local Government Association told us in its evidence to the Committee,
that local authorities will be provided with real-time PAYE data to
calculate the council tax benefit due to each applicant? Finally, does
the Minister expect every local authority in the country to process
council tax benefit applications under the new localised scheme by
October 2013?<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000159">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">This is an
important matter in its own right, but it also has important knock-on
consequences for the roll-out of universal credit. Universal credit
will have to relate to the new council tax benefit arrangements, and
when we come to discuss the IT needed to support universal credit, we
will need to consider that issue. I would be grateful if the Minister
would provide answers to those questions about what the Government have
in mind as a replacement for the council tax benefit that is abolished
by the clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000160">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Let me try to reassure the right hon. Gentleman
on one or two of those points. The Bill provides for the abolition of
council tax benefit, but that abolition will not come into place until
and unless a replacement is established. It is not our intention to
have a gap in provision for people who are in need of support to pay
their council tax. We are working towards the date of 2013, and it is
our intention to introduce the new localised arrangements across the
country in that year. As the right hon. Gentleman knows, we are in
active discussions with local authorities and their representatives in
England, and with the relevant authorities and bodies in Scotland and
Wales. We intend to provide further details to the House and to hon.
Members at the earliest opportunity, and I expect us to be able to
provide updates on our progress as the legislation proceeds through
Parliament.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000161">&#160;</a>

essential. We are working towards the date of 2013. First and foremost,
we are putting in place an alternative scheme, and our intention is
that it will start at the same time, although we could take a different
approach if circumstances were different. Our aim is to bring all the
reforms together at the same time. We are working with the Department
for Communities and Local Government on the scheme’s design, and
will bring further measures to the House in due course. I cannot give
an exact time frame for
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000163">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Whether
local authorities have access to real-time data will depend on the
arrangements for calculating and paying council tax benefit. Again,
those are part of the details of the replacement measures. We are not
ruling that out, but it may not be necessary, and will depend on the
details of the arrangements that are put in place. I freely accept that
this element of the reforms is work in progress. I
shall be happy to provide further information to the Committee, and to
Opposition Front Benchers, when it becomes
available. I will also provide further information to both Houses as
the Bill progresses through the House of Lords. We will provide
information

                           </div>to Parliament on progress thereafter. Clearly, more detailed measures
will have to be brought before the House in due course, but it is not
our intention to abolish council tax benefit, and the measure does not
and will not do so before the successor arrangements are in place. I
think I have covered the points raised by the right hon.

                           </strong> I certainly was not suggesting that the Government
would leave people with no help with their council tax for a period,
but there is a technical point that I do not understand, and I hope
that the Minister can give me an explanation. He is opening up the
possibility, at least, that council tax benefit will continue longer
than the rest of the benefits listed in clause 34(1). We know that for
new applicants, income-based jobseeker’s allowance,
income-related employment and support allowance and so on will go from
the beginning of October 2013, but he is introducing the possibility
that, depending on how things pan out over the next year or two, the
existing council tax benefit scheme will need to continue a bit longer
until it is possible to put the new localised schemes in place. Given
the complex ways in which the Bill allows different provisions to come
into effect, the introduction of the measure in subsection (1)(e) could
take place on a different date from the abolition of the other
benefits. It is a slightly arcane point, but it is important for us to
understand it. The Bill is structured in such a way that abolition of
council tax benefit could take place at a different time from abolition
of the other benefits in the
list.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000165">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The answer is that it is possible to have a
different start date for the different elements in clause 34, and that
is provided for in clause 136(3). Clearly, our goal is to introduce all
the reforms at the same time, because that is logical, but we have
given ourselves flexibility to get them right. That is important in the
design of the localised scheme. We strongly believe in the localisation
agenda, and we are taking the right approach, but we want to ensure
that we have the flexibility to get it right, and we have allowed for
that in the Bill. I hope that that reassures the right hon.

hope that this provides an opportunity for the Minister to offer us
reassurance on an issue relating to children being cared for by carers
or parents who are in receipt of state pension credit. As we heard from
the discussion that took place earlier, there would not be a
working-age adult eligible for universal credit in such a household.
Through the amendment, we want to understand how child payments for
people in that situation will be
made.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000179">&#160;</a>

may be talking about parents who are themselves of state pension age.
However, much more frequently, I suspect that we are talking about
grandparents who have taken on the care of children perhaps because of
family breakdown, because the parents are unable to parent effectively,
or as a result of the death of the parents. All parties recognise and
welcome the contribution that grandparents make in taking on those
responsibilities and would want to be able to provide support for
grandparents, other older relatives or friends who step in to provide
care for children in those difficult family
circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000180">&#160;</a>

I hope to table and debate some other amendments on further aspects of
the benefit system that relate to people in that situation. I have
tabled this amendment to give us an opportunity to understand how the
Minister intends to deal with such families. Thankfully, they are not
numerous. Most children continue to grow up with their parents, as we
would all want them to do. However,

and potentially encourage grandparents to feel that they can step in in
those situations. The Opposition very much hope that the Minister will

                           </strong> I am delighted to agree violently with the hon.
Lady. The issue is important. The group of families is small but
important. She is seeking to introduce a new child credit into the
pension credit for the reasons she set
out.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000182">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Let
me be clear: I have every sympathy with what the hon. Lady is saying. I
assure hon. Members that we also believe that pensioners on low incomes
continue to receive support for dependent children. We have already
considered how best to do that. In the universal credit White Paper, we
said that we will provide the support through pension credit, which
will mirror the approach we propose in the universal credit for
working-age
families.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000183">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Clearly,
a household as described by the hon. Lady will either be in receipt of
universal credit and support through that system, or receiving support
through the pension credit and that system. That is the simplest and
most effective way of providing necessary support for that particular
group of families, to ensure that their financial needs are
addressed.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000184">&#160;</a>

do not need to take powers in the Bill but already have the necessary
powers to make the required secondary legislation. I reassure the hon.

whatever of neglecting that group of families. I hope those comments
reassure

fixed the appointed day, the Secretary of State shall publish a report
on access to welfare advice, including advice for those unable to use
the Internet, and shall satisfy himself on the basis of the report that
provision is adequate to support migration to Universal
Credit.’.</p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is a pleasure to see you back in the Chair, Mr Weir. I hope I will not
be disappointing you too much, because my amendment is not technical.
It is a broad and simple amendment, which I hope the Government will
have no difficulty in supporting. It merely requires the Secretary of
State to assure himself that welfare advice and representation will be
adequate, sufficient to enable those in need of advice and
representation—in particular, those with difficulty in accessing
the internet—to draw on it as we undertake the massive
transition process into the universal
credit.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000195">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Opposition agree—I think that we are all agreed—that the
principle of universal credit has important strengths. In the long
term, those will potentially reduce the need for advice and
representation, because the advantages of integration into a single
benefits system will reduce the undoubted confusion and complexity, and
the number of people applying for the wrong benefit. There are
advantages in simplification and in an IT system with real-time
information—we have discussed some of the points this morning.
We have heard assurances from the Minister that take-up will be higher
as a consequence of the simplification. In the long term, that is all
extremely satisfactory and possibly beneficial to the welfare
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11042868000196">&#160;</a>
