lunch, I was concluding the debate on the amendments by pointing out
that the Government&#146;s desire to clamp down on potential tax
leakage through the forestalling arrangements is at risk of masking
some of the people who will fall victim to the hard edges of the
scheme. The Government should think about the individuals who may be
affected by the measure, in particular those who will fall foul of the
&#163;150,000 earnings barrier. Having said that, the Minister has
made some important points about the cost of some the changes proposed
in the amendments. As I have said before, the main show in town is the
next group of amendments, and I am anxious to speak to them. I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000557"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The list of amendments is fairly substantial. It is
not so much an √  la carte or table d&#146;h&#244;te menu as
a buffet.</div>
<a name="09061867000065"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061867000558"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jeremy Browne</b> (Taunton) (LD):
Sm√∂rg√•sbord.</div><a name="09061867000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000559"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I was going to use that word, but my hon. Friend
the Member for Hammersmith and Fulham has the monopoly in our ranks on
the correct pronunciation of foreign words. I am sure that he will find
the opportunity at some point before the end of the proceedings to use
the word
sm√∂rg√•sbord.</div><a name="09061867000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments are all, in different ways, designed to address the issue of
the pattern of contributions that people make towards their pension
schemes, which I have touched upon in earlier discussions. I am
concerned that the schedule as drafted refers to regular contributions
in the context of &#147;quarterly or more frequent&#148; payments
into a pension scheme.</div>
<a name="09061867000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of groups of
individuals, by nature of their employment or the profitability of
their business, are not in a position to make a regular payment to a
pension scheme. A curious situation may arise where somebody who makes
pension payments of &#163;100,000 in quarterly instalments throughout
the year will get full relief under the anti-forestalling provisions,
but somebody whose pension contributions are not that regular will only
get full relief for &#163;20,000. We need to think carefully about
whether we are penalising people who are self-employed, who are
partners in businesses, or who run small businesses, and who may lose
out as a
consequence.</div><a name="09061867000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand what the Government are trying to achieve: they do not want
people to use the interregnum between now and the introduction of the
cap on the higher rate relief in 2011 to make huge annual contributions
within the level of the lifetime allowance. That is why I suggested
reducing the level of the allowance during the stand part debate on
clause 71. However, some people will be caught out as a consequence of
the rules, because they do not make a regular pattern of contributions,
and this is a serious matter for them. We need to find a way to meet
their concerns, while recognising the point the Minister has made and
will make again that some people will seek to use the flexibility over
the next two years to reduce their tax
bills.</div><a name="09061867000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
amendment buffet contains various groups that represent different
approaches to the same issue. I would be pleased if the Minister chose
from my selection, but I suspect that he will want to return to this
important matter on
Report.</div><a name="09061867000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would affect what is defined in the Bill as a protected
pension input amount, at term that covers existing pension
arrangements. Contributions made under pension arrangements that are
already in place should be able to continue up to the current levels of
relief until the new regime is introduced in 2011. Our problem is with
the design of the measures.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column469" />Column number: 469</div><a name="09061867000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provisions
that determine what will count as a protected input amount are drawn
quite narrowly. The wording adopted throughout paragraphs 7 to 13
refers to contributions that are
made</div><a name="09061867000480"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;on
a quarterly or more frequent
basis&#148;.</div><a name="09061867000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
means that anyone who has had an arrangement to make graded
contributions on an annual basis will be subject to a reduction in tax
relief. As I said before, that could apply to the self-employed, those
who own small businesses, or partners in lawyers&#146; or
accountants&#146;
firms.</div><a name="09061867000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
number of my hon. Friends have been in those circumstances. My hon.
Friends the Members for Henley and for Poole have both been involved in
businesses in which pension contributions have been managed in such a
way. They will know how difficult it can be to predict their profits or
share of earnings and therefore their pension contributions. Those
amounts differ from year to year, depending on how successful the
business is and the investment decisions that are made; as a result,
their total contributions would vary from year to year. Also, they
might have paid their contributions to different institutions from year
to year, because one pension provider was better than another. That
would have an impact under the rules. Under the provisions in the
schedule, such people will lose the additional tax relief on any
contribution in excess of
&#163;20,000.</div><a name="09061867000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Association of British Insurers submission to the House of Lords
Economic Affairs Committee&#146;s sub-committee on the Finance Bill
gave the example of an individual seeking to wind up his affairs to
fund his retirement. The individual received a salary of
&#163;150,000 in 2008, but he received a reduced salary of
&#163;70,000 in 2009 because business had been affected by the
economic downturn. He sold the business for &#163;250,000 in
2009&#151;probably less than he would have got for it
before&#151;but then paid &#163;200,000 into his pension. Even
though the individual has suffered a reduction in his earnings and has
been forced to sell his business, he will not be able to gain full
relief for his contributions, because his salary exceeded
&#163;150,000 in the previous
year.</div><a name="09061867000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister recognises this problem, as his remarks in the previous debate
demonstrated. His written statement on Budget day
stated:</div><a name="09061867000481"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government recognise that those with less regular contribution patterns
may be affected and would welcome views on whether there are ways of
ensuring the contributions of this group are protected in the same way
as those making more regular patterns&#148;.&#151;[<i class="I">Official
Report</i>, 22 April 2009; Vol. 491, c.
16WS.]</div><a name="09061867000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
number of proposals have emerged from our discussions with interested
parties, and they are reflected in the group of amendments. Some of the
amendments are mutually exclusive, but we have tried to give a feel for
the types of approach the Government may wish to
take.</div><a name="09061867000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
228 is probably the most straightforward, but also the most prone to
defective drafting. It would delete paragraphs 7 to 13 and replace them
with a simple regime that encompasses all the various arrangements,
including annual contributions. It refers in particular to
defined-benefit schemes. It represents a crude way of approaching the
problem, but it would move us to an annual basis.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column470" />Column number: 470</div><a name="09061867000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments 190
to 196 change the language on payments in the paragraphs from &#147;a
quarterly&#148; or more frequent to &#147;an annual&#148; or more
frequent. It would prevent small business owners, the self-employed or
those who contribute to their pensions from annual bonuses losing the
tax relief they currently receive.</div>
<a name="09061867000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
182 to 188 take a different approach. They recognise that we cannot
have a free-for-all in the amount of contributions that may be made on
an annual basis, but take into account the history of contributions
made in the previous three years and restrict the protected amount to
the average of the contributions made in those three years. That has
some appeal as it reflects a past pattern of behaviour and recognises
that the contributions individuals make to their pension scheme may
fluctuate according to the performance of their business. It has some
attraction as a way of tackling the issue the Minister outlined, but
without allowing much flexibility or latitude in terms of
increases.</div>
<a name="09061867000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
182 to 187 aim to get the regular contributions requirement right
between self-employed and employed people by making the same provisions
for DB schemes&#146; existing cash balance arrangements and money
purchase arrangements. Paragraph 11 deals with money purchase
arrangements that are not part of occupational and public service
pensions. Most self-employed people will fall into that jurisdiction.
Amendment 188 would ensure that their annual contributions do not
disqualify them from the higher rate
relief.</div><a name="09061867000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
16 introduces the pre-22 April 2009 pension input amount. Any such
amounts do not give rise to a special annual allowance charge, but they
may be deducted in the calculation of adjusted contribution for the tax
year 2009-10. In that case, amendment 197 would allow an average amount
to be calculated that is half the sum of the two highest annual
contributions; or, if only one contribution has been made, half of
that. That is perhaps a more generous amendment than the one that
averages contributions over the past three years, but it too seeks to
provide
flexibility.</div><a name="09061867000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is an important group of amendments addressing an issue the Financial
Secretary identified. We need to ensure, where possible, that there are
tax arrangements in place that recognise how people lead their lives
and the flexibility that people may have, not through choice but
perhaps through force of circumstances. They are often not able to make
the relevant decisions until the end of the tax year. While the
Minister has focused so far on how to stop avoidance, we should have
regard to those whose pattern of income makes it difficult to make
regular quarterly or more frequent contributions to pension
schemes.</div>
<a name="09061867000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments offer a range of options. I do not expect the Minister to
leap to his feet and say, &#147;I am going to accept amendments x to
y,&#148; because I suspect there are some drafting errors in the
amendments. However, they represent a genuine attempt to introduce
flexibility to the arrangements to reflect the needs of a specific
group of
people.</div><a name="09061867000085"></a>

generally try in Committee not to replicate speeches that have already

earlier speakers.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column471" />Column number: 471</div><a name="09061867000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will depart
slightly from that sensible rule of thumb on this occasion to say that
I am an enthusiast for the constructive approach taken by the hon.
Member for Fareham. He recognises the legitimacy of what the Government
are trying to do&#151;we all recognise that that is a sensible
approach. If one is going down the path of introducing new measures,
some provisional arrangements are needed in the
interim.</div><a name="09061867000502"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div><a name="09061867000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman also makes an entirely sensible point&#151;one that
has been made to me through representations to which I have been
sympathetic and which is reflected in the large group of
amendments&#151;that there are people whose pension contributions are
inevitably haphazard, because that is the nature of their income. That
is most obvious for people who are self-employed, or those whose work
is seasonal or has other fluctuations beyond their control. There is a
danger&#151;more than that: a likelihood&#151;that the measures the
Government have introduced, entirely understandably, will catch people
they are not intended to catch.</div>
<a name="09061867000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope the
Minister will engage seriously with the points made by the hon.
Gentleman, myself and others. If the Treasury is able to find a way of
drafting the legislation so that penalties are not incurred by those
they do not intend to target, that would be appreciated by a large

Howell</b> (Henley) (Con): Welcome to the Chair this
afternoon, Mr. Atkinson.</div>
<a name="09061867000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">In keeping
with my perennial diet, I shall eat only one of the dishes that my hon.
Friend the Member for Fareham has set out so temptingly before us and
that is the dish relating to the self-employed. The Select Committee on
Work and Pensions has recently finished taking public evidence on
pensioner poverty. The questions naturally ranged much more widely than
that subject, although there is quite a strong link between pensioner
poverty and self-employment, which I will come on to in a minute. I
recommend that the Minister visits the website of the Committee and
looks at the evidence that was collected.</div>
<a name="09061867000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
self-employed are a major pensions headache because of how they
approach pensions. The provisions in the clause and in the schedule do
not recognise that behaviour. There is no equivalent now, and none is
proposed, for automatic enrolment in pensions for the self-employed. We
are unusual in that compared with countries such as Canada, for
example, with the result that the self-employed have a strong tendency
to procrastinate in dealing with their pensions. That builds up a
problem for later, when they tend to rely on selling their business or
their house, in a time of recession. It also leads to considerable
irregularity of payment, which has already been mentioned. Even for
people who regularly earn more than &#163;50,000, for many
self-employed people that amount comes in in a very irregular fashion
and the main reason for not saving is that they cannot afford to do so.
One of the big factors in deciding whether they can afford to do so is
directly relevant to the schedule: how much they get back. Getting back
what is put in is not enough. In the words of the Pensions Policy
Institute, they need to</div>
<a name="09061867000482"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;see the
advantage of the tax relief&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column472" />Column number: 472</div><a name="09061867000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">in order to make that
calculation. We touched on that this morning when my hon. Friend went
through some of the calculations involved.</div>
<a name="09061867000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perversely,
the recent reduction of values as a result of the economic crisis may
have shocked some out of that procrastination and we may actually see
some becoming more regular in their pattern. However, I find it
difficult to understand why there should be discrimination between
somebody who contributes &#163;2,500 monthly and someone who
contributes &#163;30,000 annually. There seems to be no logic in that
sort of discrimination.</div>
<a name="09061867000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my hon.
Friend mentioned, I have been in that situation myself. In the years
that I was a partner at Ernst and Young, we never made a pension
payment until we had seen what the annual profits were going to be. It
was a very prudent approach. The amounts certainly differed from year
to year, as did the profit and the profit shares that came out. My hon.
Friend&#146;s description was quite correct. Each year we made an
assessment&#151;on our own back&#151;of which pension providers we
would invest that money with. That flexibility was not haphazard, as
the hon. Member for Taunton described it, although I appreciate that
some have a haphazard way of going about it; it was part of the normal
business life and the normal practice of going about dealing with
one&#146;s financial affairs.</div>
<a name="09061867000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">I cannot
believe that the Treasury is not aware of those behaviours&#151;after
all, there has been enough flow between the Treasury and firms of
accountants in exchanges of personnel and, I hope, the other way. Is
the provision an afterthought&#151;a way of dealing with an oversight
of the knock-on effect of increasing the 50 per cent. rate of tax in
the first place and then realising that it was too expensive to give
pension relief at that rate; or was it deliberate, and are we really
attacking the self-employed? If so, it would have been much more open
to make it clear as a policy objective, rather than going about it
somewhat by stealth, as the Bill approaches
it.</div><a name="09061867000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000562"></a>The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen
Timms):</b> I welcome you back to the Chair, Mr.
Atkinson.</div>
<a name="09061867000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I recognise
that the Opposition are, in tabling the amendments, raising an
important issue, about which there is some concern. I have argued to
the Committee that schedule 35 brings about a balance, on the one hand
preventing people from making large increased contributions to pre-empt
the reduced relief that is available from April 2011, and on the other
ensuring that those who continue with their normal, regular pattern of
pension saving will receive higher rate tax relief until the new
legislation takes effect in April
2011.</div><a name="09061867000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would have been impossible to design an arrangement that accurately
predicted what someone would have contributed to their pension if the
future changes had not been announced, so we decided that the fair way
to proceed was to look back at past behaviour, to identify
forestalling, as opposed to regular pension savings. Those regular
pension contributions will continue to attract tax relief, at the
individuals&#146; marginal rate, until the new regime is introduced
in April
2011.</div><a name="09061867000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule
35, as we have heard, defines regular contributions as those made
quarterly or more frequently. It includes provisions to protect regular
pension savings, made under different types of arrangements that were
in place on Budget day. It is for obvious reasons more 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column473" />Column number: 473</div>difficult to identify as normal contributions that are made less
frequently, particularly when that requires looking back over previous
years, not least because the A-day changes that we touched on this
morning have altered pension saving habits for some
people.</div><a name="09061867000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Opposition amendments are intended, first, to extend protection for
annual contributions. By and large the amendments&#151;the buffet
that we have to choose from&#151;would do that with reference to an
average of previous contributions made by individuals, accounting only
for those years within the previous three years in which contributions
were made.</div>
<a name="09061867000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Fareham spent a little time discussing amendment 228 and the
replacement of specific provisions in the schedule, for different
pension saving arrangements, with something much shorter. That would
create some significant and potentially expensive avoidance loopholes,
but it could also have significant adverse consequences for some
people, with the loss of the protection that the Bill provides for
wholly commercial and unexceptional
situations.</div><a name="09061867000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would also amend the definition of regular contributions, so
that the highest contribution in the past tax year, multiplied by the
frequency of payment, would determine the amount protected. Individuals
are already protected if their regular contributions have changed as
part of a contractual arrangement; but, of course, if the frequency of
payment increased it would create an obvious
loophole.</div><a name="09061867000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
recognise that for some people, particularly those in personal pension
arrangements, contributions are often made annually, on an ad hoc
basis, as their financial circumstances allow. I entirely accept the
points made by the hon. Members for Taunton and for Henley about that.
I reassure them that there is no intention of damaging the interests of
self-employed people or any other group. The provisions therefore
include an annual limit of &#163;20,000 on which individuals are
entitled to higher-rate relief. It is worth bearing in mind, as we
debate this, that those are people in unusual
circumstances&#151;those whose income exceeds &#163;150,000, that
is, 1.5 per cent. of pension savers. That group will continue to enjoy
full higher rate relief of up to &#163;20,000 a year, even if they
have made no contributions at all over the past few
years.</div><a name="09061867000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
appreciate that for those with less regular contribution patterns, the
&#163;20,000 figure may represent a lower pension contribution than
they have tended to make in the years since A-day. The hon. Member for
Fareham was right to refer to my Budget day statement, which welcomed
views on ways to ensure that that group&#146;s contributions were
protected in the same way as those of more frequent contributors. While
continuing to achieve our core objectives, we need to ensure, as
Opposition Members recognise, that the regime remains effective against
the risk of forestalling, which is a real
risk.</div><a name="09061867000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want a fair regime that is also effective in protecting the Exchequer.
We continue to work closely with industry and to gather evidence to
identify who is affected and to quantify fully the scale of the issue.
Currently, it is not clear how many people would be disadvantaged by
the arrangements in the way that hon. Members have suggested. I hope
that we can obtain information from industry on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column474" />Column number: 474</div>that and on the contribution patterns and levels over previous years. So
far that information has been difficult to obtain.</div>
<a name="09061867000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without
effective anti-forestalling legislation, some &#163;2 billion could
be at risk. I will shortly be meeting industry representatives to
explore the issue in more detail. As I said this morning, I am prepared
to return to the subject on Report if necessary. In doing so, I will
bear in mind the ideas in the buffet presented this afternoon. I am
happy to say to the hon. Member for Taunton that I shall be working
seriously and do recognise the genuineness of the points raised. With
that in mind, I hope that the hon. Member for Fareham will feel able to
withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="09061867000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000563"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> It has been a helpful debate and I am heartened
that the Minister has not closed his mind to protection for the
self-employed and those who make annual, rather than quarterly or more
frequent, contributions. I hope that there are some dishes in the
buffet that tempt him at a later stage to reheat these ideas for
discussion on
Report.</div><a name="09061867000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
trying to tackle forestalling, we are in danger of introducing
unfairness and discrimination against people who are not in the
position to make predictable pension contributions. If we are to look
at income going back three years to determine whether the
&#163;150,000 threshold has been reached, we should recognise the
pattern of pension contributions over that time as well, and use it as
a benchmark to compare future pension contributions. We could say,
&#147;This is the pattern in the past, anything in excess of that is
subject to the regime, and if it is equal to or less than that, it is
reasonable&#148;. Alternatively, for those who have not made
quarterly or more frequent contributions, the special annual allowance
of &#163;20,000 could be higher, but that would add complexity and
leave more scope for forestalling than the Minister would be willing to
concede.</div>
<a name="09061867000503"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30
pm</div><a name="09061867000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are ways to deal with the matter. If I had felt that the Minister had
closed his mind to the issue, I would have been tempted to push one of
the amendments to a Division. However, the Minister has said he is open
to it, although given the limited time between now and Report, his mind
must remain open and work quite quickly to get to a satisfactory
conclusion by Report. We shall certainly return to this on Report,
bearing in mind the points the Minister made, and perhaps come up with
more of a table d&#146;h&#244;te of amendments at that stage,
rather than the buffet that is before us today. I beg leave to withdraw
amendment 228.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000564"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am not going to say very much about amendment
205. While I am very keen to ensure that there is certainty in the tax
regime, particularly for a set of provisions that will last only two
years, given that the Minister is open to some of the debates about
potential changes and there may be new evidence that arises that
persuades him to adjust one or more provisions in this clause, passing
amendment 205 at this point may not helpful to the interests of getting
a better deal for taxpayers. Therefore, if it is feasible, I do not
wish to move the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000566"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> This is a brief foray into the heady world of VAT
for me, as my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire, who
would normally lead on this, is debating with the Economic Secretary
the matter of preparing Britain's economy for the future. Therefore my
remarks on VAT will be mercifully brief. Clauses 75 to 78 and
associated schedule 36 introduce some changes to the way VAT is accrued
and effectively implement a package of changes that govern the place of
supply for VAT purposes. From 1 January 2010, the basic place of supply
for services for a business-to-business transaction will become where
the customer is established. This is a change from the existing rules,
where it is where the supplier is established. It is a significant
change and will require some change to how suppliers account for the
VAT on goods. There are various exemptions, which I shall not go
through, about restaurant and catering services, intermediary services
and transport of goods. However, there are some administrative issue
that I do want to touch
upon.</div><a name="09061867000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Kevin
Misselbrook, the customer services director for Access Accounting
said:</div><a name="09061867000483"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;With
these new rules, businesses will have to track the dates of delivery
that the services were provided, and account for VAT accordingly.
Things get really complicated with invoices that cover multiple
deliveries of services, or those occasions where the service dates
change...This will place an even greater burden on business at a
time when what they really need is help and support as they steer their
way through the current recession. Indeed many organisations may not
currently be aware that the new VAT rules will be coming into
force&#148;.</div><a name="09061867000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
is keen to make sure</div>
<a name="09061867000484"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that this issue
is not buried within the
Budget&#148;.</div><a name="09061867000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Financial Secretary set out what will be done to ensure that
businesses supplying services to other businesses cross-border are
aware of those changes? We will touch on the European sales list later.
There are winners and losers in the changes to the place of supply.
While those changes will reduce many businesses&#146; need to reclaim
non-UK VAT or register elsewhere in the EU, businesses that are unable
to recover all VAT on purchases, such as those in the financial sector,
could see an increase to their cost base as services not currently
subject to UK VAT are required to be reverse charged.</div>
<a name="09061867000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
businesses are already considering the requirements and planning for
the changes, although some points of detail remain to be resolved.
There are some administrative changes here, so would the Financial
Secretary indicate what assessment the Treasury has made of the cost of
introducing them on businesses, because VAT is a complex issue? He will
know that a great friend of mine is a VAT
expert&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> The hon. Member for
South Derbyshire looks at me questioningly, but even I get lost when
discussing VAT. It goes way beyond the running joke of the VAT
treatment of Jaffa cakes, because there 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column476" />Column number: 476</div>are some complex issues here that businesses need to grapple with. What
assessment have the Government made of the cost of introducing those
changes, and what work will they do to ensure that businesses are aware
of the impact of those
changes?</div><a name="09061867000121"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000567"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> Clause 75, along with clauses 76 and 77, implements
a package of changes to the VAT treatment of cross-border trade. It was
agreed by European Finance Ministers in 2008. The clause introduced
schedule 36, which changes the place of supply rules for cross-border
supplies of services, and it is worth bearing in mind that it is purely
about services. Those rules determine where VAT on the cross-border
supply of services will be due, and from whom. They apply across the
European Union, so avoiding the possibility of double taxation or
non-taxation. We are also taking an opportunity to consolidate the
rules so that they are more sensibly grouped together in the Value
Added Tax Act
1994.</div><a name="09061867000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
changes will modernise the EU VAT rules to ensure that they keep pace
with changes in business practices, the impact of globalisation and
advances in technology. A package of changes to simplify and modernise
VAT treatment of cross-border trade was, as I said, unanimously
adopted. The new rules are part of that package agreed in February 2008
and will be phased in from 1 January 2010. They aim, as far as
possible, to achieve taxation at the place of consumption, so ensuring
that UK VAT is paid on supplies made to UK customers regardless of
where the supplier is located. I think that the new rules better
achieve the aim of taxing services where they are consumed. They ensure
that in the future UK VAT will apply to most services supplied to UK
customers.</div>
<a name="09061867000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Fareham, perfectly fairly, relayed concerns that had been
expressed about aspects of the clause. If we had had those discussions
much earlier in the process, many more concerns would have been
expressed. People feel that Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs,
by and large, has done quite a good job in dealing with some of the
potential difficulties for small businesses. He raised a question about
the time of supply. The objective of the change in the time of supply
rules on the cross-border supply of services is to align the time at
which the supplier includes a transaction on the European Community
sales list&#151;we will talk about that shortly&#151;with the time
at which a customer will have to record that transaction as a reverse
charge on the VAT return.</div>
<a name="09061867000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked what the cost of all that will be. An impact assessment
was published on Budget day detailing the estimated cost to businesses
of implementing the measures in the clauses. It is estimated that up to
220,000 businesses will be affected. They will need to understand the
changes and adapt their existing accounting systems. The continuing
annual costs are thought to be in the region of &#163;5 million,
making an average quantified cost of just less than &#163;90 per
business, which will vary depending on the extent to which a business
is affected by the changes. The impact assessment also included a
one-off cost of almost &#163;30 million for an estimated 1.3 million
VAT-registered businesses to spend an hour just checking that they are
not affected by the requirement to submit the EC sales lists. We are
talking about a total cost of some tens of millions across
businesses.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column477" />Column number: 477</div><a name="09061867000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">HMRC is taking
an active approach to informing businesses about the changes. The hon.
Member for Fareham rightly asked how we can be confident that people
will know about the changes. It is important that we achieve certainty
at as early a stage as possible for changes of this kind. We were the
first member state to publish legislation and interpretation&#151;on
22 December. We published initial guidance on 1 May, covering all
aspects of the cross-border VAT changes coming into effect on 1 January
2010, and that guidance will be updated as further queries are
highlighted or issues already identified are resolved. HMRC and
Treasury officials will continue to discuss any outstanding issues of
interpretation and
implementation.</div><a name="09061867000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000568"></a>John
Howell:</b> On interpretation, I am conscious that the
Chartered Institute of Taxation has raised the concern that there would
still be differences between member states. Will the Minister assure us
of the process for resolving those differences, and tell us how that
would be communicated to
businesses?</div><a name="09061867000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000569"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> The arrangements will apply to the whole of the
European Union. There have been concerns about whether every country
will be as timely as we will be in implementation. The indications are
encouraging on that front, at least as far as the bigger countries in
Europe are concerned. It has been suggested that there could be some
points of details on which there could initially be some differences of
interpretation, and HMRC will be ready to talk to businesses about
those if they prove to be a difficulty. It is perfectly possible that
there might be some teething problems, but HMRC will understand if
businesses face a little difficulty to begin with because of issues of
the kind that the hon. Member for Fareham has referred to. We are
talking to others at the Commission to ensure that businesses receive
clarification as quickly as
possible.</div><a name="09061867000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall finish, perhaps slightly self-indulgently, by quoting an
accounting firm that praised HMRC for the &#147;open and
pragmatic&#148; approach being taken here. I have mentioned that we
were the first to publish the legislation. HMRC has done a good job. I
am not saying that there will be no difficulties, but they will be
manageable and
minimal.</div><a name="09061867000129"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000570"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Let me comment in passing on the Minister&#146;s
self-indulgent remark about HMRC being congratulated on being open and
pragmatic. I would have hoped that it should not be noteworthy that
HMRC is open and pragmatic. It sounded as though that was the exception

<div class="Column"><a name="Column478" />Column number: 478</div>rather than the norm. I shall leave that thought hanging in the
Minister&#146;s mind for the time
being.</div><a name="09061867000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
said in my brief remarks on clause 75 that I would return to the
European sales list, which is a requirement for companies to make a
periodic report of services supplied to other businesses in EU member
states. The following information should be included in the EC sales
list: the VAT registration number of the business to which services
were supplied, and the total value, excluding VAT, of such
supplies.</div>
<a name="09061867000504"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45
pm</div><a name="09061867000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Two
issues have been flagged to me, one of which has already been dealt
with. That is the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Henley made
about interpretation.</div>
<a name="09061886000001"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061867000571"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Robert Syms</b> (Poole) (Con): My hon. Friend the Member for
Henley is also on the Equality Bill, which is why he zips in and out of
this Committee. He is a very important
individual.</div>
<a name="09061867000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000572"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Clearly, not only the Exchequer Secretary is in
transitional arrangements. My hon. Friend the Member for Henley is so
assiduous in his parliamentary duties that he feels that serving on one
Committee is simply not enough; he must have two on the go at any point
in time.</div>
<a name="09061867000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue
that has been raised is whether the treatment of supplies is exactly
the same in each member state. There is an obligation on the supplier
to know what the treatment of supplies would be in the other member
states, for the purposes of complying with the European sales list. The
Minister went some way towards reassuring the Committee on that point
by talking about the pace of implementation and the fact that the
implementation of this measure will be tighter than we are normally
used to with the implementation of directives. If there is any
additional information that he can give on that subject, that would be
helpful.</div>
<a name="09061867000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister,
in his response to my question, referred to the cost of changes in
accounting systems. One of the issues that has been raised in that
regard is that at present most accounting systems cannot cope with
producing the European sales list. That is a concern, because of course
the clause relates to the new harsher penalty regime and to clause 92,
which deals with the obligations of senior accounting officers. There
is concern that although the intention may be that businesses should
comply with the measure, the systems they have in place may not be
appropriate to comfortably provide accuracy of tax accounting. As the
Government consider the measure, it is important that they ensure that
businesses have the right IT support for the European sales lists, so
that they are not subject to penalty under clause 92 or the other
tougher penalties being introduced in that part of the
Bill.</div>
<a name="09061867000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000573"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> At present, VAT-registered businesses that supply
or sell goods to other member states file a declaration known as an EC
sales list with HMRC, to notify HMRC that a cross-border transaction
has occurred but no VAT has been charged. The sales list records the
member state of destination, the customer&#146;s VAT registration
number and the value of the goods supplied. HMRC forwards that
information to the customer&#146;s tax authority, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column479" />Column number: 479</div>so that it can cross-check that the customer has entered the purchase or
acquisition in their records and will account for the VAT. Clause 77
ensures that HMRC can introduce equivalent regulations for cross-border
supplies of services. The alteration is necessary because of the change
that is being made with effect from 1 January 2010, which we have
discussed.</div><a name="09061867000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
future, therefore, VAT will be paid and recovered, subject to any
partial exemption restriction on most cross-border services by the
business customer on their VAT return, similar to the way that VAT is
currently accounted for on cross-border supplies of goods.
Conceptually, there is nothing very new, but the extension to services
is new. Unless the current sales list regime for goods is extended to
services, there is a risk that EU tax authorities will be unaware of
cross-border supplies of services and, as a result, they may lose
significant amounts of VAT. This is an important provision to monitor
compliance and to help in the fight against VAT fraud.</div>
<a name="09061867000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondary
legislation will be laid later this year, with an effective date of 1
January 2010, setting out in detail the new reporting requirements for
EC sales lists for goods and services. I have provided a draft for the
Committee. The changes, along with those in clause 75, were consulted
on before the Budget, and a summary of responses was published on
Budget day. Businesses have raised concerns about the practical
implementation of making the changes by 1 January 2010, some of which
were echoed today. HMRC has established a joint Government-business EC
sales list working group; I hope that the Committee agree that that is
an open and pragmatic thing to do. The group will discuss the issue and
identify ways of keeping the administrative burden to a minimum. The
changes ensure compliance with the new rules contained in clause
75.</div><a name="09061867000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Fareham pressed me a little further about consistency
in rules, along the same lines as the hon. Member for Henley when he
was with us. As I said earlier, I am aware that there have been
business concerns about the potential for different
interpretations&#151;in particular, the danger of double taxation. It
is conceivable that people could find themselves paying VAT in two
countries if the measure does not work as smoothly as it should, so we
have been talking to the Commission to clarify areas where there could
be difficulties, and we will update the guidance as soon as those
issues have been resolved.</div>
<a name="09061867000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can tell
people who may be concerned about the matter that if a business makes
reasonable attempts&#151;including, for example, discussing the VAT
position with the customer&#151;and those attempts have failed to
ascertain what the correct VAT treatment is in the member state where
the customer is based and to which the service is being supplied,
businesses may choose to assume that the UK VAT treatment will apply to
those supplies, on the basis that it should be consistent with the EC
directive and therefore with the law in other member states. That is
another open and pragmatic option that people might bear in
mind.</div>
<a name="09061867000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">There could
be some teething problems, but I hope that they will quickly be
resolved. As long as business is able to demonstrate that it is taking
steps to comply with the new legislation at the earliest opportunity,
there will be no question of HMRC penalties. As the hon. Member for
Fareham said, we will be debating later the question of
penalties.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column480" />Column number: 480</div><a name="09061867000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
question of accounting systems not being able to cope with the new
sales lists, it is not that they cannot provide ESLs but that the time
of completion is not always certain. HMRC is discussing that point with
businesses.</div><a name="09061867000147"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

78</h4><a name="09061867000008"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Effect

welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Atkinson. I have no doubt that
what I have to say will test the openness and pragmatism of my right
hon. Friend the Financial Secretary.</div>
<a name="09061867000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause is
an attempt to resolve an unintended consequence of the interaction
between the Agricultural Holdings Act 1986 and the Value Added Tax Act
1994, triggered by a court judgment in December last year. That
judgment held that when there is a change in the amount of VAT payable,
it constitutes a change in the amount of rent payable. Under the
Agricultural Holdings Act, that triggers a three-year moratorium on a
rent review being referred to arbitration&#151;a common means of
resolving farming rent disputes.</div>
<a name="09061867000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before that
case, it was understood that regardless of whether VAT was charged, the
sum of any tax was immaterial to the legal right to determine disputed
rent. In clause 78, the Government seek to resolve the problem by
asserting that neither the levying of the tax, which is dependent on
the status of the individual lessor, nor any change in the rate of the
tax will be taken into account when determining a right to arbitration.
That might appear to resolve the issue entirely, but it would seem that
it does
not.</div><a name="09061867000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Agricultural
tenancies often comprise both a house and land, which are treated
separately for the purposes of complying with VAT legislation.
Commercial land is VATable, but a house is not. However, those two
components are often pooled into one rent for a holding. The clause
might not address a change in the balance of the rent between the two
component parts, one of which is VATable, while the other is not. That
might occur naturally according to market circumstances; for example,
if the rent on a commercial holding were related to a return that one
might achieve from it, and the rent on a house were related to the
value of the property, the two elements might vary over time. Such a
change in the balance is entirely feasible, but it does not appear to
have been anticipated in the Government&#146;s narrow change, which
merely refers to a change in the rate of VAT, rather than in the amount
of VAT that may be attached to the
rent.</div><a name="09061867000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
may be two ways to resolve the issue. The first option is to accept my
amendment. I would be delighted if that happened, because it would be a
first for me, having served on a Finance Bill Committee at least three
times, although it may be even more&#151;I cannot remember. The
second option, which might well suffice, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column481" />Column number: 481</div>is for the Government to give a clear statement about how the change
applies and an understanding of how Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and
Customs would treat VAT in those
circumstances.</div><a name="09061867000155"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000575"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> My hon. Friend has very helpfully set out the
background to the clause and why it is in the Bill. The clause ensures
that any change in the VAT paid by an agricultural tenant is not
considered to be a change in rent for the purposes of the rent review
provision in the Agricultural Holdings Act 1986. Changes in the VAT
paid by tenants could arise because the landlord opts to apply VAT to
supplies of the agricultural land, which landlords do from time to
time, under schedule 10 to the Value Added Tax Act 1994, or because of
changes to the VAT rate applicable to such supplies. Of course, we have
had one such change recently and we will have another at the end of the
year.</div><a name="09061867000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am aware of the concern described by my hon. Friend that the clause as
drafted might not cover VAT changes resulting from a reapportionment of
rent between commercial and residential elements. We have looked
carefully at the issue and my conclusion is that such VAT changes could
arise only as a result of the landlord&#146;s exercise of the option
to tax under schedule 10 to the VAT Act 1994. Therefore, those changes
are already covered by the current wording of clause
78(1).</div><a name="09061867000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000576"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> I can imagine another circumstance. It is unlikely,
but one of our tasks is to consider the unlikely as well as the
certain. A landlord and a tenant could agree a reapportionment between
them of the two elements of the lease&#151;residential and
commercial&#151;with a consequential change in the amount of VAT
payable, but subsequently fall into dispute about how future rents
might be determined. If that were the case, and they had an agreement,
at that point they would be bound to keep to the three-year period for
arbitration. That is something that would not conform to the intent of
the clause or for that matter, the intent of those who drafted the
original clause, whose purpose was to deal with the protection of an
agricultural
tenancy.</div><a name="09061867000505"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000577"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> The intention of the clause and its effect,
according to the best advice on these matters, mean that all these
situations are covered. Any consequential VAT change would still arise
only because of the landlord&#146;s option to tax. That is why in our
view it is covered by subsection (1)(d)(i). I am perfectly willing to
reflect further on what my hon. Friend has said and perhaps to discuss
the matter further with him. If there is any remaining uncertainty
there will be an opportunity to have another look at it, but I am
confident that what is here does the
job.</div><a name="09061867000159"></a>

Greg Hands</b> (Hammersmith and Fulham) (Con): I welcome you
back to the chair, Mr. Atkinson, at the start of our
consideration of part 5. Perhaps I should also congratulate the
Minister on his remarkable solo effort today. He has shown incredible
dexterity in handling pensions, VAT and now stamp duty. Perhaps later
he will be doing North sea oil. I feel slightly sorry for him. As all
else crashes around him and everyone else seems to be coming and going,
he is pretty much the only element still standing. It is a little bit
like the Sun at the heart of the solar system as various planets and
comets come in and out of orbit. Sometimes they reappear for as short a
period as nine days. I think that is a shorter appearance than
Halley&#146;s comet. I simply express my admiration for the Financial
Secretary&#146;s ability to cope with the rapidly shifting
sands.</div><a name="09061867000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
79 is about the exercise of collective rights by tenants of flats. We
have no objection to the clause which, as far as we can see, should
allow fairer treatment of leaseholders in blocks of flats. If it does
what it purports to do, my constituents will certainly very much
welcome it, given the huge numbers who are leaseholders who are
considering purchasing the freehold of their building. If anything, I
am slightly surprised that the issue has not been dealt with
comprehensively before. I understand there have been some difficulties
in relation to the workings of the Finance Act 2003 and the right to
enfranchise companies.</div>
<a name="09061867000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">At present
when leaseholders club together to buy out the freehold of a block,
stamp duty is charged on the block as a whole. Because larger
properties and larger freeholds are subject to higher rates, perhaps as
high as 4 per cent., individual leaseholders can find that their share
of the stamp duty is higher than it would have been for an equivalent
individual freehold on the flat they have purchased. That does not seem
fair and it was never intended to be the case. Leaseholders exercising
their statutory right to acquire the freehold for a block of flats were
supposed to be able to use a &#147;right to enfranchise&#148;
company as a vehicle for the purchase. The Finance Act 2003 provided
relief for those RTE companies, but to date the Government have not
enacted the provisions. It is impossible to set one up and for
leaseholders to get the relief they were promised. The clause takes out
the references to RTE companies in the 2003 legislation. The
substitutions it makes will enable all leaseholders to claim relief in
proportion to the freehold that they have purchased.</div>
<a name="09061867000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Department for Communities and Local Government issued a consultation
paper last month proposing that the basis for RTEs&#151;that is, the
provisions in the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act
2002&#151;should not be implemented and should be repealed. The
provisions were designed to allow a majority view among leaseholders to
prevail and to stop one or two blocking the process, but they hit the
rocks over apportioning the costs of collective enfranchisement when
leaseholders disagree among themselves. The Government now appear to
have given up on their plans altogether.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column483" />Column number: 483</div><a name="09061867000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">Against the
background of that recent history of confusion and false starts, we
welcome clause 79. However, I hope the Minister can offer assurance
that, if the Government change their mind again&#151;perhaps as a
result of the DCLG consultation&#151;and activate the framework for
RTE companies, references to RTEs would be reinstated in the Finance
Act 2003. Leaseholders have waited long enough for relief and they
should not be made to wait again.</div>
<a name="09061867000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">A question
has also been raised with me about changes to some definitions. Relief
will now be calculated with respect to the term
&#147;qualifying&#148; flats, rather than the existing one
of</div>
<a name="09061867000485"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;flats in
respect of which the right of collective enfranchisement is being
exercised&#148;.</div><a name="09061867000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister clarify whether the new term will exclude flats that join
in a purchase by paying a share of the cost but strictly speaking are
not participating in the statutory process? For example, I have been
told of concerns that a tenant who was too old or infirm to participate
directly in the statutory process could miss out on relief under the
new wording. I would be grateful for clarification on the new wording
and how it differs from the previous version. I hope the Minister will
give reassurance and then we can
proceed.</div><a name="09061867000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000580"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I suspect I am not the only member of the Committee
who is already missing my hon. Friend the Member for Burnley (Kitty
Ussher) from our discussion.</div>
<a name="09061867000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
amends section 74 of the Finance Act 2003, which gives stamp
duty land tax relief where leaseholders of flats exercise statutory
rights collectively to acquire the freehold of their block. As the hon.
Member for Hammersmith and Fulham accurately set out, the relief only
applied where the purchaser was a statutory right to
enfranchise&#151;RTE&#151;company. Provision for such companies was
introduced by the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002 and was
awaiting commencement when the SDLT legislation was enacted in 2003.
However, the provision was never commenced so, as he said, no one has
been able to claim the relief. Members of the Committee may recall that
a new clause to address that was debated in a Committee of the whole
House on the Finance Bill last year. My hon. Friend the then Exchequer
Secretary undertook on that occasion to look further at the best way to
resolve this, if necessary including an appropriate clause in the
present Finance Bill, as we are doing.</div>
<a name="09061867000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is now
clear that the RTE company provisions will not be commenced. The
Department for Communities and Local Government published on 12 May a
consultation on proposals to repeal the RTE company provisions. That
sets out the difficulties encountered in seeking to put those
provisions into effect, which involved the likelihood of creating an
unduly cumbersome enfranchisement process with far greater potential
for delay, uncertainty and burdens&#151;outweighing any
benefits.</div>
<a name="09061867000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman raised some specific points about, for example, leaseholders
who are physically incapacitated. Given that a personal signature is
required to participate in collective enfranchisement, leaseholders
unable to sign their name cannot participate. That means that, under
the terms of the relief, their interests cannot be taken into account
in determining the rate of stamp duty land tax on the purchase of the
freehold. This is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column484" />Column number: 484</div>about the basis on which the right of collective enfranchisement can be
exercised, rather than the terms of the relief.</div>
<a name="09061867000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the RTE
provisions are enacted, we would certainly amend the provisions in
section 74 of the Finance Act 2003 accordingly. The clause
will amend the relief so that it can be claimed by nominees or
appointees of leaseholders exercising their statutory rights. Those can
be individuals or companies. The amendments have effect for
transactions whose effective date for stamp duty land tax date
purposes, which is normally the day of completion, is on or after
Budget day&#151;22 April. I am grateful for the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s support for the
clause.</div><a name="09061867000175"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
80</h4><a name="09061867000010"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Registered

<a name="09061867000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000581"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> The clause relates to stamp duty land tax for
registered providers of social housing. More specifically, it relates
to profit-making providers of social housing. The association of profit
with social housing is not universally popular on the Government
Benches. Some of the unreconstructed Government Members might seek to
extend their hostility from the existence of profit-making providers to
clause 80, which gives those same providers tax relief.</div>
<a name="09061867000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Housing
and Regeneration Act 2008 essentially did away with the old system of
registered social landlords. It also allowed private, profit-making
organisations to compete for public money. Clause 80 puts them on the
same footing as non-profit-making providers, in relation to stamp duty
land tax, when purchasing a property that is either already, or will
become, a social home. I understand that the 2008 Act had already added
references to non-profit-making providers to section 71 of the Finance
Act 2003, which provided the stamp duty relief for the old RSLs. It is
not entirely clear why profit-making providers were not included then.
Presumably, today&#146;s proposals either represent a change of heart
by the Government&#151;or at least an afterthought&#151;or correct
an
oversight.</div><a name="09061867000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
stamp duty exemption, when a project is receiving a public subsidy,
seems straightforward enough&#151;giving it a public subsidy and tax
relief at the same time&#151;but it would be helpful to get some idea
from the Minister of the amount of duty that the Exchequer will forgo
as a result of this measure. In principle, however, we have no
objection to the clause. Had he not introduced these proposals, the
Government would in effect have introduced stamp duty on social housing
developments, even if only for profit-making providers, which would
have run counter to the spirit of the 2008 Act. As I understood it,
that Act sought to create a level playing field for not-for-profit and
profit-making providers.</div>
<a name="09061867000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsections
(6) and (7) appear to merely extend the related relief for clients of
the old RSLs to those of the new profit-making organisations. A social
tenant who enters into shared ownership of their property will now 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column485" />Column number: 485</div>receive the same favourable stamp duty treatment irrespective of whether
the social housing provider is a profit-making or a not-for-profit
body. We find no reason, therefore, to oppose the clause, but I shall
watch with interest to see whether the Government Members are of the
same
view.</div><a name="09061867000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000582"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> On the subject of unreconstruction, it is just as
well that there is not a European dimension to clause 80. Had there
been, we might have heard from a few more Conservative
Members.</div>
<a name="09061867000506"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div><a name="09061867000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham has correctly described what the
clause does and what its purpose is, arising from the change in the
Housing and Regeneration Act 2008. He asked why the change was not made
in that Act, but of course this is a change that can only be made in a
Finance Act. That is why it is here in front of us today. It ensures
that the relief, currently available for certain acquisitions by
registered social landlords and for purchases under shared ownership
schemes operated by housing associations, can be extended under the new
system of registered providers of social housing in England to those
who may be profit-making companies, who can operate a shared ownership
scheme and be eligible for a social housing grant. What this does is
extend to them the benefit of SDLT relief.</div>
<a name="09061867000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Bodies
that become profit-making registered providers of social housing will
mainly be developers building homes for sale under low cost home
ownership schemes currently attracting grant aid under section 27 of
the Housing Act 1996. Acquisitions with grant aid under that section do
not currently attract SDLT relief, so in this case the measure will
increase the amount of relief given. As relief under the measure is
tied to the receipt of public subsidy, it is unlikely that there will
be a net increase in the volume of shared ownership purchases
qualifying for SDLT relief. That is the basis for saying that the cost
of the measure is negligible.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000583"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000584"></a>The

amendment 261, in clause 81, page 43, leave
out lines 8 to
11.</div><a name="09061867000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000585"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Clause 81 continues on stamp duty land tax and
relates to &#147;rent to shared ownership&#148; schemes. It seeks
to amend schedule 9 to the 2003 Act. In general, it seeks to simplify
the tax position of tenants who are in a Rent to HomeBuy arrangement
with a social housing provider. As members of the Committee will be
aware, HomeBuy schemes allow tenants to enter into agreement with a
provider to purchase slithers of equity in a property, owning a share
of the leasehold and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column486" />Column number: 486</div>continuing to pay rent on the remainder. That percentage can obviously
vary based on local circumstances, or even by individual
scheme.</div>
<a name="09061867000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">One barrier
to participation in HomeBuy schemes is the need to provide a deposit in
order to be granted a mortgage. Rent to HomeBuy, called &#147;rent to
shared ownership&#148; in clause 81, is the Government&#146;s
proposed solution. It is designed to help tenants enter a HomeBuy
scheme at a future date by giving them up to five years&#146; tenancy
in which to save for a deposit. The rent is discounted at 80 per cent.
or less of market rates. During the rental period the tenants have
first option to purchase a minimum 25 per cent. stake in the property
they are occupying, either outright or through a mortgage. If they fail
to do so when their assured shorthold tenancy expires, the tenancy is
reviewed and may be terminated.</div>
<a name="09061867000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">One might
question particular details of this model&#151;I do not think this
Committee sitting is really the most appropriate way to look at
that&#151;but one might question particular details without
necessarily questioning the general HomeBuy concept, which on these
Benches has certainly found a great deal of favour. However, it seems
wrong that a tenant who goes on to purchase a stake in a property may
become retrospectively liable for stamp duty land tax&#151;that is,
from earlier in the shorthold tenancy. We therefore welcome the aim of
clause 81, which is to make the charge payable when, and only when,
that shared ownership commences. It also detaches occupancy under the
shorthold tenancy from the start date of shared ownership: again,
something that seems proper in this
context.</div><a name="09061867000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the second element that I have just outlined may be unnecessary. This
is where amendments 260 and 261 come in. The amendments we have tabled
do not intend to alter the scope or effect of the clause; rather they
reflect the concern expressed to me by the Law Society that the wider
principle governing the applicability of possession towards stamp duty
liability is called into question. I understand that the principle is
set out in paragraph 7,900 of the stamp duty land tax manual. I am not
sure why there are 7,900 paragraphs. I hope that I am reading that
correctly and that it is not 79.00 or something&#151;I am told that
it is 7,900. That paragraph states that HMRC will, other things being
equal, take the view that
when</div><a name="09061867000486"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
purchaser already has occupation of the premises under a different
interest, for example when the purchase is of a freehold and the
purchaser is a tenant, substantial performance will not be triggered at
the time of the contract as long as the purchaser adheres to the
covenants in the
lease.&#148;</div><a name="09061867000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Law Society believes that that already protects Rent to HomeBuy
tenants, and makes two arguments. First, it argues that that principle
makes the Government&#146;s new sub-paragraphs 13(4) and 14(4) to
schedule 9 of the Finance Act 2003 unnecessary. Secondly, it argues
that by including those new paragraphs the Government are suggesting
that there is some doubt about the principle and its general
applicability, which in turn might cause a loss of confidence among
practitioners. Legal uncertainty is in all circumstances best avoided,
and I should be grateful if the Minister would specifically address
that
concern.</div><a name="09061867000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have said, this is a technical matter and we do not oppose the
Government&#146;s intentions in the clause. If there are good reasons
for including those sub-paragraphs, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column487" />Column number: 487</div>we will happily not press the amendments. If there are good reasons,
however, that would also suggest that HMRC&#146;s guidance needs
reinforcement, and hence potential statutory inclusion in other areas
of the relevant
legislation.</div><a name="09061867000195"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000586"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I think that new sub-paragraphs 13(4) and 14(4)
serve a useful purpose, and I will attempt to persuade the hon.
Gentleman of that.</div>
<a name="09061867000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
sub-paragraphs modify the stamp duty land tax effective date provisions
for the purposes of rent to shared ownership schemes. Such schemes can
be structured in a number of ways. The structure referred to in those
sub-paragraphs involves a purchaser entering into a contract to
purchase a share of a property through a shared ownership lease or
trust but delaying completion for a pre-specified time, during which
the purchaser occupies the property as a tenant and pays a reduced
rent, which gives them the chance to save for the deposit that they
will need to purchase their share of the property. Under the normal
effective date provisions, occupation of the property in that way would
cause stamp duty to be payable before completion. The modification of
the effective date provisions in clause 81 ensures that the purchaser
does not have to pay stamp duty until they have purchased their share
of the property. Normally they would have to pay it when they signed
the contract, which would be earlier than we would
wish.</div><a name="09061867000197"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061867000587"></a><b class="B">Alison
Seabeck</b> (Plymouth, Devonport) (Lab): I would welcome some
clarification on how the community land trust model would potentially
fit here. I might be completely wrong and this might be totally
irrelevant, but in that model a similar equity stake in a property is
bought over time. Has HMRC given any consideration to what might need
to be put in place to deal with that model when it comes
forward?</div><a name="09061867000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000588"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I think that I will have to reflect on that
question and come back to my hon. Friend, but she is absolutely right
about the importance of the
arrangements.</div><a name="09061867000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">Among
the interesting aspects of my preparatory work for the debate on this
clause were the figures for the numbers of people who have taken
advantage of the Rent to HomeBuy option addressed here. I have been
given a note that states that by the end of March that figure was just
over 1,000, and by the end of May almost 5,000. The model that is
addressed here is therefore proving popular, and is one that people
want to take advantage of in the current difficult economic
circumstances. It is right that they should be able to do that. The
Conservative amendments would directly disadvantage the purchaser under
such a rent to shared ownership scheme, by making them liable to pay
stamp duty at the very time when they are trying to save for a deposit.
That is the purpose of allowing the dates to be deferred in such a
way.</div><a name="09061867000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">HMRC
will update its guidance, as the hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham
suggested. I think that subjecting purchasers to the normal effective
date provisions would make them liable for stamp duty land tax when
they are trying to save for a deposit and least able to afford it. On
the subject of well known paragraph 7,900, I shall point out that there
are not 7,900 paragraphs; it is simply a feature of the online
numbering, which perhaps gives an exaggerated impression of how many
paragraphs there are.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000592"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Thank you, Mr. Atkinson.</div>
<a name="09061867000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 82 and
schedule 37 are slightly different, in that they relate to both stamp
duty land tax and stamp duty reserve tax. With the clause we return,
with interest, to repos, which have already featured in parts of the
Finance Bill. Where, due to the insolvency of one of the parties,
securities are not returned in the repo to the originator of a stock
lending or repurchase arrangement, a reverse repo arrangement and/or a
related transaction, the clause and schedule provide relief from stamp
duty land tax and stamp duty reserve tax. As discussed on Tuesday,
stock lending and repo arrangements involve the transfer of the full
title to the securities involved for a limited or temporary
period.</div>
<a name="09061867000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
arises from the fact that the stamp duty and SDRT legislation exempt
the transfers from taxes because the ownership is temporary. However, a
default by the borrower or purchaser under repo or stock lending
arrangements such that the transfer becomes permanent reinstates the
charge to SDRT that would have arisen in the absence of relief. That
can happen when one of the parties to the transaction goes into
insolvency, which leads to, first, the creditors of the insolvent
entity having less money available due to the additional tax liability
and/or, secondly, a possible restriction on the ability of the solvent
entity to restore its original
position.</div><a name="09061867000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause prevents that by ensuring that no stamp duty or SDRT charge
arises when one party to the arrangement goes into insolvency. If the
solvent party does not have the shares or other securities returned, he
would probably have to purchase replacement shares from the market and
thus incur stamp taxes. The Finance Bill removes the SDRT charge from
purchases of replacement securities of the same kind and amount as
those transferred prior to the insolvency that afflicted the solvent
party at the end of the transaction.</div>
<a name="09061867000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
and schedule were introduced in response to the Lehman Brothers
collapse in mid-September 2008, hence the start date of 1 September
2008. They have, as I see it, been
welcomed.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000593"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for correctly
setting out the background to the clause. It arose because the collapse
of Lehman Brothers exposed the potential for unexpected stamp duty and
stamp duty reserve tax charges when stock lending and sale and
repurchase arrangements terminate because of insolvency. The overall
cost to the Exchequer of that relief, which is certainly a welcome help
for people facing unexpected costs, is nil. There is no net benefit or
cost to the Exchequer because any tax repaid as a result of a claim for
those reliefs is tax that the Government did not intend to be paid
anyway. It is a helpful measure and I am grateful for the hon.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000594"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I mentioned earlier that the post of Exchequer
Secretary is currently a sort of revolving door at HM Treasury: since
the clauses on oil were included in the Bill just a few weeks ago, we
have gone through three Exchequer Secretaries, none of whom are present
today to explain them. Yet again, I congratulate the Financial
Secretary on being so multi-disciplined and able to answer on these
clauses. These are important clauses on North sea oil, and it seems
that that important area has been badly served by the Government,
particularly in recent weeks with the rapid change in Exchequer
Secretaries. Such a major part of our economy deserves better
treatment.</div><a name="09061867000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
83 is the first of eight clauses relating to North sea oil, each of
which gives 83 relates to schedule 38. It is a shame that my hon.
Friend the Member for Fareham and the hon. Member for Taunton are not
currently in their places, because this is my first opportunity to
introduce the word &#147;sm√∂rg√•sbord&#148; into our
deliberations. One of them said that I might know something about the
word&#146;s pronunciation, but I am not an expert on Nordic or
Scandinavian pronunciation. The only thing that I know about that is
that the last consonant should normally be softened, so
&#147;sm√∂rg√•sbord&#148; should sound more like
&#147;smorgasburgh.&#148; I digress
slightly.</div><a name="09061867000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">Each
of the sm√∂rg√•sbord clauses is extremely short, but many
of the schedules are almost interminable&#151;in places, they are
very complex indeed. Clause 83 and schedule 38 deal with the extremely
important topic of decommissioning. In general, the UK faces some
important challenges in maintaining revenue from North sea oil while at
the same time getting the last drops out of existing fields and
extending our reach to the many smaller pockets of oil and gas that are
yet to be tapped.</div>
<a name="09061867000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">Taxation
plays a crucial role both in companies&#146; decisions to invest and
in their decisions to decommission. It is important that the Government
get a fair return on a national asset, but neither in the case of
decommissioning, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column490" />Column number: 490</div>nor in the case of exploration, is it in the national interest to have
oil in the ground, not least because unexploited oil produces no
tax.</div><a name="09061867000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is not an anti-green statement. As important as bringing forward
alternatives and becoming more energy-efficient remains, we are likely
to be dependent on oil and gas for some decades to come. It is
financially stupid and less green to import more oil and gas than we
have to. It also raises serious problems<i class="I"> </i>about energy security,
as anyone who has observed Russia&#146;s relationships with its
eastern European neighbours may have concluded. For as long as we are
stuck with fossil fuels, our own reserves are preferable in every
sense. I hope that all of that is stating the obvious and is widely
accepted. Therefore, we need to take great care in how we handle
decommissioning. Our aim must be to recognise properly the cost in
decommissioning a field effectively and safely. However, we must also
do what we can to ensure that the remaining pockets of oil in a field
can still be economically exploited. So the debate about schedule 38 is
set in that
context.</div><a name="09061867000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
we have ceased to be self-sufficient, UK oil and gas still accounts for
about 70 per cent. of our primary energy demand. The industry talks in
terms of &#147;barrels of oil equivalent&#148; when it lumps oil
and gas together. Using that measure, it is estimated that the
equivalent of up to 25 billion barrels of oil is still recoverable
across the UK continental shelf, which is sometimes abbreviated to the
UKCS. The Department of Energy and Climate Change estimate is more
modest than that, but it still thinks that there are between
17 billion and 20 billion barrels of oil equivalent left
under the UKCS, which extends slightly beyond the North sea, as we will
discuss when we debate a later clause in relation to oilfields west of
the Shetland isles.</div>
<a name="09061867000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
figures&#151;17 billion to 20 billion from DECC or 25 billion from
the industry&#151;can be compared with the 39 billion barrels that
have been recovered so far over the lifetime of the North sea fields.
In other words, and to put decommissioning in context, we are just
under two thirds of the way through our own North sea oil. As the UK
currently produces about 1 billion barrels a year, the potential for
the future is still clear. Oil &amp; Gas UK, which represents the oil
and gas industry, estimates that North sea gas could still meet 20 to
25 per cent. of our gas demand in 2020. Regarding oil, it
believes that as much as 60 to 65 per cent. of UK oil demand could
still be met from the North sea. That is where the decommissioning
regime, which is referred to in detail in schedule 38, has the
potential to come into its own.</div>
<a name="09061867000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">A decline in
overall annual production is inevitable, but it need not be as steep as
is popularly imagined, if we can get the decommissioning regime right.
Furthermore, declining production does not necessarily equate in any
way to a declining industry in the manner that was previously familiar
with elements of UK manufacturing. Let me explain that point: we host
world-class expertise in offshore engineering, and we lead the way in
subsea technology. More than 34,000 people are directly employed by the
major companies and contractors on average earnings of &#163;50,000
per annum.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000596"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. I
must say that I was genuinely unaware of that family problem.
Therefore, I want to put on the record the fact that I do not impugn
the integrity of the SNP&#146;s spokesman or that of the SNP as a
whole in not being here to express an interest in North sea oil, on
this occasion at least.</div>
<a name="09061867000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">Aberdeen is
renowned as a centre of excellence and is home to a number of vibrant
specialist companies that export their services across the world.
However, the future challenges are also considerable. On current plans,
of the 25 billion barrels of equivalent reserves, according to UK Oil
&amp; Gas, or the 20 billion barrels, according to DECC, that remain in
the UKCS, only 10 billion barrels will be recovered&#151;I think that
that is the Government&#146;s own estimate. That means that half of
what is left, or 15 years&#146; worth of barrels at
current annual production levels, will remain in the sea
bed.</div><a name="09061867000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is very important that we get the decommissioning regime right. We need
to incentivise companies to get out as much as they can from beneath
the North sea. That is where the high costs of decommissioning really
come into play. If any members of the Committee doubt its value, they
should reflect that in 2008-09, oil and gas accounted for 28 per cent.
of corporate taxation in the UK, with receipts of more than &#163;13
billion. Put slightly differently, taxation from the North sea paid for
last year&#146;s transport
budget.</div><a name="09061867000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
83 and schedule 38 are, we are told, anti-avoidance measures, which we
broadly support, as long as care is taken that the measures have no, or
minimal, side effects. New fields need first to be explored and then
developed, and the easy targets have long since been exploited. What is
left is smaller, more difficult to get to and, in the case of the west
of Shetland, located in fairly inhospitable regions. About 7 billion
barrels are in the form of so-called heavy oil. As someone in the
industry put it when they came to see me a couple of weeks ago, heavy
oil is called heavy because, if one pours it into a cup and then turns
the cup upside down, it does not come
out.</div><a name="09061867000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
existing fields present different problems, and getting the last of the
oil and gas out involves not only additional investment, but also
deferring decommissioning. We need to be extremely careful about how we
structure the tax relief available for decommissioning as laid out in
clause 83 and schedule 38. The costs of decommissioning are
huge&#151;they are far greater than the annual and diminishing
returns from fields near the end of their lives&#151;and they are met
by offsetting the costs against previous tax receipts. In other words,
HMRC provides a sizeable tax rebate for decommissioning. Naturally
enough, the rules under which fields qualify for the rebate become the
determining factor, as well as whether there is still oil or gas to be
had, in the decision to cease production. In other words, companies
make a logical, economic decision based on the oil and gas that might
still be in the field, the costs of decommissioning, the relief that
they will get and the time span over which they will get
it.</div><a name="09061867000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">Now,
nothing that I have said so far is meant to suggest that the Government
are not aware of the issues. Governments of both main parties have a
long 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column492" />Column number: 492</div>track record of discussions with the oil and gas industry, which
recently culminated in this Government&#146;s paper,
&#147;Supporting investment: a consultation on the North sea fiscal
regime&#148;, last November. The paper summarised last year&#146;s
round of discussions and prepared the ground for the proposals under
discussion, which include schedule
38.</div><a name="09061867000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
paper describes the general situation quite well. For example, it
states that the continental shelf
is</div><a name="09061867000487"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;facing
increasing challenges due to its nature as a maturing basin. The easy
to recover hydrocarbons have been exploited and the remaining
opportunities are, increasingly, either smaller in size or require the
use of cutting edge technologies to enable extraction. One result of
this is that many potential projects have become commercially marginal
and unable to compete with other projects around the globe. These
challenges are exacerbated by the current uncertainty over future oil
prices and the high cost levels faced within the North
Sea.&#148;</div><a name="09061867000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
was the conclusion in response to the
consultation.</div><a name="09061867000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
financial environment in which companies operate has changed
considerably since the proposals under discussion were first conceived.
Oil prices collapsed before recovering sharply but partially, and
difficulties in the capital markets have caused big problems,
particularly for the smaller companies that the Government have quite
rightly encouraged to operate in the North sea. At present, annual
investment may drop from &#163;5 million to &#163;3 million by the
end of the year, and warnings have been sounded about an irrevocable
loss of production from the fall in capital and exploration investment.
While the proposals might have been well received when oil was trading
at more than $100 a barrel and capital was relatively easy to come by,
the Budget has done little to allay the industry&#146;s fears in the
current market. Even if the oil price returns to higher levels, the
relative attractiveness of the UK continental shelf vis-√ -vis
other oil fields will remain a
problem.</div><a name="09061867000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Treasury&#146;s conundrum, as ever, is to find the balance that
maximises revenue, which provides the immediate backdrop to the
four-page schedule under discussion. The Treasury also needs to set
down a stable, predictable framework in which companies feel safe to
plan. One complaint in this policy area, which I am afraid we have
heard made all too often of this Government over many Finance Bills, is
the level of short-term chopping and changing that characterises their
approach.</div><a name="09061867000508"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45
pm</div><a name="09061867000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning
to decommissioning, and the substance of clause 83 and schedule 38, the
Government appear to be moving to reinforce the rule that
decommissioning costs can only be written off when they are actually
run up. The consultation paper puts it thus:</div>
<a name="09061867000488"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Virtually
all capital expenditure incurred in the North Sea, including putting
the plant and machinery in place, or in dismantling it at the end of
the life of an oil field, now qualifies for one hundred per cent First
Year Allowances (FYAs), allowing the cost to be written off for tax
purposes in the accounting period in which the expenditure is
incurred.&#148;</div><a name="09061867000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is the rule that they set out, but this rule is, in turn, under attack.
The explanatory notes accompanying the Bill include this rather coy
remark:</div><a name="09061867000489"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government has become aware of arrangements that have been entered into
which seek to establish a claim for tax relief for decommissioning
costs several years in advance of any decommissioning work actually
being carried out. This undermines 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column493" />Column number: 493</div>a fundamental general principle that relief is given in the accounting
period, for costs incurred in respect of the work actually carried out
in that accounting
period&#148;.</div><a name="09061867000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I understand it, these &#147;arrangements&#148; are the much
gossiped about arrangements of one particular company, and in the
tradition of anti-avoidance stuff, these companies do not tend to be
mentioned in debates on the Finance Bill. I was not intending to do so
anyway. However, this company, has, I understand, sought to circumvent
the principle by creating some intra-group structures intended to
justify an early claim for the relief on decommissioning. The principle
as it stands is proper and appropriate, as it is only when actual costs
are being incurred that the true cost of decommissioning can be known
with certainty. We therefore support the intent of the
Government&#146;s proposals, but I would like some reassurance from
the Minister that the way schedule 38 is drafted will not inadvertently
create problems around so-called mid-life
decommissioning.</div><a name="09061867000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">Decommissioning
is actually a legal requirement and the costs involved are huge,
greatly outstripping the annual revenue that a declining field will
generate&#151;I return to the point about the equation of what is
left to exploit vis-√ -vis decommissioning costs and the relief
given against them. Hence, the rules governing the relief of
decommissioning costs against the tax previously paid on the income
from a field assume far greater importance near the end of the life of
a field than getting all the remaining oil out. As I understand it, in
the Government&#146;s proposals there is a danger of prompting the
total closure of a field to secure, beyond doubt, the capital allowance
for the full cost when, in fact, a limited number of platforms within
the field could have continued to operate. Again, it is about trying to
get as much out of the UKCS as we possibly can within a reasonable tax
framework.</div><a name="09061867000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
oil companies would lose some revenue by doing this, guaranteeing the
full capital allowance is, for them, the overriding priority. For the
Exchequer, this approach makes no sense at all. The more oil that can
be extracted for the Exchequer, the more tax HMRC will collect. I would
appreciate the Minister&#146;s comments on whether schedule 38 runs
the risk of leaving too much oil
behind.</div><a name="09061867000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
summarise on clause 83 and schedule 38, companies producing oil and gas
in the UK and on the UKCS have a statutory requirement to decommission
oil and gas fields at the end of their life. They are able to obtain
relief for such decommissioning costs in the form of 100 per cent.
capital allowances against ring-fenced profits once they have been
incurred. The Government have stated that it has become aware that some
companies&#151;I thought it was only one company&#151;have entered
into intra-group arrangements designed to enable a claim for tax relief
to be made before the actual decommissioning work is carried out. It is
unclear whether the 100 per cent. ring-fenced abandonment relief, which
was introduced in 2001 for corporation tax, had the intended effect
that relief for decommissioning costs were only available when the
decommissioning actually took place, particularly following the
relaxations of the conditions for relief made in last year&#146;s
Finance Act. Certain companies have therefore entered into contracts
for decommissioning services and claimed relief in respect of payments
made under these contracts even though the actual decommissioning may
be some years away.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column494" />Column number: 494</div><a name="09061867000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposed
changes to the legislation here apply to decommissioning expenditure
incurred on or after 22 April 2009. It provides that
expenditure must be incurred and paid out in respect of an approved
abandonment programme and it will be allowable only in the accounting
period in which the decommissioning period is carried out or
undertaken. If the expenditure in respect of which a claim is made is
disproportionate to the decommissioning carried out, the claim can be
reduced by HMRC proportionately. We have a few concerns, which we have
outlined, but nevertheless we will support clause 83 and schedule
38.</div><a name="09061867000245"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000597"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I start by reassuring the hon. Gentleman about the
seriousness with which we are dealing with this part of the Bill. I
certainly relish the opportunity to debate this area of policy, having
first had responsibility for it almost 10 years ago. I am probably not
the best qualified member of the Committee to debate this part of the
Bill. That is probably my hon. Friend the Member for Waveney, because
of his long experience as chair of the all-party group on offshore
activities. I can certainly reassure the hon. Gentleman that we have
consulted widely and put a great deal of work into the clauses in this
part of the Bill, which my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary and I
will be
addressing.</div><a name="09061867000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
package of changes as a whole could assist in unlocking up to an
additional 2 billion barrels of oil and gas from the North sea. That is
an increase of 20 per cent. on the production that is
currently planned. This is a vitally important resource from the point
of view both of our energy security and the economy. The extra
production that these changes will unlock can play an important role in
the UK economy. As my hon. Friend the Member for Waveney knows better
than anyone, we have extremely good links with the offshore industry.
We have had those for a long time. We have forums&#151;the Pilot
forum in particular&#151;in which we can discuss these matters and
make sure that we can take full advantage of the industry&#146;s
expertise and advice in coming up with a regime that can do the best
possible job for the UK
economy.</div><a name="09061867000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first clause deals with an avoidance problem, addressing arrangements
under which companies claim tax relief for the cost of decommissioning
oil and gas infrastructure in the North sea many years in advance of
the work actually being carried out. These arrangements are deliberate
avoidance. Schedule 38 amends the rules that provide tax relief for
decommissioning costs with effect from the Budget. The rules will make
sure that companies can claim tax relief for decommissioning costs only
during the accounting period in which the work is carried
out.</div><a name="09061867000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
can give the hon. Gentleman the reassurances that he was seeking. The
changes proposed by this measure will not prevent companies obtaining
tax relief for their decommissioning costs when the work is carried
out. It is important to note that oil companies have access to a very
generous regime for tax relief for decommissioning expenditure. That
tax relief is there for a good reason and this change does absolutely
nothing to reduce the access that companies have to that. Oil and gas
companies come to the North sea under the terms of licences, which
require them to decommission their installations and infrastructures at
the end of an oilfield&#146;s productive life. Companies understand
that obligation. They make 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column495" />Column number: 495</div>arrangements to meet it knowing that tax relief will be available for
those costs when the work is carried out. Nothing here will diminish
that access. The arrangements that the clause and schedule address are
undermining those activities and seeking to obtain advantage over other
companies who are not prepared to enter into an avoidance scheme of
this kind. This avoidance scheme is not a consequence of last
year&#146;s changes. It provides companies with the certainty that
they will receive relief for their decommissioning costs for the period
in which the work is actually carried out, which up until recently was
the position that everybody thought
obtained.</div><a name="09061867000249"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<a name="09061867000253"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000598"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Clause 84 and schedule 39 refer to blended oil. For
the benefit of newcomers to the oil debate, I shall explain briefly the
three basic elements in the North sea fiscal regime. The first is
petroleum revenue tax; the second, corporation tax which, as we know,
is ring-fenced in the case of the North sea; and the third, the
supplementary charge. PRT, which is at the heart of schedule 39,
applies only to the older, larger fields at a rate of 50 per cent. of
net income. It applies to specific fields given development consent
before 1993. A number of allowances and reliefs apply. In practice,
most pre-1993 fields do not pay it. Where they do, however, it
generates considerable revenue.</div>
<a name="09061867000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
schedule 39 is about PRT, it is important when considering it to
understand the effects of the other two parts of oil taxation operating
in the North sea. Corporation tax applies to companies&#146; upstream
oil and gas profits within the North sea ring fence at a rate of 30 per
cent. The ring fence prevents companies off-setting losses in other
downstream parts of their businesses against their upstream profits.
This is an area affected, as we saw, by the previous clause on capital
allowances, although decommissioning issues are also prevalent with
PRT.</div>
<a name="09061867000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
supplementary charge applies, as its name suggests, as a supplement to
corporation tax. When it was introduced in 2002 it was levied as an
additional 10 per cent. charge on ring-fenced profits and was increased
to 20 per cent. in 2006. As Members will already have calculated, this
means there is a marginal rate of 50 per cent. on most fields, rising
to approximately 75 per cent. on fields subject to PRT. These rates are
high and, as the Government acknowledge, may be too high to attract
future investment in fields where oil is difficult to extract. We will
come in a later clause to consider the widening of the North sea oil
regime to provide an incentive for areas such as high-pressure and
high-temperature oil fields.</div>
<a name="09061867000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">With that
brief exposition of the three main areas, I will turn to schedule 39
itself. Oil from different fields commonly shares a pipeline back to
the shore, despite the fields falling under different ownership, and it
is then sold after blending in the pipe. Brent crude is itself a blend.
There is an obvious need for tax purposes to establish the relative
strengths in the blend and from 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column496" />Column number: 496</div>which fields the oil came, as it is the companies that face the tax. In
the case of PRT, the field of origin determines whether PRT is
applicable, so it is vitally important to sort out that blend. As I
said, co-mingling occurs when hydrocarbon from one field is mixed with
hydrocarbon from another during transportation to the UK or its first
port of discharge; and the hydrocarbon is then sold on as a
blend.</div>
<a name="09061867000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we look
at our sm√∂rg√•sbord of crude oil blends, including Brent,
Forties, Flotta, Wytch Farm, Beryl, Maureen and Triton&#151;the last
three being co-mingled and lifted off-shore&#151;the number of
contributing fields in each varies from two constituents in the case of
the simplest blends, such as Wytch Farm and Wareham, to more than 20 in
the case of Brent, which from August 1990 also incorporated the Ninian
system, and more than 30 in the Forties field. Similarly, a number of
co-mingled gas systems&#151;separate from oil&#151;exist, usually
named by reference to the pipeline or the terminal, such as SAGE, CATS,
FLAGS and LOGS. There is even one named after a part of the
country&#151;Easington. I think there is only
one.</div>
<a name="09061867000509"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div><a name="09061867000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section
63 of the Finance Act 1987 gave statutory effect to the arrangement
that has been used in the past for determining the taxation on those
blends or co-minglements. All participators in fields contributing to a
blend of oil were required to furnish details of the method of
allocation by 1 August 1987, or if later, within 30 days of making the
first allocation under that method. In other words, companies have to
report how the blend works. Failure to comply with that requirement
incurs a penalty of up to &#163;500 per participator, with a
subsequent daily penalty after the failure has been declared by the
court or commissioners. Any change in the method of allocation requires
details of the revised method to be notified within the same 30-day
time scale. What is important is that much of that arrangement will be
abolished, and I am pointing out the convenience of its abolition. I
have printed out a copy of the Government&#146;s guidance under the
Finance Act 1987 on exactly what must be done prior to the creation of
a blend or a reporting of the changes to a
blend.</div><a name="09061867000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposals in schedule 39 simplify the rules on allocation and drop the
requirement that routine changes be backed up by extensive
documentation sent to HMRC. The reform has been welcomed by the
industry, and will reduce the compliance work load that companies face.
The Government&#146;s criteria for reform, as set out in the
consultation document &#147;Supporting investment&#148;, fall under
seven broad headings: promote investment and production, ensure a fair
return for the UK taxpayer, be non-distortionary, be equitable, improve
stability, be sustainable and, most importantly, reduce the
administrative burden. In that abbreviated form it is difficult to
disagree with the criteria. The fuller explanations are more
substantive, but we find no issue with those criteria.</div>
<a name="09061867000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">Whether those
seven aims have been pursued as rigorously as they might have been in
the Finance Bill in general is open to debate. Schedule 39, besides
being equitable in the sense of not disproportionately affecting any
one section of companies, mainly lays claim to meeting the last
criterion&#151;a reduction in the administrative burden. The
explanation of the criterion in annex B of the &#147;Supporting
investment&#148; document reads:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column497" />Column number: 497</div><a name="09061867000490"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Any
changes to the fiscal regime should not increase the administrative
burden on companies involved in the North Sea, either by increasing the
complexity of the current regime, or through adding to the reporting
requirements. Government should also actively look to reduce the
administrative burden where
possible.&#148;</div><a name="09061867000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems that by simplifying the blended regime perhaps as far as
reasonably possible, the Government will at least have modestly
reduced, in this one area, the administrative burden facing the oil and
gas
sector.</div><a name="09061867000262"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000600"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I start by welcoming the Economic Secretary to the
debate. I said at the start of the debate on clause 83 that four
Ministers have been responsible for the North sea oil and gas regime
since the Bill was published, but in the short space of time since then
we have gone up to five. Nevertheless, I am delighted to see him in his
place and look forward to hearing his views on the sector over the
coming minutes.</div>
<a name="09061867000268"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061867000601"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Field</b> (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con): I am
sure that my hon. Friend will be delighted by the absence of the hon.
Member for Dundee, East, because it would have been pointed out that
there are, no doubt, several Members of the Scottish Parliament who are
also responsible for those matters. Dealing with the five Treasury
Ministers will be quite enough for the time
being.</div><a name="09061867000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000602"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> We have already reflected on the absence of the
hon. Member for Dundee, East, but I am told it is due to an
injury.</div><a name="09061867000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000603"></a>The
Lord Commissioner of Her Majesty's Treasury (Mr. Bob
Blizzard):</b> His daughter has broken her arm, and he has
given me his
apologies.</div><a name="09061867000271"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000604"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Yes, so I will not pursue that subject. Questions
of devolution, although probably interesting, are perhaps not pertinent
to clause 85 and schedule 40.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column498" />Column number: 498</div><a name="09061867000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am extremely
unhappy about the way that 31 Government amendments to
schedule 40 have been tabled. They might have reached the Clerks by the
time limit on Tuesday, but they did not arrive with me through the
internal post until 2 pm yesterday, despite the fact that I have
requested, as Members may now do, as you probably know, Mr.
Atkinson, to be bumped up to the maximum number of deliveries a day,
which I think is four. Previously I had my post delivered once a day,
but when I joined the Committee there was such an incoming load of
Government amendments and personnel changes that it seemed wise to
increase its
frequency.</div><a name="09061867000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
normal circumstances, with three or four amendments, tabling them so
late might be acceptable, but 31 Government amendments really is an
awful lot to digest, especially when dealing with so complex a
schedule. It is difficult for the Opposition to scrutinise the result
properly, when there is such a number of amendments. I should point out
that I submitted three or four amendments of my own, so I am not saying
that the Government alone are guilty, but submitting 31 Government
amendments at the last moment makes life extremely difficult, given the
resources with which Opposition parties
operate.</div><a name="09061867000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
debate will be slightly difficult because I believe that many of the
Government amendments are designed to overcome the problems highlighted
in our amendments. I will rely to some extent on the Economic Secretary
to explain the competing merits of some of the Government amendments,
relative to the merits of the Opposition amendments, because I cannot
say with absolute certainty what those are, having been unable to
devote the time needed to determine the merits of A or
B.</div><a name="09061867000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part
of enabling the maximum recovery of economic reserves from the UK
continental shelf in the future lies in ensuring that the licence
interests are in the hands of companies that are willing to invest. The
current chargeable gains system can deter companies from swapping or
trading assets to achieve that, and that is what schedule 40 is
intended to deal with by making it easier for companies to trade
assets.</div>
<a name="09061867000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">The schedule
has two parts. Part 1 extends chargeable gains exemptions on licence
swaps from being limited to pre-development licences, as is currently
the case, to being an exemption on all licence swaps. As before, the
licences will be required to be of equal value, but developed fields
can now also be traded among companies. That means that companies will
have greater scope to realign their assets. It should, therefore,
become easier to create concentrations of fields that could make
further investment more economic. In other words, in the latter part of
the life of a few of those fields, being able to trade them and perhaps
combine such a field with two or three smaller fields nearby would make
exploitation easier and more economic. That sounds like something we
want to encourage.</div>
<a name="09061867000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part 2 of the
schedule allows companies to avoid a chargeable gain on the sale of an
asset, provided that the proceeds from the sale are reinvested within
the North sea ring fence. Until now, a company making a disposal of a
UK licence interest is subject to corporation tax on the chargeable
gains that arise, although there is a possibility that the gain can be
held over by reinvesting the proceeds into certain classes of asset. If
the reinvestment is in a qualifying class of asset, the gain is held
over until 10 years have elapsed, or the new asset is disposed of,
whichever happens earlier. Part 2 takes most forms 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column499" />Column number: 499</div>of reinvestment out of chargeable gains altogether, as long as certain
conditions are met. The combined effect of both parts of the schedule
should stimulate asset trading in the UKCS, either by allowing assets
to be transferred to a company willing to invest in certain fields, or
by enabling a series of transactions to be undertaken to align
interests.</div>
<a name="09061867000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have tabled 31 amendments. My understanding is that they
would increase the number of licences that can be swapped in a single
transaction and tighten the definitions used in part 2. Broadly, they
seem to increase the flexibility of the schedule.</div>
<a name="09061867000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment 258 is especially welcome as it reflects a concern, raised
directly with me by the industry, that the schedule was drafted too
narrowly in excluding other companies within a group of companies from
the criteria for reinvestment. That is probably the most liberalising
amendment. The inclusion of other companies within a group, on the
condition that they are within the ring fence, is also sensible and
should increase the number of disposals, while at the same time
removing the temptation for companies to find ways to work around the
rules.</div>
<a name="09061867000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">In her letter
to the Committee setting out the amendments, the rather short-lived
Exchequer Secretary&#151;I think the hon. Member for Burnley lasted
nine days, all told, but she found time to write this letter&#151;she
explained that the amendments were</div>
<a name="09061867000491"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the result of
consultation with the industry following the publication of the Finance
Bill.&#148;</div><a name="09061867000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have said, the industry also raised those points with me and we
welcome the Government&#146;s willingness to listen and modify their
proposal.</div>
<a name="09061867000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">We tabled our
amendment 266 in an attempt to deal with the situation of groups. It
was anomalous to require that proceeds had to be reinvested by the
company&#151;the same company&#151;that realised the chargeable
gain, rather than extending the reinvestment provision to place it on a
group basis. That would have, or should have, given rise to greater
flexibility. Our amendment sought to exploit the similar arrangements
that related to holdover relief and to apply them to exemption. If the
Minister gives an assurance that the Government amendment will, in
practice, provide the same result, I shall be happy to withdraw
amendment 266.</div>
<a name="09061867000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the
Government appear to have accommodated groups of companies in response
to the feedback they received, they have not gone quite as far as they
could in other respects. In particular, it appears that insufficient
provision has been made for companies reinvesting in so-called subsea
tiebacks, where existing platforms are connected to new wells by an
underwater pipe. The new well is, as I understand the situation, dug
and is linked back to the platform via an additional new pipe; it is
like a satellite well. I think that is how those things work.</div>
<a name="09061867000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
explanatory notes state that where a company disposes of
business</div><a name="09061867000492"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;assets
used in connection with a UKCS field and the proceeds are reinvested in
other ring fence assets...the gain shall be treated as not being a
chargeable
gain.&#148;</div><a name="09061867000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, if one reinvests the proceeds, everything should be fine.
That seems clear, but all field assets are intended to come within the
scope of schedule 40. If there is any doubt, the explanatory notes
repeat that point the other way round.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column500" />Column number: 500</div><a name="09061867000493"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;where the assets
are sold and the proceeds are not reinvested in the UKCS, then the
disposals will be taxed in the normal
way.&#148;</div><a name="09061867000510"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.15
pm</div><a name="09061867000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
seems to be an assumption that everything should be within the scope of
schedule 40. However, it seems that reinvestment in UKCS does not
include the exploration appraisal and development of new
wells&#151;the so-called subsea tiebacks. Because of the way that
part 2 of schedule 40 is drafted, drilling new wells does not qualify
as reinvestment and is not seen as creating an
asset.</div>
<a name="09061867000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
that the industry&#146;s lobbying effort to exempt gains in general
was explicitly raised as an issue with one of the Minister&#146;s
multitude of predecessors. It is hard to know who dealt with that
lobbying effort, but the Economic Secretary is nodding, which shows
that he is aware of the situation faced by some of his colleagues, past
and present. Wells were explicitly raised as an issue, but the
Government appear to have ignored that plea, despite the fact that it
sits squarely within the schedule&#146;s intent. Indeed, in reading
the explanatory notes, one would think that wells are actually
included, but I do not think that they are. The Minister needs to
clarify that
point.</div><a name="09061867000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
increasing percentage of recent UK continental shelf developments have
been in subsea tiebacks, which are likely to continue to increase in
the future. The new wells are linked to existing
infrastructure&#151;the platform&#151;so there is an advantage in
having the wells provide the export route for the hydrocarbons. In most
cases, the developments will not support the cost of infrastructure in
their own right. As I understand it, on average, approximately 40 per
cent. of the cost of a subsea tieback development is associated with
the wells, so a significant proportion of the funds invested in future
developments will not qualify for the reinvestment relief. Bizarrely,
it appears that constructing a new well does not qualify for relief,
but constructing a tieback to the well does. I would be grateful if the
explained what precisely qualifies for the relief and whether the
explanatory notes accurately state that everything should be
accounted
for.</div><a name="09061867000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
262 to 265 are designed to rectify the problem. I am keen to hear the
Government&#146;s arguments on new wells and am willing to concede
that there may be easier means to achieve the end than those that we
have outlined in our amendments. If the Government can find a better
way to do it, so be it, but if there is a point of principle at stake,
I would like to hear
it.</div><a name="09061867000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
raison d&#146;√™tre of schedule 40 is to encourage new
investment in the North sea. It seems reasonable to extend the criteria
to cover fully one of the primary forms of development that that
investment needs to take, and there do not appear to be any additional
costs associated with that step. Preventing reinvestment from incurring
a chargeable gain should surely mean just that. I look forward to
hearing the Minister&#146;s explanation of the competing sets of
amendments and that all parts of the assets described will qualify
under schedule 40.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000605"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Clause 85 builds upon existing reliefs and
reforms the treatment of chargeable gains arising within the ring fence
regime to ensure that oil and gas assets are in the hands of those most
likely to develop them. The first change enacted by the clause is that,

<div class="Column"><a name="Column501" />Column number: 501</div>where companies swap licence interests for developed areas within the UK
continental shelf, the disposal of the licence interest will not give
rise to a chargeable gain or to an allowable loss where the
consideration received is also a developed licence interest. That will
enable gas and oil companies to swap licence interests that they do not
intend to fully develop with other companies to build hubs, around
which further development will take place. That will increase
production and extend the life of North sea infrastructure, which is a
policy objective of
ours.</div><a name="09061867000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second reform is that, where a company disposes of oil and gas assets
used in a ring fence trade and reinvests the proceeds in further ring
fence assets, the company may make a claim that any gain arising is not
chargeable, provided that the reinvestment has taken place no more than
12 months before or three years after the disposal. That provides an
additional incentive for companies that make disposals of such assets
to reinvest the proceeds in further acquiring and developing UK oil
fields and infrastructure in order to enable the development of the
North sea to reach its full economic potential. Where a company
disposes of assets and removes the proceeds from the North sea
altogether, they will still face a chargeable
gain.</div><a name="09061867000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a number of amendments to schedule 40. I apologise to the
hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham that he did not have the text of
the amendments further in advance. We have probably relied too much on
the internal post system. We ought to investigate if there are better
ways of communicating with Opposition Front Benchers, to ensure that
they have any Government amendments in as timely a manner as possible.
I will ask my officials to see whether that can be
done.</div><a name="09061867000294"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000606"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. In fairness to everybody, I want to make
it clear to the Committee that the text of the amendments was on the
Order Paper on Tuesday, as I recall. I think that it is the letter that
was delayed. However, the text of the amendments was here on Tuesday
afternoon; I saw it. So the text of the amendments was available. In
fact, I am told that it was available on Tuesday
morning.</div><a name="09061867000295"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000607"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I welcome that clarification. However, I am keen
to ensure that our information flows are as good as possible, so that
the hon. Gentleman has the information that he feels that he needs in
this area.</div>
<a name="09061867000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, I want
to stress that the Government amendments are technical amendments,
which build on the reforms introduced in the existing schedule. As the
hon. Gentleman mentioned, they have been introduced as a result of
further constructive meetings with oil and gas stakeholders following
publication of the Finance Bill. That was confirmed in the letter from
my hon. Friend the Member for Burnley.</div>
<a name="09061867000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government amendments extend the proposed legislation to ensure that it
applies in the full range of asset trading circumstances that may occur
in relation to the North sea. Although there are a large number of
Government amendments to the schedule&#151;31 in all&#151;I assure
the Committee that they cover only four areas. The first two relate to
part 1 of the schedule and deal 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column502" />Column number: 502</div>with licence swaps. They will allow companies to swap licence interests
in developed areas for licence interests in undeveloped areas, and to
swap multiple licences in a single
transaction.</div>
<a name="09061867000298"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000608"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I may be getting confused about something that I
was not previously confused about. Is it also possible to swap assets
in developed fields for other assets in developed fields, or is it
possible only to swap developed assets for undeveloped
assets?</div><a name="09061867000299"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000609"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I will come on to that point in a moment,
hopefully. However, what I said was that the change would allow
companies to swap licence interests in developed areas for licence
interests in undeveloped areas and to swap multiple licences in a
single transaction.</div>
<a name="09061867000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third and
fourth changes relate to part 2 of the schedule, which deals with
reinvestment of ring fence assets. The third change will act to ensure
that, where an asset trade has involved both a licence swap and a cash
consideration, companies will be required to reinvest only the cash
consideration, rather than the entire proceeds of the asset trade, to
receive full roll-over relief.</div>
<a name="09061867000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fourth
change will ensure that the grouping rules, which apply more widely to
reinvestment reliefs outside the North sea ring fence, apply equally to
the new North sea reinvestment relief. I believe that that change
covers the issue raised by amendment 266, which is one of the
Conservative amendments. I confirm to the hon. Member for Hammersmith
and Fulham that the Government changes have the same effect as that
amendment was intended to have.</div>
<a name="09061867000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we are all
evidently agreed on the importance of the grouping rules applying to
the legislation, I trust that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to
withdraw his amendment and that he will support the Government
amendments, which we believe are technically
superior.</div>
<a name="09061867000303"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000610"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Will the Minister explain something in relation to
amendment 266? He seems to be saying that a collection of Government
amendments would have the same effect&#151;an identical
effect&#151;as that single amendment would have. Would it not be
easier to take the single, stand-alone Opposition amendment, rather
than a panoply of Government amendments that try to achieve the same
purpose?</div>
<a name="09061867000304"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000611"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I am advised that it would not be easier, which
is why the Government amendments have been drafted as they
have.</div>
<a name="09061867000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">In response
to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s previous question about swapping
developed assets for other developed assets, I can confirm that the
legislation already allows the swapping of developed assets for other
developed assets and the swapping of undeveloped assets for other
undeveloped assets to take place. The change we are proposing now
completes the picture.</div>
<a name="09061867000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
it has become clear from what I have said that the Government are
willing to listen to what stakeholders have to say on this subject and
to take action. However I am unable to recommend amendments 262 to 265
to the Committee. As I understand them, they are designed to add costs
incurred in drilling a well to the definitions of relevant assets that
can be reinvested in for the purposes of the reinvestment relief in
schedule 40. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column503" />Column number: 503</div>However, they do not provide any further definition of exactly what
costs are to be included within the term &#147;well costs&#148; and
what are to be excluded. The general reference to &#147;well
costs&#148; does not state what the chargeable gains asset is that
would be being reinvested in. Indeed, from a chargeable gains asset
perspective, it is not at all clear why the amendments are required,
because where a chargeable gains asset is being invested in for the
purposes of drilling wells, it would be covered by the
Government&#146;s proposed
legislation.</div><a name="09061867000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the amendments refer to general well-drilling expenditure, because that
is not expenditure on either a licence or plant and machinery and hence
would not itself be liable to chargeable gains, it would not come
within the chargeable gains regime. Consequently it would be incorrect
if it were eligible for the reinvestment relief. I remind the Committee
that such general well-drilling expenditure already receives generous
tax reliefs, for example through mineral extraction
allowances.</div>
<a name="09061867000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman is correct in his assessment that tieback infrastructure
would be eligible, although the costs of drilling wells are not. We are
aware of industry&#146;s view that exploration and appraisal
expenditure should qualify for the relief, and we are willing to
discuss the matter further with the industry.</div>
<a name="09061867000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, I
hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw amendment 266,
as it is already covered by Government amendments, as well as the other
Opposition amendments in the group. We are more than happy to engage
further with the industry on these important
matters.</div>
<a name="09061867000310"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000615"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Thank you, Mr. Atkinson, for your
guidance on our amendments to schedule 40. I assume that it will be
convenient to discuss schedule 41 at the same time as the clause. The
issue addressed by schedule 41 is another aspect of the problem that I
raised in relation to clause 83 and schedule 38. Because of its size
the relief on decommissioning costs assumes such importance that it can
override all other considerations when a field is nearing the end of
its life.</div>
<a name="09061867000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of those
considerations is the potential to adapt the infrastructure already in
place to use fields for gas storage, carbon capture or wind power.
Having taken oil or gas out, it is possible to pump gas or the carbon
emissions from an onshore power station back in. That is the basis of
carbon capture and storage. But that requires leaving the pipes and all
the other related infrastructure in place. Companies are under a legal
obligation, as we explored on clause 83 and schedule 38, to remove all
that infrastructure from the seabed when it is deactivated. As the
legislation stood, had they allowed a change of use, companies would
have had great difficulty in recouping the decommissioning costs later,
which is the basis of the measure today.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column508" />Column number: 508</div><a name="09061867000511"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30
pm</div><a name="09061867000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the Government&#146;s November paper
found,</div><a name="09061867000494"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Industry
argue that effective access to decommissioning relief is a critical
issue when considering the economics of a change of use project, and
that the current treatment is extremely likely to result in a change of
use activity not going ahead where it utilised existing infrastructure
that was expected to have a substantial decommissioning
cost.&#148;</div><a name="09061867000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, we are looking at tax relief for decommissioning
infrastructure and at whether we want to encourage its use for other
purposes, such as carbon capture and storage, wind power and so
on.</div><a name="09061867000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">Carbon
capture or schemes involving power generation do not fall within the
North sea ring fence. Equally, there are clear potential benefits from
allowing infrastructure to be reused. Schedule 41 represents the
Government&#146;s view following many years examining the problems of
and opportunities for change of use. We welcome it, even though it has
been a long time coming. Many changes are still theoretical and we are
a long way from seeing North sea carbon capture projects or some of the
other uses under discussion. However, measures that enable such
projects to be at least considered are
welcome.</div><a name="09061867000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
debate provides an opportunity to put three important questions to the
Minister, which may assume greater significance if decommissioning
begins to be postponed. First, what level have Government liabilities
for relief for decommissioning reached? Secondly, how are the
liabilities likely to be distributed over future years and decades?
Thirdly, are they included in the Government&#146;s accounts or are
they another example of off-balance sheet liabilities, like PFI
projects and public sector pensions? Those questions are important. I
am not entirely clear how the future liabilities are dealt with on the
Government&#146;s balance sheet.</div>
<a name="09061867000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many of the
current potential change of use projects are at best marginal
economically, and the potentially significant tax charges that could
have arisen on implementation of the projects were a major disincentive
to companies even starting to evaluate such projects, so the changes
appear to move us in the right
direction.</div><a name="09061867000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Opposition value all efforts to make CCS and alternative energy
generation more attractive through the tax regime. The changes remove a
barrier, but they do not, in themselves, ensure that these important
industry developments take place. Nevertheless, we welcome the
provisions, but I await the Minister&#146;s explanation of where
future liabilities are accounted for.</div>
<a name="09061867000363"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000616"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I am glad that the official Opposition welcome
clause 86 and schedule 41. Their purpose is to remove tax barriers to
the reuse for other activities of oil and gas infrastructure. I shall
briefly go into detail on the schedule. It removes potential tax
barriers where oil and gas production assets are reused for so-called
&#147;change of use&#148; projects, particularly, as the hon.
Gentleman noted, carbon capture and storage, gas storage and wind power
generation.</div><a name="09061867000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
schedule has three main effects. First, it ensures that a petroleum
revenue tax charge does not arise when a PRT asset is subsequently used
for another purpose. Under current legislation, when a PRT asset is
used for an activity unrelated to oil production, a portion of the PRT
relief given for the cost of the asset is clawed back. That could
entail a significant tax charge for the company 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column509" />Column number: 509</div>in question and may deter it from embarking on change of use projects.
The schedule removes the possibility of such a tax charge. It has been
welcomed by the industry as well as by the hon. Gentleman.</div>
<a name="09061867000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the
schedule will ensure that profits from change of use projects that
reuse PRT assets are not liable to pay PRT. Again, the existing rules
state that income derived from PRT assets is liable for PRT no matter
how the asset is used. However, change of use profits are clearly
beyond the intended scope of the PRT regime, which was designed
primarily to capture the super-profits from oil and gas production.
Consequently, the schedule will remove such income from the scope
of
PRT.</div><a name="09061867000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
the schedule will ensure that companies that embark upon a change of
use project can still gain access to the same tax relief for the cost
of decommissioning infrastructure that they would have had at the end
of oil and gas production. Again, that will remove the existing
perverse incentive to decommission infrastructure, rather than to reuse
it, which is an objective we support.</div>
<a name="09061867000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government believe that the UK will gain major benefits from the
removal of the barriers to change of use projects. As I have mentioned,
such projects can make a significant contribution to reducing carbon
emissions and to ensuring that the UK has a secure energy supply. As
the hon. Gentleman will be aware from today&#146;s statement in the
House on climate impact projections, there is a need to continue the
drive to develop a low-carbon economy in the UK. We should ensure that,
where appropriate, the tax system provides sufficient incentives for
things that are public policy goods and removes perverse incentives not
to do such things. That is widely accepted as the right thing to
do.</div><a name="09061867000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important to recognise that such projects have the potential to
bring investment and employment to the North sea long after the
production of oil and gas has ceased. In addition, the deferral of the
decommissioning of oil and gas infrastructure by companies will benefit
the UK by deferring the point at which the Exchequer must give tax
relief for decommissioning expenditure. Given the economic
circumstances, that will benefit Government
overall.</div><a name="09061867000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause will ensure that when a company is faced with whether to
decommission depleted oil and gas infrastructure or reuse it for a
change of use project, it will not be deterred from engaging in
activities that could be beneficial to the company and to the UK as a
whole. That is why I believe it should stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="09061867000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham mentioned decommissioning costs.
Those are currently estimated at &#163;20 billion. Tax relief could
lead to the Government effectively paying 50 per cent. of that. The
time scale will depend on how and when the assets are decommissioned.
That will depend on a range of variables, such as the prevailing oil
price.</div><a name="09061867000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not currently able to advise the hon. Gentleman on accounting
practices, but am more than happy to write to him with the
detail.</div><a name="09061867000372"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000617"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I must say I am surprised that the Minister is
unable to tell us what is the accounting practice for this potential
liability of up to &#163;10 billion. That sounds

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000619"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000620"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon.
Gentleman. Speaking of being brief, I warn the Committee that by 4
o&#146;clock we will have sat for three hours. At about that time, I
propose to have a short
adjournment.</div><a name="09061867000381"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000621"></a>Mr.
Blizzard:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson.
Thank you for that announcement. We had an agreement to finish clause
90 and the corresponding schedule today. I think the mood of the
Committee is that it would be better if we could finish it without
adjourning, so I hope that we can have a common purpose and move that
way. Would you permit us, if necessary to go a little beyond 4
o&#146;clock in order to expedite
that?</div><a name="09061867000382"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000622"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Further to that point of order, Mr.
Atkinson, we did not have that agreement. I was saying that we should
stick to the schedule laid out by the Government at the beginning of
the Bill, which would mean that we will continue discussing oil when we
return on Tuesday. Clause 89, schedule 44, on which we intend to have a
Division, is very
substantial.</div><a name="09061867000383"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000623"></a>The
Chairman:</b> These are matters, not for the Chair, but for
the usual channels. I am giving guidance to the Committee because,
unlike honourable Members, the Clerk and I cannot keep going out, so
after about three hours, it is useful to have a break. If the Committee
is aiming to get towards the end of the business on oil, I will be
flexible about when we adjourn, however, at 4 o&#146;clock
or slightly after, I propose to adjourn the Committee. That is in the
hands of Committee Members and the usual
channels.</div><a name="09061867000384"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000624"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Thank you, Mr Atkinson, for that clarification. I
mentioned clause 89, but we are on clause 87 and schedule 42. Schedule
42 deals with the oldest, or first-round licences, that are due to
expire in 2010 and proposes a way in which extended licences can be
issued, and decommissioning relief against petroleum revenue tax, PRT,
can be carried over for the licence 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column511" />Column number: 511</div>holder, after both extension and expiry. The existing position for PRT,
which applies, as we know, only to fields developed before 1993, was
summarised in the Government&#146;s consultation response in
November:</div><a name="09061867000495"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;When
a field reaches the end of its productive life and decommissioning
costs are incurred, to the extent that such costs are deductible for
PRT purposes, any losses arising can be carried back for offset against
profits from the field without limit, subject to the retention of the
licence or within two chargeable periods of the relinquishment of the
licence&#148;.</div><a name="09061867000385"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I understand the PRT regime, a chargeable period is a period of six
months. I think the Minister is confirming that. So, under current
legislation, PRT relief for decommissioning expenditure is not
available to a company if those costs have been incurred for more than
12 months&#151;two PRT periods&#151;after it has ceased
to be a licence holder in respect of that taxable field. The new rules
will allow relief for such expenditure, but will also ensure that any
income that may arise in respect of the assets in question will also be
chargeable to
PRT.</div><a name="09061867000386"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
changes, as I understand them, provide necessary clarity on what should
happen if a license expires, or is due to expire, before this can
happen. As it stood, if a company ceased to be a licensee, its
obligation to decommission would remain, but finding itself outside the
PRT regime, it would not have been able to relieve this cost against
the PRT it had previously paid. Companies will now continue to be
deemed to be licence holders for PRT purposes after the licence has
expired. The extended licences themselves will be deemed to have
expired at the point when production stops. We think this is a
relatively neat solution to that problem, it has been broadly welcomed
and addresses a real issue. We therefore see no reason to oppose the
solution that DECC has put forward and that schedule 42 would
implement.</div><a name="09061867000387"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000625"></a>Ian

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000626"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Clause 88 and schedule 43&#151;I presume that it
will be convenient to debate the schedule at the same
time&#151;relate to the abolition of the provisional expenditure
allowance. Provisional expenditure allowance has, as the Government
suggest, ceased to be appropriate. It was intended to provide relief
against PRT for start-up costs, but as no field that has started up
since 1993 is subject to PRT, it is no longer required. Moreover, its
continued existence has caused claw-back problems for some companies
that have been hit by what the Government refer to as unintended and
detrimental tax charges. Further provisional expenditure already
granted will be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column512" />Column number: 512</div>clawed back in the following 12 months. No one appears to be in favour
of its retention, and we do not represent an
exception.</div><a name="09061867000393"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
we know, PRT differs from other taxes in that expenditure relief does
not reduce a company&#146;s tax liability until the expenditure has
been claimed by the company and allowed by HMRC. When the expenditure
has been claimed and allowed, it reduces PRT for the next half-yearly
assessment&#151;the six-month PRT assessment period&#151;rather
than necessarily for the half-yearly period in which it was
incurred.</div>
<a name="09061867000394"></a><div class="hs_Para">To compensate
somewhat for the consequential timing disadvantages that might,
therefore, ensue, section 2 of the Oil Taxation Act 1975 provides for a
provisional allowance for each chargeable period. That provisional
allowance is calculated under section 2(9)(a) and section 2(11) of the
Act by reference to two components. If the first is greater than the
second, the difference between them is the amount of provisional
allowance to be given in the assessment together with any expenditure
already allowed and linked to the chargeable period. Conversely, if the
second exceeds the first, no provisional allowance is due. This is a
rather complicated set of provisions. We have checked the Act to ensure
that we have got things absolutely
straight.</div><a name="09061867000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first of the two components&#151;remember that if the second exceeds
the first, no provisional allowance is due&#151;under section 2(9)(a)
of the 1975 Act is 5 per cent. of the amount included in the
participator&#146;s return&#151;under section 2(2) of the 1975
Act&#151;in respect of its estimate of the total sale proceeds or
market values computed in accordance with section 3(2) of sales and
appropriations of oil for the chargeable period. The
participator&#146;s estimate of the market value of non-arm&#146;s
length disposals is used regardless of whether the oil taxation office
subsequently agrees a higher or lower figure to be included in the
assessment under section 2(5)(b) and section 2(5)(c) of the 1975
Act.</div><a name="09061867000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the participator fails to submit a return and an estimated assessment
is made, no provisional allowance is available. Once a return is made,
a provisional allowance based on the incomings returned is made
automatically.</div><a name="09061867000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me return to our consideration of whether the second component exceeds
the first. The second component is the amount of any expenditure
claimed under sections 5 and 6&#151;but not any related
supplement&#151;which was incurred in the chargeable period in
question and which has been allowed by the oil taxation office for
inclusion in the assessment for that chargeable period. That is an
outline of what we have in front of us, which this clause and schedule
are seeking to abolish.</div>
<a name="09061867000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for the
clawback, the 5 per cent. allowance is provisional and section 2 of the
1975 Act prescribes a clawback of the relief given. Subject to
additional rules, also in section 2, any provisional expenditure
allowance given in a particular chargeable period is clawed back in the
next but one chargeable
period.</div><a name="09061867000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section
2 of the 1975 Act modifies the basic rule in two ways. Under section
2(10)(a), where expenditure allowed in a chargeable period was incurred
in the immediately preceding period and provisional allowance was given
in that period, a further adjustment is required. The clawback in the
computation of any 5 per cent. provisional allowance given in the last
but one chargeable period will be increased by an amount equal to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column513" />Column number: 513</div>expenditure now allowed which was incurred in respect of the immediately
preceding chargeable period&#151;the six-month periods under which
the petroleum revenue taxation operates&#151;or the 5 per cent.
provisional allowance of the immediately preceding chargeable period,
whichever is the lower figure. However, under section 2(10)(b) of the
same Act, the clawback of provisional allowance given for the last but
one chargeable period is reduced by the equivalent amount of any
increase made under section 2(10)(a) of the Oil Taxation Act 1975 in
the assessment for the immediately preceding chargeable
period.</div><a name="09061867000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
point is that those seem to be fiendishly complicated regulations, and
the clause and the schedule before us appear to have the worthy aim of
simplifying our tax code and seeking to extract those regulations from
it. No one seems to favour their retention, and we certainly do not
represent an
exception.</div><a name="09061867000401"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000628"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> This clause probably contains the most important
changes to the North sea oil and gas regime in part 6 of the Bill, and
I expect that we will want to press amendment 267 in due
course.</div><a name="09061867000407"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
89 refers to schedule 44. The other clauses and schedules that we have
discussed so far either represent relatively small changes or seek to
create conditions in which it is easier for new investment to take
place. Schedule 44, however, is the only part of the
Government&#146;s package that attempts to offer direct incentives to
invest, and it is therefore worth recalling what the Government have
said about the need for incentives. In their document,
&#147;Supporting investment: a consultation on the North Sea fiscal
regime&#148; they described the UK continental shelf
as</div><a name="09061867000496"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;facing
increasing challenges due to its nature as a maturing basin. The easy
to recover hydrocarbons have been exploited and the remaining
opportunities are, increasingly, either smaller in size or require the
use of cutting edge technologies to enable extraction. One result of
this is that many potential projects have become commercially marginal
and unable to compete with other projects around the globe. These
challenges are exacerbated by the current uncertainty over future oil
prices and the high cost levels faced within the North
Sea.&#148;</div><a name="09061867000408"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule
44 is the Government&#146;s attempt to answer that commercial
marginality and struggle for capital expenditure. We see it as a fairly
limited attempt to address the problem.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column514" />Column number: 514</div><a name="09061867000409"></a><div class="hs_Para">Oil and Gas UK
was formed by and represents the industry, and has met with both the
Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Prime Minister. I am not sure how
many Exchequer Secretaries it has had the pleasure of meeting in recent
days&#151;as we know, there have been three in the past nine days. I
am not exactly sure who it has had the chance to meet with on that
front. Nevertheless, at various times Oil and Gas UK has met with the
Government to discuss the future of the North sea. In its public
response to the Budget&#151;three Exchequer Secretaries ago&#151;it
said:</div>
<a name="09061867000497"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Oil
and Gas UK members have voiced their deep concern to us at what has
been left undone by the 2009 Budget. In the current climate, the
package of measures will have limited impact on the UKCS&#146;s
economics, will have little effect on the UK&#146;s competitiveness
and attractiveness to investment and will not lead to any significant
increase in activity....The consequences of the failure to act
decisively could be severe. Current economic circumstances are already
placing industry work programmes under extreme pressure. The fiscal
measures announced in April may help a small number of projects but
will not reverse the significant decline in capital investment forecast
by Oil &amp; Gas UK &#151; to around &#163;3 billion by
2010.&#148;</div><a name="09061867000410"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a fairly damning indictment of Government policy from the industry,
at least in relation to the 2009 Budget, especially given the warmth of
some of their other comments in relation to the actual consultation
process. The industry was very open and supportive of the
Government&#146;s willingness to consult, but it has turned out to be
extremely disappointed by the result of the consultation.</div>
<a name="09061867000411"></a><div class="hs_Para">Oil and Gas
UK does not stop there. Its response
continues:</div><a name="09061867000498"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Under-investment
at this stage in the mature UKCS life risks fatally undermining the
government's stated goal of maximising the recovery of the UK&#146;s
remaining oil and gas reserves. Without new injection of oil and gas
from the development of outlying satellite fields, key offshore
infrastructure hubs will risk seeing their decommissioning being
brought forward...Once these strategic platforms and their
pipelines are removed, it is unlikely that they will ever be replaced
and the means to recover the estimated remaining oil and gas reserves
of up to 20-25 billion barrels...will be
lost.&#148;</div><a name="09061867000412"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
that is a damning indictment of the Government&#146;s approach from
UK Oil and Gas. It is clear that the industry does not&#151;I see
that we are joined by the new Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, the
hon. Member for Portsmouth, North. I should start off by welcoming her
to her new position as today&#146;s Exchequer Secretary. I look
forward to a number&#151;or a panoply, or sm√∂rg√•sbord
of debates on different issues to
come.</div><a name="09061867000413"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
industry does not see the new field allowance that the Government are
proposing as the answer and certainly not in its current form. We have
some sympathy with the argument put forward by the
industry.</div><a name="09061867000414"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s proposals in schedule 38 will create an allowance
against the supplementary charge&#151;in other words, the 20 per
cent. charge, which was increased from 10 per cent., that is applied to
ring-fenced profits as a supplement to corporation tax. That brings the
overall marginal tax rate on new fields to 50 per cent. As we know, the
new allowance will apply to three kinds of fields; small fields,
ultra-heavy oil fields and high-pressure, high-temperature
fields.</div>
<a name="09061867000415"></a><div class="hs_Para">The small
fields that the Government talk about will have to be very small and
the allowance is set relatively low. We do not intend to debate those
at great length today. As a result of this measure, the industry
expects 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column515" />Column number: 515</div>only one or two more fields to have been brought into development than
would otherwise have been the case in the short to medium term. The
small-field change is not a particularly significant change in the
legislation.</div>
<a name="09061867000416"></a><div class="hs_Para">We touched on
the question of ultra-heavy oil earlier. If you turned a cup full of
heavy oil upside down, it would not come out; it is that heavy. There
are huge technical problems to be surmounted before ultra-heavy oil can
begin to be properly exploited, although there is plenty to be had if
this can be done.</div>
<a name="09061867000417"></a><div class="hs_Para">The category
of high-pressure, high-temperature fields has left the industry feeling
aggrieved. This is a consistent view across the major players whom I
have met with in recent weeks. BP, for example, describes the field
allowance as being of negligible impact. None of their HPHT discoveries
would qualify for the new allowance. Only one HPHT discovery, across
the whole of the UK continental shelf, is thought to meet the
Government&#146;s combined temperature and pressure criteria, and
that is the Jackdaw field owned by British Gas. This would cover only
one new field. Of course, that is only looking at fields which have
been discovered to date&#151;others may be found. I understand that a
combined temperature and pressure rule, which the Opposition seek to
amend here, is not a good way to get people to look for these HPHT
fields, as there is no consistent relationship between high temperature
and high pressure.</div>
<a name="09061867000513"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4
pm</div><a name="09061867000418"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nor,
I am told, is a high-pressure, low-temperature or a low-pressure, high-
temperature field any easier to handle than a high-pressure,
high-temperature field. In other words, removing one of the two areas
of difficulty and having it either high- pressure or high-temperature
does not necessarily make it any easier to exploit.</div>
<a name="09061867000419"></a><div class="hs_Para">Oil and Gas
UK have written to the Treasury to make six points on behalf of the
industry as a whole. First, the ultra-HPHT target is too tightly
defined to deliver the required benefit. Secondly, the ultra-HPHT
target does not mark the break from subsea to platform-based
development. Thirdly, other HPHT fields face similar development costs
to ultra-HPHT fields. Fourthly, the requirement to meet both ultra-high
temperature and ultra-high pressure is simply too onerous. Fifthly,
both ultra-HPHT pressure and temperature limits are set too high.
Sixthly, with modifications, the field allowance still has the
potential to influence HPHT exploration activity. So Oil and Gas UK are
looking for
modifications.</div><a name="09061867000420"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
amendment seeks to relax the requirement in schedule 44 to meet both
the pressure and the temperature criteria at the same time, so that
only one of the two needs to be met. It must be either high pressure or
high temperature. This would help to reduce the random, lottery-winner
nature of the clause as it stands, and do more for exploration. Even
this amendment would still bring only a handful of known but
undeveloped fields within the scope of the allowance. It is not an
extremely radical approach. We just believe that what is brought in
under the schedule should be widened a little to try to encourage more
exploration. I am sure that we all agree that that is of huge
importance to this country and to our tax
intake.</div><a name="09061867000421"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
the Chancellor announced the field allowance during the Budget speech
on 22 April, he believed that it would encourage the development of the
equivalent of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column516" />Column number: 516</div>about 2 billion barrels. As the clause stands, the Chancellor&#146;s
claim looks wholly implausible. It is open to the Government to talk to
the industry and revisit the limits once the Finance Bill has gone
through the House. That is fair enough.</div>
<a name="09061867000422"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000629"></a>Ian

<a name="09061867000423"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000630"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I see the Economic Secretary nodding. The limits
are open to adjustment by statutory instrument. In fact, any of the
definitions of small oil field, ultra heavy oil field or ultra
high-pressure, high-temperature field set out in paragraphs 20 to 23,
and also the total field allowance levels specified by paragraph 24,
can be amended by statutory order. That is made clear in paragraph
17.</div><a name="09061867000424"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is worth pointing out that no costs are incurred either by our
amendment, or by lowering the limits. There is some difficulty in
trying to understand the fiscal implications. There is just an
unquantifiable loss of revenue from fields that may have been developed
anyway to be balanced against an unquantifiable increase in revenue
from fields where exploration and development would not have occurred
without it. We are looking at hypothetical revenue and allowances
against it. I will listen with interest to the Minister&#146;s view
of this balance and where it lies. At the moment the proposals seem far
too restrictive.</div>
<a name="09061867000425"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said
when opening my remarks, when it comes to providing new incentives for
fresh investment, schedule 44 is the Government&#146;s only current
answer. Hence it is worth noting the two policy areas it has left
untouched. The first is also a geographical area&#151;the west of
Shetland area. In our debate on an earlier clause, I said that we would
be returning to that geographical area
later.</div><a name="09061867000426"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I mentioned earlier, the UKCS is far more extensive than the North sea.
There is also the Atlantic, where there is oil too. Even old North sea
hands seem to become rather white at the knuckles when they describe
the weather conditions west of Shetland and some of the other
difficulties involved in working in that environment, with its deep
water and atrocious weather. However, the rewards would be substantial
and the Government have failed to do anything in the Bill that would
make the exploitation of that area more
likely.</div><a name="09061867000427"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have established a joint west of Shetland taskforce with
industry representatives and I would be grateful for news of any
progress that that taskforce has made when the
Minister&#151;whichever Minister it is&#151;responds to the
debate.</div>
<a name="09061867000428"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
second, wider problem. The Government are only talking about providing
incentives for new fields. There are no incentives for existing fields
and no such incentives appear to be under consideration. Where fields
are still going strong, by definition no incentives are required.
However, fields nearing the end of their life are a different matter
and a significant and increasing number of fields are in that category.
I return to my earlier point that we are now just under two thirds of
the way through the proven oil and gas reserves that are under the
North sea.</div>
<a name="09061867000429"></a><div class="hs_Para">Encouraged by
the Government, smaller companies have already come in and are
specialising in the different operating challenges that such
fields&#151;the ones nearing the end of their lives&#151;present.
Those companies possess 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column517" />Column number: 517</div>a readiness and willingness to invest at that end-life stage. To take
just one example, Talisman Energy now operates in 23 different fields,
which is a higher number than for any other group on the UKCS.
Therefore, although it is a relatively smaller and newer entrant to the
sector, Talisman Energy operates in more fields than any of the
existing big players.</div>
<a name="09061867000430"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
changed financial background against which companies have to operate
will make it difficult to mop up all the remaining oil and gas. I would
appreciate it if the Minister explained the Government&#146;s
approach to encouraging companies to invest in existing fields, as
there is nothing in the clause&#151;in fact, there is nothing in the
entire Bill&#151;to help those
companies.</div><a name="09061867000431"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
conclude, clause 89 is the most important clause in the Bill in terms
of the considerations about North sea oil. The industry welcomes the
existence of the new field allowance, which is designed to help the
exploitation of small fields and fields that are difficult to reach.
Schedule 44, in so far as it goes, is also welcomed by the industry,
but nobody thinks that it goes very far. Our amendment to schedule 44
would take it a little bit further by removing one of the lottery
elements, in other words the fact that a field has to qualify for both
&#147;high pressure&#148; and &#147;high temperature&#148; to
qualify for the relief. Our amendment would remove that lottery
element.</div>
<a name="09061867000432"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Minister, in responding to the debate, will explore the possibility
of going further still in this area, or at least offer some better
explanations as to why the Government are unwilling to do so. While the
days of plenty in the North sea are starting to fade, there is the
prospect of more adventurous and still more profitable activity for
decades to come. Whatever that may entail, what we know for certain is
that one new field, which is what we are talking about here with
schedule 44, simply will not cut the mustard. Unless we hear some
convincing arguments from the Minister, we will therefore seek to put
amendment 267 to the
vote.</div><a name="09061867000433"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061867000631"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Clause 89 introduces a new field allowance into
the North sea fiscal regime, which will have the effect of reducing the
profits liable to supplementary charge for certain categories of new
field that have development concerns, on or after 22 April
2009.</div>
<a name="09061867000434"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government believe that the measure can play a significant role in
ensuring that the North sea meets its full potential. We estimate that
it could lead to the production of an additional 2 billion barrels of
oil and gas, which might otherwise have been left in the ground. That
will be of major benefit, ensuring that the UKCS continues to be a
significant industrial success, with the employment skills and
technological benefits that that success brings. Furthermore, it will
benefit the UK more widely, by helping to secure the UK&#146;s energy
supply.</div>
<a name="09061867000435"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of
stakeholders have warmly welcomed the measure. For instance, Oil &amp;
Gas UK, in commenting on the overall package of measures,
said:</div>
<a name="09061867000499"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
acknowledge this demonstration of the Government&#146;s commitment to
the future of this industry in the UK. The measures announced today are
a positive step for those companies trying to develop small and
challenging fields in this mature, high cost
province.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column518" />Column number: 518</div><a name="09061867000436"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Oil and Gas
Independents&#146; Association
said:</div><a name="09061867000500"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Today&#146;s
announcement by the Chancellor will assist both small and large
independent companies to continue their activities...the OGIA believes
this is an important first step in making the UKCS fiscal regime
competitive.&#148;</div><a name="09061867000437"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
there is broad support for clause 89 and schedule 44.
</div><a name="09061867000438"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
267 on the face of it seems relatively simple. It would change one of
the qualifying criteria for an oilfield to receive the new field
allowance from needing to be both ultra-high pressure and ultra-high
temperature to needing to be either ultra-high pressure or ultra-high
temperature. The hon. Gentleman went into some detail in explaining it.
I assume the amendment has been introduced to increase the number of
existing fields that are eligible for that allowance. The hon.
Gentleman suggested that the Government&#146;s measure is very
limited. We certainly want to maximise the potential benefits to the UK
of the Government&#146;s policy proposals in this area.</div>
<a name="09061867000439"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
requirement for a field to be both ultra-high pressure and ultra-high
temperature was decided upon following extensive consultation with a
broad range of stakeholders. It is intended to provide significant
support for investment whether in exploration, appraisal or development
of some of the most technologically challenging and demanding
reservoirs in the North sea. In the course of those discussions, the
clear impression given to Government was that these challenges occurred
when both criteria were found in a reservoir, not just one. Reservoirs
with both extremely high pressures and temperatures need most support.
Equally, given the size of the incentive on offer, the criteria are
also carefully targeted at those developments that most need it and
would not go to developments that would proceed regardless. We believe
this approach is necessary to provide maximum value for money for UK
taxpayers. On the basis of the evidence presented to us, to relax those
criteria, as proposed in the amendment, would run the risk of giving
support to fields that do not face the degree of challenge that this
allowance was intended to support, at a potentially significant cost to
the Exchequer, while providing little extra benefit to the UK.
Therefore, while I understand what the hon. Gentleman is seeking to
achieve, I cannot recommend that the Committee accept the
amendment.</div>
<a name="09061867000440"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked a number of specific questions to which I shall briefly
respond. Regarding the number of fields eligible for the field
allowance, it is impossible to estimate the number able to claim. It
will depend on the number of discoveries made by companies in the
coming years. One benefit of the allowance will be to encourage
companies to increase their exploration activities. It is the increase
in reserves that is important, rather than the number of fields. We
believe that there are around 2 billion barrels of untapped reserves
that the allowance will help to recover. Professor Alexander Kemp of
the university of Aberdeen estimates that 40-plus new small fields will
be brought into development. That is just one estimate. The 2 billion
figure includes not only existing discoveries but a range of prospects
from fields that the incentive will influence now, through to
discoveries and prospects that the incentive will help support in
further exploration and appraisal drilling. The figure of 700 million
barrels that has been quoted is a conservative estimate of the
potential impact over the  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column519" />Column number: 519</div>next 20 or so years. The final number could be much higher. Overall, the
intention of these incentives is to increase activity in these
challenging areas.</div>
<a name="09061867000441"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposed
definitions of fields eligible for the allowance have been arrived at
following in-depth consultations and discussions with a range of
industry stakeholders as well as technical experts at the Department
for Energy and Climate Change. They have been designed to ensure that
the allowance is targeted on the areas that are most in need of support
to limit the dead-weight cost to the
taxpayer.</div><a name="09061867000442"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me make it clear to the hon. Gentleman that we are still committed to
further dialogue with stakeholders. If there is a convincing case, the
secondary powers in the legislation, to which he referred, will allow
the Government to take appropriate action once the full and correct
analysis has been
undertaken.</div><a name="09061867000443"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked a specific question about the west of Shetland.
The taskforce has made significant progress, leading to Total
oil&#146;s announcement in the new year of its intention to take
forward the development of the Lagan tarmac field with its partners.
That will include the vital gas pipeline to open up the west of
Shetland.</div><a name="09061867000444"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked about existing fields. The Government considered a
range of options on encouraging investment in the North sea in the
run-up to the Budget. Industry stakeholders gave their views on many of
the options. In our view, a satisfactory case has not been made to date
for an incentive that could be introduced to encourage investments in
existing fields while providing value for money for the UK taxpayer.
However, we recognise the importance of existing fields to the future
of the North sea, which he mentioned. We are happy to have further
discussions with stakeholders on how support could be given to
investment in existing fields. Today&#146;s proposals do not cover
existing
fields.</div><a name="09061867000445"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that I have answered the hon. Gentleman&#146;s questions and
that he will not press his amendment to a vote.</div>
