welcome you back to the Chair.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000026">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">At this
morning’s sitting, we had a lively debate about some of the
provisions of schedule 1. We are looking at relocation, the overnight
residence requirement and some of the contributions that were made on
those 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 166<a class="bkMark" name="Column166">&#160;</a>
                  </div>issues. Just before the break, I was setting out the context and talking
about the Government’s consideration of these issues as part of
the counter-terrorism review. Obviously, we had regard to the
significant issues involved in relocating an individual to a different
part of the country and the need to set that against the threat that
people pose to this country.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000027">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Clearly, the
provisions in schedule 1 do not mean that it is not possible to provide
that the individual must remain overnight in a residence other than
their own. In certain circumstances—for example, where the
individual is homeless or does not have a suitable permanent
residence—it will be possible to require them to stay overnight
in Home Office-provided accommodation, and we talked through some of
the provisions on locality that are reflected in schedule 1. Such
accommodation must be in the individual’s home area or in an
area that they have a connection with. If there is no such
area—for example, because the individual is a foreign national
with no home in, or connection to, the UK—the area may be one
that the Secretary of State considers appropriate. Again, that was part
and parcel of some of the discussions we have
had.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000028">&#160;</a>

                  </span> We are trying to
tease out why the word used in the Bill is “must” and
not, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Salford and Eccles
proposes, “may.” Why do we need “must” in
the Bill?<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000029">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">

                     <span class="hs_CLMember">James

                     </span>
                  </strong> I tried to give hon. Members an indication of
that by setting out the context and reading the relevant section from
the counter-terrorism review, which deals with the significant impact
of some of the provisions, including the relocation requirement. That
has raised significant issues, and we heard in the evidence sessions
about the possible impact on specific individuals. Equally, there is
the proportionality of the overall package. We are investing heavily in
policing and Security Service funding for monitoring. We are also
focusing on delivering the requirements that we need to deliver
on—national security and protecting against a terrorist threat.
Again, the way in which we do things is a question of balance, judgment
and degree.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000030">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We believe it
is appropriate for there to be restrictions on the Secretary of
State’s use of the powers. However, as I hope to explain, other
measures in the schedule can be applied to disrupt the activities of
terrorists. For example, we can require them to stay overnight at a
particular address in their home locality so that they can be more
easily monitored and, in some cases, so that they are separated from
other extremists. We can also require them to abide by other
restrictions on their movements overnight, such as excluding them from
areas or places where they might meet extremist associates or conduct
terrorist-related activities; prohibiting their association with
individuals of concern; requiring prior notice of association with
other individuals; restricting and monitoring their financial
activities; and limiting their communications to a small number of
approved devices.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000031">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">All those
restrictions and powers are potentially available to the Secretary of
State in schedule 1. These focused powers will be accompanied by a
significant increase in funding for the police and the Security Service
to enhance their covert investigating capabilities. That is the balance

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 167<a class="bkMark" name="Column167">&#160;</a>
                  </div>to be struck, and having conducted the review and examined the issue in
the broad way that we have, we believe that that is the appropriate way
forward. Deciding on appropriate powers for the state in areas of
counter-terrorism will always raise difficult issues. We have
confronted some such issues in many different ways in Committee thus
far. I understand some of the genuine concerns that hon. Members have
highlighted, which I do not ascribe to basic partisanship; they wish to
satisfy themselves about fair and reasonable points, which I
respect.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000032">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
will always be an understandable temptation for the Government of the
day to take a cautious approach that does not give sufficient
consideration to civil liberties. That is why our review of
counter-terrorism and security powers made it clear that we wanted to
redress imbalances that had arisen in the past. We considered very
carefully whether to retain the power to relocate individuals under the
TPIM regime, as I have indicated.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000033">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Our approach
in the provisions gives the right mix of disruption, to protect the
public, and protection of civil liberties. All the powers that are
available in schedule 1 combine with the support that is available to
the police and the security services. In a free society, we must
challenge ourselves to fight terrorism using a targeted set of powers,
safeguarding our hard-won civil liberties and prosecuting terrorists
wherever
possible.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000034">&#160;</a>

course, there will always be particularly difficult individual cases,
which will require particularly close working between the police and
the security services to manage the risk that the individuals pose. Our
police and security services are equal to that challenge. I acknowledge
the speeches made by Opposition Members, who questioned whether this is
the right approach. We must weigh up difficult issues, but we have
reflected carefully on the matter and on the discussions with the
director general of the Security Service. He is content that the
changes provide an acceptable balance between the needs of national
security and civil liberties, that the overall package mitigates risk
and that it is possible to attain that end result through our focused
approach. It is, however, a question of judgment and assessment and I
acknowledge that others may reach a different judgment. However, based
on our assessment, we believe that the approach in the Bill is the

of our discussion. Clearly, the Minister seeks to rely heavily on the
extra resources that will be invested in surveillance. So far, the Bill
relaxes the overnight residence requirements—curfew—which
will result in increased risk and will require extra surveillance. I
think that the Minister has acknowledged that. Secondly, we have the
abolition of the relocation power, which has been described as the most
important power by a whole series of witnesses. That will increase the
risk and extra resources will be needed to mitigate that

the comments of the director general of the Security Service, and the
comments that he has made in that regard. I point to the process that

preventing terrorism, we have to do things in a particular way. I do
not agree with that analysis. We are able to balance and look at the
various different mechanisms and ways to ensure that citizens in this
country are protected by looking at the level of support that is
provided to the security services and the police, by looking at the
disruptive tactics that are potentially available, and by looking at
the options to ensure that those who are suspected of committing
terrorist acts, or acts preparatory to terrorism, are brought to
justice. Underpinned in the counter-terrorism review, a combination of
those factors led us to the approach in the Bill and the approach that
the Government are seeking to adopt to ensure that safety and

on a case-by-case basis. We need to look at where someone may be
living, and if no suitable accommodation satisfies the necessary
requirements, the Secretary of State could relocate that person within
that locality. Again, it will depend on whether it is an urban area or
a more rural area, because in terms of geographical size, a locality in
a rural area may be much larger than a locality in a more urbanised
area. It is difficult for me to say that it is a certain amount of
space or a precise geographical area, because it will hinge on the
individual
circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000064">&#160;</a>

Does my hon. Friend the Minister therefore agree that locality implies
something different from place and that “place” is likely
to be interpreted by the Secretary of State, no doubt on perfectly good
legal advice, as being wider than “locality”? A locality
is likely to be construed as something smaller than a place, which

interesting point. I recognise his judicial and legal experience. We
need to look, however, at the overnight residence measure, which seeks
to address where someone is living. I suppose that that offers a hub
around which a locality may emerge, whereas the provision that he
alludes to relates to exclusion, which may mean a specific building,
railway station or other defined area. I would tread carefully in
seeking to mark the definitional provisions in paragraph 3 back to
those in paragraph 1. I am grateful, however, for his assistance in
pointing out that
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000066">&#160;</a>

admirable job of dancing around the various definitions, but it would
be right for me to ask him a straight question. Does he envisage the
locality in paragraph 1(4) and the exclusion measure in paragraph 3
being Greater London? I am seeking to establish whether the agreed
locality could be as big or the exclusion area as large as Greater
London, because otherwise I do not see how the provisions will

rather than the whole of a city. I hope that assists the right hon.

requirements. The locality has to be one in the United Kingdom in which
the individual has a residence, and its definition will be approached
in that

hesitate to say it, but he has not dealt with the issues, certainly not
those arising on amendment 128, which relates to the
exclusion measure. He did not give me a satisfactory answer about
whether the place from which the individual is excluded could be as big
as Greater London. My confusion relates to what happens if the
subject’s residence is in London. He will therefore be subject
to an overnight residence requirement to live in his house there, but
at the same time it might be desirable to exclude him from London,
certainly during the Olympics, so are not the two provisions
contradictory? I have not received an answer on that point from the
Minister.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000070">&#160;</a>

of State to use the overnight residence measure and the exclusion

that

                  </strong> With the greatest respect, the Minister has not
grasped the point. Under the provisions as they currently stand, if
someone has a residence and the Secretary of State applies the
overnight residence requirement, that person has to be kept in that
home or within a locality with which he has a connection. If, at the
same time, the Secretary of State wants to exclude a person from a
particular place, she will be prevented from doing so, because the
person has a right to be in his residence. The two provisions appear to
be contradictory. If the Secretary of State wants to exclude someone
from most of London, but his residence is in London, how can she use
the exclusion power to achieve the desired result?

the Secretary of State an opportunity to make a different condition to
specify a different locality where public safety is put at risk. Does

which all members of the Committee will appreciate, because the

will be looking—in the Minister’s own words—at the
context of the situation, so they will be looking at the specific
power. They will then be looking at the combination of measures and how
they contribute to public safety. They will also look—as Mr
Justice Simon said—at the resources available to try to fill any
gaps that are there, to maximise public safety. The Minister has
acknowledged that this is a complex and interrelated jigsaw, and we
have the same provision in the measures. They are interrelated and

other.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000077">&#160;</a>

insert “may”. That was about trying to give the Secretary
of State discretion over the powers that she thought it appropriate to
use. On relocation, I am still absolutely of the view that preventing
the Secretary of State from ever, in any circumstances, considering the
practical necessity of having the relocation power is a serious step to

                  <strong> </strong>This is a group of relatively short
amendments that relate to electronic communications and devices. It is
spelled out in schedule 1 that the Secretary of State can impose
restrictions on an individual’s possession or use of electronic
communications devices. Amendment 27 is fairly straightforward. It
seeks to include persons “visiting or staying” at the
individual’s residence as well as the individual concerned. It
would provide more clarity, by showing that the measure will apply not
only to members of the individual’s family who will be there on
a permanent basis but to visitors who may attend the premises; there
ought to be restrictions on their use of devices as well.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000096">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 28
would delete sub-paragraph (3), which brings us to amendment 129.
Amendment 129 is really about the heart of the matter and it is similar
to the amendment that I tabled on relocation powers. Again, I seek to
delete the word “must” and insert the word
“may”, and I will be using the same kind of argument that
I used earlier. Once again, I do not understand why the Minister seeks
to tie the hands of the Secretary of State by saying that in every
circumstance a terrorist suspect must be allowed access to a telephone
operated by connection to a fixed line, a computer that provides access
to the internet and a mobile telephone that does not provide access to
the internet. We all know that in this world of international
terrorism, the use of mobile phones and in particular the use of the
internet are key ways in which terrorists will seek to communicate with
each other, to pass information and to prepare for and be involved in
the attack planning that we know goes on.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000097">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Again, it may
well be that in 99 cases out of 100 there might not be sufficient
concern for there to be restrictions on the use of a mobile phone or
the internet. The Minister will no doubt tell me that the provisions in
sub-paragraph (4) about monitoring and surveillance will all be
sufficient to reassure him that there will not be an increased risk in
allowing terrorist suspects access to the internet. I have no doubt
that he will tell me that. But again the argument is the
same—why, in the one case out of a hundred where there will be
an increased risk, is the Minister not prepared to allow a discretion
for the use of the internet and mobile phones not to be
allowed?<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000098">&#160;</a>

argument the right hon. Lady is trying to make. If it is the case that
in this one case in 100, or in however many cases it is, this suspected
terrorist will be using an electronic device as part of their terrorist
plan, they will know that it is being monitored and if they were so
foolish as to use that device they would be providing a lot of evidence
that could be used quite strongly against them. We would have a lot of
information about who they rang, and so on. In fact, that would make it
easier to prosecute. So, is

are not simply about communication. I understand that there are

circumstances; I am reluctant to say it in an open sitting. Mobile

                  </strong> The people who provide the information on the
website that I have in mind will say that it is to detonate firework
displays, not explosives, and that it is therefore a perfectly
legitimate use of a mobile phone, so it would not necessarily be
evidence of a terrorist offence. There could be an alternative,
non-terrorist use of a mobile phone. As the website would say, it might
be used to set off a firework display in one’s garden remotely.
However, it is clearly an issue that a terrorist could use a phone in
that way.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000104">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I was
interested to see the report of the trial for the bomb attempts that
took place last year. The report said that terrorists tried 15 times to
detonate two car bombs filled with petrol, gas and 2,000 nails in
central London. The displays of Nokia mobile phones left in each car
revealed several missed calls; they had been dialled up to four times
each. By the time that happens, it does not matter how much monitoring
we do. What is the space between using a mobile phone to make a call to
set off a bomb and the security services’ ability to intervene
and say, “We have been monitoring your use of these
phones”? It is simply not practical.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000105">&#160;</a>

<div class="columnNumber">

                  </div>because they are the best person to dial the phone to set it off? Surely

measures provide an extra risk in the system. My amendment asks why,
for heaven’s sake, the Secretary of State will be required to
provide a mobile phone and internet access in all circumstances. It
brings me back to the first premise. The measures are framed so as
to maximise the ability of the person subject to them to
lead a normal life, rather than to strike the right balance with
national security and the protection of the public. Yet again, the
Government are asking what the rights of the individual are, and
stating that they must have a mobile phone and access to the internet.
There may be circumstances—I am prepared to admit that they
might not happen often—in which we do not want highly dangerous
people to have access to a mobile phone or the internet, and the
Secretary of State will not be able to make that
decision.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000108">&#160;</a>

are important. Taken together with the other measures that we are
debating today, they draw a picture of the various steps that the
Minister is proposing to take that, in my view, will increase the risk
to the public. All the measures that we have talked about, such as
relocation, the relaxation of provisions for a mobile phone and the
residence requirement, have a cumulative effect. Each of them
contributes to an increased risk, which is supposed to be filled by the
extra resources for surveillance. It is therefore important that we
delve into the matters and probe and press the Minister on why it is
necessary in every single case for someone to have access to a mobile
phone.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000111">&#160;</a>

phones that were used in the particular case were two unregistered
phones—pay-as-you-go models with their numbers written on labels
stuck on the back. They were used to try to detonate the bombs.
Whatever monitoring the security services had in place at the time,
they were not able to monitor those pay-as-you-go phones that were used
to make four missed calls. Luckily, the terrorists were not successful,
although they tried to detonate the bombs using the mobile phones 15
times. The security services were not able to monitor
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000112">&#160;</a>

the hon. Member for Cambridge—they would never, ever seek to use

people access to mobile phones, people will not seek to use them in the

which it is not appropriate, but the risks outweigh the possibility.

seek to make the point that it may be appropriate in some cases for
suspect terrorists to have access to mobile phones and the internet.
That makes me nervous, but it may be appropriate. Again, however, I
cannot understand why the Bill provides that the Secretary of State
“must” provide at least one mobile phone and access to
the internet to a terrorist suspect. There may be circumstances in
which the security services say, “In the light of this
person’s previous behaviour and our security assessment, we do
not think it appropriate for them to have access to a mobile phone or
the internet, whether that is monitored or not, because we might not be
able to intervene by the time we find out what they are using the phone
for—and that increases the risk.” The amendment is
perfectly
sensible.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000126">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> It is generous of the right hon. Lady to give way
a third time. She speaks from a security angle. Dr Michael Korzinski
provided an illuminating contribution to the Committee’s
evidence session by talking about these people as human beings rather
than simply as terrorists. Some people might have been picked up in a
taxi in the wrong place in Kabul, been in Guantanamo Bay, and ended up
in the UK. Such people might genuinely want to get on with a normal
life, or they might have a family around them who are not terrorists in

               <p class="tabbed">If someone
can be wooed away from the dark side of fundamentalism, they must have
some normality in their lifestyle, which unfortunately means, in this
day and age, having access or ownership of a mobile phone and a

get them themselves, or they will be prevented from getting involved

in which a person has found themselves back in this country, really
wants to change their life, is determined to put their past behind them
and wants to become a good, upstanding member of our society, clearly
the Secretary of State would not want to impose restrictions on their
ability to have access to a mobile phone or a computer. Such a scenario
would be unlikely to lead to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 181<a class="bkMark" name="Column181">&#160;</a>
                  </div>the imposition of a control order that included such measures. The
components of the control order would be reviewed and confirmed by the
High Court. If the evidence demonstrates that the person has genuinely
rejected an extremist past, wishes to pursue a future with no
connection with terrorism and disavows all those activities, I very
much doubt that a High Court judge would, having seen both open and
closed-session evidence, confirm a control order that included those
measures.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000129">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
scenario of a committed person who, given any chance whatever, is
determined to engage in attack planning and to seek to damage and maim
as many people as possible, is very different. When a determined
terrorist cannot be brought to trial, not allowing the Secretary of
State to disallow them access to a mobile phone or a computer increases
the risk in the system.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000130">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Our whole
debate over the past few sittings has been about managing that risk and
reducing it to manageable proportions. Why do we not want to allow the
Secretary of State discretion, in the small minority of cases when it
is necessary, to decide that a person is such a danger that they must
not have access to a mobile phone that could be used in attack
planning, in plots and to detonate bombs? I do not understand why we
frame legislation that does not allow us even the possibility to manage
such a risk, perhaps in a better way than is currently proposed. If
people want to change their lives and not associate with anyone they
have ever previously associated with, and if they can convince the Home
Secretary and the courts that that is the case, they would not be
subject to control orders. The people subject to control orders, or
indeed to TPIMs, would be some of the half dozen or so most dangerous
people in this country, who are determined to do maximum harm and
damage to the ordinary citizens of our
nation.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000131">&#160;</a>

a Home Office mobile telephone, assuming that the battery works, is to
give warning to someone that something has happened, perhaps using
certain code words, rather than as a detonation device. The danger in
someone having one of those phones might well be simply that he or she
can give warning or inform someone else of what has happened. That is
probably the most dangerous aspect of someone being given a Home Office
telephone that
works.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000132">&#160;</a>

personal, practical experience in his work, has made one of the most
telling points of the afternoon. There is a practical issue. Someone
could warn an associate that something might be about to be
discovered—the security services would be monitoring but, again,
before they have a chance to intervene, evidence could be disposed of
and we would not be able to build the
case.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000133">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
one of the court cases I was reading about, exactly that happened. A
recording was made of a telephone call between two
terrorists—they were gathering the means to make a bomb, such as
chemicals, and had been in touch with people who sold hydrogen
peroxide—but it was about designer aftershaves. The discussion
about 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 182<a class="bkMark" name="Column182">&#160;</a>
                  </div>aftershaves was clearly about the chemicals necessary to make a
bomb—obviously, people use code words. However, the hon. Member
for Beckenham made his point about a warning extremely well, and I ask
the Minister to reflect on it. What reassurance can the Minister give
us that if such a scenario were to occur, he would be satisfied that
the monitoring provision is sufficient either to deter the would-be
terrorist from using the device in that way or for the security
services to be able to intervene immediately to prevent the warning
having the effect that the hon. Gentleman
indicated?<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000134">&#160;</a>

do not wish to detain the Committee for long—I am mindful of
what the hon. Member for Ipswich said about how we have many other
things we need to discuss—but I have a couple of comments. The
hon. Member for Bournemouth East matched a degree of humanity with his
obvious understanding of security risk in his intervention on my right
hon. Friend the Member for Salford and Eccles; his comments do him
great
credit.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000136">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
can understand the reason for a provision in schedule 1 that
invites—not invites but insists—the Secretary of State to
consider the merit of a fixed phone line, an internet connection or a
mobile phone in each individual case. They should be considered, and in
most cases there might well be a good argument why they should be
permitted but, going back to the main points made by my right hon.
Friend, as currently drafted the matter is mandatory—there is no
choice, and the Secretary of State must make such provision. Again, I
fear that the Minister is boxing himself into a corner. One
day—I hope this never happens, but it is a
possibility—the Secretary of State might want to act in a
certain way but be unable to do so, because she is prohibited by her
own legislation. As I said, the comments of the hon. Member for
Bournemouth East were timely and
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000137">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
only other point relates to yet further challenges for the police and
the Security Service that will arise from the obligation to provide a
telephone line, internet connection and mobile phone. There will
certainly be further challenges and costs for surveillance; that is
undeniable and will happen in each and every case. I do not have the
technical expertise of my right hon. Friend the Member for Salford and
Eccles, but in common with my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford
South, I spent some time with responsibility for prisons. My hon.
Friend will agree that the ingenuity with which prisoners are able to
secrete mobile phones and SIM cards into their prison cells is at times
beyond belief. It happens none the less, and the Minister’s
colleagues in the Ministry of Justice will have to deal with that
problem. It relates to organised crime outside prison and to drug
misuse inside. It is an absolute menace.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000138">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As was
pointed out during an intervention, if it is possible to secrete mobile
phones in and out of prison, suspects will certainly be able to pick up
mobile phones and SIM cards outside their home, bring them in
and—who knows?—switch the SIM card in the phone they have
brought in with that in the phone provided by the Home

challenge, but there may be moments of confusion.

Friend the Member for Salford and Eccles has explained her position and
concerns perfectly clearly and I do not intend to detain the Committee
by going over them again. I simply make the point that there is the
potential for confusion because phones or SIM cards could be swapped in
a way that could be momentarily confusing for those operating the
surveillance. It could be a moment in time for which we would all pay
dearly. If someone subject to a TPIM order was found to be misusing
their mobile phone in that way, they could not have the phone taken off
them; they would have to have it because the Secretary of State must
give them one. There is no penalty if someone subject to the TPIM
misuses their phone. I do not see any way in which the Secretary of
State could withdraw it; they must provide that person with a mobile
telephone.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000145">&#160;</a>

                  </div>explaining my understanding, at least, of how the process will work. The

otherwise.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000161">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge is perfectly correct that
paragraph 7 includes the right for the Secretary of State to impose
requirements, particularly under sub-paragraph (2)(b). However, the
right hon. Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East is also correct that
there is no right, if any of those requirements are broken, for the
Secretary of State to remove the devices that sub-paragraph (3) obliges
her to give the subject of a TPIM order. My hon. Friend the Minister is
correct that someone who did not comply with those conditions would
commit an offence under clause 21 that would be triable on indictment
and could give rise to a five-year custodial sentence. Notwithstanding
the heat of the last part of the debate, the point is that my hon.
Friend the Member for Cambridge, the right hon. Member for Wythenshawe
and Sale East and my hon. Friend the Minister are all correct, so I
hope that that makes the position clear.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000162">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I actually
rose to address amendment 27, which was moved by the right hon. Member
for Salford and Eccles, because it is both unnecessary and dangerous. I
will invite her to withdraw it in due course. The amendment would add
the words “visiting or staying” after the word
“persons” into paragraph 7(1)(b) of schedule 1. The
present position in the Bill is that the Secretary of State has the
power to impose<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000163">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“requirements on
the individual in relation to the possession or use of electronic
communication devices by other persons in the individual’s
residence.”<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000304">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>My
understanding is that that covers everybody in that individual’s
residence, so the addition of the words “visiting or
staying” is unnecessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000164">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It goes
beyond that, however, and that is why I invite the right hon. Lady to
withdraw the amendment. It is possible to contemplate persons who could
be in the residence but would not be visiting or staying. While I have
been listening intently to the debate on her well-formulated
amendments, the only group of such persons that I have been able to
come up with is those who might be engaged in cleaning or something
similar—service occupiers within the house, or domestic staff
for want of a better phrase. It is possible that such people could be
construed to be persons who are not visiting or staying in the
house.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000165">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendment is in fact dangerous and counter-productive to the view that
the right hon. Lady takes of what the Bill ought to contain. For that
reason, I urge her not to press at least that amendment, although
judging by the state of the Opposition Benches, I imagine that none of
the amendments in the group will be pressed to a Division at this
stage.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000166">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">It
was interesting to hear the comments of the right hon. Member for
Salford and Eccles and her personal concern. Indeed, the approach that
Opposition Members are taking is interesting. At times, that approach
seems to involve looking at the balance and then saying that we always
need a bit more. In many ways, that was the problem when the previous
Government were posed with some of these challenges and difficulties.
We are trying to fix the situation with the measures that we are
introducing in the Bill, as well as those that have been introduced in
other
ways.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000168">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Fundamentally,
the approach that we try to take is that the individual should be able
to live a normal life as far as is consistent with protecting the
public, and that they should be subject to only the minimum
restrictions necessary for that purpose. That, perhaps, is where the
difference lies. We have taken that approach so that we are able to
ensure that it is consistent with protecting the public while we
examine the situation in a very focused and measured way. In the
context of paragraph 7, we believe that there are certain basic
standards that should be upheld as part of living a normal life. To
that extent, it is appropriate to look at limitations that might apply.
This reflects some of the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member
for Bournemouth East. We should look at what is necessary and focused,
and what will deliver on the public safety agenda.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000169">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 27
would specify that restrictions could be imposed on the individual
under the electronic communication device measure, in relation to the
possession or use of devices by third parties in the residence, only if
those persons were “visiting or staying” at the
residence. As I have said, the approach to the measures that may be
imposed under the Bill is that the individual should be able to live a
normal life as far as is consistent with protecting the public. That is
why, under this measure, it will not be possible to impose a blanket
ban on electronic communication devices. The individual must be
permitted at least one mobile and one landline telephone, and a
computer with a fixed-line connection to the internet.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000170">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To ensure
that the measure is compatible with public protection, however, it is
intended that it will be possible, when necessary, to restrict access
to any communication devices other than those permitted. To ensure that
that restriction is effective and enforceable, the Bill allows the
Secretary of State to impose—if that is necessary and
proportionate—requirements on the individual regarding the
possession and use of such devices by other people in the residence.
The Bill makes no distinction between visitors, guests and long-term
residents, since the mischief that the provision is designed to address
is generally not dependent on the status of the individual. It would
therefore be possible, for example, to impose a restriction on the
individual requiring them not to knowingly permit specified electronic
communications devices to be kept switched on or used in their
residence while they are there. The clear purpose of that would be to
ensure that the individual was not easily able to use any
communications devices, including any brought into his residence by a
third party, other than those of which the authorities were aware. To
limit the power to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 187<a class="bkMark" name="Column187">&#160;</a>
                  </div>impose such restrictions only to devices brought into the residence by
visitors or guests, and not by persons living at the residence, would
reduce its effectiveness. It would limit our ability to ensure that the
individual does not have easy access to devices other than those
permitted in the TPIM notice. We do not think that the amendment would
bring about the right
approach.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000171">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendments
28, 29 and 129, by contrast, would amend the requirement in paragraph 7
that the Secretary of State must allow an individual to possess and use
the devices specified in sub-paragraph (3) without the need for
specific permission to be granted. The sub-paragraph gives effect to
the conclusion in the counter-terrorism review that the replacement
system for control orders can continue to protect the public while
allowing greater, albeit still fairly limited, access to electronic
communications devices. The devices that the individual must be
permitted to access, as specified by sub-paragraph (3), are a
fixed-line telephone, a computer with fixed-line internet connection,
and a mobile telephone that does not provide access to the internet. I
assure the Committee that the exceptions have been considered and
framed carefully. This reflects the approach taken on the Bill: the
individual should be able to live a normal life as far as is consistent
with protecting the public, and should be subject only to the minimum
restrictions necessary for that purpose. Again, I refer the Committee
to the fact that the director general of the Security Service has made
it clear that the changes provide an acceptable balance between the
needs of national security and civil liberties, which is at the heart
of our debate on this group of amendments and other aspects of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000172">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendments
28 and 29 would remove sub-paragraph (3). Amendment 129 would leave it
in, but would specify that the Secretary of State only
“may”, rather than “must”, permit access to
the specified devices. Its effect would be that the Secretary of State
could prohibit access to any communication device if that was thought
to be necessary and proportionate. There would be no requirement for
her to permit a minimum level of
access.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000173">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Although
we share the desire of Opposition Members to ensure that the public are
protected, the amendment goes further than necessary under the new
regime, especially if we take account of the restrictions that can be
imposed under sub-paragraph (4). Our view is that the measure in the
Bill as it stands strikes the right balance, because it will protect
the public by continuing to limit access to electronic communication
devices significantly, while avoiding unnecessary intrusion into the
life of the individual who is subject to the measure. None of the
amendments would improve the Bill, and I ask the right hon. Member for
Salford and Eccles to withdraw amendment
24.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000174">&#160;</a>

I envy the Minister’s access to a comprehensive and accurate

improvising, which will be character
building.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000175">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Minister says that my amendments are characterised by the argument that
we need a bit more restriction to reassure ourselves about public
safety. I think that there is a difference between us, because I would
characterise the Minister’s position as saying that we can
manage with a bit less, whether that relates to relocation, overnight
residence restrictions or access to the internet and mobile 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 188<a class="bkMark" name="Column188">&#160;</a>
                  </div>phones. It is right that we have teased out the difference between us,
although I would not characterise it as a chasm. I think it is summed
up by amendment 129, which would simply replace the word
“must” with “may”. That does not indicate
that there is a gulf between our view of the balance, but it shows that
we are in a different place, because I am have not yet been reassured
by what the Minister has said in any of our debates that the cumulative
effect of all these relaxations will be sufficiently mitigated by the
extra resource that he is putting in for
surveillance.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000176">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">When
DAC Osborne gave evidence to the Committee on some of these issues,
albeit not particularly on access to the internet, he said that he
hoped that we would be able to achieve the right level of protection
for the public. I hope so, too, but I do not think that hope is the
right level of reassurance. I want much more clarity about how much
reassurance we can have.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000177">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Beckenham, in a brief but extremely effective intervention,
brought the issue to a head in very practical terms. He asked what
would happen if somebody used a mobile phone to warn their associates
that the police or security service were on their case and then steps
were immediately taken to bring a plot to fruition, or to abandon it
and dispose of the evidence. That point weighs heavily with me in terms
of the reassurance that we can offer the public. Providing the
Secretary of State with an obligation to ensure that suspected
terrorists have access to the internet and mobile phones is not
necessarily the right thing to do in every single case. We ought to
measure the degree of risk that such individuals pose. It might well be
appropriate for nine out of 10 to have access to the internet and a
mobile phone, but we are not in a position to provide that the one
person for whom that is inappropriate does not have
access.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000178">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
right hon. Friend the Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East
underestimates his knowledge of technical matters. If he thinks that
his knowledge is less than mine, he is wrong because, as my husband
will testify when I get in trouble on the computer, I have very little
knowledge of technical matters. My right hon. Friend’s
contribution was straightforward. He said that such things are hard
enough to control anyway, because suspected terrorists will try to get
other SIM cards and mobile phones. Every single court case has shown
that mobile phones have been key to these people’s network of
communication. Such people rarely act alone; they act in a group with
associates. They plan attacks and prepare the ground together, and
mobile phones are crucial. Why make it any more difficult for the
police and security services to disrupt and intervene in such activity?
I am not saying for a moment that if terrorist suspects were not
allowed access to an official mobile phone, the problem would be
solved, but I feel that we are making things even more difficult by
putting an obligation on the Secretary of
State.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000179">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham described
amendment 27 as unnecessary, counter-productive and possibly dangerous.
I feel less aggrieved by that formulation than I did when he declared
some of my previous amendments to be blindingly obvious. I agree with
him that the amendment is unnecessary. The wider formulation in the
Bill is better, and it provides a more comprehensive definition of the
people who will be covered by the prohibition and the

having the ability to impose any conditions subject, of course, to
review and challenge in the courts, we have gained a better
understanding of them. For example, on what is meant by a curfew, we
know that it is not possible to impose one of 18 hours or more, but
that 16 hours is permitted. In the AF judgment, an interpretation has
been made about the rules on disclosure that has also refined how
control orders have operated
recently.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000187">&#160;</a>

concern is that the gradual process of development and evolutionary
change and improvement will be interrupted by the proposals in schedule
1. The issue of having “must” rather than
“may” has been raised several times in discussing the
schedule. There will be very tight restrictions on the overnight
residence requirement. Relocation will not be permitted under the
schedule. There will be a mandatory requirement on the Home Secretary
to provide a computer, a mobile phone and a landline phone. Certain
measures will now be closed off from being used by the Home Secretary;
even if she wanted to, she could not impose them. That causes me
considerable concern, as it is out of keeping with the process of
gradual change.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000188">&#160;</a>

put it to the Minister that there may be circumstances that even he, in
his far-sighted way, has not yet called to mind or that the Home
Secretary has not envisaged, but which might lead her to believe that
certain conditions are required under the TPIM arrangements. Nothing is
perfect, and we should never assume that certain things will never
happen, because it is in the nature of things that Home Office
Ministers, in particular, often have to deal with unexpected and
unpredicted events. I am concerned that without the proposed new
paragraph 13—it would allow, albeit subject to a higher test,
the Secretary of State to impose requirements additional to those
specified in the schedule—a day may come when the Secretary of
State wants to impose a condition that her legislation prevents her
imposing.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000189">&#160;</a>

Gentleman that I do not support his efforts to salvage more from the
wreckage of authoritarian control orders. I am sure that we will
shortly receive some legal advice, but it seems to me that the word
“or” in the amendment would allow the Secretary of State
to impose extra measures if there is a serious terrorist threat and the
measures are not necessary for the protection of the public. Is that
not what the “or”
means?<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000190">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I could go into a very long explanation about the
inclusion of the word “or”, or I could admit to the
Committee that one’s first draft sometimes contains
imperfections. The point on which I want to press the Minister is that
not having some form of additional power, which would allow the
Secretary of State to impose conditions other than those rightly set
out in the schedule—I have previously said to the Minister that
I agree with the measures and with his trying to be as clear and
specific as possible—and ruling out the possibility of
circumstances that we cannot predict and have not foreseen but which
require measures that are not in the Bill, might put the Secretary of
State in a real predicament. In her heart and in her judgment, she will
know that something needs to be done, but she will be unable to do it,
because her legislation does not allow her to do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000191">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
am heartened that those who undertook the counter-terrorism review have
foreseen that problem. I ask the Minister to turn to paragraph 27 on
the final page of the review, and I hope that the Committee will bear
with me if I read four or five important lines from it. The review
concluded
that<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000192">&#160;</a>

Suspects (Temporary

                  </div>Extension) Bills, which are the Government’s plan to make it
possible to extend the maximum period of pre-charge detention from 14
to 28 days in exceptional circumstances. The proposal, which is
relevant to our deliberations, is that if such circumstances arise, the
Government would introduce primary legislation to enable those
circumstances to be accounted
for.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000195">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Is
the Minister thinking of something similar for the TPIMs regime? I am
sure that he has already paid careful notice to the recommendations of
the report, but I need to draw his attention to some of the
difficulties that the Joint Committee encountered. That Committee is
made up of Members from both Houses and from all parties, and we
reached a unanimous view, so the seriousness of the recommendations
should not be underestimated. We saw difficulties in producing primary
legislation, literally at the drop of a hat, in exceptional
circumstances. Some of the difficulties we foresaw would take me away
from the issues at stake in the Bill, so I will not dwell on them.
Suffice it to say that in those circumstances, if the Secretary of
State came in search of those emergency powers, she would be unable to
say much at all to Parliament about the circumstances in which she was
seeking those additional powers. There would also be a risk that any
subsequent trial is prejudiced by a  debate about the extension
of the pre-charge detention period.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000196">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Those are
issues of principle, but there are also issues of practicality, which
apply if the Government are thinking of using fresh primary legislation
to deal with the exceptional circumstances on TPIMs. The Joint
Committee was seized of two particular practicalities. The first is if
the House is not sitting, and the other is if the House had been
dissolved before a general election. I will go through those issues in
turn.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000197">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If
Parliament was sitting, it would be extremely difficult for the Home
Secretary to introduce fresh primary emergency legislation as it would
require a lot of reorganisation of the Houses’ business. Other
important business would have to be set aside. However, it would be
possible to do that, albeit there would be the risk of prejudice at
subsequent trials. However, were the exceptional circumstances on the
TPIM to occur in the middle of August, and the Minister sought to
introduce primary legislation to extend the requirements of the TPIMs
regime, he would face extraordinary difficulties. Some hon. Members
would be enjoying holidays, others the delights of their constituency.
A whole variety of activities would be going on. My right hon. Friend
the Member for Blackburn (Mr Straw), who was at one time the Home
Secretary, was clear in his advice to the Joint Committee about the
time it could take to recall Parliament during a
recess.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000198">&#160;</a>

certainly could not implement primary legislation. That has to be done
by both Houses in the normal way. Although it would be possible for
emergency legislation to be passed very quickly, perhaps even within
two days, that in itself means that the Secretary of State has to sit
around waiting for two or three days to get Royal Assent before she
could impose any further
conditions.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000201">&#160;</a>

that in all the different scenarios that we considered in the Joint
Committee, the one that he suggests was not considered because it was
not thought feasible. One issue that was discussed extensively was the
idea of using the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 as a way of dealing with
that situation. He may agree that that might be a rather blunt way, and
a rather too expansive way, of dealing with this very specific issue of
additional requirements to a TPIMs regime further to those contained in
schedule 1 that, in the view of the Secretary of State, are required
and for which she would have to bring primary legislation to the
House.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000203">&#160;</a>

Presumably, if there is a delay of a few days that would not be such a
problem, because there already are existing powers to detain without
charge for 14 days. So there would be that period of 14 days before
there would be any real concerns. Am I missing something?<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000204">&#160;</a>

straying too far here. However, in terms of the pre-charge detention,
of course it may not become apparent until some way through the
investigation—perhaps on day 10, 11 or 12—that it is
necessary to seek an extension beyond 14 days. Again, that was another
practical issue that was considered.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000205">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In relation
to the Bill and the TPIMs regime, I do not think that the Home

is not listed in schedule 1.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000206">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I pause here
for a moment, Mr Caton, to remind the Committee that I am seeking to
give the Secretary of State the power in the Bill to make those
requirements—albeit subject to a higher test, which I will come
on to shortly—without any need to come back to Parliament. She
could do what she judges needs to be done and she could do it because
we would give her the authority through the amendment that I am
proposing. Indeed, that reflects the conclusion that was reached by the
Joint Committee, which has recommended that the Home Secretary should
have an order-making power. She would require the agreement of the
Attorney-General and she would then be subject to some very strict
conditions, but she would have the power to make the order. She would
be accountable for it; eventually, she or her successor would have to
come back to Parliament 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 193<a class="bkMark" name="Column193">&#160;</a>
                  </div>to account for the decision that was made. But that is a practical way
of marrying the principles that hon. Members from various parties in
this Committee are keen to press home with the practicality of ensuring
that the Home Secretary has the powers that she needs.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000207">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I must say to
the Minister that I was disappointed yesterday by the Home
Secretary’s initial response to the Joint Committee and the
report that was published last Thursday. However, she gave one
assurance to the House in questions yesterday. That was that a proposal
would be introduced by the Home Office for an order-making power to be
available for the Home Secretary in the period when a Dissolution of
Parliament has taken place. Therefore I expect, at the very least, that
the same order-making power in relation to TPIMs should be brought back
as a Government amendment on Report so that there would be no doubt
whatsoever that when Parliament is not sitting, because it has been
dissolved, the Home Secretary would have a power to impose the
conditions that she has judged to be appropriate. I expect
the Minister to give us that assurance this afternoon. I am sure that
he will be able to bring forward a perfect redrafted
amendment—unlike
mine.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000208">&#160;</a>

practice the level of reasonable belief has operated in relation to all
control orders imposed so far. In practice, there is no big issue, but
it is right that it should be in the Bill. I am proposing a safeguard
so that the power is not used too lightly. There should be a higher
threshold in relation to a decision to use the additional power that I
am suggesting, and it should be on the balance of probabilities. There
would be a requirement on the Home Secretary to meet that higher test

slightly flawed amendment and bring it back on Report, he would do all

technical issues around that, I hope that he will understand the spirit
in which my right hon. Friend moved the amendment, given what the
counter-terrorism review said. What my right hon. Friend said will help
us all to support the Home Secretary in difficult decisions. The
counter-terrorism review alluded to the fact that there may be a need

raised an interesting argument in the context of the mechanics of
acting speedily or during a parliamentary recess. I would like the
Minister to let the Committee know at some point whether the
Government’s position is, as I think it ought to be, that the
Crown retains a prerogative right to promulgate law, even in the
absence of parliamentary consent, albeit that is a reserve power, which
I do not think has been used since the Glorious Revolution. Given the
world we now live in, it may prove to be a useful power as we move
forward in the 21st century. I would like some assurances in
due

                  </strong> I thank the right hon. Member for Wythenshawe
and Sale East for the way in which he moved his amendment, even if I
cannot accept it for some of the drafting reasons identified, as well
as certain issues of principle which I will speak to. In saying that, I
pay tribute to his work and that of others on the Joint Committee in
providing pre-legislative scrutiny and examining the draft legislation
that would increase pre-charge detention from 14 to 28 days in extremis
and in limited circumstances. The report is interesting and we will
certainly consider it carefully and respond in due course. He noted
yesterday’s comment by the Home Secretary on the report, so he
already knows that my right hon. Friend is prepared to consider how to
act in the circumstances of the Dissolution of Parliament, albeit
certain reserve powers might be contained in the Civil Contingencies
Act. I saw him in the Chamber, he noted what the Home Secretary said
and he has referred to it
today.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000216">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
will certainly consider the implications of the report for pre-charge
detention in the draft legislation that we intend to publish on the
enhanced TPIMs regime. Given yesterday’s comment by the Home
Secretary, we will reflect on 14 days to 28 days in the context of this
Bill and how that might operate in an enhanced TPIMs structure. I hope
that the right hon. Gentleman will accept that we are carefully
examining the report published by the Joint Committee and that he is
reassured by the Home Secretary’s comment. I hope that stating
that at the outset is helpful to him and the
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000217">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
must add that we see the enhanced TPIMs regime as the exception, not
the norm. That came out clearly in the counter-terrorism review, which
was highlighted by the right hon. Gentleman. Some of his drafting might

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 195<a class="bkMark" name="Column195">&#160;</a>
                  </div>make the enhanced regime more rudimentary and more common. That might
not have been his intention, and I appreciate his comments on the
drafting of his proposed provisions in amendment 125. However, the
clear conclusion of the counter-terrorism review was that in certain
circumstances it would be necessary for the Government to seek
parliamentary approval for additional, more stringent measures to
protect the public. We do not dispute the need to deal with such
circumstances, but the approach taken by the amendment would differ,
sometimes significantly, from the one proposed by the Government. We do
not agree with his approach, notwithstanding my comments at the
outset.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000218">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendment would grant the Secretary of State a broad power to impose
any measure that she considers necessary. We have been clear throughout
the process that we consider it appropriate for measures available to
the Secretary of State to be considered in advance by Parliament. That
is the clear approach adopted in the Bill, and the approach that should
be taken towards the enhanced measures that might be required in
exceptional circumstances, when there is a serious terrorist risk that
cannot be managed by any other means. Of course, given their purpose,
the enhanced measures would be more stringent than those provided for
in the Bill, which is also the intention behind the right hon.
Gentleman’s
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000219">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendment also proposes that the enhanced measures would be available
in a wide range of circumstances. The first suggested condition is a
serious terrorist threat; although no definition is suggested in the
amendment, the phrasing could arguably be invoked when the joint
terrorism analysis centre threat level was at
“substantial” or higher which, based on the experience of
recent years and current assessments, would probably mean that the
additional powers were immediately and generally available to the
Secretary of State. Again, that might not be what the right hon.
Gentleman intends, but that is perhaps a comment on the drafting. I
respect the probing nature of his amendment in that
regard.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000220">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Our
assessment, in general terms, is that the package of measures set out
in schedule 1 is the right one. I have sought to explain to the
Committee that as they will be combined with the additional resources
that we are providing to the police and the Security Service, we do not
see the need for further measures, other than in emergency or extreme
situations, which we must consider, sadly, although it is not something
that any of us would wish to entertain lightly. As the
counter-terrorism review indicated, we believe that further measures
might be appropriate in some circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000221">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The second
objection to the amendment is that given the more intrusive nature of
the powers that we propose will be available under the enhanced TPIMs
regime, our view is that it is appropriate that legislation should not
be introduced or passed until it is needed, subject to the point that
my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary made yesterday about the
extension of 14 days to 28 days. Again, I commit that to the
Committee to consider carefully in the context of the report and the
comments that my right hon. Friend made yesterday.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000222">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We consider
that the standard measures will protect the public in normal
circumstances and for the foreseeable future. The enhanced measures
will be a contingency for an exceptional situation—as I have
said, when we are faced with a serious terrorist risk that cannot be 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 196<a class="bkMark" name="Column196">&#160;</a>
                  </div>managed by any other means. Before such a situation arises—we
hope that it never will—we do not consider it necessary or
appropriate for such stringent powers to be generally available.
Therefore, although I recognise the good intention behind the proposed
amendments, I feel that our approach strikes a fair balance and
provides greater safeguards while ensuring that we can protect the
public.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000223">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">For those
reasons, the Government resist the amendment, but given the comments
made, I commit to the Committee to reflect on it further in the context
of the report published by the Joint Committee and of the comments made
by my right hon. Friend
yesterday.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000224">&#160;</a>

need to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities. Again, that

amendment 125, which was tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for
Wythenshawe and Sale East. It is a probing amendment to try to
ascertain and expose the difficulties in the measure, and the cliff
edge that we will reach. A TPIM will be imposed, with all its
proportionate and necessary measures to contain and control the
activity of the person who is subject to it, but suddenly, after a
period of two years, everything will be discharged and that person will
be completely free to walk the streets, carry on with their behaviour
and perhaps continue to pose a significant and substantial threat to
the public’s safety.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000253">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I want to
explore with the Minister whether there is any possibility of providing
for exceptional circumstances. Heaven forbid, there might be several
terrorist attacks across the country, and the surveillance and
monitoring capabilities of the security services and the police would
be stretched to the limit. At the same time, two or three 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 199<a class="bkMark" name="Column199">&#160;</a>
                  </div>TPIM notices might be coming to an end and those individuals might be
released into that set of exceptional circumstances that the country
faces. In those circumstances, can we provide for an extension of the
TPIM notice, albeit with modified measures, to allow at least for some
supervision, surveillance and disruption beyond pure
surveillance?<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000254">&#160;</a>

know that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee do not want TPIMs
to be imposed indefinitely, and I do not pursue that argument. We all
have tremendous qualms—I certainly have—about people
being subject to intrusive measures for an indefinite time period,
which does not sit well with our legal system or with people’s
rights to have their case heard. I am concerned, however, that the TPIM
notice can be extended for one year under clause 5, but unless there is
evidence of new involvement in terrorist activity, it must come to an
end.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000255">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I think it
was Lord Carlile who told us in the first evidence session that he
initially supported the provision of two years, but said that there
must be a two-year cut-off point. Yet, on reflection, when he looked at
some of the serious cases, he felt that in a tiny number it might be
necessary, because of the continued risk that someone posed, for an
order to continue to apply without evidence of new terrorist activity.
We should take seriously Lord Carlile’s views, because he is the
only person who has reviewed every single control order and looked at
every set of circumstances. Indeed, he has also discussed about the
effect of the orders on the people who are subject to
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000256">&#160;</a>

argument with great interest. I am trying to understand how we could be
sufficiently sure that someone posed a great risk after two years when,
during that two-year period, there was no new evidence of any terrorist
involvement. I find it hard to imagine that to be a realistic
situation. I am very concerned about the measure becoming a rolling

                  </strong> The hon. Gentleman takes an entirely principled
position. I share his view that TPIMs should not be subject to
automatic renewal year on year, irrespective of the risk that is posed.
The purpose of TPIMs is to balance the risk with measures that intrude
on people’s civil liberties, and to get that balance
right.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000258">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
key question is whether, over the period in which a TPIM is in place,
the risk has reduced such that it is no longer necessary to have the
restrictions. People often argue that if someone who has been subject
to measures for two years, their associations and networks will have
degraded, they will not have used their mobile phone to keep in
contact, they will not have met people outside their home and their
relationships with those with whom they plotted and planned will have
broken down to such an extent that it would be safe to remove the TPIM
to allow them to be subject, perhaps to surveillance, but not to the
measures in the
order.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000259">&#160;</a>

probing amendment, so there may not necessarily be a detailed logic
behind what she is advocating. She proposes to allow TPIMs to be
extended for one year, but how will that additional year—over
and above the two years that apply—make a difference, and did
she consider an 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 200<a class="bkMark" name="Column200">&#160;</a>
                  </div>extension of more than one year to be certain that the networks she

                  </strong> I put in a further year because I was conscious
that people would argue that, without an end point for the TPIM, the
suggestion would simply amount to an annual renewal. The key question
is whether the networks have degraded to such an extent that we can
collectively be assured that removing the TPIM notice will not expose
the public to too high a risk, and to be assured that we have got the
balance right. I put in a further year, because it is right to have
such an end
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000261">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Cambridge asked what kind of cases might fall within
that definition. I draw to his attention the case of AM, in which a
control order was imposed on a subject in June 2007 and came up for
renewal in 2009. The evidence was scrutinised extremely closely by the
High Court because, in relation to control orders, the courts are
always conscious that they should keep in mind the minimum period
necessary commensurate with public safety. Just as will be the case for
TPIMs, control orders have to be renewed and subject to judicial
scrutiny, and quite rightly
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000262">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
the case of AM, Mr Justice Wilkie looked at the material—it was
open rather than closed material—about someone who was part of
the cell planning the transatlantic liquid bomb plot, who was an
al-Qaeda sympathiser and who had connections with others involved in
such plots. Mr Justice Wilkie, who had an opportunity to hear AM speak
on his own behalf and personally to assess him on the strength of his
evidence, said that he
was<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000263">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“highly
intelligent, calm and cautious beyond his years. He was only prepared
to say in oral evidence whatever was contained in his written evidence.
He is strong minded and disciplined. In the face of the overwhelming
evidence against him, his firm consistent denials are, in my judgment,
simply untrue. They have been maintained with a degree of calmness and
self confidence which, in my judgment, is consistent with the view of
the Security Service that he is a disciplined, trained and committed
person whose commitment remains unimpaired…He was and remains
prepared to be a martyr in an attack designed to take many lives. He
remains highly trained, security conscious and
committed.”<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000311">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
was no evidence of new involvement in that case, but the depth of the
risk that AM posed and the likelihood that he would immediately return
to his networks and to active planning were such that the judge, who
had heard the evidence and the individual himself, reached that
assessment. That is a rare case perhaps, but it is a recent one, and
the decision was made that that person was likely to revert
automatically. The judge also said
that<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000264">&#160;</a>

               <p class="hs_brev">“he

activity.”<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000312">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>In
such a case, I would have concerns, particularly if we were in the
exceptional circumstances to which my amendment refers, with the
prospect of his TPIM coming to an end and of him being out on the
streets without there being any measures under TPIM legislation to
monitor his behaviour, may be an unacceptable level of risk when we
seek to balance the rights of the individual with the right of the
community to be protected.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000265">&#160;</a>

further 12 months or a further two years is a matter for debate. I
tabled my amendment to find out whether the Minister shares my unease

establish that sometimes there are practical considerations to which we
have to have regard, as well as theoretical considerations about what
we might like to see in the abstract. That is a practical proposition
for a Minister faced with a set of circumstances that we cannot begin 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 202<a class="bkMark" name="Column202">&#160;</a>
                  </div>to contemplate, where our country is in dire straits and facing
terrorist attacks. There may be circumstances in which he would be loth
to allow persons subject to a TPIM to suddenly not be subject to any
measures whatsoever.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000273">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That
takes into account the fact that many of the Minister’s
arguments rest on the fact that the additional resources that he is
giving to the police and security services will be sufficient to close
the gap in increased risk. If he faces exceptional circumstances, with
a number of simultaneous attacks on the country, the pressures on the
Security Service and the police will be enormous. If I were making the
decisions that he is making , I would want at least some flexibility so
that, if a TPIM was about to come to an end and I had no prospect of
renewal, I might be able to renew it for a limited fixed period of a
year. At the end of that period, if the exceptional circumstances on
terror attacks had abated, he would be able to make the decision. If
they had not, a Secretary of State might want to come back to the House
to introduce further legislation. At least the amendment
would give him some flexibility in the exceptional circumstances that I
have set out. It echoes many of the amendments that Opposition Members
have tabled, and which give the Secretary of State flexibility in
powers on relocation, access to mobile phones and computers, and the
extension of a TPIM notice. In each circumstance, the Government are
limiting the flexibility to cope with changing circumstances when
national security is at issue. I genuinely believe that the amendments
that we have tabled provide a little flexibility and discretion. In the
case of a tiny minority of people and where the balance lies with the
protection of the public, the Secretary of State would be able to take
the necessary
steps.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000274">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I do not intend to detain the Committee very
long. The right hon. Lady said something along the following lines. I
am afraid I did not write quickly enough, but we can consult
<em>Hansard</em> in due course. Towards the end of her argument, she said
that there may be circumstances in which the Home Secretary would be
loth to permit someone subject to a TPIM not to be subject to any
measures at all. That was how I heard it. According to her argument,
the circumstances in which the Home Secretary might be loth to permit a
person to come off a TPIM may occur 23 months after the TPIM has been
imposed, or at 35 months if the amendment is accepted. They might occur
thereafter if a different amendment were made enabling the TPIM to run
on and on. It is for that reason, I am afraid, that I do not support
amendment 127, because there is an arbitrary cut-off point at three
years.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000275">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I described
the argument—not the right hon. Lady—as unprincipled. It
makes no more sense to have a three-year cut-off point than it does to
have a two-year cut-off point. If we adopt the argument that the right
hon. Lady urges on the Committee, we might as well have a five-year
cut-off point or no cut-off point at all. The only point that I was
making to the right hon. Lady was that if she actually believed the
argument that she was advancing, she ought to have the courage of her
convictions and develop it to it logical conclusion and say that there
should be no cut-off point for TPIMs at all, so that they could be
rolled over indefinitely. That was the point that 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 203<a class="bkMark" name="Column203">&#160;</a>
                  </div>I was making, and it was for that reason that I described her argument
as unprincipled—in other words, for the simple reason that it
is.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000276">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I appreciate the comments made by the right
hon. Member for Salford and Eccles. I also note the comments made by my
hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham. The
right hon. Lady said she accepted that it was not right and appropriate
to warehouse people on a TPIM indefinitely. I welcome that comment.
Under the control order regime, it is possible to continue the control
order without limitation, subject to annual renewal. The regime that we
set out in the Bill requires a TPIM to be granted and the relevant
tests that we have just considered in clause 3 to be satisfied. The
TPIM is then in operation for a year and a further assessment on
whether to renew it for a second year has to be made by the Secretary
of State at the end of the first year. Unless new terrorism-related
activity comes to light at the end of the two-year period, the TPIM
comes to an end. It demonstrates our belief that the measures should
not be used to warehouse people and should not be imposed indefinitely
on individuals who have not been convicted of any crime. The Secretary
of State may be satisfied by the relevant test, and can impose the TPIM
at the outset. That test needs to be satisfied at the end of two years
for new terrorism-related activity as defined in clause 3, if it is to
be extended.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000277">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That is
important, because ultimately we want to see people coming off TPIMs in
the same way that the previous Government wanted to see people coming
off control orders, managing the process and preparations over that
period. In some ways, having the two-year requirement focuses attention
on the fact that this is intended to be a temporary measure, and that
it is intended to allow time for such preparation to take
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000278">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I note the
right hon. Lady’s anxiety, which underpins her desire to add a
further year. Her amendment is drafted in such a way that it could be
interpreted as a wish to add a further year and a further year and a
further year. She said that that is not the intention, and I understand
that, and that the amendment intends to provide for a maximum period of
three years. Ultimately, she accepted that there has to be an end
point. We have carefully considered what the duration of a TPIM should
be and have come to the conclusion that two years is the appropriate
period. Careful consideration and close working with the police and the
security services will be required to assess and manage the risk posed
by an individual at the end of the two-year period, or, in the right
hon. Lady’s analysis, at the end of the three-year
period.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000279">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The two-year
period is appropriate, as it strikes the right balance. It provides
safeguards during the time period, enables preparations to be
undertaken, and allows further extensions to be granted if there is new
evidence of involvement in terrorism-related activity. It does not
simply look back, as it recognises the important work that the security
services and the police would need to undertake, during and after that
period, to ensure that the appropriate support is
provided.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000280">&#160;</a>

                  </div>“That is that,” when we get to the two years, and that the
security services will have to find another way, which is unspecified,
to deal with the threat. In the judgment that my right hon. Friend read
out, the judge made it clear that that individual would still be
committed to the cause. We have not heard what the Minister would do in
those circumstances. Perhaps we need a little bit
more.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000281">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I am sure that the right hon. Lady can speak
for herself, but my understanding is that the amendment seeks a single
one-year extension. The amendment does not deal with the
point made by the hon. Gentleman. We have made it clear that where the
individual does not re-engage in terrorism-related activity and it is
not possible to impose further measures, but where they are assessed as
having the potential still to pose some form of risk, they will, of
course, be managed by the police and the security intelligence agencies
through other arrangements. The additional resources that we are
providing for covert investigation will help to deal with that, too, in
the same way that the measure would work at the end of the three-year
period suggested by the right hon. Lady. That is a means of dealing
with the issue at the end of the appropriate period. Otherwise, we
would be led down the path of saying that we have to warehouse people.
That is why there is some confusion as to whether it is warehousing, or
whether there is an end point to a TPIM. We have set out clearly our
position that we need an end point, with support, which is being
provided and will continue to be provided, to manage risk at the end of
the TPIM period. The hon. Member for Bradford South seems to be
suggesting that continual arrangements should be in place, which
differs from the point made by his right hon. Friend the Member for
Salford and Eccles. I think that that represents a clear distinction
between
us.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000282">&#160;</a>

that this is a probing amendment, because we want to tease out from the

which will rely on the additional resources. That is a fair answer. I
think it is a tremendous risk, but the Minister thinks
otherwise.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000283">&#160;</a>

because it is exactly what I sought to achieve with this amendment.
That is why I framed it in terms of exceptional circumstances. If the
country faces multiple threats and if we are to introduce emergency
legislation that might include enhanced measures in the TPIM regime,
the prospect of people coming off a TPIM is a cliff edge. How we manage
the situation is a genuine scenario that we ought to consider. It
should also include what the transition should be when a TPIM comes to
an end. I am grateful to the Minister for his comments on that
matter.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000286">&#160;</a>

his clarification that he was referring to my amendment rather than me
when he used the term “unprincipled.” Perhaps he will
agree that the provision for a two-year TPIM is equally unprincipled,
because it has an arbitrary cut-off point. The legislation frames it as
a two-year order, rather than a three-year order. I am seeking to do a
pragmatic and practical thing. I do not think that our British law can
have a regime of indefinite detention without trial, as was the case
with the Special Immigration Appeals Commission and the original
detainees. That decision was overturned by the courts, which was the
whole reason for control orders, and now we have
TPIMs.<a class="bkMark" name="11062893000287">&#160;</a>

a TPIM. I might feel slightly more

recognition that sometimes somebody’s commitment to terrorism is
not necessarily degraded simply by the expiration of a period of two
years or, indeed, as the hon. and learned Gentleman has said, three
years. However, a point has to be made that is commensurate with the
principles of our legal system, as the hon. Member for Cambridge has
