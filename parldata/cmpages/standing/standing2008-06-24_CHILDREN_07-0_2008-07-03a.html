Loughton</b> (East Worthing and Shoreham) (Con): I cannot
remember where I had got to before lunch, but perhaps I can finish off
by saying that the aim of this probing amendment is to tease out a bit
more information than was teased out by the amendment that my noble
Friend Baroness Morris of Bolton tabled in the House of Lords. We want
to ensure that inspections of residential children&#146;s homes are
meaningful and not just inspections of the accommodation&#146;s
physical suitability. We want to broaden the scope of what is taken
into account, so that consideration can be given to the promotion of
the child&#146;s welfare and safety.</div>
<a name="08070411000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Much earlier
in our proceedings, I gave the example of a children&#146;s home in
my constituency. It was a nice converted farmhouse in the middle of the
rolling downs of Sussex, but the children were running amok, and their
welfare was clearly not being catered for. However, that did not
necessarily come out in the Ofsted inspection report, and the new
clause is intended to probe such issues. There is no statutory duty to
consider the real aim of children&#146;s homes&#151;to promote
children&#146;s well-being&#151;and such a duty should be included
in the Bill.</div>
<a name="08070411000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000374"></a>The
Minister for Children, Young People and Families (Beverley
Hughes):</b> I hope that all hon. Members agree that the
Government have been very clear about the need to safeguard children
and promote their welfare. Indeed, that is an important part of the
remit of the new Ofsted, which took over the regulation of
children&#146;s social care in April 2007.</div>
<a name="08070411000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section
119(3) of the Education and Inspections Act 2006, when read with
section 117(2), sets out the factors to which the chief inspector must
have regard in performing her functions. The first item on the list
is</div>
<a name="08070411000317"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the need to
safeguard and promote the rights and welfare of
children&#148;.</div><a name="08070411000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a core responsibility of Ofsted and the chief inspector; it applies
to all their functions, rather than being selectively attached to
individual functions.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column220" />Column number: 220</div><a name="08070411000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">This morning,
the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham set out the intention
behind the new clause, which is to secure a broad scope for inspections
of children&#146;s homes. Her Majesty&#146;s chief inspector draws
her power to inspect children&#146;s homes not from
section 147 of the 2006 Act, to which the new clause
relates, but from section 148. Section 148 transfers functions under
part 2 of the Care Standards Act 2000 from the former Commission for
Social Care Inspection to the chief inspector.</div>
<a name="08070411000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no
disagreement about what we understand the intentions behind the new
clause to be. When inspecting children&#146;s homes, however, Ofsted
should and does consider a range of matters. Comprehensive law is
already in place setting out the appropriate factors that inspectors
must consider when inspecting children&#146;s homes and, indeed, any
other institutions and services. Sections 22 and 23 of the Care
Standards Act, for example, give the Secretary of State the power to
make regulations and publish statements of national minimum standards
against which children&#146;s homes are inspected. Those regulations
and national minimum standards cover a broad range of issues relating
to the welfare of children in homes, as well as matters such as the
fitness of managers and staff; they are not solely about the premises
and material conditions.</div>
<a name="08070411000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the
chief inspector inspects children&#146;s homes, fostering agencies,
voluntary support agencies, adoption support agencies and all the other
services within her remit, she must, as I explained, have regard to the
matters set out in section 117(2) of the 2006 Act. As I said, the first
aspect of that remit is</div>
<a name="08070411000318"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the need to
safeguard and promote the rights and welfare of
children&#148;.</div><a name="08070411000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
those reasons, new clause 11 is unnecessary. It adds nothing in
legislative terms to the existing safeguards for
children.</div><a name="08070411000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
primary objective is to ensure that as those legislative requirements
are implemented, the types of situation outlined by the hon. Gentleman,
which may be familiar to other Members, are dealt with to the extent
that Ofsted is much more rigorous in ensuring compliance with existing
standards, which it is Ofsted&#146;s purpose to oversee. I hope that
the hon. Gentleman will accept my assurances and feel able to withdraw
the new
clause.</div><a name="08070411000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000375"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I am grateful for that answer. In the interest
of brevity and elegance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
motion.</div><a name="08070411000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Motion

Loughton:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column221" />Column number: 221</div><a name="08070411000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause
deals with a rather more weighty subject that has been of concern to
many who keep an eye on adoption issues. I flagged up this concern
during Committee stage of the Adoption and Children Act 2002, when the
law on adoption was changed, and the same concern has been raised in
the press and by other hon. Members. It is that a perverse incentive
arises from the way in which the Government financially incentivise
adoption targets, such that some adoptions may be taking place that do
not meet the thresholds for an adoption that would normally need to be
met. I shall not give reams of categorical evidence that that is
happening&#151;</div><a name="08070411000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000377"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children, Schools and
Families (Kevin Brennan):</b> Is there
any?</div><a name="08070411000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000378"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I will if the Under-Secretary wants. There is a
suspicion&#151;an impression&#151;that needs to be either allayed
or dispelled.</div>
<a name="08070411000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Through the
use of certain targeted grants, as announced by various Ministers and
confirmed in parliamentary questions answered by Ministers, including
the hon. Gentleman and the Minister for Local Government, performance
reward grants have operated in past years. According to an answer on 3
September last year, the figures for how much grant money each local
authority received between 2004-05 and 2006-07 in relation to their
performance on adoption targets were released in a table. The figures
show that authorities have been incentivised for meeting national
adoption targets. The Under-Secretary defined those targets in an
answer to the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (John Hemming) on 23
July. He said</div>
<a name="08070411000319"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
national adoption target was announced in 2000 to increase the number
of adoptions of looked after children by 40 per cent. by the year
ending March 2005, and to exceed this by achieving, if possible, a 50
per cent. increase by the end of March
2006.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 23 July 2007; Vol. 463,
c.
838W.]</div><a name="08070411000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most
of us would agree that we need to increase quality adoptions to give
damaged children the very best second chance to enjoy the benefits of a
stable family life, which might put them back on the straight and
narrow, for want of a better phrase. It was particularly envisaged that
we would concentrate most on getting children out of the care system
who had been there for a long time and ensuring that, if there was no
prospect of them going back to their birth parents or kinship family,
they would be placed in stable adoptive situations. I think that we all
agree with that objective, although there are other countries that take
a different approach. The other day I cited Denmark, where in the year
before last&#151;the last year for which I have figures&#151;only
20 adoptions took place, but that has much more to do with the
flexibility of the system in and out of care, the greater use of
residential children&#146;s homes and so on.</div>
<a name="08070411000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">I disagreed
at the time the 2002 legislation was passed with the use of numerical
adoption targets&#151;a very blunt instrument&#151;backed up by
financial incentives, which could create a perverse incentive for a
local authority that had not met its adoption targets to clamour around
desperately at the end of the year to find a few soft targets to boost
its adoption figures. Theoretically, that could happen. Although we
know that an authority would have to go through all sorts of procedures
for the care proceedings and pass the various 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column222" />Column number: 222</div>thresholds, there could be a perverse incentive to try to find some
adoption candidates to meet those targets before a year
ends.</div><a name="08070411000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
fear that something along those lines may be happening is borne out
when one looks at the demographics of adoptions that have taken place.
I pluck out the example of Hammersmith and Fulham, which has received
about &#163;500,000 as a reward for placing more than 100 children
for adoption in three years. It exceeded its goal of 101 adoptions and
secured 106 by the target deadline. It is interesting to look at what
happened after those adoption targets ended&#151;they no longer exist
in their old form. The number of babies placed for adoption by that
authority fell substantially. In 2005, there were 21, in 2006 there
were 23 and in 2007 the figure dropped to 10. The figures are also
likely to be low this year. These are not children who have been in the
care system for some time, but new babies who are taken from their
mothers at an early
stage.</div><a name="08070411000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not trying to undermine the system of fast-track baby adoption that
we approved in the 2002 Act. If a mother with or without another parent
is incapable of taking on the responsibilities of caring for her baby,
there is a case for that child being placed for adoption as soon as
possible, subject to the checks, procedures and appeals. I am not just
picking on Hammersmith and Fulham; there are many similar cases. If one
looks at the overall figure, the number of babies placed for adoption
rather than returned to their parents is very high. It increased during
the years when the performance targets were
operating.</div><a name="08070411000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a perfectly justified suspicion that the targets are leading to
perverse incentives to adopt more children than would normally be
adopted, particularly focusing on babies. That does not do anyone any
good. I am not trying to suggest that there is systemic abuse of the
process, with social workers going around assuming the role of child
snatchers, as many in the more sensationalist media would have us
believe. Such views have not been beneficial and have not helped the
perception and the image of social workers, which we talked about
earlier. One way of dispelling that is to say that these targets should
not be
allowed.</div><a name="08070411000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know that the targets have changed in the last couple of years, but the
principle is wrong. The principle can lead to the wrong outcomes and to
all sorts of allegations that are harmful to the adoption process and
to the work of social workers. The commission on social workers that I
chaired concluded that the Government should not use such targets. That
is why new clause 12 states the case quite simply. It is a probing new
clause, and the Minister will no doubt tell me that it would not fit
into this part of the Bill, but it is useful to have this debate none
the less. The Government need to state clearly that they will not use
these sorts of targets. They must send out a clear message that they
will come down heavily on any authority that appears to be
over-enthusiastic in its adoptions. We must ensure that we increase
adoptions, but we must do so for the right
reasons.</div><a name="08070411000053"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070411000379"></a><b class="B">Annette
Brooke</b> (Mid-Dorset and North Poole) (LD): Does the hon.
Gentleman agree that it would be helpful if the Minister explained why
there has been little change in the number of adoptions from the older
age group while there has been a large increase in adoptions of very
young babies? I would sincerely like an explanation for
that.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000380"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> The hon. Lady makes a key point. That was why I
singled out the increase in the baby figures and the fact that we need
to make the most progress in getting the hard-core cases, many of which
are difficult and challenging teenagers who are not easy to adopt, out
of the care system and into some form of permanent adoption if there is
no way they can go back to their birth parents or other members of
their family. That is where we are trying to get them. The hon. Lady
makes a perfectly pertinent point, so I hope that the Minister will
address those concerns in his reply. It is a genuine concern that we
need to dispel, because it does no one in the business of adoption any
good.</div><a name="08070411000343"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div><a name="08070411000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000381"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> Perhaps I can express a little disappointment
with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s contribution on this occasion, just
for the sake of symmetry. To be fair, he is usually pretty assiduous in
his research and uses real evidence to support his points, but most of
what he has just said did not seem to be based on evidence. He used
words such as suspicion, impression, hypotheticals and fear, but then
proceeded to claim that it does no good to spread suspicion or have
those sorts of stories circulating in the wilder corners of the
media.</div>
<a name="08070411000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to make a few points absolutely clear. It is wrong to claim that local
authorities were incentivised in any way to meet a national adoption
target. That is not true and I will explain why later. It has always
been and remains the Government&#146;s policy that children should
live with their parents whenever possible and that when necessary,
families should be given extra support to help keep them together.
Naturally, the expectations placed on local authorities through
legislation reflect that policy.</div>
<a name="08070411000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for East Worthing and Shoreham was a member of the Committee
that scrutinised the Children and Adoption Bill a few years ago, so he
knows that the national adoption target, which ended in March 2006,
applied only to the number of adoptions of children who were already in
care and waiting to be placed for adoption and to the speeding up of
that process, which we all agreed had to be improved. Those targets
reflected the Government&#146;s desire to reverse the long-term
decline in the number of children already in care achieving permanent
adoption.</div>
<a name="08070411000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of those targets was to give hundreds more of our most vulnerable
children the chance to benefit from a safe, stable and loving family
life and fulfil their potential. That is exactly the right thing to do,
so I make no apology for it whatever. Local authorities were neither
compelled to meet national adoption targets, nor financially rewarded
against them. Having run its course and achieved its purpose, the
national adoption target was not extended beyond March 2006 and the
Government currently have no plans to reintroduce
it.</div><a name="08070411000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local
authorities are relevant in this respect because some of them chose to
develop local adoption targets as part of the local area agreements,
formerly known as local public service agreements. As with the national
target, those targets were focused on children already in the care
system. In other words, some councils judged themselves weak at helping
children find new families in a timely way and chose their own local
targets that were linked, in general with other issues, to the
rewarding of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column224" />Column number: 224</div>funding. The Government never imposed adoption targets on individual
local authorities in any way whatever. Indeed, as I think the hon.
Member for East Worthing and Shoreham acknowledged, the local
government White Paper commitments mean that the Government will now
only agree targets with local authorities against indicators drawn from
the national indicator set, which contains no indicator for measuring
the number of adoptions from care.</div>
<a name="08070411000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first
point is that any targets that existed, whether the national target set
by the Government or those that a local authority decided to set for
itself, are no longer in place. As I have said, I make no apology at
all for the national target set by the Government, because it
successfully improved the speed at which children were able to go
through the care system when they were already judged suitable for
adoption. In the new system there will be no financial incentives for
performance against specific targets; instead, local areas will be able
to earn limited reward funding based on average performance across a
range of targets agreed with the Government and their local
authorities, but adoption will not be
included.</div><a name="08070411000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000382"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> Did that target specify how long the children
needed to have been in care? Could they have been in care for just a
day or
two?</div><a name="08070411000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000383"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> The national target was to increase by 40 per
cent.&#151;more if possible&#151;the number of looked-after
children who were adopted within a specified time. That target was not
quite reached&#151;38 per cent. was the outcome figure. All councils
were meant to bring their performance up to that level. If I have not
answered the hon. Lady&#146;s question, she might want to come back
on
that.</div><a name="08070411000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000384"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> My question was whether the target specified how
long the children that one wished to move out of care had been in care.
Could an authority count children who had only been in care for seven
days?</div><a name="08070411000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000385"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> I apologise to the hon. Lady. The target was
nothing to do with how long the children had been in care, it was about
whether they had been in care and judged suitable for adoption. It
would be impossible for them to be part of a target if they had been in
care for just one day. The target kicked in only after a judgment had
been made that adoption was the right route. If they had been in care
for only one day, they would not yet have been assessed as suitable for
adoption.</div><a name="08070411000065"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070411000386"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Edward Timpson</b> (Crewe and Nantwich) (Con): Will the
Minister clarify whether when he says that the child had been judged
suitable for adoption he means that the child had then been placed
through the adoption
panel?</div><a name="08070411000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000387"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> Yes, that is absolutely correct. That is the
point at which the target would kick in. When we debated the Adoption
and Children Bill in 2001, concern was expressed that too many children
were languishing in care when it had already been decided&#151;the
paramountcy principle having been considered&#151;that the
appropriate way forward for them was to be placed for adoption. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column225" />Column number: 225</div>They were not being placed for adoption quickly
because local authorities were not being very effective or efficient in
finding the right family for them. That was the purpose of the national
adoption target, and it was
successful.</div><a name="08070411000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000388"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Just to be clear on the point made by the hon.
Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole, on the back of the accelerated
adoption processes for babies in particular&#151;which we enabled
through the Adoption and Children Act 2002&#151;more babies could
come into the care system and be quickly adopted, and they therefore
formed part of the adoption figures that met the adoption targets. That
would appear to be borne out by the fact that the biggest increase in
adoptions has been in the adoption of young babies. That is the case,
is it
not?</div><a name="08070411000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000389"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> The key safeguard in all cases is that no child
can be adopted unless it has been through the proper procedures,
including the court procedures. We all agreed, and it was absolutely
the case, that where it was appropriate that a baby be placed for
adoption it should happen quickly. What are being conflated in the
argument, perhaps deliberately in some cases&#151;not here but in
some of the media accounts&#151;are the local area agreement targets
and the national target on adoption. There is no evidence at local
target level that the policy has resulted in any inappropriate
adoptions&#151;none whatever. In fact, the available evidence
suggests that local authorities that included time-limited adoption
increases as part of their local public service agreement were already
well below average in using adoption as a permanent option for
looked-after children in comparison to other local authorities. They
set fairly modest targets, as the hon. Member for East Worthing and
Shoreham indicated, and even when they achieved those targets in full,
the individual local authorities involved rarely became above average
performers in terms of adoption as a permanent option, even in the
short term while the targets were in place.</div>
<a name="08070411000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have seen
no evidence of inappropriate adoptions resulting from the target. It is
very sad that some accounts&#151;not from anybody on the Committee,
but elsewhere&#151;have given the impression that Ministers, judges,
social workers, lawyers, solicitors, CAFCASS officers and a range of
other people are involved in some sort of conspiracy to kidnap babies
from otherwise loving families to meet adoption targets. That sort of
swivel-eyed nonsense is exactly what contributes to our problems in
improving the image of social workers and in ensuring that children in
care, whom the Bill is largely designed to assist, have the best
possible outcomes. The extent to which we pander to those views is very
dangerous to what we are trying to
do.</div><a name="08070411000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
us base our deliberations on evidence. There is no evidence of
inappropriate adoptions. There are no national targets in place now,
the national target having achieved its outcome. Councils set local
targets for themselves because they felt that they needed to challenge
their poor performance; the Government did not set them. They are no
longer in place and there is no evidence whatever that they resulted in
inappropriate adoptions. I see no need to adopt an amendment that would
tie the hands of future Governments seeking to improve adoption
performance, although targets are not currently needed because of the
improvements made directly as a result of the 2002 Act and the national
target set at that time.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column226" />Column number: 226</div><a name="08070411000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
call for consensus on adoption across the Committee and across the
parties in the House, and hope that we can reach it. Given that no
targets are in place at this point, and that the hon. Member for East
Worthing and Shoreham fundamentally disagrees with targets, consensus
should be possible without the necessity for his amendment. On that
basis, I invite him to withdraw it.</div>
<a name="08070411000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000390"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> We needed to have this discussion. I think the
Minister and I are entirely at one on what needs to be achieved, which
is an increase in adoption, particularly for those who are in the care
system for far too long and in many cases spend their entire youth in
the care system without the chance of adoption. I have been very
careful not to make wild allegations about inappropriate adoptions. One
cannot deny, however, that the system is such that they could happen,
nor could one say that they would not happen. There would be no
question of anybody pandering to the allegations if the Government had
not introduced the performance reward grants in the first place, or
subsequently allowed local authorities to include any adoption target
within local area agreements. That is where the problems come in and
that is what we warned about in 2001. A question remains. I am
interested in further analysis from the Minister&#146;s Department as
to why there has been such a big increase in the adoption of babies,
which is part of the targets, but little movement in the adoption of
older children, on whom we should be
concentrating.</div>
<a name="08070411000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000391"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> I will be happy to send the hon. Gentleman some
further information on that point. It is true that more children aged
between zero and one are coming into care, but the compensating figure
for children aged between one and four balances that. In other words,
early intervention is working exactly as we want it to. We have learned
the lessons about the need to ensure that we intervene early where
children are genuinely at risk and the statistics absolutely bear that
out.</div>
<a name="08070411000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, does
the hon. Gentleman not accept that for those aspersions to be true in
some way&#151;aspersions that the system conspired to put people up
for adoption inappropriately&#151;the court system itself and the
judges involved in it would have to have been part of that
conspiracy?</div>
<a name="08070411000344"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30
pm</div><a name="08070411000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000392"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I entirely take the Minister&#146;s point and
I am not suggesting that there was a conspiracy. However, the evidence
supplied by social workers closest to the case will weigh heavily in
court and, without there having to be any sort of conspiracy, if a
claim is being made by an employee of the local authority and that
authority stands to benefit from a performance reward grant, clearly
there is the potential for that employee to over-egg the claim when
otherwise they might not have done so. That situation does not require
a conspiracy.</div>
<a name="08070411000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part of the
problem is the pressure on the courts at the moment. I have sat in
family courts where the judge will tell me that there have been changes
in social workers and the paperwork is enormous&#151;we will go on to
talk about transparency in family courts when we discuss another
amendment very shortly&#151;so I know that the scrutiny of some of
these cases is not as tight as it might be. On that basis, some of
these numbers, hypothetically, could be raised higher than we would
like.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column227" />Column number: 227</div><a name="08070411000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point is that, ultimately, the overall adoption figures have not risen
recently and we need them to rise; in particular, we need them to rise
more for older children than for babies. That is a real problem that we
need to face. However, I hope that when the Minister endeavours to
tackle it again&#151;I realise that all sorts of things are happening
that are ongoing&#151;he will not revert to coming up with some sort
of financial incentive that is based on numerical targets, because that
will only give rise to further suspicions that children are being
inappropriately adopted at an early age who would otherwise not
necessarily justify being adopted.</div>
<a name="08070411000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not wish
to put this matter to a vote. On that basis, I am grateful for the
debate that we have had and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
motion.</div><a name="08070411000079"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000396"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> It is slightly unfortunate that new clause 13
has been grouped with new clauses 17 and 18, which the hon. Member for
Mid-Dorset and North Poole will be speaking to in more detail; I will
just touch on them.</div>
<a name="08070411000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 13
is another new clause that was tabled and debated in the House of
Lords; it was originally tabled by Lord Northbourne. He sought to
clarify and embed in law the responsibilities that a person assumes
when they accept the responsibility of caring for a child who will live
with them as a result of a residence order. It is critical for the
child and for the parents of that child, who the child is not living
with, that the child receives the parenting that they need. So this is
purely a probing amendment to engage in a discussion of what parenthood
is all about and what the responsibilities of parenthood are.</div>
<a name="08070411000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
and I can have&#151;indeed, we have had&#151;endless debates about
over-nannying states and ill-equipped parents and so forth. Actually,
however, it is fundamental to the Bill to establish what qualifies
somebody to take on the role of a parent if the birth parents are
deemed to be no longer capable of doing that.</div>
<a name="08070411000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason
that I raise this issue now is that, at the end of the debate in the
Lords, Lord Adonis indicated that the Government were prepared to look
at it further and I just wondered whether there has been any progress
since then. Therefore, the Minister will have the opportunity to update
the Committee if there is anything to report back on.</div>
<a name="08070411000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clauses
17 and 18, grouped with new clause 13, are in the name of the hon.
Member for Birmingham, Yardley and other hon. Members, and I have added
my name to those of my hon. Friends who are supporting them. These new
clauses address an issue that has been the subject of much debate in
the press and on which we had hoped that there would also have been
some movement in Government as a result of the consultation that took
place on the transparency of the family courts. However, that
consultation largely came to nothing, so they deal with the problems of
transparency within the family courts.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column229" />Column number: 229</div><a name="08070411000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have strong reservations about the watertightness&#151;that is not a
good word to use&#151;of the family court system. I have sat in on
family courts and my hon. Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich may
wish to make comments about his much greater personal experience. There
is great pressure on the officers and agencies that are privy to family
court proceedings, not least on social workers. There is a large
turnover in social workers attached to cases. I have given the example
of when I sat in court for a day and the judge told me that all the
social workers he had seen were different from the ones who had started
the cases he was judging. For those reasons, there is a propensity for
mistakes to happen and for wrong records to be taken. That can easily
happen, but often those wrong records are not corrected and erroneous
information is resurrected later in proceedings. Because different
social workers are often involved, that information is taken as
gospel.</div><a name="08070411000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is essential that we provide for far greater transparency in family
court proceedings so that when mistakes are made they can be
challenged. It is important that it is seen to be challenged and that
the correct information is seen to be put on the record to the
satisfaction of all parties involved. I recognise that that must be
done sensitively. I am not coming up with a blueprint for how
transparency in the family courts could be achieved. Such procedures
would have to take account of the child&#146;s right to anonymity and
of whether members of the public should be allowed in to see the court
proceedings. That raises all sorts of potential issues. For example, a
vexatious neighbour might want to make mischief by sitting in on family
court proceedings. That could cause
problems.</div><a name="08070411000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">Despite
those problems, it should be possible to publish court proceedings for
the appropriate people so that there is a greater chance for scrutiny.
Connected persons might wish to say, &#147;Hold on, that&#146;s not
true,&#148; or &#147;This was thrown out at an earlier
stage,&#148; or &#147;It was pointed out that that was not
true.&#148; That would improve the
system.</div><a name="08070411000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand why reform of the family court system was largely terminated
when the Leader of the House was responsible for it. I had a private
meeting with her when she was very keen to progress this issue. The
confidentiality of children&#146;s concerns was an important factor.
That was an interesting angle that not many people had considered at
the outset. However, the problem still remains. We see it as
constituency MPs, when it is usually aggrieved fathers who come to us.
Some of the more militant of them unhelpfully get involved with the
organisations that we can all think of, but which we need not name.
That escalates the matter, which is in nobody&#146;s interests, least
of all the children about whom we should care
most.</div><a name="08070411000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clauses would lay down a framework for publishing court proceedings
and for determining who had access to them. I thought that we had
addressed part of this issue in the Children Act 2004. At that time,
the sister of the Leader of the House was involved in a case where she
unwittingly disclosed information about a family court case to her,
which was deemed to be against the law. I thought that we amended the
2004 Act. I tabled an amendment whereby constituents could discuss
their cases with their MP without falling foul of the confidentiality
of the family courts. I understand that there are still
problems.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column230" />Column number: 230</div><a name="08070411000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clauses would start the ball rolling to improve the transparency
of, and therefore the confidence in, the family court system. These are
probing new clauses so the Minister can say why they may or may not be
practical. Perhaps he might explain what it would take for changes to
be made in the system to give greater assurances to the many aggrieved
people who come to us because of the court
proceedings.</div><a name="08070411000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000397"></a>Mr.
Timpson:</b> I know from my own experience that there has been
an increase in the number of written judgments issued and approved by
judges in controversial family law cases, particularly those that have
then crept into the criminal arena such as cases of non-accidental
injury. There has also been an increase in cases being judged worthy of
publication through bad practice, not only from local authorities, but
from other agencies. Does my hon. Friend therefore agree that a
presumption that there would be a written judgment in a family case,
unless there was good reason not to do so, such as for public interest
immunity or the particular sensitivity of the case, would at least be a
starting point in opening up the family courts to a more transparent
way
forward?</div><a name="08070411000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000398"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> My hon. Friend makes a very good point, which is
obviously born out of his experience in this area. Clearly something
has to be done. Many hon. Members from their own experiences both with
their constituents and in their professional and legal backgrounds have
a contribution to make here. It is not a subject that will go away. An
increase in the publication of written judgments will go some way to
allay the suspicions that things are being swept under the carpet.
Again, as with our last debate, I am being careful not to scaremonger,
but this is an increasingly widely touted concern that needs to be
addressed. I will not detain the Committee for any longer. Hon. Members
want to make some comments and then we want to hear what the Minister
proposes as a way
forward.</div><a name="08070411000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000399"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I would like to place on record that I am not in
the business of pandering to the media or any other people.
Nevertheless, cases come to light. There are questions and it is
difficult to answer the accusations at times in the current situation.
It would be for the greatest good if we could manage to progress
openness and transparency in some way. I was keen that we should have a
discussion in Committee because that is the most appropriate way to
tease out some ideas on the way forward. I was quite taken with the
suggestion from the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich, which I have
also heard made by
judges.</div><a name="08070411000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am a little bit concerned about new clause 17 because it does not seem
to cover the welfare of the child. However, I appreciate the sentiments
behind it and I want more openness. A lot of progress was made and the
former Constitutional Affairs Committee published a report on family
courts. There was a lot of evidence on how we could progress to more
openness. Of course we must respect the views of young people because
we are repeatedly saying that we should seek their views, but I feel
that we should try to find a way around this to dispel the myths and
suspicion.</div><a name="08070411000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 18, to which I put my name to ensure that it was discussed, has
some rather important elements. We have to assume that there will
occasionally be a miscarriage of justice. There will occasionally be
mistakes by medical experts. There will occasionally be mistakes 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column231" />Column number: 231</div>by social services staff. It concerns me that
although wild allegations are around us all the time, if we could just
put some more checks and balances into the system, we might be able to
tighten it up
more.</div><a name="08070411000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
specifics here, which seem fairly reasonable to me&#151;I am ready to
be contradicted&#151;are that someone should be able to go to the
police if they have evidence contrary to that which has been provided.
An example was given of two parents, one blaming the other for
maltreating the child. Although the silence aspect has been addressed,
false allegations could be made, and somebody&#151;perhaps a family
member&#151;might want to go to the
police.</div><a name="08070411000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is also an issue about the right of the party whose child might be
taken away to see a further expert witness. I see the problem with
that&#151;they could go on and on with expert witnesses&#151;but
there are a few well-documented cases in which the judge, when
publishing his views, has acknowledged that a wrong medical procedure
took place that led to a whole sequence of events. It is easy to see
that once one gets on the treadmill and it is suggested that an injury
is non-accidental, it can colour everything that happens. I would
always want to put child protection first&#151;the welfare of the
child is paramount&#151;but there should be scope, for example, to
bring in one&#146;s own expert witness so some assessment could be
made in court.</div>
<a name="08070411000345"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45
pm</div><a name="08070411000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause also includes Members of Parliament and their equivalents in
other parliamentary bodies. Many of us thought that that was dealt with
by an amendment to the Children Act 2004, but I am told that that is
not the case. It puts Members of Parliament in a difficult position
when people come to our surgeries and we are not sure what we can do or
whether we should be hearing the evidence. Some clarity on that is
needed. Surely somebody can be acknowledged who is totally trustworthy,
so people can bring information to them and seek their
advice.</div><a name="08070411000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
are just a few comments. I genuinely want to tease out as much as we
can in Committee, because I suspect that we will return to the issues
on Report, and I would like to get as much on record here as
possible.</div><a name="08070411000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000400"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> I understand the hon. Lady&#146;s comments. As
the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham pointed out, my hon.
Friend Lord Adonis undertook to consider clause 13 further, and we have
done so. At the specific suggestion of Lady Butler-Sloss, the
Government sought the views of the president of the family division of
the High Court and, through him, other senior judges with experience of
family cases and members of the Family Justice Council. The common view
of those experienced practitioners was that they have had no
difficulties managing cases using the current wording of section 3 of
the Act, which defines parental responsibility
as</div><a name="08070411000320"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;all
the rights, duties, powers, responsibilities and authority which by law
a parent of a child has in relation to the child and his
property.&#148;</div><a name="08070411000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
number of senior judges who were consulted further foresaw problems
with a fuller definition such as the one proposed. For example, such a
definition would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column232" />Column number: 232</div>risk becoming a focus of conflict or a cause for further argument
between parents, both of whom say that the statutory definition
entitles them to do something unless prohibited from doing so. The view
is summed up in a letter of advice sent to Lord Adonis by the president
of the family division saying that the proposed amendment</div>
<a name="08070411000321"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is neither
necessary nor
helpful.&#148;</div><a name="08070411000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
believes that</div>
<a name="08070411000322"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to introduce
and define a new concept of the responsibilities of parenthood in the
form of amended section 8(4A) will create scope for argument and
confusion in an area in which none of the many judges I have canvassed
at all levels has ever found the existing definition to present any
practical difficulties&#148;.</div>
<a name="08070411000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have also considered referring the matter to the Law
Commission, recognising that the commission itself recommended the
current definition in its 1988 report &#147;Family Law: Review of
Child Law: Guardianship and Custody&#148;. However, setting to one
side the time that it might take to hear further from the commission,
the view of those consulted was that, in the absence of any substantive
concerns about the current position, such a referral is
unnecessary.</div><a name="08070411000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is worth noting that during the course of the consultations, our
attention was drawn to a leading judgment by the then Mr.
Justice Wall, in the case of Re F (Shared Residence Order)
[2003] 2 FLR 397, which set out an extended list, the contents of which
might be relevant in residence order cases. That case law approach is
echoed in one of the parenting plans, &#147;Putting Children First -
a planner for separating parents&#148;, which was published by my
Department and is now distributed primarily by the Children and Family
Court Advisory and Support Service, with more than 70,000 copies
distributed last year.</div>
<a name="08070411000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe
that the intention behind the new clause, as was made clear when it was
first considered in the other place, is to assist the courts, parents,
relatives and, above all, the children who might become the subject of
residence order proceedings. It would do so by ensuring that those
acquiring parental responsibility by that route are clear about what
they are taking on and that they are suitable to fulfil that vital
role. That is an extremely laudable aim, but given the strength of the
advice we received and the expertise of those whose views have been
provided to us by the president of the family division, the Government
have concluded that those whom we want to assist, namely the children
involved, would be better served by the continuation of the status quo
in this case and that there are positive advantages to that position. I
am sure that the Committee will understand that. The president has
advised
that</div><a name="08070411000323"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
full range of powers and duties of the parent...change and develop
as both the child and the law and practice of parenting change and
develop&#148;.</div><a name="08070411000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government accept that view and consider that there should not be a
refinement or further iteration of the meaning of parental
responsibility within the
Act.</div><a name="08070411000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
new clause 17, I understand the sentiments expressed in the debate and
that the new clause is intended to make the family courts more open by
requiring them to provide written judgments to all parties in family
cases and allowing those people receiving judgments and other documents
to publish them further, potentially even in the
media. The arrangements for providing judgments in
family courts depend on the level of the court involved, as I am sure
hon. Members know, and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column233" />Column number: 233</div>courts are always required to explain their decisions to the parties,
but there is no requirement in the county court or the High Court for
the explanation to be given in writing; often, they are only given
orally and a tape recording is made. It is only in the family
proceedings court that there is a requirement to produce and issue
written reasons to the parties. Like the hon. Member for East Worthing
and Shoreham and other hon. Members, I have sat in on those courts and
observed the proceedings.</div>
<a name="08070411000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Ministry
of Justice has consulted twice, as hon. Members will know in recent
years, on increasing the openness of family courts, and central to that
has been the recognition of the need for better provision of
information about the work of the family courts. It needs to be
accessible to those who are involved in the proceedings, but it is also
important that more information is available to the general public, for
the reasons hon. Members have outlined during the debate. We need to
help people to understand how the courts make those difficult and
important decisions so that the public can have confidence in the
family justice system.</div>
<a name="08070411000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The decision
on whether to publish judgments or permit information from a case to be
published more widely rests with the courts. In broad terms, it makes
that decision by balancing the best interests of the child with the
interests of justice and the public interest in the issues raised by
the case. It will include consideration of the rights of the parties
and the media to freedom of expression under article 10 of the European
convention on human rights and the European convention on the rights of
the child, as well as consideration of the parties&#146; rights to
privacy under article 8 of the convention on human rights. When the
Court of Appeal or the High Court considers the case to have
significant public interest, it is common practice for the judgment,
which is anonymised to protect the interests of the parties,
particularly the children involved, to be published in the law reports
and on the British and Irish Legal Information Institute
website.</div><a name="08070411000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
want to encourage more judgments to be published, but need to balance
that with the demands that publication places on the efficient
operation of the system. We must not risk further delays in the family
courts when we have been working hard to reduce delays. Those delays
directly impact on the children and parents involved in proceedings.
Last summer, the Ministry of Justice announced that it would be
piloting written judgments when a final order is made in certain family
cases, and I can confirm that an announcement about those pilots will
be made to the House after the summer.</div>
<a name="08070411000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 18
would amend the Children Act 1989 so that the courts could not prevent
the disclosure of evidence to the police or any regulatory body. It
would make such disclosure lawful while the proceeds are ongoing and
make it lawful to provide information to an MP, a Member of the Welsh
Assembly or a Member of the European Parliament. It would also make
disclosure lawful for obtaining advice, performing research and
ensuring law enforcement or compliance with regulatory proceedings. I
understand that the new clause is intended to enable people who find
themselves and their children in family proceedings to make wider
disclosure of information from those proceedings than is currently
possible without potentially being in contempt of court.</div>
<a name="08070411000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
disclosure of information for those involved in family proceedings is
an issue that interests hon. Members 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column234" />Column number: 234</div>across the House. I understand that the intention is to overcome some of
the problems faced by people involved in family proceedings who wish to
disclose information or documents that form part of the proceedings to
their MP, for example, for any number of reasons. I understand the
concern that prompted the new clause. The changes that have already
been made are not entirely complete, because there is a problem with
what can be disclosed to an MP while proceedings are
ongoing.</div><a name="08070411000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
are a number of reasons, I cannot agree to the new clause. First, in
October 2005 we changed the rules of court that govern the disclosure
of family court information, making it easier for people involved in
family proceedings to get advice and support and to disclose certain
information in given circumstances without the prior permission of the
court. Those changes sensibly allow people to share information
legitimately with close family members, McKenzie friends and health
professionals. We also made changes so that people can share
information with the police to help with a criminal
investigation&#151;as the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich
mentioned&#151;or to protect children. People may also share some
information with their MP to investigate a complaint or raise a
question of policy or procedure. Those changes have helped people to
get help and support. They have also made it easier for people to make
a complaint to the General Medical Council. After seeing three years of
the changes in action, we think that further changes may be needed.
That is why in June last year, the Justice Secretary consulted further
on the rules and whether further changes were
needed.</div><a name="08070411000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second reason for not accepting the new clause is that this is a
difficult and sensitive area, so we must be careful in our approach. We
must balance one individual&#146;s right to privacy against another
individual&#146;s wish to share documents or details of court
proceedings that might breach that privacy. As hon. Members are aware,
many of the documents we are talking about contain highly sensitive and
personal information, including medical records, details of
people&#146;s mental health status and so on. We need to be alert to
how damaging it could be for an individual if such information was
disclosed inappropriately. However, we must also keep it in mind that
people involved in family proceedings will often seek advice and
support, and we must ensure that they can do so in a simple and timely
manner. That is why we consulted on disclosure last
year.</div><a name="08070411000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have mentioned, the Government will make an announcement to the House
after the summer, following the consultation, and make further detailed
proposals. In developing our policies, we want to work with the Family
Procedure Rule Committee on any amendment to court rules. Given that
work is ongoing and that there is an impending announcement from the
Ministry of Justice, it would be premature at this stage to consider
accepting new clauses 17 and 18. I think that we are all travelling in
the same direction and want to achieve the correct balance. In the
light of what I have said, I hope that hon. Members will not press the
new
clauses.</div><a name="08070411000121"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000404"></a>Mr.
Timpson:</b> It falls to me to speak to new clauses 14 and 40,
which stand in the names of hon. Members from all parties on the
Committee. It would be remiss of me not to say to you, Mr.
Pope, that it has been a delight to serve under your chairmanship on my
first
Committee.</div><a name="08070411000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clauses deal with two principal issues. The first is the
requirement that local authorities continue payments to a foster carer
or foster carers until a determination is reached regarding an
allegation made against them. The second is the protection of the
identity of foster carers who are subject to complaints. There is a
general consensus in the Committee that social workers have not been
valued and that that needs to be recognised in the legislation. It
seems to me and my colleagues that the same can be said of foster
carers. I should say at the outset that the welfare and protection of
children in public care is the primary consideration at the core of the
new
clauses.</div><a name="08070411000346"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2
pm</div><a name="08070411000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important to say that foster carers provide a valuable and vital
service that is complex and highly specialised. They perform a hugely
demanding role, and many do so full time. Given those demands, foster
carers often receive no earnings through employment or lose earnings
through reduced hours. They therefore make an enormous
commitment.</div>
<a name="08070411000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">The dearth of
foster carers has been a theme during our consideration of the Bill. In
2000, the book &#147;Delivering Foster Care&#148; made it clear how
deep that dearth was, saying:</div>
<a name="08070411000324"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
order to meet the demand for placement and to ensure a choice of
placements that can best meet children&#146;s needs, at least 10,000
more foster carers are needed in the
UK&#148;.</div><a name="08070411000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
was said in 2000, but it remains true today. What makes those figures
even more pertinent, however, is that the current population of foster
carers is ageing, with one fifth over 56&#151;and that includes my
own parents.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column236" />Column number: 236</div><a name="08070411000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we are to
increase the pool of foster carers, we need to send out a signal that
we are on their side. One reason for the lack of take-up is the lack of
protection afforded to foster carers in carrying out their role and
particularly during the investigation of allegations. Unlike members of
the teaching profession, foster carers do not benefit from such
protection, and the consequences are potentially hugely damaging, not
only for the individual foster carer, but for the fostering service as
a whole. Any foster carer who has been through the investigative
process, as a third of all foster carers have, will say two things:
first, that it is a tremendously traumatic experience that leaves them
in constant fear of further allegations and undue public vilification;
and secondly, that the financial impact can be devastating.</div>
<a name="08070411000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members
will have seen the helpful briefing from the Fostering Network, which
sets out a number of case studies. One of those case studies is as
follows:</div>
<a name="08070411000325"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
child made an allegation against a male carer, which was later proved
unfounded. The couple had been out of work and the fostering income was
relied on for all their outgoings. They were struggling and
subsequently, as the &#145;investigation&#146; took so long (over 2
months at this point) without an income, the couple were given notice
by their building society. They have since been forced to sell their
house to a company which then rents them back. They are in a very
precarious position which has lost them their
equity&#148;.</div><a name="08070411000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
cannot be right.</div>
<a name="08070411000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem
is compounded by the Government time scales for the resolution of
allegations, as set out in the &#147;Working Together&#148;
guidance of April 2006. Those time scales are being routinely missed.
The target is 80 per cent. resolution by one month and 90 per cent.
resolution by three months, but the actual figures show that 50 per
cent. of cases run for more than three months, one in 10 runs for more
than a year, and some run for several years.</div>
<a name="08070411000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">During an
investigation, almost all foster carers have their fostering income
cut, and 46 per cent. have all their fostering income stopped. Despite
the unfair and severe financial hardship that is laid at the door of
foster carers, the majority of allegations prove unfounded&#151;I
would be interested to know whether the Minister has specific figures
showing what that majority is. Certainly, in more than two thirds of
cases, children are not removed from the foster carers&#146; care on
completion of the investigation.</div>
<a name="08070411000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
repercussions of any investigation are widespread. We must bear it in
mind that foster carers are often involved in other child care
occupations, in parallel with their fostering commitments. An
investigation might therefore threaten their other sources of family
income.</div>
<a name="08070411000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">The British
Association for Adoption and Fostering makes a strong argument when it
says:</div>
<a name="08070411000326"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Due
to the nature of children and young people placed with them and the
often fraught relationships between foster carers and birth parents
unfounded allegations are a regular
occurrence.&#148;</div><a name="08070411000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know of a teenage girl who was moved from placement to placement after
making unfounded allegation upon unfounded allegation, purely because
her birth mother encouraged her to disrupt the placements. She was told
that if she did so enough times she would eventually be returned home,
as the least worst
option.</div><a name="08070411000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any
allegation has the potential to trigger one of three types of
investigation: a child protection inquiry under section 47 of the
Children Act 1989; the fostering 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column237" />Column number: 237</div>service&#146;s own investigation; and, of course,
a police investigation. A third of foster carers are subject to an
investigation at some time during their fostering career, and the
majority of allegations prove to be unfounded, which only heightens the
case for greater protection of their identity, to mirror the protection
given to teachers whose role in children&#146;s lives has, in many
ways, a professional symmetry with that of foster
carers.</div>
<a name="08070411000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000405"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> My hon. Friend makes a very good case for the
new clause. Does the Fostering Network not also say that 10 per cent.
of such allegations take longer than a year to investigate? That means
an extended period of uncertainty in which the foster carers may not be
looking after their charges, although we desperately need their
services because of the shortage of appropriate foster care, as has
already been mentioned.</div>
<a name="08070411000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000406"></a>Mr.
Timpson:</b> My hon. Friend is right. I think that I alluded
to the figure of one in 10 earlier. The point about investigations
lasting a year or more is that the foster carers in question are out of
the fostering pool during that period of suspension. That is a resource
that we can ill afford to lose. My plea to the Government is that they
think again and commit to bringing to an end once and for all the
unjust position in which foster carers are singled out for financial
penalty and potential public exposure and humiliation following
unfounded allegations.</div>
<a name="08070411000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
local authorities, such as Portsmouth, that have already recognised the
absolute necessity of financial entitlement for foster carers during
the period of investigation and have implemented such a system. On that
point, and on the issue of identity protection, my colleagues who
support the new clause urge the Government to do the same and support
the proposed changes in their
entirety.</div><a name="08070411000143"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070411000407"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Kidney</b> (Stafford) (Lab): Like other hon. Members, I
have tabled a new clause on this subject because I support the proposal
that foster carers should be paid while they are under investigation
following an allegation. I do not intend to give a view on the
rightness of allegations in any individual case, nor do I come at the
matter with any particular assumption about whether an allegation might
be valid or false. The memory is fresh in my mind of two sisters, who
are now adults, and who, as children, made a complaint about abuse.
They came to see me to tell me how inadequately their felt their
allegations were investigated. However, it is a fact, as the Fostering
Network briefing says, that</div>
<a name="08070411000327"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;around a third
of all foster carers will face an allegation during their fostering
career and the vast majority of these turn out to be
unfounded.&#148;</div><a name="08070411000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Fostering Network deserves much credit for its campaign on the issue.
It has marshalled its facts well; its arguments are cogent; and it has
been quite attuned to the parliamentary process in trying to influence
decision makers. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will recall that I
brought a delegation from the Fostering Network to see him, and the
present subject was among the matters that we discussed. My hon. Friend
gave a very sympathetic reception to the points that they made. On
Second Reading, the Fostering Network arranged a lobby of Parliament by
foster carers. The focus on that day was on children staying put with
foster carers after 18, but this issue was discussed as well.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column238" />Column number: 238</div><a name="08070411000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have found
in preparing for the debate that Unison is a major trade union in
social care and has strong views in support of the Fostering Network.
Its briefing to hon. Members reminds us of
the</div><a name="08070411000328"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;emotional
strain and the considerable length of
time&#148;</div><a name="08070411000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">that
foster carers might be worrying about an allegation made against them,
as well as the loss of income. It makes the point that people might be
able to manage the emotional strain and the worry, but they certainly
cannot manage without the money. Unison says that it is crucial to
ensure that good foster carers do not move out of fostering because
they are compelled to do so by the lack of money, even though at the
end of the investigation it might be found that indeed they are good
foster carers with no stain on their character from the allegation that
was made. Unison
states:</div><a name="08070411000329"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
believe that foster carers should continue, where paid, to receive
their fee payment (the money given as remuneration for their work,
skills and experience) and a portion of their allowance (the money paid
to cover the cost of looking after children) that relates to ongoing
fostering costs during an
investigation.&#148;</div><a name="08070411000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich made the point that often the
timetable for completing an investigation given in Government guidance
is missed. That is a scandal in itself. Acceptance of the proposal that
people continue to be paid during an investigation might be an extra
incentive for local authorities to ensure that their investigations
comply with the time limit. In that way, it might have a second benefit
in addition to the benefit of maintaining foster carers&#146; incomes
while they are under investigation. That is why I support new clause
14.</div><a name="08070411000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000408"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I, too, will start by thanking the Fostering
Network for bringing these important issues to our attention in a very
powerful way&#151;through the meetings with foster carers and
looked-after children.</div>
<a name="08070411000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unfounded
allegations will undoubtedly be made, because we are talking about
often very troubled children who will feel the need to hit back. Making
such allegations is one manifestation of that impulse. However, given
what we hear after the events in various children&#146;s
homes&#151;I have a constituent who was placed with a foster carer
many years ago and it was proven that he was abused while in that
care&#151;it is vital that allegations are investigated properly. It
is also important that there should be pressure to complete
investigations in a timely
fashion.</div><a name="08070411000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most
of all, payment of the fee to the foster parent while the investigation
is taking place is vital. We pride ourselves in this country on working
on the premise that people are innocent until proved guilty. The
current provision seems to go completely against that by stopping
payment immediately an allegation is made. I also concur with the hon.
Member for Crewe and Nantwich about the need for anonymity as far as is
possible.</div><a name="08070411000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000409"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> I shall cut to the chase. I am very sympathetic
to the principle of new clause 14. We have to do what we can to reduce
the financial impact of an allegation on foster carers, but a better
way of achieving that aim, rather than by amending primary legislation,
is through the national minimum standards, which we are in the process
of reviewing and which will be subject to full public consultation
later this year. We intend, therefore, to use the revised national
minimum standards to make it clear that fostering service providers who

<div class="Column"><a name="Column239" />Column number: 239</div>usually pay their foster carers a fee should continue to do so while an
allegation is investigated, at the same level as it would have been
paid at had the child or children not been removed from the placement.
Payments would continue until the allegation had been resolved. I hope
that that announcement is helpful to all hon. Members who spoke on the
new clause and put their names to it, and to the Fostering
Network.</div><a name="08070411000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 40 also deals with payments to foster carers who are subject to
an allegation, but it concerns the allowance that is paid to foster
carers, rather than the fee. This new clause would require local
authorities to continue paying the allowance to foster carers who were
the subject of a complaint until a decision on the complaint had been
reached. Unlike the fee, which is intended to reward the foster carer
for their skills, experience and commitment, the allowance is intended
to meet the cost of caring for the child. Therefore, it would not be
appropriate for us to insist that the allowance be paid if the foster
child or children had been removed while the allegation was
investigated. In certain cases, the local authority or other provider
might want to consider continuing to pay at least an element or perhaps
all of the allowance if there are special circumstances, but that is
best determined locally where all the facts are known. There is
certainly no legislative barrier to providers continuing to pay an
allowance if that is appropriate in the
circumstances.</div>
<a name="08070411000347"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div><a name="08070411000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 40 would also require local authorities to take steps to protect
the identity of foster carers who are the subject of a complaint.
Rather than lay out all of the provisions that we have in place, it may
be useful if I write to Committee members to outline the details of the
foster carers right to confidentially. We accept the principle that
foster carers&#146; identities should not be released in most cases
and, where appropriate, should be protected while an allegation is
being
investigated.</div><a name="08070411000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
&#147;Working Together to Safeguard Children&#148; guidance, states
that that all complaints should be treated seriously and in accordance
with consistent procedures. It also states that it is reasonable to
expect 80 per cent. of cases to be resolved within one month, 90 per
cent. within three months and all but the most exceptional cases within
12 months&#151;so, 10 per cent. is not an acceptable outcome, as hon.
Members have said. Evidence says that those time scales are not always
met. During an investigation, the national minimum standards for
fostering services, makes it clear that providers should be making
independent support available to their foster carers. Again, it appears
that that is not happening in all
cases.</div><a name="08070411000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am committed to taking further action to address those issues. I
recognise that lengthy investigations without adequate independent
support can add to the stress experienced by foster carers. So, in
addition to our commitment regarding fees, we will be revising the
national minimum standards for fostering services to reinforce our
expectations about the time scales for resolving investigations and to
highlight the need for foster carers who are subject to an allegation
to receive appropriate independent support. We will clarify what we
mean by that during the revision of those national minimum
standards.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column240" />Column number: 240</div><a name="08070411000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford that
there are times when allegations have substance, and we should not
forget that when trying to deal with the problems that the Fostering
Network and hon. Members have rightly highlighted. I hope that hon.
Members are reassured by what I have said and that the action that we
are taking will improve the situation of foster carers subject to an
allegation. I hope that the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich will
withdraw the motion on that
basis.</div><a name="08070411000157"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000413"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I do not wish to delay the Committee for too
long. New clause 16 is a probing amendment. I am in sympathy with new
clauses 21 and 22 in the name of the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and
North Poole and others. I want to focus on health records. We had a
discussion on that and the problems that occur on the Adoption and
Children Bill. I am involved with a charity called Cardiac Risk in the
Young, which will be holding an annual reception on the Terrace before
long. It deals with the tragedy of young people who drop down dead all
of a sudden due to a congenital heart defect about which they knew
nothing, often relating to problems inherited from parents or defects
that could have been detected or been scanned for and dealt with before
the fatality happened. As we discussed during the Adoption and Children
Bill, there are cases of children who develop a genetic disease later
in life, without any knowledge that they may have inherited it from a
birth parent with whom they no longer have contact and/or knowledge
of.</div>
<a name="08070411000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of new clauses 21 and 22, which were proposed by BAAF, is to ensure
that the lifelong needs of post-care adults are not overlooked during
debates on the reform of the care system. It is paramount, when
appropriate, that a child who has been through the care system should
be able to access the medical records of their birth parents, or that
those medical records should be available to the person responsible for
caring for that child, so that when the child becomes an adult he or
she can refer to them to see whether they mention anything that might
prejudice their health later in life.</div>
<a name="08070411000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">The idea of a
genetic key has been mentioned. For those children who end up in the
care system and then go for adoption, there should be a formalised
system for keeping their health records and the records of their birth
parents safely, so that they can be made available to the children and
the children&#146;s health advisers when appropriate. Although it is
common sense for that to happen, it does not happen often
enough.</div>
<a name="08070411000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">When children
are pushed from one placement to another, and have unsettled lives, the
capacity for medical records to go missing is exacerbated. We know that
a large number of children in the care system have not had the basic
vaccinations, so their health outcomes are already prejudiced. They do
not have access to some of the basic medical preventions that are
available to the rest of the population.</div>
<a name="08070411000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clauses are probing, to see whether such provisions are necessary and,
if it is not already good practice, whether the Government would
consider them as a basis for spreading good guidance, so that a
directive along those lines could be issued to local
authorities.</div>
<a name="08070411000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000414"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I shall speak to new clauses 21 and 22. I do not
disagree with anything said by the hon. Member for East Worthing and
Shoreham. The purpose of the clauses are linked. The first is on the
duty to keep records. Whatever should be in those records and how it
should be transferred would, I assume, be dealt with in regulation. The
details and possibly the medical records, too, could be the subject of
regulation. The second is on the duty to provide access to records, on
which I particularly want to speak.</div>
<a name="08070411000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
estimated that 350,000 adults in the United Kingdom have spent all or
part of their childhood in foster or residential care. The sharing of
memories and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column242" />Column number: 242</div>photographs&#151;all the things that we do with
our own families&#151;are not possible for most post-care adults.
They may in due course want to make contact with parents and siblings,
but that might not be possible. Each year, an estimated 4,000 requests
are made by post-care adults for access to files. They do so for many
reasons&#151;to rebuild part of their lives, to build self-esteem or
because they need to know about their past identity and
relationships.</div>
<a name="08070411000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">Requests by
post-care adults for access to childhood information held in records
retained by the local authority come under the Data Protection Act
1998. That Act, however, is not an effective way of meeting the
information needs of post-care adults. It imposes restrictions on birth
party information, and it does not take account of the plight of
post-care adults who want to obtain their family history and details of
their parents and siblings.</div>
<a name="08070411000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">For many
years, rightly so, legislation has been in place to assist adopted
people to access support. Today, I am looking for equality of
treatment. The same opportunities do not extend to post-care adults,
and it could be argued that until they do so those adults will continue
to receive a second-rate service, compared with adopted
people.</div><a name="08070411000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000415"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I wanted to intervene to say that I support the
new clause, which is why my name appears against it. I do not wish to
make a speech. Is not the crux of the matter that there is a
legislative framework for adopted children as adults to access their
records and learn more about their history, but there is no such
framework for adults who were children in care? Those adults have to
fall back on the Data Protection Act, which was not meant for that
purpose and actually gets in the
way.</div><a name="08070411000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000416"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention.
He knows that I am using the BAAF briefing, so he probably anticipated
where I was heading. There is an action on access group which is
calling for a legislative framework that would enable post-care adults
to access information so that they could have a coherent and personal
account of their origins and time in care. It also calls for the
availability of advice and support that post-care adults can request if
they wish, including intermediary services to help to locate and
contact family members, and for an audit of statutory and voluntary
sector records to be undertaken and published, to enable post-care
adults to know where records can be found. Clearly, a lot more needs to
be done for that group of
people.</div><a name="08070411000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to pay tribute to my noble Friend Baroness Barker who has
raised the issue on a number of occasions in the other place, most
recently during the passage of this Bill. Lord Adonis said that the
House of Lords
was</div><a name="08070411000330"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;indebted
to the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, for raising the critical issue of
how best to ensure proper access to information and related services,
not only by those who have been adopted but by those who have been in
care.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords, </i>14 June
2005; Vol. 672, c.
1189.]</div><a name="08070411000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore
the consideration today is: &#147;It is a critical issue, but can it
be addressed
please?&#148;</div><a name="08070411000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
constantly come across explanations of how there is already an
appropriate strategy framework in place to enable post-care adults to
access their case records, and that there are already arrangements for
the placement of children, and general regulations and data protection
legislation. However, I am told by those with practical 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column243" />Column number: 243</div>experience that the provisions are not working. They do not address the
particular circumstances of post-care adults, and are simply
inadequate. I will not go on at length about that inadequacy&#151;I
want the Minister to go further than what already exists to address the
point that the provisions are inadequate, and to tell us what can be
done to improve the situation. The important point is that we need the
legislative framework for adults who were looked-after children. It is
really important to progress
that.</div><a name="08070411000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000417"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> I will do my very best to satisfy as many people
as I can before the bell
tolls.</div><a name="08070411000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
new clause 16, we agree that where a child is adopted it is important
for their GP to have full and accurate medical information in order to
meet that child&#146;s health needs. It is equally important that
local authorities have full and accurate medical information about a
child where adoption is the plan, and that the child&#146;s adoptive
parents are also given that information. That provision already exists
in regulations, and I will not go through the regulations now because I
seek to keep the Committee happy. However, I shall write to everybody
and set out&#151;perhaps in full&#151;what those regulations are
and why I think that they are satisfactory. There is nothing to prevent
birth parents from approaching the local authority and asking it to
pass on new medical information to the child&#146;s adoptive parents
and GP. There should be a balance between the interests of the child,
and the privacy of birth parents and the confidentiality of medical
records. That is a difficult balance to strike. However, local
authorities are required to record detailed information about a
child&#146;s health and medical history, and must arrange for regular
assessments of the child&#146;s health and take health matters into
account in regular reviews of the child&#146;s
case.</div><a name="08070411000348"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30
pm</div><a name="08070411000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clauses 21 and 22 relate to looked-after children. Looked-after
children are not covered by the support and assistance under the
Adoption and Children Act 2002. The hon. Lady mentioned intermediary
services which was my own addition to that Act. I accept that formerly
looked-after children do not have access to the same services, but
there are important distinctions between the two groups. Looked-after
children did not change their name or identity. The overwhelming
majority returned to their families during the course of their
childhoods. That is a vital distinction.</div>
<a name="08070411000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most children
do not typically spend a significant period of time being looked after
before a permanent arrangement for their care is made either with a
parent, another family member or an adoptive parent. These two new
clauses are not necessary because the appropriate statutory framework
exists. I shall not set out again what that is. The hon. Lady is
familiar with it and I will again write to members of the Committee
with the full details of the regulations that I am talking
about.</div>
<a name="08070411000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">There will be
individual adults who are trying to piece together information about
their time in the care system from a long time ago. Although the Data
Protection Act provides for access to personal information, if records
are incomplete then, sadly, no new legislative provision would be able
to conjure up non-existent 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column244" />Column number: 244</div>records. Record-keeping is now much more consistent.
The guidance is clearer than it has been in previous decades. The
Children Act 1989 sets a better framework than previously existed. The
integrated children&#146;s system and the detailed resources being
produced to support it aim to improve record keeping still
further.</div>
<a name="08070411000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">While I do
not agree with the hon. Lady that we need primary legislation, we
recognise that practice varies. Existing guidance already highlights
the need for local authorities to handle these issues sensitively and
provide appropriate support. In the planned revision of the statutory
guidance to the Children Act there is an opportunity to update the
existing guidance to local authorities and to ensure that the current
best practice is promoted more widely. I will seek to do
that.</div><a name="08070411000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000418"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> The briefing from BAAF, to which the hon. Member
for Mid-Dorset and North Poole referred, anticipates that the Minister
will say that the guidance is adequate, so there is no need for primary
legislation. Does he not understand that BAAF, Barnardo&#146;s, the
Care Leavers Association, the Catholic Children&#146;s Society, the
Children&#146;s Society, the National Children&#146;s Bureau, the
National Leaving Care Advisory Service, the NCH, the Post Care Forum,
Voice and the Who Cares? Trust all say that the present legislative
framework is out of date and inadequate? It has been overtaken by the
Data Protection Act 1998 and that gets in the way of people having
access to records that are relevant to their own
identity.</div><a name="08070411000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000419"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> I realise that I am outnumbered. I take the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point very seriously and I will look carefully at
what they have to say. But I also give an undertaking that during the
planned revision of the Children Act statutory guidance we will look at
updating the existing guidance for local authorities and we will try to
ensure that current best practice is promoted. On that basis, I hope
that hon. Members will not press these new
clauses.</div><a name="08070411000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000420"></a>Tim

the participation of looked-after children. I do not want to undermine
the great strides forward that have been made generally in terms of
taking on board children and young people&#146;s views and listening
to them. But it is vital that we make sure that children&#146;s views
are fully taken on board in service improvement. The new clause calls
for each local authority to establish a children in care council or

must acknowledge that it is not prescriptive to say that every local
authority shall have a children in care council. There are obviously
other ways of accessing children&#146;s views. It may not be
appropriate for a very small authority to have a children in care
council. However, there should be a collective mechanism to bring
children and young people together to engage in debate on a fairly
regular basis, not just once a year. That would enable them to have a

talk about his work in the local authority where he is effectively head
teacher for 500 looked-after children. In any school situation, it
would be good to have a school council among a group of 500 children.
With all of the good work going on with the virtual head teacher, it
would be superb to have a children in care council. I can see that it
would really work with those sorts of
numbers.</div><a name="08070411000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">Following
that meeting, I am even more inspired about this idea. I am very keen
on school councils and like to promote them when I go round schools.
Now that we have virtual head teachers, I do not see why a virtual head
teacher should not be empowered, or have a duty, to set up a
council.</div><a name="08070411000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord
Adonis claimed in the House of Lords that it was unnecessary to
legislate for children in care councils because we have existing
regulations for children in care to be consulted about service
provision. My briefing points out that what is in existence is only an
annual one-off event for the children and young people&#146;s panel.
A children in care council would be ongoing with continuous
participation and existing ideas could be built upon. Consultations are
narrowed by specific questions, where as a children in care council
would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column246" />Column number: 246</div>be pretty open-ended. The views of children in care would be
heard directly by the people who are vital to the provision of
services: the director and the lead
member.</div><a name="08070411000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most
of all, this proposal focuses on the specific views and experiences of
children in care. Throughout the Bill we have made the point that we
must keep focusing on the particular needs of children in care. I
emphasise that I am not suggesting that the new clause should result in
a children in care council for every local authority. I can see that
there would be variations. However, I think that it would be excellent
to have a commitment in the Bill to listening to the views of
looked-after
children.</div><a name="08070411000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause is compatible with article 12 of the convention on the
rights of the child. It would bring out debates on local needs and it
could spread accountability to children in care. How often do we hear
young people say, &#147;Well I said such and such, but it did not
make any difference.&#148;? Regular interactive meetings with young
people would enable them to follow something through. They would be
able to find out why good ideas that they had raised had not been
implemented. They would be able to find out the reasons and chase
people up to get on with the job. I commend the new clause to the
Committee for serious
consideration.</div><a name="08070411000197"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Kevin
Brennan:</b> I, too, met the virtual head teachers when they came into
the Department and virtually all of them turned up on that occasion. It
was interesting to hear about the progress on the pilots, which are an
important initiative. I can assure the hon. Lady that I agree with
everything she said, except for the need for the new clause. We are
deeply committed to ensuring that looked-after children and care
leavers who are entitled to leaving care services are properly
consulted on the services they receive and involved in helping to shape
and improve them. That is why we made the commitment, as she knows, in
the &#147;Care Matters&#148; White Paper to introduce children in
care councils in every local authority.</div>
<a name="08070411000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
embedding that commitment by spelling out in statutory guidance our
expectation that every local authority should have a children in care
council or an equivalent structure to ensure that looked-after children
and young people are able to put their experiences of the care system
directly to those responsible for service delivery, and I recently met
some young people in south Gloucestershire who are doing exactly that.
We will ask Ofsted to report on those participation arrangements as
part of the planned inspection programme focusing on children in care,
and that will begin in 2009. The new clause is unnecessary because the
reforms that it seeks to legislate for are already
underway.</div>

in guidance or that it will happen, so I am rather heartened to hear
that there will be a specific inspection on that matter, because it is
important that there is a clear way forward to ensure investigations on
whether local authorities are following through. During the course of
the Committee&#146;s proceedings, we appear to be imposing rather a
lot of guidance and regulations on them. I beg to ask leave to withdraw

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000423"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="08070411000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
new clause is very much intended to be probing, although the principle
was discussed in the other place. I wish to ascertain the
Government&#146;s position on a statutory system of guardianship for
all separated children who are subject to immigration control in
England and Wales. I want to ensure that the welfare needs of those
children are properly safeguarded within the context of the asylum
determination process and that their support and care needs are met by
all agencies charged with those functions.</div>
<a name="08070411000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Each year,
3,000 children who are separated from both parents and are not being
cared for by an adult who by law or custom has responsibility to do so
come to the UK and claim asylum. I have a feeling that I might have put
the same arguments forward during the passage of the Children Act 2004,
as they seem remarkably familiar and there is a sense of
d(c)j  vu. We also proposed at that time that the Border
and Immigration Agency should come under section 11, so I think that it
is worth carrying on putting the points
forward.</div><a name="08070411000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill presents an opportunity to strengthen the protection for children
in the care of the state and cover asylum-seeking children and
trafficked children, which is a matter of great concern. The new clause
does not seek to establish any detailed mechanics on how a system of
guardianship would operate, but it is important to recognise that there
is no systematic provision of independent oversight on matters
involving separated children who are subject to immigration control.
Children can go unrepresented in their asylum application and might be
placed in inappropriate accommodation with inadequate support. Indeed,
they might not understand the implications of their asylum application.
In the current system, separated children seeking asylum, some as young
as eight years old, have to instruct their own solicitors, yet these
children might not be competent to instruct a legal representative.
Although there is provision through CAFCASS, which I appreciate, we
still need
guardianship.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column248" />Column number: 248</div><a name="08070411000349"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45
pm</div><a name="08070411000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed,
my noble friend Baroness Walmsley raised the issue, but I think that
the Minister misunderstood what she was saying. Obviously we accept
that CAFCASS can be helpful for a small number of non-citizen children
going through the family court system, however, there is a gap in
provision. A very low number of children is granted asylum. The
majority are granted discretionary leave, which means that they need
greater protection during the time that they are here, certainly to
comply with the European convention on human rights.</div>
<a name="08070411000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
still have the reservation to article 22 of the UN convention on the
rights of the child. I was heartened earlier this year when the
Minister addressing that issue said that it was being looked at. I am
not sure whether we have any information on that matter. I want
particularly emphasise trafficked children. Lord Adonis commented in
the other place that the Government are considering the changes needed
to comply with article 10 of the Council of Europe convention on action
against trafficking in human beings, which states that every
unaccompanied child identified as a victim will be provided with
representation</div><a name="08070411000331"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;by
a legal guardian, organisation or authority which shall act in the best
interests of that
child&#148;.</div><a name="08070411000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like some more details about that because it is so important.
There is cross-party concern for trafficked children.</div>
<a name="08070411000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also
important to note that the 10th report of the Joint Committee on Human
Rights, published March 2007, expressed concern that asylum-seeking
children were not getting as much protection as other children. The
report
recommends</div><a name="08070411000332"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that
a formal system of guardianship should be established for separated
children subject to immigration control, including separated asylum
seeking children. The guardian would have a statutory role and would be
appointed by a statutory body to safeguard the best interests of the
child and provide a link between all those providing services and
support. The guardian should be expected to intervene if public bodies
act in contravention of their legal duties towards a
child&#148;</div><a name="08070411000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a great opportunity to protect further the rights of separated
children subject to immigration control. I hope that the Minister will
consider favourably something that has been asked for on many
occasions. I know the concerns about control of asylum and immigration,
but we are talking about children. I believe that child in this country
have the same rights to protection as citizens
do.</div>
<a name="08070411000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000424"></a>Beverley
Hughes:</b> I agree with the hon. Lady that the issue concerns
everybody, particularly when we are talking about children who are not
only separated from their families but may have been trafficked. I
shall say at the outset that the matter was considered in detail in
2004 when we implemented the European Union reception conditions
directive, which called for minimum standards on the reception of
asylum seekers, including children. Article 19 requires
states</div><a name="08070411000333"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
ensure the necessary representation of
unaccompanied&#148;</div><a name="08070411000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">asylum-seeking
child by legal guardians or</div>
<a name="08070411000334"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;representation
by an organisation which is responsible for their care and
well-being&#148;</div><a name="08070411000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
took the view then, and it is still our view, that the care and support
that children receive from local authorities, under the same statutory
arrangements as other children 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column249" />Column number: 249</div>in need, mean that the UK is fully compliant with that directive.
Therefore, we do not believe that a system of statutory guardianship is
necessary, or indeed desirable, to achieve that goal. However, I agree
with the hon. Lady that services for unaccompanied asylum-seeking
children, particularly those who have been trafficked, need to be
improved. The provisions of the Bill, alongside some other measures
that I will touch on briefly, will deliver some of the necessary
improvements that she
seeks.</div><a name="08070411000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
it is important to make the point, in relation to the hon.
Lady&#146;s concluding remarks, that we are discussing children. All
children should have the same rights under the law. I agree with her.
Children&#146;s legislation makes no distinction between
children who are separated, unaccompanied asylum-seeking children or
other children. The duties under the Children Act 2004 depend simply on
the levels of assessed need. They are not affected at all by
immigration status or other factors of that nature. As she will know,
last year the courts made it absolutely clear in a robust judgment that
it is not acceptable for local authorities to make any distinction in
service provision on any basis other than assessed need. That was in
relation to a case involving unaccompanied asylum-seeking
children.</div><a name="08070411000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
the reforms in the Bill and the wider &#147;Care Matters&#148;
programme will challenge local authorities to improve their practice.
That will benefit unaccompanied asylum-seeking and trafficked children
who have grown up in this country. I recognise that the experiences of
these children will be distinct in some important respects and that
they will require more specialised services and care than the
generality of looked-after
children.</div><a name="08070411000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
that reason, the UK Border Agency has proposed that children should be
placed not right across the country, but with a limited number of
specialist local authorities so that we can be sure that they receive
that specialist level of care and expertise. The training of IROs and
social workers in those authorities can be given in relation to the
dimensions that the separated and immigration statuses give such
children. We will therefore develop some specialist areas of expertise.
That fits in with the reforms of the UK Border Agency set out in
&#147;Better outcomes: the way forward&#148;, which was about
improving the care of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children and was
published in January this year. It also fits in with the code of
practice, &#147;Keeping children safe from harm&#148;. I think that
that is the way to ensure that the special needs of such children are
dealt with in
practice.</div><a name="08070411000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
will also update the statutory guidance to recognise and deal with the
particular needs of this group. In revising the Children Act guidance
for local authorities, we will reflect the significant increase in the
number of these children in the care system since the guidance was
originally written in the early 1990s. There will be a real focus on
this group in that
guidance.</div><a name="08070411000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the other hand, I hope that the hon. Lady accepts that it is not clear
what benefits there would be from an extra system of guardianship. This
matter reflects the debate on advocates for every child. The reality
for most of these children is that they already encounter a long list
of individuals, many of them charged in one way or another with
representing them, such as their solicitor. They are all referred to
the Refugee Council children&#146;s panel, which provides advice and
assistance. They have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column250" />Column number: 250</div>their local authority social worker and the enhanced
role of the IRO will apply to them, which we have discussed in this
Committee. As I have said, if they are located in specialist
authorities where the IRO is given special training in the
circumstances and needs of such young people, they will get a better
service.</div><a name="08070411000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have had this argument before. I do not think that the legislation
needs to be adjusted. I accept that we need to adjust practice and we
must spotlight the needs of these children and train people to be
better in meeting their needs and recognising the issues that come with
their immigration status. However, that is a matter for practice and
not for legislation in the Bill. I hope that the hon. Lady accepts that
the measures I have outlined will meet her aspirations sufficiently and
will therefore withdraw the
motion.</div><a name="08070411000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000425"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I thank the Minister for her comprehensive reply.
I am still unconvinced, but sometimes one has to beg to differ. I will
not press the matter to a vote, but this is an issue that I will
continue to raise because I think that we need to go a lot further. I
seem to recollect that when the Green Paper was first published, as the
Minister will acknowledge, it made little mention of asylum seekers,
which always gives the impression that we do not give enough attention
to them. We have come quite a way since then but we have not yet
reached the best position. I will continue to push for this outside
Committee, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
motion.</div><a name="08070411000221"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Motion

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000426"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="08070411000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
amendment has also been supported by a number of organisations. I
should like to make that clear from the outset. I suspect that I will
be given assurances that it is all dealt with already, but the NSPCC,
BAAF, Who 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column251" />Column number: 251</div>Cares?, ChildLine and the NCB support this, so I am not alone in
thinking that rather more could be done. Ever since the Sexual Offences
Bill, I have had a particular interest in seeing that when a child has
been sexually abused an assessment is made and therapeutic treatment is
available. I have raised this on many occasions. A child who has been
abused sometimes goes on to become a perpetrator. We have more and more
unhappiness and misery by not addressing the situation at the time when
it needs addressing. The availability of therapeutic treatment across
this country is very patchy. We could prevent many tragedies if we
could ensure that that treatment was available.</div>
<a name="08070411000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
concerns assessment, treatment and support. My particular interest in
therapeutic counselling and treatment for sexually abused children
will, sadly, form part of that. About 60 per cent. of children are
brought into care is because they have been abused in some way, be that
physical violence, sexual abuse or other forms. That tells us quite a
lot. Children who come into care have at least a 60 per cent. chance of
needing some form of treatment. They often need mental health
treatment.</div>
<a name="08070411000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">Despite the
fact that the Government have invested greatly, and I will not
underestimate the extra investment, there is still a long way to go
until we provide enough services. There can be a long time lag between
assessment and treatment. That is critical for this group of vulnerable
young people. They have already had a bad start in life. We need to be
able to act to do the best that we can to remedy and make good as soon
as
possible</div><a name="08070411000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
therefore call in the new clause for an explicit duty to be placed on
PCTs to co-operate with local authorities in the provision of health
assessments and care to looked-after children, for assessment to be
undertaken by suitably qualified and experienced practitioners and for
regulations to set out in detail how joint arrangements for the
individual child will be made, recorded and reviewed. I should add that
45 per cent. of looked-after children and young people aged five to 17
are assessed as having an emotional or mental health disorder, compared
with 10 per cent. of the general child and young person population.
Those are Government figures. Looked-after children and young people
exhibit high rates of self-harm and high risk behaviour. Two thirds of
looked-after children are reported to have had at least one physical
health complaint. Some of those complaints are speech and language
problems, and in other arenas we talk a great deal about how much such
problems inhibit a child&#146;s
development.</div><a name="08070411000350"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div><a name="08070411000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem is that provision is patchy, as is working together, despite
provisions that state that there should be a multidisciplinary approach
and that primary care trusts should work closely with local
authorities. I shall give an example from my own constituency, where
local authority boundaries are not coterminous with primary care trust
boundaries. That problem has been overcome with help from the
Government for the council concerned. Nevertheless, I have a letter
from a health service worker
saying:</div><a name="08070411000335"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is not my responsibility in West Dorset to provide services for East

east Dorset children have been sent to a specialist school in west
Dorset. That problem has now been dealt with, but it has taken a long
time and an MP&#146;s intervention. I do not buy the assurances that
&#147;it is all happening&#148;. We have a long way to go, and that
is why the duty is
important.</div><a name="08070411000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have the feeling that everybody is trying to hurry me up. I am doing my
best, but these are meaty new clauses. I am sure that <i class="I">Hansard</i>
will show that I have not had more than my fair share of time. The new
clauses that I am leading on are really important to me and to all our
looked-after children, and I do not want to rush through them at the
cost of not making a point. I am looking for a number of assurances on
how the arrangements will work. Given the intensity of the problems
regarding the health of looked-after children, a duty in the Bill is
called
for.</div><a name="08070411000232"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000427"></a>Beverley
Hughes:</b> I will not list for the hon. Lady the various
current regulations, because I want to focus on the steps we are
taking, which I think will achieve what she wants to achieve in a
different but equally effective way. She will be aware of the duty to
co-operate in sections 10 and 11 of the Children Act 2004, which
applies to a range of health bodies and other agencies. The guidance
that flowed from that and the power to issue statutory guidance were
not implemented in relation to primary care trusts and health bodies.
Guidance was issued to health bodies but it was not
statutory&#151;that power was not switched
on.</div><a name="08070411000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
give the hon. Lady an assurance that we intend to issue new statutory
guidance in relation to the powers in sections 10 and 11. The revised
guidance will be statutory for primary care trusts, strategic health
authorities, NHS foundation trusts and local authorities. It will cover
assessments of the physical, emotional and mental health of
looked-after children, health plans, the involvement of qualified
medical practitioners in assessments and reviews, the time scales for
completion of assessments and reviews, health promotion, the provision
of child and adolescent mental health services for looked-after
children&#151;which the hon. Lady rightly says is
important&#151;and the roles and responsibilities of health bodies
and local authorities in improving the health of looked-after children.
For the first time, the guidance will have the statutory bite that has
applied to other agencies under sections 10 and 11 of the 2004
Act.</div><a name="08070411000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, we are using some of the architecture of the national health
service to build in a focus on looked-after children. The statutory
guidance will be complemented by the new joint strategic needs
assessment, the new NHS operating framework for 2008-09, and the
national indicator set for local government. For the first time, the
NHS operating framework includes keeping children well, improving
overall health and reducing health inequalities as one of the top five
priorities for the NHS. That marks the beginning of a new chapter in
the journey of the NHS to a focus on more preventive services for
children and young people.</div>
<a name="08070411000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
explain how we will monitor that. In addition to our existing data
collection, there is a new indicator on the emotional health of
looked-after children. That will be particularly important in driving
up the supply of CAMH services. Under the children&#146;s plan, we
asked Jo Davidson, the director of children&#146;s services for
Gloucester, to undertake a review of CAMH services. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column253" />Column number: 253</div>The call for evidence closes tomorrow, I think, and
Jo Davidson will report in the autumn on what more needs to be done in
that
regard.</div><a name="08070411000236"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000428"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> Can the Minister give a time scale for publication
and implementation of the revised guidance? I am talking about the
statutory position. When will that happen?</div>
<a name="08070411000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000429"></a>Beverley
Hughes:</b> It is part of our process of either revising
existing guidance or, in this case, introducing revised guidance with a
new status. I do not have information on the specific time with me, but
I might be able to get that if I keep talking long enough-albeit
without wishing to delay the Committee. Otherwise, I can write to the
hon. Lady. I am not clear on where it is in our list of work to be done
on guidance, but I can tell her that it will be published before the
end of this year&#151;in 2008. With that, I hope that the hon. Lady
feels that the points she made have been covered and she will withdraw
the
motion.</div><a name="08070411000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000430"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> Again, the test will be in the monitoring to see
what difference statutory guidance makes and whether we will need to
return to the matter at a later date. I would just like to leave the
Minister with a thought about the availability of therapeutic treatment
across the country. There has been a long-term campaign on that by the
NSPCC&#151;I am an ambassador for the NSPCC, so I ought to declare
that interest. I know that not having therapeutic treatment escalates
problems and leads to further incidents in society. I thank the
Minister for the fact that we have the statutory guidance. I hope that
that will result in change, but I feel that we have a long way to go
and we may well have to revisit this issue. I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
motion.</div><a name="08070411000239"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Motion

period</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;In seeking to bring a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000431"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="08070411000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">Limitation
periods provide cut-offs on people&#146;s ability to bring cases to
court. There are limitation periods in criminal courts and civil
courts. There are different limitation periods for different behaviours
and there are different rules about disapplying limitation periods and
extending them. The Law Commission was asked to examine the state of
the law in 2001 and concluded that the law was needlessly complex,
outdated and, in some respects, unfair. It gave as an example of
complexity and unfairness sexual abuse cases. Unfortunately, many
sexual abuse cases that have come to the public&#146;s attention over
the years have related to children who were abused 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column254" />Column number: 254</div>in public care. They are particularly powerful cases, because the public
feel that very vulnerable children, whose protection the public were
charged with, have been let down a second time. We are seeing that all
over again at the moment in the cases being investigated in
Jersey.</div><a name="08070411000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Law Commission said that the law should be reformed, and in 2002 the
Government said that that was a good idea and they would do that, but
still there has been no reform. Several hon. Members, myself included,
have been asking parliamentary questions about the Government&#146;s
intentions. Last year&#151;2007&#151;the Government told me in
written answers that they would start to reform the law at the
beginning of 2008. When I asked a written question at the beginning of
2008, they said that they had not got round to it yet and they might do
so later in the year. Now we are in the second half of the year and
still there is
nothing.</div><a name="08070411000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
might be fun for me to criticise the Government for being slower than
they said they would be, but it is now several years since they said
that they would amend a law that has been shown by the Law Commission
to be complex and unfair. Still there are cases of people who have been
deprived, by a limitation period, of the ability to bring a claim for
compensation for sexual abuse sustained when they were in public care.
Potentially, other people will suffer in future years until we amend
the law. I am therefore trying to provoke a debate through new clause
28, at least in respect of children in care&#151;I recognise that
limitation periods apply much more widely than simply to this group of
people and this type of case&#151;to see whether the Minister can
tell me whether the Government will finally make some
progress.</div><a name="08070411000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000432"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> There are three reasons why I am resisting my
hon. Friend&#146;s new clause. I hope that I can also say something
at the end on his final point.</div>
<a name="08070411000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, the
current law contained in the Limitation Act 1980, as interpreted by the
recent House of Lords ruling in A <i class="I">v. </i>Hoare, already achieves
much of what the new clause is designed to achieve. Indeed, the current
law is in many ways more generous to claimants. I will write to all
members of the Committee to outline my reasons for saying
that&#151;</div><a name="08070411000351"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.10
pm</div><a name="08070411000247"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Sitting

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000433"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> I was on the first of the 47 points&#151;I
correct myself, three points&#151;that I was going to make in
response to the new clause tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for
Stafford.</div><a name="08070411000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
first point was that the current law is more generous to claimants than
the new clause would be in practice. I said that I would write to my
hon. Friend and Committee members to outline why that would be the
case.</div><a name="08070411000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
there is no need to create a special limitation category for
looked-after children. My hon. Friend acknowledged that in his remarks,
and I shall be happy to elucidate in my letter.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column255" />Column number: 255</div><a name="08070411000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, any
reform of the law of limitation in this area should be undertaken as
part of a wider exercise addressing the whole topic. I sensed from my
hon. Friend&#146;s comments that in tabling the new clause, he was
trying to stimulate action by the Government on the reform of the law
of limitation. I can confirm that it has taken longer than expected for
the Government to issue the consultation in this area. However, it will
be issued as soon as possible&#151;hopefully, in the near future. If
it is deemed to be appropriate, based on the consultation, the
Government will consider legislating in this area. On that basis, I ask
him to consider withdrawing the
motion.</div><a name="08070411000253"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000434"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> There are some inadequacies in the drafting of the
new clause so I will not press it to a vote. As the Minister says, the
issue is not simply limitation periods as they apply to former children
in care; a wide range of cases are affected. Some hon. Members will
recall that there is a lot of interest in this matter in relation to
health and safety at work cases for people who develop conditions such
as mesothelioma many years after they have finished work. There are
questions about when the limitation period stops them from making
claims against employers arising from events that happened many years
back.</div><a name="08070411000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a need to review the law in this entire area, as the Government said
it would in 2002. If we have helped to speed things along a little by
making this proposal and by the Minister making inquiries of the
Ministry of Justice about where it is with its proposals, we will have
done some good. I would like to stress to the Committee that in my
capacity as chairman of the associate parliamentary group on
looked-after children and care leavers, I still come across dreadful
cases of people who have suffered atrociously, first by going into
care, secondly by being sexually abused when in care, and thirdly by
their experience of the legal system, because they could not make a
claim for compensation when they finally realised that a claim was
possible.</div><a name="08070411000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is an urgent and pressing matter and I hope that the Minister will
write not only to me and members of the Committee, but to the Ministry
of Justice to hurry it along. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
motion.</div><a name="08070411000256"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Motion

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000435"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000436"></a>The

Every local authority shall make a report on access to advocacy
services in their local area annually to the Secretary of

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000437"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I shall be brief, because we debated advocacy
fully in a previous sitting and we all agreed that advocacy in the
right place is a good thing and part of a good-quality service for all
children in care. Perhaps some of us on the Committee were more
enthusiastic about the range and rate at which advocacy should be
available to children in care, and perhaps the Ministers were not quite
so keen; nevertheless, we all agreed.</div>
<a name="08070411000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
need to improve access to advocacy, so the new clause would require
local authorities to make assessments to show that they have an
adequate supply of advocates in their area and to keep that assessment
under review and up to date. My hon. Friend the Member for Warrington,
South has linked that with new clause 32, which is about local
authorities providing a report on access to those
services.</div><a name="08070411000262"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070411000438"></a><b class="B">Helen
Southworth</b> (Warrington, South) (Lab): I hope that my hon.
Friend accepts that new clause 32 is far more modest than new clause
31, and in fact encapsulates the drivers that would require new clause
31. Although it is brief and modest, it represents the least the
Government can do to ensure that advocacy services are
available.</div>
<a name="08070411000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000439"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I will not allow my hon. Friend to undersell new
clause 32, as it makes an excellent companion to new clause 31.
Together, they would ensure that local authorities had at the forefront
of their mind the need for adequate provision of advocacy services for
all the children for whom they are
responsible.</div>
<a name="08070411000264"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000440"></a>Beverley
Hughes:</b> I am grateful that my hon. Friend the Member for
Stafford acknowledged the important debate that we had on Tuesday,
during which I set out our view on advocacy in the context of clause 11
and made it clear that listening to children is crucial to improving
outcomes for them, both individually and in relation to the system as a
whole, and to improving system-wide standards. New clauses 31 and 32
pick up 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column257" />Column number: 257</div>on the related issue of how local authorities contract and make
arrangements for advocacy provision, and how they should be making
effective provision for those services.</div>
<a name="08070411000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can tell
both my hon. Friends that we already require local authorities to
monitor their services by keeping a record of each representation
received, its outcome and whether there was compliance with the time
limits set out in regulations. They are also required to compile a
report at the end of each financial year on the operation of their
complaints and representations procedure. However, I intend to go
further and through statutory guidance require local authorities as
part of that report to review their advocacy services annually, to
ensure compliance with national standards. We will set out that that
will necessarily involve local authority staff seeking regular feedback
from children about their experiences of the service.</div>
<a name="08070411000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">In revising
that guidance and including that provision, we will of course consult
widely. We have no doubt that the expertise of third sector advocacy
services and the charities represented on the National
Children&#146;s Advocacy Consortium will make an invaluable
contribution to ensuring that we get that guidance right and that it
takes into account good practice on how all children should be listened
to, including those who are hard to reach, such as those who require
additional communication assistance or help from translation services
so that local authorities can ensure that their views are heard. I do
not want to require local authorities to publish a separate assessment
of advocacy, but I think that extending the statutory guidance in the
way that I have outlined will cover the issues that my hon. Friends are
concerned
about.</div>
<a name="08070411000353"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4
pm</div><a name="08070411000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will include another provision: the general quality of advocacy
services that we get from those reports and from elsewhere will be
included as an item in the annual ministerial stock-take of services to
looked-after children that we committed in the White Paper to having
every year. Moreover, when Ofsted inspects local authority services for
looked-after children, as it will do regularly in a thematic review, it
will take into account how local authorities, as corporate parents, are
listening to children&#146;s voices and providing for the advocacy
service to enable complaints or representations to be made.</div>
<a name="08070411000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
that with those three additional levers in the system, my hon. Friend
will accept that we are strengthening the way in which local
authorities will have to monitor the quality of their advocacy
services, show compliance and take steps to improve them if that is
necessary. I hope that those assurances are sufficient to persuade my
hon. Friend not to press the new
clause.</div><a name="08070411000269"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000442"></a>Helen
Southworth:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a
Second
time.</div><a name="08070411000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am conscious that I bring with me the admirable support of not only my
hon. Friends the Members for Stafford and for Stourbridge, but the 198
Members who signed early-day motion 1413, &#147;Support for young
people in care in transition to adult life&#148;, which I tabled. It
notes that many young people in care are moved into independent living
at 16 or 17, when the average age at which young people in the United
Kingdom leave home is 24. In practice that means that many vulnerable
young people do not receive sufficient support to enable them to make
the transition into adult life successfully. It calls on the Government
to take steps to ensure that all these vulnerable young people have
access to effective support including, where appropriate, the
opportunity to remain with their foster carers until they are
21.</div><a name="08070411000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reason why so many hon. Members believe it is essential that the
opportunity of this Bill is seized to ensure that there is effective
support for young people who are making steps into independent living
from care is that the Bill is intended to enable those who enter the
care system to achieve the aspirations parents have for their own
children, and to reduce the gap in outcomes between children in care
and their
peers.</div><a name="08070411000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill sets out many excellent measures to revolutionise care for
children who are looked after by local authorities, but there remains a
huge gap between the aspirations within the Bill and the practice for
young people who, from the age of 16, are moving into independent
living. There is a particular issue for young people who at the age of
16 or 17 move from foster care or from a local authority or private
children&#146;s home into other accommodation. The current practice
in operation in many, if not most, parts of the country is that when
young people leave the care of the local authority and leave the
protection of the &#147;parent&#148;, they are left alone to
resolve their problems themselves because they have moved
accommodation.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column259" />Column number: 259</div><a name="08070411000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the
Ministers have made it clear in the Bill that they have admirable
aspirations to ensure that local authorities provide accommodation for
young people in their care, the practical fact remains that many young
people of 16 or 17 are at best encouraged, and in some cases left with
no alternative other than, to leave care and move into the supported
services available through local authority housing services, rather
than through children&#146;s
services.</div><a name="08070411000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
draw the Committee&#146;s attention to the children&#146;s rights

People&#146;s Views on Leaving Care&#148;, in which Dr. Roger
Morgan made it clear that the consultation that he undertook
demonstrated that this is an issue of serious concern to young people.
In his top 10 list of things that most worry young people about leaving
care, drawn up by consulting young people, among the problems such as
loneliness and not being able to cope that hon. Members have already
mentioned is the serious problem

so&#148;.</div><a name="08070411000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
went
on:</div><a name="08070411000340"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;One
young woman told us she had received no notice of having to leave care,
had no plans drawn up prior to leaving and did not have any form of
written
plan.&#148;</div><a name="08070411000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is a sad fact that that young woman is not the only one. Hon. Members
in the Committee and outside have received considerable evidence from
young people leaving care that they have not had proper support and
that they have been put into dodgy places. In some cases, they have
been put in hostels where the majority of other residents are people
who are leaving prison or have convictions for drug offences or
prostitution. These vulnerable young people are being left to cope
alone in that sort of
accommodation.</div><a name="08070411000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept that provisions are made in clause 9 for other placements, but
there is no way of measuring by inspection the suitability of those
other places. It should not be beyond the wit of this House to produce
a reasonable checklist that says what is suitable accommodation and
what is dodgy. If 16-year-olds can work it out for themselves, we ought
to be able to work it out on their behalf. We have a duty to do
so.</div><a name="08070411000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
aspirations stated in the new clause refer not only to relevant
children, but to young people who have previously been relevant up to
the age of 21. That is an important thing to write into the Bill. Much
legislation over the past few years has demonstrated the right of a
looked-after child to be protected up to the age of 18 if it is needed.
We have seen that 41 or 42 per cent. of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column260" />Column number: 260</div>young people have left looked-after status to go into independent living
before the age of 18. In many cases, they have gone into wholly
unacceptable accommodation. It is unsurprising that they do not have
the opportunities that any parent would want for their child in such
circumstances.</div><a name="08070411000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
hon. Members want to see the aspiration of the opportunity for a young
person to make a proper transition into independent living written into
the Bill. We would then not have to look at opportunities that might
emerge from future pilots. We already know that, for many young people,
the opportunities to carry on in further education, higher education,
training or work all depend on having a safe place to live and somebody
they can turn to and talk things through with.</div>
<a name="08070411000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally and
briefly, I would ask that we please focus on this problem, because it
is something that many Members of this House expect us to address,
either in this Committee or elsewhere.</div>
<a name="08070411000287"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000443"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for her work and my other
hon. Friends who have campaigned very assiduously on this issue.
Unfortunately, her new clause is technically defective, because unless
an appropriate consequential amendment is made to make an exclusion
from the definition of a child who is looked after in section 22 of the
1989 Act, it would have the effect of making all relevant children
looked after. Notwithstanding that, I think that she wants me to talk a
little about these issues.</div>
<a name="08070411000288"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000444"></a>Helen
Southworth:</b> On that point about technical drafting, I am
sure that the Minister will be very well aware that he has far greater
resources at his command than his hon. Friends have available to them.
Will he meet with us to discuss the detail of drafting, so that we can
have a better new
clause?</div><a name="08070411000289"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000445"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> I am always pleased to meet my hon. Friend,
although I was going on to give the other reasons why we do not need
the new clause and, of course, there was no implied criticism of her at
all in relation to the point that I was making about the technical
drafting of the new clause.</div>
<a name="08070411000290"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000446"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> The Minister did not say that to
me.</div><a name="08070411000291"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000447"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> In the case of the hon. Gentleman, although I
extend my sympathy to him for having been in the same job for the past
seven years, I had thought that, by now, he would have learned how to
draft an amendment or new clause in the correct manner.</div>
<a name="08070411000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our three
priorities are: making sure that children do not have to leave care
before they are ready to do so; making sure that all care leavers have
access to an appropriate range of accommodation options when they leave
care, and providing the right support for care leavers so that they can
make a successful transition to independent
living.</div><a name="08070411000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee will be glad to hear that I will not go through all the
measures that we have discussed and are introducing, both in the
&#147;Care Matters&#148; implementation plan and in the Bill, in
relation to young people leaving care and accommodation. There are a
number of measures that should have a significant impact in reducing
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column261" />Column number: 261</div>numbers of relevant children who need accommodation. Clause 9 will
ensure that there is thorough scrutiny whenever a local authority plans
to move a child to move from a placement with foster parents or in a
children&#146;s home to any other arrangement, which is likely to be
accommodation that is less supported, whether that is a hostel or
supported lodgings.</div>
<a name="08070411000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we have
already discussed in our consideration of the Bill, we would expect the
IRO to provide a robust challenge to such a proposed change to the
placement arrangement if there is any doubt about the young
person&#146;s informed consent to the move, or any doubt that such a
move is not in their interest. We are committed to using existing
regulatory powers to introduce a new requirement for personal advisers
to visit young people where they are living, mirroring the new visiting
duty for looked-after children in clause 16, to reduce still further
the practical differences between the services that local authorities
must provide for looked-after children and relevant children, including
the financial incentives that local authorities may have had previously
to force children out of care before they are ready. We want to stop
there being any incentive at all for local authorities to do that, and
to ensure that they absolutely understand what their duties are.
Obviously that has been a large part of the discussions that we have
had in relation to the Bill and to the wider &#147;Care
Matters&#148; implementation plan.</div>
<a name="08070411000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">As part of
our revision of the Children Act guidance, we will be issuing statutory
guidance to IROs in 2009. The focus of case reviews should be the
provision made by the local authority to meet the full range of the
child&#146;s needs. For relevant children placed in unregulated
placements, such as supported lodgings, hostels, or, as is sometimes
the case, their own independent accommodation, it is essential that the
review examines whether or not their accommodation is suitable and
whether or not they are being provided with all the support that they
need.</div>
<a name="08070411000354"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div><a name="08070411000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
that review process identifies problems, then the review meeting
provides the opportunity to find the appropriate solutions. That will
require that leaving care services establish real partnerships with
housing and youth homelessness services. Housing services and
children&#146;s services must adopt a shared strategic approach to
the provision of housing and support pathways for young people. That
was the strong message in the guidance, &#147;Joint working between
Housing and Children&#146;s Services: Preventing homelessness&#148;
published by my Department and the Department for Communities and Local
Government in May this
year.</div><a name="08070411000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
I visited South Gloucestershire a few months ago, I met a young person
in care and what one young lady said about what her brother had said
years before was interesting. She said that her brother had said that
being in care meant &#147;homelessness&#148;. Ultimately, that was
what it meant to him and his friends; we are determined to bring that
to an end. I and hon. Members have seen how that situation can be
transformed, and we need to ensure that that is happening more widely
around the country. We are committed to supporting young people in
their transition into adulthood. I know that my hon. Friend the Member
for Warrington, South will be holding us to account as we try to
strength the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column262" />Column number: 262</div>guidelines. Her new cause is unnecessary and has technical
deficiencies, and I hope that she will agree to withdraw
it.</div>
<a name="08070411000298"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000448"></a>Helen
Southworth:</b> We have already commented on the technical
difficulties within the amendment. I hope that my hon. Friend will
agree to meet Members to look at the issues further. In light of the
indications that we have received from the Minister and of the time
that we have available to us over then next few months before Report, I
will review what he as said. However, first I shall remind him that in
the Joseph Rowntree Foundation&#146;s 2005 report, &#147;Life after
care&#148;, 36 per cent. of young people reported being homeless at
some time in the year after leaving care and that Rainer&#146;s
&#147;Home alone&#148; report found that almost one in six of care
leavers were in unsuitable accommodation, with a number in unsafe
accommodation. We urgently need to demonstrate that the Bill as drafted
is capable of delivering what it needs to for young people up to the
age of 21 to ensure that they can make an effective transition into
independent living. On that basis I will withdraw the amendment, but
198 Members want to see the Bill working effectively. I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the motion.</div>
<a name="08070411000299"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Motion and
clause, by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="08070411000300"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
proposed, </i>That the Chairman do report the Bill, as amended, to the
House.</div>
<a name="08070411000301"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000449"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> On a point of order, Mr.
Pope.</div>
<a name="08070411000302"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000450"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. The motion that the Chairman do report
the Bill to the House is itself debatable.</div>
<a name="08070411000303"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000451"></a>Kevin
Brennan:</b> I obviously learnt nothing in my two years in the
Government Whips Office. I am a rather defective Minister. I thank you,
Mr. Pope, and your colleague, Mr. Williams, for
chairing the Committee. I apologise that perhaps his presence meant
that some of us, including the hon. Member for Upminster, occasionally
lapsed into the language of heaven and I particularly apologise to the
<i class="I">Hansard </i>writers for that. I hope that the Committee will agree
that we, including the hon. Member for Ceredigion, made a valiant
effort to pronounce the very difficult English constituency names of
colleagues correctly during the proceedings. I also thank the
officials, the Clerks, the <i class="I">Hansard</i><i class="I"> </i>writers, the
Doorkeepers and the police for their assistance during our
deliberations.</div><a name="08070411000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have had an extremely useful Committee stage. The Bill has been
altered, if not through direct amendment, by indications that my right
hon. Friend and I have given either about strengthening regulation or
about amendments to other legislation about which hon. Members have
raised important points. The Committee has had a right and proper
scrutiny process, which has improved the Bill. I would like to thank
all Committee members, particularly my right hon. Friend the. Member
for Stretford and Urmston and my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester,
who, being in the Whips Office and not being allowed to speak, does not
get enough recognition. He has helped us to get through all the clauses
in time, as we have this afternoon.</div>
<a name="08070411000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would also
like to thank Members of the Opposition parties and particularly their
spokespersons, both of whom I have debated with before. I thank the
hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole for her elegant 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column263" />Column number: 263</div>choice of clauses and amendments to support. The hon. Member for East
Worthing and Shoreham said that he did not come into politics to be
elegant. I wrote that down when he said it. You may have noticed at
that point, Mr. Pope, one or two titters on this side of the
Committee, because as the hon. Gentleman was saying that some of my
hon. Friends behind me were passing around a copy of a new magazine
called &#147;Total Politics&#148;. In that magazine there is an
article on political elegance, with a quote, which is
highlighted:</div><a name="08070411000341"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;And
wear braces only if you want to look like a
twit.&#148;</div><a name="08070411000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">Heaven
forefend that the hon. Gentleman should think that I am getting at him.
That is a quote from his hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton
(Alan Duncan). He made that contribution to an article entitled
&#147;Dress to the Right, Sir?&#148; I hope that the hon. Gentleman
will forgive me for pointing that out to the Committee, but it was he
who said that he did not want to be elegant. That is just as well,
considering his hon. Friend&#146;s comments. With that, I would like
to conclude, and to thank you once again, Mr. Pope, for your
chairmanship.</div><a name="08070411000307"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000452"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Further to that non-point of order,
Mr. Pope, I also add my thanks to you and Mr.
Williams for your unassuming, understanding and accommodating
chairmanship, which has allowed us perhaps to range slightly more
freely through some of the clauses. May I also thank&#151;I was going
to thank the Minister but I am not entirely sure that I should now. One
would look even more of a twit if one was not wearing braces and
one&#146;s trousers ended up around one&#146;s ankles. That is
another matter, which I shall take up with my sort of hon. Friend the
Member for Rutland and Melton later in the
Lobby.</div><a name="08070411000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have had a constructive debate on a universally welcomed Bill, which
has been improved by the debate in another place and by the
undertakings and discussions in this Committee. We have had some
disappointments and some anticlimaxes, although not quite of the
ejaculatory nature that the Minister suggested earlier. I also thank my
hon. Friends. It is always worthwhile being on a Committee where just
about every member contributes. In the past, there were times when like
muppets they sat there and, under strict instructions, said nothing.
There are some regular suspects&#151;if I can put it that
way&#151;on the Committee who have been very involved in
children&#146;s legislation for many years, for almost as long as I
have, and they made valid contributions born out of their great
experience.</div><a name="08070411000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
give my thanks to my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight. It was
good to see him back in Committee, making his first contribution since
his recent health problems. I also give my thanks to our Whip, my hon. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column264" />Column number: 264</div>Friend the Member for Upminster. It is always good to have a talking
Whip&#151;try stopping her, with her knowledge of this subject. I
thank my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove who has been with us on
children&#146;s legislation before, and particularly my new hon.
Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich, who is no longer a Committee
virgin which is always a good hurdle to get
over.</div><a name="08070411000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
was almost frustrating that it was hard to find something to vote
on&#151;but we did. However, on Report we might find more reasons to
vote. There is some time now for the Government to reflect on many of
the suggestions that were made in the Committee. They have undertaken
to look again at certain things. They have undertaken to reflect on
some of the debates that we have had on the guidance that will be
issued with this and accompanying legislation. I therefore look forward
to returning on Report, when we might have further progress to report
towards ensuring that the Bill is as good as we could possibly hope
for, to at last address the problems of some of the most vulnerable
people in our society, namely children in care. They have had a lousy
deal for some time, and I think that we all agree that the time has
finally come to give them the deal&#151;the support and
services&#151;that they so much
deserve.</div><a name="08070411000311"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000453"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> I would also like to add my thanks, particularly
to you, Mr. Pope, in the Chair. It has been obvious that you
are very interested in the material, and that has given an added
dimension. I thank Mr. Williams as well. I thank the Clerks
and everyone else who has contributed to our proceedings. I give
particular thanks to the Ministers, who have been very courteous,
receptive and perhaps responsive&#151;we shall see on Report. I have
to say of the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham that I just
hope he does not have too many sneezing fits, particularly in
inappropriate
places.</div><a name="08070411000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have had good debates, and I hope that we would all agree that it has
been a privilege to serve on the Committee considering this very
important Bill. The fact that so much work was done in the other place
has enabled us to deal with some of the outstanding issues in quite a
lot of detail. That has been a good thing. I just hope that we really
will change things for the better and make a difference with this
Bill.</div><a name="08070411000313"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070411000454"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Thank you for those kind remarks and thank you
also for being a well behaved Committee, with the exception of the
