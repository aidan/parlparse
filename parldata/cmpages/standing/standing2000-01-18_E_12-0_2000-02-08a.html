Amendment proposed [3 February]: No. 311, in page 31, line 41, after the word `without', to insert the words 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`the approval of a resolution of both Houses of Parliament and'.—[
Mr. Gerald Howarth.]
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<H5>10.30 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made. 
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Keith Hill):</B> We have already had contributions from the hon. Members for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth), for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) and for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) on this clause, all of whom made— 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I should have stated that the hon. Member for Aldershot has given his apologies and asked me to express them to the Minister. He is in Select Committee this morning. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I wholeheartedly accept the hon. Gentleman's apologies and offer him a retrospective welcome to the Committee. 
<P>
The various contributions that we have heard from Conservative Members have made rather heavy weather of the provisions of the clause. It may help the Committee if I set minds at rest about its purpose. It has nothing to do with commitments on the size of the Government shareholding in National Air Traffic Services or the possibility of an eventual flotation. Provisions governing the Government's shareholding are to be found in a Government amendment to clause 49, and the remote possibility of a flotation is provided for in clause 53. 
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex quoted rather selectively from material kindly provided to Members of this Committee by my hon. Friend the Minister. Let me emphasise again that the full meaning of that material makes it clear that to float the company is not the Government's intention. To give a selective, but representative, quote: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Government, however, can never be required to dispose of its shares in a flotation. This underlines that there is no intention for there to be a flotation of NATS''.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Clause 48 is not primarily about the Government's ability to dispose of shares; it is about the Government's ability to acquire further shares in NATS or, much less likely, in NATS subsidiaries. That might prove necessary once the transfer schemes have taken effect and before the public-private partnership is established, but is much more likely to occur at some future date, after the establishment of the PPP, if NATS needs to be provided with equity funding—for example, in order to fund a major investment project—and the Secretary of State, with Treasury's consent, agreed to assist. Unsurprisingly, the Treasury's consent would be required for any such investment by the Secretary of State and, conversely, for any disposal of that investment. In that context, it should be remembered that the clause is not like clauses 47 and 56, which allow the Secretary of State to direct the issue of shares. Any shares acquired under clause 48 will be acquired on whatever terms they are offered. 
<P>
There is, however, no intention to allow the Government a free hand in the disposal of shares in NATS. The Committee will be aware of the amendment to clause 49 that would limit the Government's ability to dispose of shares in NATS; we hope to discuss that matter shortly. That clause will govern the extent to which the Secretary of State is able to dispose of shares in NATS, whether those shares are acquired under clause 48 or any other clause dealing with the transfer provisions. 
<P>
Given the safeguards that will be contained in clause 49, the controls proposed by amendment No. 311 are not necessary. Accordingly, I invite the hon. Gentleman the Member for Aldershot to withdraw his amendment. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We have a slight problem. The only person who is able to withdraw the amendment is the hon. Member who moved it and that is Mr. Howarth who is not present. So the amendment will have to be moved at some point. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bernard Jenkin </B>(North Essex): I am flummoxed. It is obviously a very good amendment. [Laughter.] It would have pained me deeply to have it withdrawn. My hon. Friend the Member for Aldershot must be very attached to it, which is why he has gone to the Select Committee instead of coming here. Given that this is a good principle on which to take a stand, I hear what the Minister says in response to the points made by my absent hon. Friend and will sit down to find out what will happen— 
<P>
Amendment negatived. 
<P>
Clause 48 ordered to stand part of the Bill. 
<H4><center>Clause 49 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Crown shareholding </center></H4>
<P>
<B>The Minister for Housing and Planning (Mr. Nick Raynsford):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 363, in page 32, line 7, at end insert— 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2A) The Secretary of State must ensure that the Crown does not dispose of any of the shares it holds in the designated company unless— 
<P>
(a) the Crown holds at least 49 per cent. of the company's issued ordinary share capital immediately before the disposal, and 
<P>
(b) the Crown will continue to hold at least 49 per cent. of that share capital immediately after the disposal. 
<P>
(2B) The Secretary of State must ensure that at any given time the Crown holds at least 25 per cent. of the designated company's issued ordinary share capital.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 364 and 365. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Since we have now reached clause 49, it will probably be appropriate, with your agreement Mr. Gale, to cover in a little more detail two matters on which we touched earlier: the articles of association and the strategic partnership agreement. I propose to say a little about the articles when we come to the next group of amendments and some more on the strategic partnership agreement on the subsequent grouping. That might be the most appropriate point at which those could be taken. I will not, therefore, give a detailed explanation of either of those items at this point. 
<P>
Amendment No. 363 would place certain limits on the way in which the Crown may deal with its shareholding in NATS. The first limit, which is set out in proposed new subsection (2A), is that the Secretary of State must ensure that the Crown does not dispose of any shares in NATS where the result of that disposal would be a reduction of the Crown's percentage holding of ordinary shares to less than 49 per cent. The second limit, which is set out in proposed new subsection (2B), is that the Secretary of State must ensure that at any time the Crown holds at least 25 per cent. in NATS' issued share capital. As Committee members may be confused about these two different figures, it might be helpful if I take each in turn and explain the reasons. 
<P>
The prohibition on sales below 49 per cent. is to ensure that the Government do not sell any more of their shares in NATS after completion of the public-private partnership. That is the clear policy intention. Our intention is that the public-private partnership will be created by the Government disposing of 51 per cent. of NATS to a strategic partner and NATS' employees—probably 46 per cent. to the former, 5 per cent. to the latter. The public-private partnership will be an enduring partnership between public and private sectors and that limitation is evidence of the Government's commitment to that partnership. There will, therefore, be no sales by the Government of their 49 per cent. shareholding. 
<P>
The second limitation is designed to ensure that the Crown retains a substantial shareholding in NATS—ie of at least 25 per cent.—even if that shareholding is reduced in time. That may happen if a future NATS funding requirement is met by the selected strategic partner in return for the issue of shares in NATS. That would not involve any sale of the Government shares, but the Government's holding would be diluted if there were an increase in the overall share capital. Any such transaction will be subject to the agreement of the Secretary of State through the shareholders' agreement. The transaction would not involve any disposal by the Government of their shares and, therefore, would not involve a breach of the limitation set out in subsection (2A), but would nevertheless reduce the Government's percentage holding. I repeat that the Government do not intend to allow a dilution at present, but if it ever occurred, the provision would provide an important, statutory guarantee that they will continue to hold a significant enough shareholding in NATS to protect their interests. Those familiar with company law will know that a party needs a 25 per cent. shareholding to be able to block any special resolutions of the company. 
<P>
If a reduction in the Government's shareholding were not permitted, there would either have to be no further equity investment in NATS or the Government would always have to match any investment made by the strategic partner. That is not what is intended, because one of the effects of the PPP is to remove NATS from the Government's financial constraints. The amendments therefore represent a strong commitment on the part of the Government to remain materially involved in NATS' future, while providing sufficient flexibility for additional investment to be made without the hindrance of Government financial constraints. 
<P>
Amendments Nos. 364 and 365 would expand the application of subsection (6) to transactions that result in a contravention of the limitations that I just described. That is not in any sense a lessening of the effect of subsections (2A) and (2B), but merely an acknowledgement that the duties imposed in these subsections are duties to which the Secretary of State—and not third parties—is subject. Subsection (6) would reinforce the fact that the retention of the Crown shareholding in NATS is a matter for the Secretary of State. The amendments proposed will operate in the best interests of NATS and of the Government and I commend them to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): This is an interesting amendment. So far, the Government—both in consultation and their stated policy—have said that 49 per cent. would continue to be owned by the Government, 46 per cent. probably by the strategic partner and 5 or 6 per cent. by the employees. The public-private partnership is based on some sort of equal stake between the private and public sectors, with the private sector being responsible for the day-to-day management of the company. In effect, the Government would be the silent partner, but they would certainly be a partner in that they would earn just under half. As a result of the amendments, although that could be the starting point, it would be relatively easy thereafter to dilute the Government's shareholding to 25 per cent. The Minister said that a 25 per cent. shareholding would still enable the Government to block any changes and control their reserve powers under the articles of association and shareholders' agreement, ensuring a degree of protection from the point of view of their policy. However, if one can ensure protection at that percentage holding, why should one not start at 25 per cent. rather than 49 per cent.? The proposal for a 49 per cent. shareholding is a political cover for saying that this is not a privatisation but a public-private partnership. 
<P>
Now we are told that the shareholding could be reduced to 25 per cent., leaving 75 per cent. to be owned by the private sector or those who work for the business. I am not against that—we are in favour of privatisation in principle since there are many benefits. The Minister said that there may have to be share issues to draw more capital into the business and that, because the Government do not wish to subscribe to their share of that capital, they are willing to allow their shareholding to be diluted. 
<P>
While we do not disagree with the amendment, it seems strange that, having set out their stall for 49 per cent., the Government now suggest that 25 per cent. would be acceptable. Evidently the Government's shareholding is somewhat less important than some of the guarantees that were built into the structure. That would be my interpretation of the Minister's explanation of the amendment. This morning in a quiet Committee Room upstairs in Parliament we have seen a subtle, or perhaps not so subtle, change of policy. The new company could be 75 per cent. owned by the private sector, rather than half owned. It is interesting to see how the Government's policy on air traffic services is evolving. 
<P>
<H5>10.45 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Gavin Strang </B>(Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh): This is an important clause. In a previous debate, the hon. Member for North Essex focused attention on the fact that in one of the documents that has been circulated to us the Government seem to be providing for the possibility that there could, at some point, be a flotation of the new NATS. That is different from the dilution to which the Minister referred. He said the quotation had been selective, as was obvious if one read to the end of the paragraph, where it said that the Government intend to retain their 49 per cent. stake. However, why did they include the possibility in the document in the first place, if their position is that the best option is to retain 49 per cent. equity in the company? The suggestion is that this would happen after the new en-route centre at Swanwick and the new Scottish centre at Prestwick were operational. Given that the document is a draft, would it not be more consistent with what the Minister has said this morning to delete it altogether? 
<P>
Although the Government intend to retain 49 per cent. of the equity, the private strategic partner will have complete commercial control of the company. That point is made in the document that was circulated to us from the DETR dated 28 January, which states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We have made it clear that initially there will be a single licence, covering en route air traffic services both in the UK and in UK-„controlled international airspace, and that it will be awarded to the current provider, National Air Traffic Services Ltd (NATS). There will not on this occasion be any competition to be the licence holder. The competition will come in the selection of the strategic partner who will take a controlling interest in NATS.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
The Government are saying that although the strategic partner will have less than 50 per cent. of the equity in NATS, it will have a controlling interest. We must be under no illusion that it is the intention that the private company will be allowed to take complete control of the running of National Air Traffic Services. 
<P>
I welcome the strong affirmation by my hon. Friend, the Minister of State, this morning that the Government intend to retain their 49 per cent. equity in the company, even though I do not regard that as the optimal arrangement. The Committee knows my view that the sensible option is for the Government to retain 100 per cent. equity in NATS, but it would not be profitable to argue that at this point. 
<P>
We are looking for a sign from the Government that they could reconsider the proposition for a flotation and reinforce their policy of retaining at least 49 per cent. of the equity. 
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members rose— </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I should be grateful if Committee members would leap to their feet and give a swifter indication that they wish to speak. The Minister is living in suspense. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Owen Paterson </B>(North Shropshire): I will leap to my feet swiftly and noisily too and make a gesture in your direction, Mr. Gale, to catch your eye. 
<P>
Will the Minister give us a more detailed explanation? We have had bold statements from the Government. The golden share has been the weapon with which they have assuaged their Back Benchers. The hon. Member for Harwich (Mr. Ivan Henderson) said ``Hear, hear!'' boldly when the Minister said that the Government will not sell their share. We have heard firm reassurances, but it is actions not words that count and there has been an extraordinary change. The golden share was to be built around a massively powerful 49 per cent. block, which was a substantial majority. As my hon. Friend the Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) said, that has suddenly tumbled down to 25 per cent. and we have not heard the full reasoning behind that change. There is a big difference between 25 per cent. and 49 per cent. The rhetoric is all the same—there is a powerful block—but the action does not match that. Will the Minister give us a much more detailed explanation of what is going on? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am happy to say that I am going on—a remark made by a very eminent Member of the House 30 years ago. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> She actually said ``I am going on and on . . .'' 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I was referring to Harold Wilson, who perhaps did not express himself in quite the same way as Baroness Thatcher. Either way, they were both distinguished former Prime Ministers and I do not aspire to that role. I am simply trying to clarify the policy. 
<P>
There is no question of any change such as that implied by the hon. Member for Poole. We have made it clear that when we establish the PPP we envisage that it will be on the basis of a 49 per cent. shareholding being held by the Government, 46 per cent. being offered to the strategic partnership and a further 5 per cent. to the employees. Those are our initial thoughts. As I have stressed on many occasions, it is not written in tablets of stone at this stage, but that is broadly our intention. 
<P>
In so far as the amendment does anything, it reinforces that intention. As members of the Committee will be well aware, the effect of section (2A) in Amendment No. 363 is to insist that the Crown cannot dispose of any of its shares if that would take its holding to below 49 per cent. That probably gives the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) the reassurance for which he was asking—there is no scope for the Government to sell their shares. 
<P>
The 25 per cent. shareholding would come in in very different circumstances—if the share capital of the company has to be increased at some future date and the Government do not wish to match any additional shareholding that may be agreed. There are circumstances where that may apply. Let us assume that at some dim and distant date, the Conservative party returns government and so mismanages the economy that, as and when NATS is expanding, it simply does not have the resources to provide the necessary public investment to match the expansion. That is a possible eventuality. I sincerely hope that it will not happen, but it could and it would be imprudent of us not to provide for the fact that the Government might not be able to match share expansion that is seen as fundamental to the continued future of the business. It would be imprudent to say emphatically that in all circumstances the 49 per cent. must never vary. 
<P>
Crucially, we have insisted upon the retention of an absolute minimum of 25 per cent. That is important because it provides the necessary security against any resolutions being moved that might, for example, wind up the company or reduce its capital—or anything else that would seriously damage the interests of the Government and the company. That is the power of the 25 per cent. holding, which is sufficient to block any special resolutions such as those I described. It is a necessary safeguard to guarantee the Government's interest in NATS, while allowing operational flexibility. It would be wrong to set an absolute straitjacket that required a change of legislation as and when it became necessary to consider a further share issue. 
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh (Dr. Strang) raised two points—one of which is the issue of flotation, which he wants us to look at again. My hon. Friend, the Under-Secretary, the Member for Streatham (Mr. Hill) made it clear a moment ago that there is no intention to seek a flotation, except in very remote circumstances. The first of those might be where the strategic partner and the Government have reached a total impasse—there is no agreement, therefore there has to be an exit route. Unless it was possible to pursue a flotation, there would be no way of resolving such a conflict. I shall explain that in more detail when we come to talk about the strategic partnership agreement that sets that arrangement in place. It is an unwelcome but necessary option in the event of a conflict that cannot otherwise be resolved. Safeguards are necessary and that is the reason for the provision, but I repeat to my right hon. Friend that there is no intention of pursuing a flotation. 
<P>
Secondly, my right hon. Friend asked about the role of the strategic partner and whether it would have a controlling interest. It will be the body in overall charge of the management of the company, but—as he will see when we talk in more detail about the strategic partnership agreement, and as I have previously explained in Committee—the framework provides a raft of interlocking safeguards to ensure that, even if the Government do not have a 50 per cent. or greater share in the company, the public interest is always maintained while allowing the strategic partner to bring its experience and capital to the operation.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): On the question of interlocking safeguards, will the Minister give an example in which holding the shareholding at a minimum of 25 per cent. might provide protection against the company taking action that the Government could not block with other pieces of legislation, particularly where the licence holder is in breach of either its section 8 duties or its licence conditions? That safeguard is there anyway, so I cannot see the need for the 25 per cent. holding in those circumstances. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I have just given the illustration that a special resolution could be moved which the Government, if they had an interest of less than 25 per cent., would not be able to block. The structure could be changed through the normal procedures of company decisions without the Government having the necessary blocking power. There are other safeguards that I will discuss later, but the intention is that we should not be dependent on one. The 25 per cent. shareholding is a further element of that. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I entirely understand the Minister's argument. I simply sought to obtain from him an example of the sort of restructuring of the company that might take place without the 25 per cent. block, which would not at the same time fall foul of the requirement to meet section 8 duties and the licence conditions. I cannot envisage a structural change that could not have that effect and, if a change did not have that effect, why anybody would be concerned about it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> If it will help the hon. Member for Bath, let me paint one possible scenario. Let us assume that it has been necessary to go for a flotation. The original agreement with the original strategic partner has broken down. The strategic partner and the Government are in disagreement and the strategic partner accepts, therefore, that he or she will have to end the relationship. There has to be a means of replacing the strategic partnership and a flotation takes place. That is one possibility. It is not very likely. It is not something that we would seek, but it could happen. The purpose of the legislation is to safeguard against those possibilities. 
<P>
<H5>11 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
Other safeguards ensure that no individual party can acquire more than a 15 per cent. shareholding: those are in the articles that we will come to later. Although there are all those safeguards in place, one of the shareholders, post-flotation, might seek a reduction in the share capital in the company by means of a special resolution. While there are safeguards—the Government have partnership directors who are there, who can engage in debate with the other directors and come back to the Government and the Government have a power to make direction—clearly it would be unsatisfactory if the Government did not have the power to block an unwelcome resolution to pursue a policy that is diametrically opposite to their objectives. That is why this 25 per cent. shareholding is one further necessary safeguard. It does not mean that without it the Government would be powerless. It does mean that, with it, the arrangements for the successful management of the public-private partnership will be easier. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman. Would the 25 per cent. shareholding be available as a tool to prevent an unwelcome takeover of the company? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> It would be one means of safeguarding the company against unwelcome moves, but the safeguards against a takeover are there already. I have referred to the articles that provide that there should be no more than a 15 per cent. shareholding in the hands of any one party. That is the real safeguard against unwelcome takeover, but obviously any move to change the share capital of the company to make it easier for one party to exercise control could be made by means of a special resolution. The 25 per cent. holding would be an effective block against that. This is, therefore, one more safeguard. I hope the hon. Member for North Essex sees the significance of that. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Poole argued as to why we did not start at 25 per cent. instead of 49 per cent. I hope that that is now clear from my answer. If we started at 25 per cent. there would be no flexibility. If subsequently the share capital of the company needed to be expanded, it would be essential for the Government always to match any increase in the shareholding agreed by the strategic partner. With 49 per cent. there is that flexibility but—to return to my point—it is not our intention to use that flexibility to reduce the Government's shareholding. This is a necessary safeguard and a necessary provision for flexibility at a future date—if it is required. Our plan, however, is to proceed on the basis of a public-private partnership, with the Government holding 49 per cent. of the shareholding, the strategic partner holding, probably, 46 per cent. and the employees the remaining 5 per cent. That is the purpose. I hope the Committee will accept that these amendments reinforce those points and, therefore, are welcome additions to the legislation—both in terms of clarity and safeguard. I hope that the Committee will agree to include them in this clause. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> We are probably dealing with the most sensitive clause in this part of the Bill. It provides for the guts of what is happening and will continue to happen after the public-private partnership is in place. Usually in these circumstances, the Opposition parties table troublesome amendments seeking assurances on the face of the Bill. The Minister then says that those are unnecessary, that he has given his word, that the Government's intentions are perfectly clear and, in any case, the provisions are elsewhere in the Bill. 
<P>
Now, however, we have an extraordinary situation. The Minister is tabling a series of amendments that are designed to give assurance before any was sought. I have to tell you, Mr. Gale, that I smell a rat [Laughter.]—we hear offstage laughter from the pantomime dame there. We are faced with an extraordinary situation. There is a fundamental flaw in the Minister's argument. If it is possible to conceive of circumstances in which the Government might need the flexibility to allow an increase in the share capital without expense to the public purse—therefore a dilution when the Government hold 49 per cent.,—it is possible that, at a future date when the Government are holding only 25 per cent., similar circumstances may occur. Then what? The Minister has put the Crown in a curious position: the 25 per cent. would have to be diluted. He will assure us that that holding is on the face of the Bill and cannot be diluted, but we are going to have a debate about subsection (7), which says 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Secretary of State may by order amend or repeal this section.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Let us start from the premise that nothing that the Minister says about anything that in the clause has any semblance of permanence to it. ``By order'' means that the Minister can table an affirmative resolution in both Houses and knock it through with a vote; it is as simple as that. Nothing in the clause is of any real significance—except that it is a tell-tale to some of the difficulties that the Government are having in reconciling their stated policies, intentions and aspirations to keep this business in close partnership with the public sector with the circumstances that will prevail as soon as the partnership is in place. 
<P>
This clause is designed to reassure us that the Government are going to hold on to 49 per cent. in all possible circumstances except the most extreme. Then they might dilute it to 25 per cent. The first point I would make to the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh is that there is nothing in the clause that precludes a flotation. The flotation could take place while the Government still retain 49 per cent. Any assurance that the Minister sought to give the right hon. Gentleman about it not being the Government's intention to move to a flotation and that the provision is somehow an additional insurance against a flotation is, therefore, a completely empty promise. 
<P>
What is the Government's motive for tabling the amendment? It is because the more they looked at the protections they wanted to put in place to maintain the Government's influence over what happens in the partnership company and, more importantly, who controls and how they control the partnership company, the more problems they have found. That is because we are not dealing exclusively with United Kingdom law; we are also dealing with European Community law, and the latter is very clear. Article 73(b) of the treaty as currently in force sets out that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Within the framework of the provisions set out in this Chapter, all restrictions on the movement of capital between Member States and between Member States and third countries shall be prohibited.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
The new subsection is designed as a fig leaf to cover the future failure of the golden share arrangements that we shall debate later. I will not detain the Committee on that question, but the Minister himself said that he does not imagine that the primary role of the 25 per cent. blocking minority share is to prevent a takeover, though within the articles of association as they are currently construed it might be able to be used in that way. We should put our faith in the golden share—the special share that will be referred to later—for that purpose. The principal reason behind the amendment is that the Minister is trying to stick in numerous complex obstacles to frustrate what the Commission would regard as the free movement of capital, and the amendment provides an additional obstacle. It is a valiant attempt but it betrays that this whole clause is a mess: the Government are grappling with intractable problems surrounding special shares and special protection for companies of strategic significance. Hon. Gentlemen sitting on the Government Benches in this Committee need to be aware—

<B>Ms Claire Ward </B>(Watford): Ahem! 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I apologise: hon. Gentlemen and hon. Ladies—perhaps I ought to stick to ``hon. Members''. Sooner or later that is going to be modernised to ``hon. Persons'' I suppose. Labour Members should be aware that we are discussing a release of the business from the state sector. There could never be stronger confirmation that we are going down a path to privatisation because, we have heard, from the Minister's own lips, that he contemplates a flotation as the final solution to this process. Conservative Members may well feel that that is preferable—provided that we have sufficient protection for the public and the national interest, safeguarded through the articles of association, the provisions of the Bill and, ultimately, through the special share. 
<P>
The Minister should come clean. We would understand if he were to explain that there are problems with securing the provisions of special shares and special restrictions on the transfer of shares and special arrangements for the Crown to hold a special influence in this company. We want him to be able to do that, but he should share with us some of the problems he has encountered and some of the legal advice he has been given about the difficulties he is likely to encounter. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I endorse many of the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex but I think the reasons for the amendment are simpler and come down to money. The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions has a tradition of always knuckling under to the Treasury and never ever getting its own way. I think that the draft Bill was sent to the Treasury where a little Treasury mandarin read it in detail; he went in a state of panic to his masters asking, ``Have you seen what these lunatics in the DETR are committing us to? Do you realise what this means?'' 
<P>
In the case of air travel really taking off—and none of us could have imagined 15 years ago how telecommunications or the internet would take off—there could be a wholesale expansion of air travel. Terrestrial travel is jammed up, so why not take the third medium, as the birds did many millenniums ago? Personal air travel may well come about in our lifetime, in which case there will be a huge explosion in demand for air traffic control. Here is our little mandarin saying, ``Do you realise what these guys are committing us to? They are committing us to holding a 49 per cent. stake in this company, regardless of how big it gets, how much it expands, and how much it may want to absorb gargantuan volumes of cash. They can't do that! Get 'em to knock out an amendment quickly to reduce our long-term commitment.'' I think that is what the audit is all about. The Minister said so. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford indicated dissent. </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> The Minister shakes his head but that is exactly what he said. He said that in the event that the company wants to float and expand and the Government do not want to follow through, they will be able to reduce their holding to 25 per cent. Twenty-five per cent. of a massively enlarged NATS could still be a huge commitment. Perhaps the amendment represents a botched compromise arrived at with the Treasury. The amendment comes down to cash. Not far down the road there could be a demand for large volumes of capital. 
<P>
<H5>11.15 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> My hon. Friend has hit on a point about the drafting of the proposed subsection. The Minister wanted the 49 per cent. and the Treasury decided that provision had to be made to avoid a capital rating that would result in an illegal dilution of the Government's shareholding. Therefore we have had a little pas de deux between the Treasury and the DETR. The Minister tabled 49 per cent.; the Treasury said, ``You've got to provide a dilution.'' and the result is the amendment, which provides no assurance of what the Minister intended. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I entirely endorse that. The amendment reveals a flop—a complete collapse of the DETR in the face of Treasury pressure. Will the Minister enlighten us as to what discussions he has had with the Treasury about the clause? Has he talked to any ministerial colleague about the long-term commitment? Have his officials talked to their counterparts in the Treasury? At the back of it is the Treasury saying ``No, you cannot commit yourselves to the possibility regardless of circumstances of a 49 per cent. holding in what could be a massively increasing capital base.''. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I shall start with the point raised by the hon. Member for North Shropshire, whose metaphors became a bit mixed in the course of the debate. We heard fantasies about personal air travel and I am sad that the hon. Member for Aldershot, who clearly enjoys the process, was not here to share the debate. The next thing we heard about was a pas de deux. I am not sure that is altogether compatible with personal air travel. 
<P>
I have spoken to colleagues about the provision. I spoke to the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin) and my right hon. and noble Friend, the Minister for Transport. It is at his behest and at that my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister, who was also consulted—although I was not personally involved in discussions with him—that the provision has been tabled. 
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex smelt a rat. If the Government table amendments offering safeguards it may not be because of pressure from the Opposition. It may be because the Government have decided, on reflection, that there is merit in providing further reassurance that might be attractive to Labour Members, as well as Opposition Members. There is no cause for suspicion about the Government tabling amendments that provide safeguards and guarantees. 
<P>
I remind the hon. Members for North Essex and for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) of the wording of the amendments. The first starts: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Secretary of State must ensure that the Crown does not dispose'';
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
and the second one starts: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Secretary of State must ensure that at any given time the Crown holds at least''.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Those are clear directions in legislation to the Secretary of State. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> The Minister has not answered my question. I asked, not about discussions within his own Department—that is interesting information for which I am grateful—but between himself or his officials and the Treasury. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I thought that I had made it clear to the hon. Gentleman that I have not had any conversations with anyone other than the Ministers I listed—and, obviously, with officials in my Department. Undoubtedly there will have been discussions with officials in other Departments, of which the Treasury was one. That is part of the normal process of government. His great fantasy is not even an approximation of the reality. 
<P>
The provision is designed to give both safeguards and flexibility. I have stressed before and will do so again that if, as the hon. Member for North Shropshire envisages, there is huge expansion of air travel and a need for a dramatic increase in the provision of air traffic control services, it would be unfortunate if an excessively rigid framework prevented opportunities for raising additional share capital. That is the circumstance in which there might be a dilution of the Government shareholding. It is not our intention. It is not policy. However, it would be imprudent of us not to provide for that while providing safeguards so that, even if it happened, the Government would continue to hold a sufficiently large shareholding to be able to block any unwelcome special resolutions. 
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex talked about the possibility of this provision being over-ruled by subsection (7). We will consider that, but I remind the hon. Gentleman, that subsection (7) which is related to clause 89(4) requires an affirmative resolution from both Houses of Parliament before any such change can be made. If the hon. Gentleman thinks that that is a pushover, he was obviously not paying attention to what was happening in the other place last night. Clearly, if the Government are pursuing a course of action that arouses disagreement, another House of this Parliament can overturn their proposals. I do not welcome it, I regret that very much. It is not the case that it is a pushover and that the Government can simply table a resolution and push it through Parliament on the nod. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That is a most interesting observation and I take what the Minister says very seriously. However, he is not giving us an assurance that the Government are not going to go on appointing members to the upper House until they have a controlling majority, He is not giving us that assurance. His assurance is of absolutely no consequence. Everyone knows that secondary legislation to amend primary legislation is a good deal easier than having to put through a new Bill. It is the shortcut procedure that the hon. Gentleman wants at his disposal. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman is wrong, but I will not pursue the argument lest I fall into trouble with you, Mr. Gale. Discussing Government intentions for the future of the House of Lords is not within my remit. The hon. Gentleman's suggestion that a requirement for an affirmative resolution in both Houses is a matter of no consequence seems to be both misguided and affront to both Houses of Parliament. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also talked about the possibility of a flotation taking place even if the Government hold 49 per cent. As I have explained, if the strategic partnership arrangement were no longer workable because the strategic partner and the Government had fallen out, clearly one would need to find a mechanism to replace the strategic partner. That is where a flotation might apply. It does not in any way show that we intend to seek a flotation. 
<P>
Finally, on the hon. Gentleman's Euro-fantasy line, which we will no doubt hear more about, he described the provision as a fig leaf for the potential failure of the golden share. When we discuss the golden share, I hope that he will realise that no fig leaf is required because the golden share gives real and important safeguards—but that is for another debate. We are not interested in fig leaves. We are not interested in fantasies. We are interested in effective arrangements that give real safeguards, but also provide real flexibility for a hugely important company that will be vital to this country's long-term interests. That is what we are putting in place and I hope Committee agree these amendments. 
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 393, in page 32, line 10, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, which shall specify'— 
<P>
(a) the extent to which Table A of the Companies (Table A to F) Regulations 1985 shall be adopted; 
<P>
(b) the authorised share capital of the company; 
<P>
(c) the rights attached to shares in the company;

<P>
(i) the appointment and powers of various classes of directors; and 
<P>
(j) such other matters as may be relevant to any company's articles of association and relevant to the special circumstances of this Act.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
The amendment would put on the face of the Bill items that ought to be in the articles of association. Principally, we wanted to debate the articles of association. Due to the way in which the Bill is drafted, much of our discussion has centred on what will happen. It is important that we probe and test the Government to find out what their thinking is. I again thank the Ministers for providing the draft articles of association and the other associated documentation, which have enabled a more informed debate on the subject. Nevertheless, we have a number of questions. The first is that of the new company and it follows seamlessly on from the last debate since all these matters are inter-related. I see nothing in the bill that necessarily means it will be listed as a public limited company on the London stock exchange. As far as I can tell from the way the Government are thinking, we have draft articles of association for a limited company. The idea is that a strategic partner would negotiate, an agreement would be signed and they would become partners in a company. It may be a private company or a public company, or a strategic partner may have a separate listing of its own in which case its shareholding within the new NATS would be a subsidiary of that company. That raises a number of questions. 
<P>
First, the Government started off by saying there would be 49 per cent. for Government, 46 per cent. for the strategic partner and 5 per cent. for employees. We have not managed to tease out of the Government their thinking on the 5 per cent. for the employees. For example, are those shares to be issued at a market price or is a discount to be given to people who work within the company? I asked at the beginning of our deliberations whether the shares would be available to former employees of NATS. If the new company has no listing, how does one set a market price? I also asked how those who took a shareholding in the business would be able to realise their shares when they wished to do so—it is not that easy to trade shares in a private business—or does the Minister envisage the 5 per cent. being in the company listing of a strategic partner? That is important because the Government have reassured people who work in the company that they will have a stake in it. How will they have a stake, on what terms and how will they be able to realise their interest in the company? Would there be any restrictions if they were given shares on a preferential basis? For example, could they only sell after x number of years? In other words, should the investment remain longer term, rather than one that could be realised on day one when some other party could come in to sweep up that shareholding? 
<P>
I would be grateful if the Minister could set out a little more clearly how he sees the operation. Clearly, if the new company has a listing on the stock exchange it will be a different animal than if it were a private company. 
<P>
I know that there is a difficulty. At the moment we do not have a strategic partner in mind. That partner may have its own views about how it wants things to operate. The issues seems pretty critical. We are talking in almost abstract terms about articles of association for a company and we are not sure whether it is to be a limited company, a plc, or something else. These are all important matters. 
<P>
By and large, I do not want to zero in on anything in the articles of association. On the whole, the document is well put together. When the Minister gives an overview of the articles of association, perhaps he will explain how the special share will be held. We heard in an earlier debate that the Government would have the right to be repaid their capital from their special share first, which would seem to make it a debenture rather than an ordinary traded share. 
<P>
Also, as the Minister mentioned, if a person or body owns or controls more than 15 per cent. of the shares, the draft articles of association provide a control mechanism, so that people cannot buy up shares in the company and have an influence beyond that measure. Again, it is difficult to talk in these terms when we do not know whether there is to be a public listed company or a private listed company, nor do we know how the company will operate. 
<P>
Will the Minister give us a little more information about the partnership directors who would represent the Government? As has been stated in a number of documents, they would have to declare their interest so that people within the business knew exactly where they were coming from. They would have almost a dual mandate: they would have a responsibility as directors of the company, as under the various Companies Acts, but they would also have a responsibility to the Treasury. As the Minister explained earlier, the procedure would be that, if they had particular concerns, they would raise them in front of the board; if these were not addressed, then they would have a responsibility to go back to the Treasury, which is the principal shareholder, to express those concerns. 
<P>
I am presuming that, under those arrangements, they would all be paid on the same basis. What happens if there is a share scheme for directors, to give them an incentive in the business? Would the partnership directors take up their particular share in terms of incentives within the business or would they be more constrained than the other directors? Although all members of the board have equal responsibility for the company, do the Government envisage the partnership directors operating on a different basis from other directors? 
<P>
I do not want to labour this point, and I am sure there are many hon. Members who want to contribute to the debate. There may be rather more questions than answers, because we do not know who the strategic partner will be, so we do not know under what arrangement the new company will be set up. All we know is Government's intention as to the environment that they wish to create through negotiation. We do need some answers from the Minister and some assurances. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Moore </B>(Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale): Following on the point made by the hon. Member for Poole, as I read the articles of association and the Bill—and I am happy to be corrected by the Minister if I have this wrong—I could find no definition anywhere of the types of body corporate that are the only ones who can hold shares in this organisation, that might be deemed unsuitable—perhaps for national security reasons—and that the Government might not want to have a shareholding. There is a cap on the amount of shares that any body corporate can have and there are reasonably sophisticated mechanisms in the articles and elsewhere to check and to give the directors power to investigate if they think that that 15 per cent. rule has been breached, either directly or indirectly. 
<P>
However, what measures are there, either in the articles or elsewhere, that cover the possibility of various 14 per cent. shareholders acting in concert? They may not be directly or indirectly related to one another, but indirectly come together behind the scenes and agree to vote as a block; there need not necessarily be any legal connection establish between them. I hope that the Minister will respond to those points. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I have a few brief comments and some questions about the articles of association which the amendment enables us to discuss. First, can the Minister tell the Committee what gearing in the company he would regard as acceptable and what as unacceptable? I do not imagine that it will be a £100 off-the-shelf company, but article 3 does not specify how much share capital there should be. 
<P>
Secondly, why should regulation 2 of references in table A to classes of share not apply? That is the reference in article 4 to the company's ability to issue preference shares. If the Minister is worried that issues of capital will dilute the Government's shareholding, it would seem sensible to allow the company to issue preference share capital, as that would give the Government two options. One is to decline to take up the offer of preference share capital; the other is to take up the issue of preference share capital on the basis that it will be repaid at a future date and therefore can come out of the national loans fund instead of being a permanent expenditure commitment. It could be capitalised under the new resource accounting rules. I fail to see why the company should not be able to raise preference capital.  
<P>
Thirdly, why is article 6 so worded in the draft that the Minister has kindly given us? It gives the directors unconditional authority, 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to exercise all powers of the Company to allot relevant securities.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Does he imagine that the flotation will take place within the next five years, which is a reasonable assumption? It might be useful for the directors to have those powers over that period. I do not know whether that is a tell-tale in that direction.  
<P>
Article 10.3, which deals with the special shareholder, raises an interesting point. It says: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The written consent of the Special Shareholder is also required before certain events can take place. This is so even if these articles suggest otherwise.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
That is an important point to understand. I do not see the purpose of putting that second sentence into the articles, because statute law and European Community law would override the articles if there was any conflict between them. It would be perfectly possible for the company to remove the phrase 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``This is so even if these articles suggest otherwise.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
We are entering into a dangerously circular and confusing argument. It reminds the Committee of the point that should be of interest to all members of the Committee that the articles are largely academic when it comes to the golden share. Whatever the rights of the golden share may be in the articles, they can be interfered with; what matters is what is in the Bill. However, it is clearly important, assuming that everything is going according to plan, that the golden share arrangements are reflected in the articles as well. We have tabled a later amendment that specifies what the rights of the golden share should be in the Bill. That is an assurance that the Minister should be keen, in his proactive and assuring mode, to put in the Bill, as he did his previous amendment. 
<P>
Finally, will the Minister explain why the limitations on shareholdings—they are contained in the articles of association so that is clearly a demonstration of his intentions—are not put in the Bill to protect the public interest in statute rather than simply in the articles of association? The reason for discussing the articles is to find out what the Government's intentions are and, in principle, to ask why those intentions are not expressed in the Bill. The limitations on shareholdings seem to be a significant matter and I invite the Minister to say why they are not in the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Will the Minister explain how the market in these shares will work? My hon. Friend the Member for Poole began with that issue. Will the shares be listed? If so, where will they be listed? Will it be on the London stock exchange? Will they be available on European stock exchanges or the New York stock exchange? If it is not listed, how will we arrive at a market price? I could find nothing in the articles about how prices will be arrived at for incentive schemes such as employee share schemes. Will the Minister explain how he envisages the development of the market in the shares and where it will be located? 
<P>
On the other hand, how does the Minister intend to keep out undesirables? While he reassures Labour Back Benchers that the Government will keep a firm grip on our air traffic control, out of the other side of his mouth he encourages the markets to consider the good investment opportunities that are involved. How, under the articles, will the blackguards be stopped? Who will define them as such, and how will they be identified? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Amendment No. 393 would require the articles of association to contain provisions relating to the matters covered by the amendment. I am delighted that Opposition Members have found the time to type out, or perhaps merely to photocopy, the table of contents in the draft articles that we supplied, and I commend them for their careful scrutiny. I suspect that the purpose of the amendment was to ensure that the Committee has an opportunity to discuss the articles, and I shall take it in that spirit. I shall say a few words about the articles and, in doing so, try to answer the many questions that Opposition Members have asked. 
<P>
I repeat the health warning that I must give at the beginning of any such explanation: the articles, like the strategic partnership agreement and the draft licence agreement, represent a working draft. They will be developed to reflect changes to the Bill and those that arise from subsequent discussions with the strategic partners. When they are finalised, the articles will govern the relationship between NATS and its shareholders. 
<P>
The articles are in a form that is typically used in a joint venture context. That is my response to the question that the hon. Member for Poole asked about the form that the company will take. It will not be a publicly listed company. We envisage that it will initially be a private company as a vehicle for the public-private partnership. I have described the circumstances in which a flotation might happen, although it is not our policy to pursue that. In the event of a flotation, new articles would be adopted that are suitable for a listed plc. For the time being, the framework is for a private company with a partnership focus. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about shares. The articles deal with matters relating to the company's share capital, such as the authorised amount, the rights attaching to shares, pre-emption rights on the issue of new shares and the directors' authority to allot shares. They also contain restrictions on transfers of shares that complement those in the strategic partnership agreement. 
<P>
No final decision has yet been made about the detailed arrangements for the issue of shares to staff members. It is envisaged in principle that some may be available without charge and some may be sold at a price, which would have to be determined. There will be a trust for the shares, which will make the market and exercise the role that is essential in the absence of any open market valuation. 
<P>
The next important issue in relation to the articles concerns the rights that attach to the special share. The special share is needed in order to protect the public interest, especially in the event of a flotation of NATS. The primary right attaching to the special share is to prevent certain events occurring without the Government's consent. Those events include amendments to particular articles, including article 10, and the issue of any new shares in NATS. I shall say more about the special share when we discuss the strategic partnership agreement. In that context, the special share will be defined in greater detail, and we shall be able to understand the safeguards more clearly. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> In the event of a flotation, the strategic partnership agreement will cease to be operative. How can the Minister's comments on that agreement have any bearing on the way in which the special share will operate after a flotation? 
<P>
<H5>11.45 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> As I said, the special share is described in the strategic partnership agreement and relevant provisions are contained in the articles. In a flotation, the company structure will change and the articles will guarantee the maintenance of the special share. However, the special share will operate in a different way because a strategic partnership may not be agreed on the basis on which it was initially envisaged. That is why the provision appears in the articles and in the strategic partnership agreement. The matter is complex, and it is, I am sure, confusing to some. However, our approach is to put in place a raft of interlocking safeguards that will apply in different circumstances and has the flexibility to cope with subsequent developments. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Poole kindly said that the document that sets out the articles was well put together. I thank him for those comments, which I am sure will be appreciated by my officials and by their advisers. We hope and believe that the document is well put together, but it will require further consideration in view of the Committee's comments and discussions with strategic partners. It is not yet a final document, and it will, I hope, become even better. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned the special share, which is a voting equity share, although it is redeemable. It would not make the Treasury happy if it were redeemed, because it has a value of £1. It also gives voting rights in limited circumstances—it is not a debenture. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Mr. Moore) raised the possibility that unwelcome persons might become a strategic partner or a major shareholder, or that they might be able to launch an unwelcome takeover. I shall deal with those perfectly fair points in turn. When the Government choose the strategic partner, they will seek to ensure that he or she is a fit and proper person to carry out the relevant responsibilities. It would be unthinkable for the Government to appoint someone who was regarded as being not proper to carry out those responsibilities. We recognise that other shareholders could come into the picture during a flotation and that different provisions might apply. A range of safeguards, including the 15 per cent. maximum limit on an individual shareholding, will deal with those eventualities. 
<P>
Other provisions will allow the Government, in certain circumstances, to require a divestment of shareholdings by individual parties. Those important safeguards will guard against improper behaviour by parties who happen to acquire an interest. Specific provisions will guard against an unwelcome takeover. The Government will be informed of any proposed acquisition of shares, and they will be able to instruct the interested parties to divest themselves of the shares through the controls that will be established when the strategic partnership agreement and the golden share proposals are combined. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> That was not the point that I made. My concerns were about what would happen if several different corporate bodies—they are the only bodies that can hold shares—worked in concert with each other. They would be bound, not legally in a group, either directly or indirectly, but through an alliance. What would happen if they effected a takeover and the appropriate legal provisions were not in place? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> In that circumstance, other safeguards would apply. As I said during an earlier debate, it is important that the Government hold the minimum level of shares necessary to block any special resolutions resulting from an agreement between two or three shareholders who each control about 14 per cent., and who try to amend the articles or change the directors or the shareholding arrangements. That is why a raft of separate safeguards is necessary. Clearly, any conspiracy among individuals to subvert the 15 per cent. shareholding obligation would be a very serious matter and would be investigated. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Who would carry out the investigation? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> There would be a number of possibilities. Certainly, hon. Members would show considerable interest in any attempt by business interests to subvert Parliament's clear intention that a shareholding of no more than 15 per cent. be held by any one party. I referred specifically to a conspiracy, which, I would imagine, would arouse real concern. 
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex raised a number of specific issues. He talked about the envisaged scale of the share issue. At this stage, the gearing will be set as part of the competitive sale process and in the light of the strategic partner's plans for the business. No particular figure is envisaged at the moment, and it would be inappropriate for the Government to determine this as an absolute. The matter will be discussed with the prospective strategic partner, and a view will be taken at that point. However, the strategic partnership agreement provides an overall control mechanism, which we shall consider in due course. The strategic partner will have day-to-day management control, but the partnership directors will safeguard the Government's interests by securing adherence to the agreed business plan. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman raised the question of article 6 and the director's authority to issue new shares. I can assure him that that is a standard provision in private company articles. The five-year period to which he referred is the maximum period allowed under statute. In all events, the issue of new shares requires the Government's consent under the provisions in the strategic partnership agreement, which we shall consider later. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also expressed a concern about preference shares. The article does not rule out their use, and we will consider any proposals on their merits. However, in practice, preference shares are not much used these days outside highly leveraged venture capital projects such as leveraged buy-outs. We do not envisage such a circumstance in relation to public-private partnerships. 
<P>
On limitations on shareholding, the most important article, which may not be amended without Government consent, is article 11, which prohibits any individual shareholder from holding more than 15 per cent. of NATS shares. Clearly, that is an important protection. The articles provide for the special share to be redeemed at the Secretary of State's option, or by NATS if the Crown holds less than 25 per cent. of NATS. However, as the legislation prevents the Crown from redeeming the special share and allowing its shareholding to be diluted below 25 per cent., such a circumstance could not arise without legislation being amended. 
<P>
The final provisions in the articles govern the conduct of meetings in terms of participation, quorum, voting arrangements and proxies, and deal with shareholders' meetings and directors' meetings. Otherwise, the company will have articles that follow those set out in the Companies Act 1985 as standard for private companies, which are also known as ``Table A articles''. I hope that that covers the points made by hon. Members and that the hon. Member for Poole will recognise that the amendment is unnecessary.

<P>

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> This has been a useful debate. I thank the Minister for setting out much more of the Government's thinking on the matter. I am still a little worried about the 5 per cent. that employees, in effect, were promised as their stake in the new company. I understand the logic of the Government's thinking in terms of the strategic partner and the regime set out in the Bill. I also understand why employees are being offered 5 per cent. of the company. The Government are doing something that may not be flavour of the month. Consequently, they want to offer something to give people an incentive and make them feel more involved—a 5 per cent. financial interest, on terms yet to be agreed. 
<P>
As the Minister told the Committee, some shares might be free and others might be available for subscription. A 5 per cent. share may or may not pay dividends—if the strategic partner were larger than the Government, it might determine that it wanted to keep cash in the business to expand it in the short term, instead of paying out dividends. Setting up a trust to make an artificial market for that 5 per cent. shareholding is not a satisfactory arrangement. How will a price be fixed? If one is an employee with a shareholding in a major company, one of the factors affecting price is whether other people are buying shares in the company. Under this regime, however, restrictions apply to the percentage of shares—even if the company were listed, the prospects of a takeover would be highly unusual and unlikely. I would be interested to hear the Government's thinking on how to establish a market through a trust in only 5 per cent. of the shares. I think that that would be extremely difficult, because only a small percentage of the company would be involved. All the other shareholdings would have no impact. 
<P>
I wonder whether such a scheme will be attractive to employees. If people are offered shares, they take them, whether they are worth anything or not. However, I wonder whether people will want to subscribe to such an odd arrangement. More detail is necessary and I suspect that the Government will have to give more thought to the arrangements. The strategic partner and the new company might be a success, but the means by which the 5 per cent. shareholding is offered to employees is not logical. It is not a regime that would inspire confidence in share purchasers. Today might not be the time to press that matter, as we shall return to it on Report. Where companies are not listed—the listing may not even be of the strategic partner, which may be a private company—the Government must think more clearly about how to make employees confident about purchasing shares and about the future of the business. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 313, in page 32, line 11, leave out from second `share' to end of line 13 and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`of a class which by virtue of the rights attaching to it under the articles of association of the company concerned can be held only by the Crown (within the meaning given it in this Chapter), of which there may be only one share in issue from time to time and which gives the holder of that share— 
<P>
(a) the right to prevent any alteration to those articles of association; 
<P>
(b) the right to prevent any winding up of the company concerned; 
<P>
(c) the right to prevent a transfer of other securities in the transferee on grounds of national security; 
<P>
(d) the right to prevent certain other events specified in the articles of association; and

(e) the right to be converted, wholly or in part, into shares in the ordinary share capital of the transferee, such conversion to be conditional upon the making of an offer to the public of such ordinary shares and the acceptance of an application for admission to the Official List (within the meaning of Part IV of the Financial Services Act 1986).'.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 314, in page 32, line 18, at end insert— 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5A) The rights accorded to the Crown by the special share under this section shall not be subject to any limitation that may be imposed through the European Communities Act 1972 as amended.'.

<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
This group of amendments deals, fundamentally, with the special share. Amendment No. 313 would set out, in principle, the rights attached to the special share, as the Minister intended in the articles of association. I appreciate that the drafting of the amendment may not be fully comprehensive, but I want to discuss why the rights of special share are not set out in the Bill. When I put that question to the Minister in relation to the articles of association, he skated over the issue. While the articles of association may be amended by a simple resolution of the company, the statute can be amended only by Parliament, notwithstanding the thoroughly unsatisfactory short-cut procedure provided by the Henry VIII clause in subsection (7). 
<P>
<H5>12 noon </H5>
</P>
<P>
In the amendment, we set out 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(a) the right to prevent any alteration to those articles of association;
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) the right to prevent any winding up of the company concerned;
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) the right to prevent a transfer of other securities in the transferee on grounds of national security;''—
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
a matter that we discussed earlier— 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(d) the right to prevent certain other events specified in the articles of association; and
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(e) the right to be converted, wholly or in part, into shares in the ordinary share capital of the transferee, such conversion to be conditional upon the making of an offer to the public of such ordinary shares and the acceptance of an application for admission to the Official list''—
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
meaning that that paragraph provides a contingency arrangement in the event of flotation. 
<P>
Why cannot the Minister give this assurance? He has already tabled an assurance for which we did not ask, to trammel up some of the consequences of the public-private partnership that he feels are slipping beyond his grasp. This would be an assurance in which Labour Members could invest hope for a continuation of that relationship between a company and the Government known as a public-private partnership. 
<P>
Amendment No. 314 deals with the possibility of the rights accorded to the Crown by the special share being eroded by the consequences of our membership of the European Union. The Minister dismissively referred to that as me indulging in my European fantasy. I do not take offence at that sort of abuse, but I expect a more intellectual and erudite approach to such a serious question. I have no doubt that the Minister has been extensively briefed on it. For example, when the Government were privatising the port of Belfast, The Daily Telegraph on 24 December 1999 stated that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Government has abandoned its plans to retain `a traditional golden share' in the proposed £100 million Port of Belfast flotation for fear of upsetting Brussels.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
The article went on to describe how the European Commission had issued a reasoned opinion last July, outlining its attitude towards golden shares. I believe that that document is IP99/582, issued by the Commission on 28 July. In it, the Commission considered that certain provisions introducing the privatisation of the British Airports Authority were 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``incompatible with Community law on the free movement of capital.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Lo and behold. The Committee is now drawn inexorably into the realms of what the Minister calls my ``European fantasy''. 
<P>
I shall describe what is in the Commission's opinion. It sets out the legal basis for its view that special share provisions are incompatible with European Community law. I hope that Labour Members will take note of this opinion, because they will be hoodwinked by their Ministers unless we have some serious and comprehensive answers. 
<P>
The premise of the opinion is the importance of intra-EU investment, which the Commission reports has increased enormously. It says 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``some Member States have felt it necessary to introduce several measures in order to monitor, and in some cases control, this important development.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Intra-EU investment is regarded by the Commission as fundamental to the single market. The free movement of capital is one of the fundamental freedoms. I do not suppose for a moment that the Minister is introducing this golden share intentionally to frustrate the free movement of capital, but the European Commission will consider any obstacles to the free movement of capital to be a frustration of this fundamental freedom. The paper specifically refers to such golden share arrangements which 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``have been introduced more recently in the context of privatisation programmes undertaken over the last few years by some Member States. Since such measures could generate restrictions on free circulation at the cross-border level, they may raise compatibility problems with EU legislation, in particular, with Articles 73b and 52 of the Treaty concerning the freedom of capital movements and the right of establishment, and hinder the functioning of the Single Market.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
The paper sets out its arguments and explains that the treaty provision provides that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``all restrictions on the movement of capital between Member States shall be prohibited.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
The Commission says: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``This means that all restrictions, both those of a discriminatory (i.e. applied only to other EU investors) and those of a non-discriminatory character (i.e. applied to nationals and to other EU investors alike) are not allowed.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
That applies to the acquisition of domestic securities and direct investment, so it applies directly to the PPP that we are considering. 
<P>
The paper also explains that it is a question not simply of free movement of capital but of freedom of establishment. I regard that as stretching the meaning of the freedom of establishment, but what is important is not whether we agree with the Commission's determination but whether the court is likely to agree with its determination. There is every evidence that the court will accept the determination that reflects the broad consensus of the Commission and a majority of the member states. In that case, we will find that we are on weak ground. 
<P>
The paper provides exceptions to the general rules mentioned in this opinion that allow member states to introduce restrictions. They are described as, first, 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``activities which, in the Member State concerned, are connected, even occasionally, with the exercise of official authority.''  
<P>
</UL></FONT>That refers to article 55. British Airports Authority is clearly connected with the exercise of official authority: airports are statutory undertakings, as are water companies and ports. Yet, the Commissioners made it clear that they do not think that the golden share arrangements in BAA and in ports are compatible with European Community law. If that is the Minister's belief, why does he think that article 55 applies in this case? 
<P>
The Commission makes it clear that public policy, public security or public health are not grounds for the special share. It says: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``according to European Court of Justice jurisprudence, these exceptions have to be understood in a narrow sense (as opposed to an extensive one) and exclude any interpretation based on economic considerations''.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Therefore, one cannot use any economic argument in favour of the Government exercising the powers under the golden share. For example, we cannot say that we would like it to be a British company, because ownership of the company cannot be restricted on economic grounds. That is an unsatisfactory part of the arrangement. It means that if a company is owned by the state, that is not regarded as a restriction on the free movement of capital, but if a company has previously been owned by the state, and the Government then seek to restrict ownership of that company on the grounds of reciprocity—there is no provision, for example, or a British company to buy French air traffic control because French air traffic control is owned by the state—we do not have reciprocal arrangements between the two member states. Reciprocity has never been a principle that is respected under European Community law and we cannot therefore expect any defence in that respect. 
<P>
The paper explains that article 73d(1) 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``permits Member States `to take all requisite measures to prevent infringements of national law and regulations, in particular in the field of taxation and the prudential supervision of financial institutions, or to lay down procedures for the declaration of capital movements for purposes of administrative or statistical information, or to take measures which are justified on grounds of public policy or public security'.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
It goes on to state: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``all these exceptions shall not constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on the free movement of capital.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
The paper explains that it is all about proportionality. 
<P>
Whatever the Government's view may be, this area is justiciable by the European Court of Justice and the extent to which the provisions of the golden share may be exercised may be challenged under European Community law. The paper points out that article 223 allows 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Member States to take measures they consider necessary for the protection of the essential interest of their security which are connected with the defence sector.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
It continues: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``However, the Court of Justice pointed out that article 223 covers only exceptional and clearly defined cases.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
If we try to use the provisions of the golden share to protect a general national security interest, we will find that we cannot exercise a power on a general basis in that way. Inherent in the treaty is a general proviso covering all measures that are taken for reasons of public security. 
<P>
I should summarise and explain the conditions with which the Government are confronted. This is a serious challenge to the whole basis of the Government's assurances to the House and to the Committee about how they will maintain their influence over NATS. 
<P>
The paper goes on to state that: ``several of these measures''—that is, the golden share measures cited in the paper— 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``are coupled with so-called `national interest' considerations as a basic criterion for their use. Although `national interest' considerations are often linked to theoretically non-discriminatory measures such as the granting of authorisation, this criterion does not appear to be sufficiently transparent and could, thereby, introduce an element of discrimination against foreign investors as well as legal uncertainty.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
It continues: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Under these circumstances, the Commission could not accept that the `national interest' concept as a criterion could, in itself, be used as a legal cover for the measures mentioned above.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
The only measures that are allowed are 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``permitted in so far as they are based on a set of objective and stable criteria which have been made public and can be justified on imperative requirements in the general interest''—
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
not the national interest, but the general interest. We have already discussed the fiction that there is a general European or public interest. 
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
The Minister must explain the circumstances in which he believes that he will be able to exercise the golden share arrangement and be immune to challenge under European Community law. If he cannot do so adequately, he should agree to amendment No. 314. That would give the Secretary of State the immunity that he will need to make the clause's provisions operative. If the Secretary of State does not have such powers, subsection (5) might require him to exercise his power to issue a consent that requires the approval 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``by resolution of each House of Parliament.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
As the Minister said, that is a serious safeguard, but what would happen if one of the Houses of Parliament declined to give such approval? We should be in something of a crisis. The Government's advice is that Parliament is legally required to give its consent under European Community law, but Parliament might not do so. In that case, there would be a stand-off or a conflict between two legal systems: that of the European Community and the British legal system. Why is the Minister creating the possibility for such conflict? Why do we not make it clear at the outset that the Minister's and Parliament's determinations are supreme and unchallengeable? 
<P>
Amendment No. 370, which is in the same vein as amendment No. 313, states that, in the event of a flotation under clause 54, or during a post-flotation period, the rights of the special share will still apply. 
<P>
The amendments are designed to strengthen the assurances that Ministers say that they will give to Parliament. I believe, and the Commission made it clear that it believes, that the assurances that Ministers may be tempted to give to Parliament will be false and cannot be delivered. I have in my hand an opinion that clearly sets out the restrictions that will be placed on Ministers who attempt to exercise any powers in relation to the special share. I shall give it to the Minister if he has not seen it. The opinion makes it clear that we are not in the realms of European fantasy; we face the prospect of a collision between the wants of Ministers and a democratically elected Government and what the European Community decides should be the case. How does the Minister intend to get out of that one?

<P>

<B>Dr. Strang:</B> I am sure that all Committee members agree that we are dealing with an important clause. It is valuable to explore the powers that are associated with the special share and the Government's views of the role of that share. There is much ignorance about special shares—people do not usually appreciate that they are narrowly defined and, in the main, enacted through a company's articles of association. Certain provisions in the articles of association cannot be changed without the prior written consent of the special shareholder. That is the situation in this context. It is useful to refer to them as special rather than as golden shares. That phrase has contributed to a misunderstanding of their influence and an at times exaggerated idea of their role. Of course, many companies have a special share. In this country, some 20 companies—including Cable and Wireless, Stena Sealink Line, British Aerospace, VSEL, Rolls-Royce, National Power and PowerGen—are currently the subject of a Government special share. 
<P>
The draft articles of association have been circulated and we are grateful for that, because it is important that we have a clear understanding of what they envisage. My hon. Friend the Minister mentioned paragraph 11 of the articles, but paragraph 10.3 is also of great importance. It states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The written consent of the Special Shareholder is also required before certain events can take place. This is so even if these articles suggest otherwise. This restriction applies to the following events:
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (A) the Company creating, issuing, purchasing, redeeming or repaying any of its shares or reducing or reorganising its share capital or any rights to it in any way;
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (B) the Company altering the voting rights of any of its shares; and
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (C) the removal of any director appointed by a Crown representative.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
My hon. Friend the Minister referred to a stalemate between the Government and the strategic partner as a circumstance in which one might consider flotation. Does he not agree that it is very unlikely that such a stalemate would arise, because paragraph 10.3 would enable the Government to have their way in such matters? 
<P>
When a private strategic partner gets involved, it goes in with its eyes open. Does my hon. Friend think that, in the light of the articles of association, it would be extremely unlikely that the hiatus to which he referred would occur? As the hon. Member for North Essex said, that would radically change the partially privatised NATS. 
<P>
I wrote to the Treasury some months ago on the very important question of the European Union in the context of the British Airports Authority. In his reply of 25 January, my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury said: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Commission issued a Reasoned Opinion last July arguing that the Government's Special share in BAA plc is held contrary to EC law, as being a barrier to the free movement of capital and the right of establishment. The Government has issued its defence. We believe that the Government is entitled under EC law to own Special shares in companies . . . However, I can confirm, in answer to one of your queries, that there is a derogation in the EC Treaty which would enable a Special share to be held on the grounds of public security.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
We should be grateful to the hon. Member for North Essex for the information with which he has provided us today. Are the Government maintaining that it is possible under European Union legislation to maintain a special share in a company? If not, will the Government argue for the maintenance of the special share in the new NATS on the grounds of public security? What the hon. Gentleman said on that point was interesting, and no doubt the Minister will comment on it when he replies. 
<P>
If the argument about whether we can retain the special share concerns public security, that is an important matter. I would argue that there is a bigger public security issue in relation to NATS than in relation to the British Airports Authority, but I add quickly that there are public security issues surrounding airports such as Heathrow and Gatwick. What is the position vis-a-vis the European Community? I would adduce the public security argument in relation to being allowed to maintain the special share. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I do not wish to make a long contribution, because my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex made an eloquent case, and I look forward to the Minister's answer on the important points that he raised. No doubt an argument is taking place in Europe with the Commission on the basis of the free movement of capital and the reduction of many of these special shares. As the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh said, there is certainly a dispute over BAD's special share. As we all know, our special shares are necessary and everybody else's are probably trade protection. However, this is an important aspect, because one major reassurance that the Government have given is that the special share is a final protection, and hon. Members on both sides of the Committee must be concerned if it is swept away. 
<P>
Subsection (4) says: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``which gives the shareholder the right to prevent certain events''.
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
When the Minister replies, will he say something about the certain events and give some examples of what they would be? We have discussed in previous debates the fact that the Government have not ruled out a foreign company as the strategic partner. We want a little more detail on the way in which the Government see that aspect operating. 
<P>
I am sure that the Minister will have the port of Belfast example thrown at him throughout the remaining stages of the Bill. These are important issues and I look forward to hearing his reply. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I echo the comments of my two hon. Friends: an important issue is at stake here. A most interesting article in December in The Daily Telegraph on the City pages said: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The EC issued `a reasoned opinion' in July that the golden share in BAA was `incompatible with Community law on the free movement of capital'.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
It could not be clearer. The only let-out that I can see from the most interesting information that my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex gave us was the possible ground of national security. Is that the let-out? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> It was explicitly not national security. The opinion is clear on that point. It says: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Under these circumstances, the Commission could not accept that the `national interest' concept as a criterion could, in itself, be used as a legal cover.''
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
What it deals with is public security, and public security, in European Community law, recognises no national dimension. As part of the extinguishment of national identity and national interest it substitutes for public security what we would call national security. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> That was a most helpful intervention. In that case I do not see what the legal grounds would be in European law for this provision not being a clear breach of the rules on the free movement of capital. 
<P>
We know that the Labour Members think that there is perhaps an obsession with European matters here. [Laughter.] They always laugh. It is riveting. This debate could not happen in other European countries; this pretence that laws made in another place do not have the deepest and most penetrating impact on our everyday lives—another place being the Commission, where the directives are cooked up, and the Treaty of Rome is extended by various measures. 
<P>
<B>Tony Clarke </B>(Northampton, South): I am amazed by the hon. Gentleman's contribution. Earlier, he mentioned flying machines, and now he is discussing debates that we may or may not have in parts of the European Union. In future, we may be able to get in our flying machines and hold our debates in whichever part of the world we wish. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> The hon. Gentleman mumbled his concluding comments. Will he repeat them? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> Surely the day will come when we can get in our own flying machines and hold debates in whichever part of the world we wish. 
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Perhaps my comments will be recorded by Excalibur and go down on my record. I read at the weekend that all Conservative Members are marked by a Labour Member, who is supposed to make notes in preparation for the next election. If anyone is marking me, I am sure that it is the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape), who is this morning wearing a splendid yellow tie. I am sure that the image-makers would approve of it. 
<P>
This debate would not take place in Germany or France, where there is approval for the establishment of European law in many areas of daily activity—[Interruption.] I do not see why that should be the object of laughter. Such laws have been enacted, and our laws could be overruled. A ruling in July stated that the golden share was incompatible with Community law on the free movement of capital. The Minister must respond to that. 
<P>
What are ``certain events'', who defines them and who objects to them? The phrase pops up in the draft articles of association in article 10.3. Is there a mechanism for appeal? A party could be injured by a certain interpretation of the phrase and by the associated use of the golden share. Would there be legal recourse against the Government for inflicting commercial damage on another organisation because the phrase had been interpreted in such a manner as to hurt that organisation? We need to discuss that matter in much greater detail. Will commercial events and a business's proceedings be involved? All of those matters are vague, and the Government should give us a more detailed explanation. 
<P>
The main purpose of this debate is to examine the discussions that the Minister must have had with European officials and the Commission about interpretation of European law in relation to this vital issue.

<P>

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Amendments Nos. 313 and 370 would place in the Bill the precise rights that would attach to the special share, and amendment No. 314 would prevent a successful challenge to the special share under European law. Before I respond in detail to the amendments, it might be helpful if I gave an outline of the strategic partnership agreement, as I undertook to do. It might have been useful to have done so earlier, but I felt that it was easier if Committee members absorbed explanations in bite-sized chunks rather than in one enormous block. I also hope to clarify the safeguards to which I have repeatedly referred. 
<P>
I issue the usual caveat that the strategic partnership agreement that Committee members have seen is only a draft and remains subject to further amendment both as a result of the development of Government policy and as a result of negotiations with potential strategic partners. The Agreement is intended to be entered into by the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions and whoever is selected to be the private sector partner in the NATS PPP. Those parties are described in the agreement as the Crown shareholder and the strategic partner, and I shall refer to them as such throughout. I shall endeavour to follow the order of the agreement as much as possible to avoid confusing members of the Committee. 
<P>
The substantive terms of the agreement will not become effective until a number of conditions have been fulfilled. It is not yet possible to determine precisely what those conditions will be, but they are likely to include completion of the sale of part of NATS to the strategic partner and merger clearance from the European Commission or the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. 
<P>
The agreement specifies a number of actions which may not be taken by NATS without, in some cases, the approval of the strategic partner and the Crown shareholder and, in other cases, the approval of the directors appointed by the strategic partner and the Crown shareholder. To that extent, the strategic partnership agreement reinforces and interrelates with the safeguards that are referred to in the articles as ``certain events'', and were mentioned by the hon. Members for Poole and for North Shropshire. Those events are those that are subsequently listed in the articles—that is, the range of activities covered by the special share. 
<P>
Actions that require the approval of the strategic partner and the Crown shareholder include a material change in the nature of NATS' business. Actions that require the approval of the directors appointed by the strategic partner and the Crown shareholder include the raising of loans and the acquisition or disposal of material assets. 
<P>
This may be a suitable point at which to explain why there are numerous references in the draft agreement to NATS and its subsidiaries, expressed as the ``Company'' and its ``Affiliates''. That is to reflect the intention that pre-PPP, the existing business of NATS will be separated into those activities that are to be regulated as monopoly business and those that are not, because they will remain contestable and will therefore be in a separate subsidiary company. The licence will be issued to the subsidiary to which the activities to be regulated have been transferred. When I refer to NATS I am therefore referring to NATS and the two proposed subsidiaries. 
<P>
In a similar vein, there are a number of references in the draft agreement to private sector shareholders in the plural. Because that kind of reference can easily be confused, I stress that it is not intended to suggest that there will be more than one strategic partner from the outset, but is merely intended to provide a degree of flexibility in case that is considered appropriate at a later stage. Therefore, although the agreement refers consistently to ``private sector shareholders'', I shall refer merely to the strategic partner. 
<P>
Whenever an agreement specifies, as this one does, actions that require the unanimous approval of both parties before they can be taken, there must be a process covering circumstances in which unanimous approval cannot be achieved. That process normally involves a period of negotiation backed up by a termination event that is designed to act as a spur to resolution. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh pointed out, given the amount of detail that is specified in the strategic partnership agreement and the articles, any strategic partner will come to the table in clear knowledge of the Government's expectations and what it will be expected to do. Therefore, there should not be any risk of confusion leading to difficulties between the parties at a future stage. However, even the best partnerships sometimes run into difficulty, and it is prudent and right that safeguards should be in place. They are there to guard against possibilities, not because we envisage such a course of action being followed. 
<P>
In the case of the agreement, the spur to a resolution of differences is the prospect of flotation. Accordingly, if agreement cannot be reached on one of the actions that NATS may not take without the joint approval of the strategic partner and the Crown shareholder or the directors whom they have appointed, and a process of negotiation has failed to resolve the dispute, there is a requirement for the strategic partner and the Crown shareholder to obtain an opinion from an investment bank as to whether a flotation of NATS would be feasible. If the opinion is favourable, the flotation must be implemented unless the strategic partner and the Crown shareholder agree an alternative approach to resolve the impasse. I repeat that the inclusion of provision for flotation in those circumstances is intended to be unattractive and to act as a spur to finding an alternative solution to the problem. In addition, no flotation may take place until the new Scottish centre has been completed and is fully operational, which means that the strategic partner is tied in until at least 2006. 
<P>
I now turn to the provisions of the agreement that relate to the management and control of NATS, post-PPP. The strategic partner is required to appoint a majority of the board of NATS. Its appointment of executive directors is subject to the unanimous prior consent of the directors appointed by the Crown shareholder, while the appointment of non-executive directors is subject to prior consultation. The strategic partner is entitled to appoint the chairman of NATS. The Crown shareholder is also permitted to appoint a number of directors, although all his appointees will be non-executive and will be known as partnership directors. Partnership directors are to be appointed for a fixed term and may not be removed before the end of that term, other than in certain specified circumstances—for example, resignation, sickness or disqualification. 
<P>
The partnership directors will be obliged to act in accordance with a mission statement set out in a schedule to the agreement. That mission statement identifies the functions of the partnership directors and makes it clear that their primary areas of responsibility are the protection of the value of the Crown shareholder's investment in NATS, and the preservation of NATS' independent identity. 
<P>
Voting control of NATS is conferred on the strategic partner. That will be achieved by restricting the voting rights attaching to the shares held by the Crown shareholder, so that the strategic partner will always be in a position to ensure that ordinary resolutions—that is, shareholder resolutions requiring only a simple majority—are passed. Similarly, day-to-day management control of NATS will be conferred on the executive directors appointed by the strategic partner. I should point out, however, that the control rights given to the strategic partner will not override the need to obtain joint approval in the circumstances that I have already mentioned. 
<P>
On other management issues, one of the executive directors appointed by the strategic partner is to be given responsibility for safety matters, while a safety review committee will also be formed. That committee will be chaired by one of the partnership directors. Similarly, the strategic partner will ensure that the business of NATS is conducted with due regard for the rights of employees. 
<P>
In addition, the Crown shareholder is to form a stakeholder council comprising representatives of parties with an interest in NATS' regulated services and in airport air traffic control services. NATS will be obliged to consult the stakeholder council and the board of NATS will be obliged to consider the minutes of its meetings at its subsequent board meeting. 
<P>
Although not yet drafted in full, the agreement will contain an unequivocal statement of the Government's commitment to the two-centre strategy. The clause that will set that out is being developed in conjunction with NATS and Bechtel Ltd., the project manager for the new Scottish centre. The clause will be finalised when all relevant information is available, and will impose an obligation on the strategic partner in respect of the completion and continued operation of the new en-route centre and the new Scottish centre. I hope that all hon. Members will welcome that provision. 
<P>
As Members of the Committee will be aware, one of the primary motivations for the PPP is to free NATS from restrictive Government financial controls. The agreement therefore, contains a number of provisions relating to its future financing. The first of these is that NATS' total borrowings will not be permitted to exceed a specified level; that level has yet to be determined, as I made clear in response to a question from the hon. Member for North Essex. Both the strategic partner and the Crown shareholder will be obliged to provide funding to NATS to the extent that such funding is required to be provided by them in accordance with an agreed business plan. 
<P>
In relation to other funding requirements, the strategic partner will be obliged to ensure that NATS uses reasonable endeavours to satisfy them by means of third-party borrowing. If NATS is unsuccessful in obtaining third-party borrowing, the strategic partner may request permission for NATS to meet the funding requirement through an issue of shares.  
<P>
The Crown shareholder may give or refuse permission at his discretion. There is no intention that permission will be granted for an issue of shares that reduces the Crown shareholder's holding, and the agreement acknowledges that. We considered that thoroughly in an earlier debate. In any event, it is intended that such permission cannot be given without parliamentary approval where the effect would be to reduce the percentage holding below 25 per cent. The agreement also contains a number of provisions regulating transfers of shares in NATS. If either the strategic partner or the Crown shareholder wishes to dispose of any shares, it must first offer them to the other. The recipient may insist that the price to be paid should be determined by an independent expert. 
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
All that, however, is subject to the overriding factor that the strategic partner may not make such an offer without the prior consent of the Crown shareholder, which the Crown shareholder will not be able to give without parliamentary approval. That will be reflected in the Government amendment to clause 49, which has already been discussed.

<P>

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> That means that either party has to offer shares to the other. What happens to the 5 per cent. owned by the employees? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> It is envisaged that those shares are held by the employee and overseen by the trust, to which I referred earlier. The hon. Gentleman raised doubts about whether the trust could act effectively as a market for such shares. We heard that point, and, although I do not necessarily accept it, I have certainly reflected on it, and will continue to do so. The framework is separate, and it is not envisaged that the shareholding held by employees should fall within the remit of the strategic partnership agreement, which governs the relationship between the two principal parties—the Government and the strategic partner. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I do not know whether it would be more appropriate to debate this point later. Given that the Minister mentioned the strategic partnership agreement, however, will he tell me who is responsible for hiring and firing the chairman and chief executive of the company? That is what determines who controls the company. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. We are in difficulty because the strategic partnership is covered by, and will be heavily debated in relation to, amendment No. 394. I recognise that the Minister is trying to provide an overview, which is probably beneficial to the Committee. However, I would not want to go more deeply into the strategic partnership at this stage. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. If we deal with the strategic partnership agreement now, as it is relevant to the special share, will that not inhibit the later debate on the subsequent amendment? 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman has been in the Committee long enough to know that the same debate can be held only once, not twice, under my chairmanship. In so far as it is appropriate for the Committee to have information that facilitates the broader debate, I am willing to accommodate that. However, I am not prepared to go over the same ground twice. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I shall respond quickly to the hon. Gentleman's question, and proceed immediately to avoid difficulty. The board of directors will appoint the chairman and chief executive. The hon. Gentleman will know, from what I have already said, that the strategic partner will have a majority on that board. However, there are safeguards for the Crown shareholder, as I have described. The strategic partner will have day-to-day management control of the company, but will be subject to a raft of safeguards to ensure that its operation is compatible with the Government's objectives. The strategic partnership agreement, the special share, the framework in the articles and the framework in legislation provide the necessary safeguards. 
<P>
The agreement also contains a number of provisions regulating the transfer of shares. All that is subject to the overriding factor that the strategic partner may not make such an offer without the prior consent of the Crown shareholder. The Crown shareholder will not be able to do so without parliamentary approval. In any event, no transfer of shares may be made before completion of the new Scottish centre. Provision is also made for the flotation of NATS following a proposal made by the strategic partner or the Crown shareholder. No proposal may be made without the consent of the Crown shareholder. For reasons that I have given, the Crown shareholder will not be able to take part in any such flotation without parliamentary approval. This provision is also subject to the caveat that no flotation may take place before completion of the new Scottish centre. There is no intention whatsoever that a flotation of NATS should occur, but circumstances change, and it would be foolish to deny ourselves or the strategic partner this option. 
<P>
The agreement deals with circumstances where the strategic partner defaults. If that happens, the strategic partner will be obliged to offer to transfer its shares in NATS to the Crown shareholder if the Crown shareholder requires it to do so. Examples of default include an unauthorised disposal of shares by the strategic partner and a material breach of the agreement. Of course, it is unlikely that the Crown shareholder would accept an offer to preserve the classification of NATS to the private sector, but the Crown shareholder would be entitled to find a third party to acquire the strategic partner's shares and take over its role. 
<P>
Having set out the background, which I hope has proved helpful, I return to amendments Nos. 313 and 370, which list the rights that the Opposition want statutorily entrenched in the special share. The Government see no reason explicitly to include special share rights in the legislation; as all Committee members will have noted during the previous debate, they are entrenched in the articles of association. As I have said, once implemented, the relevant parts of the articles of association cannot be changed without an affirmative resolution of both Houses of Parliament, so a more than adequate safeguard already exists. 
<P>
The first right that the Opposition want to entrench is a right for the holder of the special share to prevent any alteration to NATS' articles of association. Committee members will recall that a similar right is included in the draft articles of association, but it is restricted to specific articles, which is an important difference. One example is article 11, which sets out the proposed 15 per cent. limitation on individual shareholdings in NATS. It is right and proper that there are safeguards to prevent any alteration to such an article. 
<P>
As the clause is currently framed, the Secretary of State cannot consent to amending any of the articles to which I have referred without the approval of both Houses of Parliament. However, other articles can be amended in the ordinary way without the approval of both Houses. The amendment appears to require the approval of both Houses of Parliament for any change to NATS' articles of association. Were it to be accepted, routine changes to relatively trivial items in the articles could be subject to parliamentary approval. That cannot be sensible. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> When I moved the amendment, I said that the drafting is not as material as the principle, and the Minister is making a fairly trivial point. If the articles of association are in draft form, the Bill cannot specify which parts should be subject to such a restriction. The Minister should explain why key provisions in the articles of association that relate to the special share are not in the Bill. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I have already explained that they are entrenched in the articles and cannot be changed, except with the consent of both Houses of Parliament. As I have said, those provisions are crucial and must be notified to the special shareholder before any proposed change can take place; that is the safeguard. However, if we are considering a matter such as a minor change in response to a new Companies Act requirement or the latest thinking on corporate governance, it would be absurd if that had to go back for approval by both Houses of Parliament. That is why the whole framework has been devised so that the items that are crucially important and should not be changed are specified as such, whereas the rest of the articles are not subject to that safeguard. The hon. Member for North Essex would like that to be on the face of the Bill, but it becomes far more complex and difficult if everything of this nature is put on the face of the Bill. We are satisfied that the safeguard exists, because the articles have to be observed and no change can be agreed without a positive resolution of both Houses of Parliament. I do not, therefore, accept that the point is trivial; it is a very important point. It is about proper arrangements for governance that focus on the important issues that must remain immutable, while allowing flexibility for other items to be changed as appropriate. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Perhaps we can clear up this matter before One o'clock—whether there is a general inclusion or it is particular to the articles of association. Why not have certain articles of association—differently worded—in the Bill so that they are clear in statute. As the hon. Gentleman surely knows, statute law would override any muddle in the articles of association that might occur in future. We have been dealing with hypothetical situations like flotations and a multiplicity of licences and a multiplicity of partners. Why not deal with the possibility that the articles of association themselves might become deficient in respect of crucial rights? Why should the statutory provision depend upon the drafting of the articles of association? It seems to me to be topsy-turvy. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I fail to understand the hon. Gentleman's concern, given that it is absolutely axiomatic that for any change to be made in any of the specified articles, the consent of both Houses of Parliament is required. If an order from the Secretary of State were all that was required, the hon. Gentleman's argument might have some force. However, it is not. As is made crystal clear in the legislation, the consent of both Houses on an affirmative resolution is required for any change. That gives the safeguard that the hon. Gentleman seems to be seeking—that parliamentary approval is necessary before any change can be contemplated. I do not believe that it is the intention of Conservative Members that every amendment to NATS' articles should be subject to parliamentary approval, so I hope that they will accept that we have got the right balance and that our approach is sensible and practical. 
<P>
The second right that Conservatives want to be statutorily entrenched in the special share provisions is a right to prevent any winding up of NATS. Protection against that is already incorporated in the draft strategic partnership agreement. Accordingly, the right does not require repetition on the face of the Bill. It is worth adding that the primary national interest in that context is to prevent a winding up of NATS' regulated business. As members of the Committee will recall, the issue is already addressed through the special administration regime set out in clauses 26 to 33 which contain further safeguards. 
<P>
Next, Conservative Members opposite want the special shareholder to be able to prevent a transfer of securities in NATS other than the special share on the grounds of national security. The first point to consider is when such a right might be of effect. During the currency of the PPP, there will be a strategic partnership agreement in force which, as the Committee will have seen from the draft, will require the consent of the Secretary of State for each and every transfer of shares in NATS. The Secretary of State may give or refuse his consent for any reason and it is not necessarily limited to grounds of national security. It seems, therefore, that the right proposed by the Opposition would be of use only following a flotation of NATS. 
<P>
The Committee will be aware from previous sittings that the Government have no intention of proceeding with such a flotation. However, even if a flotation were permitted, the articles of association would contain a 15 per cent. limitation on individual shareholdings. That limitation would prevent anyone other than the Crown from obtaining an influential stake in NATS. In addition, NATS would remain subject to licence obligations which require notification of substantial acquisitions of shares and which permit licence revocation and, in certain circumstances, implementation of the special administration regime if the relevant acquirer is considered undesirable on national security grounds. 
<P>
What I have just described is a comprehensive and coherent set of protections for NATS and, accordingly, the right proposed by the Opposition would appear to be unnecessary. I do not intend to deal with paragraph (d) of the amendment, as it seems to add little or nothing to subsection (4). The Opposition want the special share to be capable of being converted into ordinary shares in NATS—
