<P>
Question proposed [this day], That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr. Ian McCartney):</B> Good afternoon, Mrs. Dunwoody. Before we broke for lunch, I was about to talk about enforcement notices and how an investigation would take place. I shall also discuss the role of the enforcement officer and the rights of the employer under investigation, how the enforcement officer will seek information about the complaint or allegations about non-payment or under-payment, and what will happen after that. Finally, I want to refer to the roles of the employer and enforcement officer when an enforcement notice has been issued.
<P>
I said that I would not take interventions from hon. Members. In case you think I am being unduly harsh, Mrs. Dunwoody, there was a significant and wide-ranging debate under Mr. Atkinson, during which there were large numbers of questions and comments. I intend to address them in my speech.
<P>
I note, however, that the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) has not participated in the debate so far. I am not sure whether he will try to catch your eye, Mrs. Dunwoody, but if he wants to intervene on a point of substance, I shall take an intervention from him. I do not think I can be fairer than that.
<P>
Opposition Members tried to steer the debate away from the principle of the clause. It ensures that low-paid workers and those who are vulnerable and lack the capacity to seek advocacy rights on their own will be able to do so. The clause enables an enforcement officer to take fuller action if an employer fails to comply with an enforcement notice. He may bring a case to an industrial tribunal or a civil court to recover the difference between the national minimum wage and what has been paid to the worker covered by the enforcement notice. The fact that the agency is bringing such a case does not deny the individual the right to bring his own case.
<P>
At this point I shall deal with the issue of double jeopardy, which was raised by several Opposition Members, including the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow). I disagree with them that an employer would be taken to court by an individual and, simultaneously or subsequently, by the agency. That would not happen in practice. The agency is unlikely to take up a case that an individual is already pursuing. Even if it did, the employer would be able to alert the court authorities, which may proceed with only one case at a time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): Will the Minister give way on that specific point?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> No. I said clearly that I would not give way.
<P>
Alongside the issue of double jeopardy is that of duplication and whether the process would be a burden, particularly to small and medium-sized employers. I made clear my belief that it is impossible in practice for the agency and an employee to use the same court process to seek redress. That is also true of the tribunal although in theory it could happen that an employee claimed for an unauthorised reduction of wages, it would not happen in practice. Again, the employer would be alerted at an early stage when sent the papers to the potential for tribunal or court proceedings.
<P>
The officer responsible for those cases is part of the case management and ensures that parallel proceedings are not instituted. That is an important aspect. I am not telling members of the Committee that I hope that that happens it is essential that the officials in the process deal with case management in a proper, professional way. If proceedings are initiated, we will ensure that there is no such risk of parallel proceedings.
<P>
A number of other issues were raised by Opposition Members. I was asked how quickly a worker must bring a claim for an enforcement notice. On civil claims, the normal period is six years in England and five in Scotland. For industrial tribunals, the period is three months.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) asked what the cost would be to the public and whether the Treasury would receive money to offset costs. The answer to the second question is yes; clause 19(5) states:
"Any penalty under this section shall be recoverable as a civil debt by an officer acting on behalf of the Secretary of State."<P>

<P>
That will go into the general pot. How much the measure will cost will depend on the number of cases of latent underpayment, and that will depend on the level at which the minimum wage is set. So costs are recoverable, but how much will depend on the level set for the minimum wage and the number of employers who risk acting outside the law in their unwillingness to meet their obligations. I hope that it will be very few. It was the same with wages councils. There was a very high compliance rate, and I suspect that the same will be true for the national minimum wage.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry also asked about conciliation, and clause 27 deals specifically with conciliation. It provides for conciliation to be provided by conciliation officers appointed by the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service for national minimum wage-related matters coming before industrial tribunals. Employees complaining about access to records are covered by clause 11. Individuals' enforcement of the right to a minimum wage is covered by clauses 15 and 16. An enforcement agency acting on behalf of a worker and enforcing the right to a minimum wage is covered by clause 18(1)(a). Enforcement of the right not to suffer any detriment is covered by clause 22. That is all part of the process of ensuring that conciliation measures are available for workers to secure the minimum wage or, when a dispute arises, that such measures can be introduced to try to resolve it.
<P>
Some of the amendments that we have voted on today and in previous sittings, which Opposition Members opposed, take account of the Employment Rights (Dispute Resolution) Bill, sponsored by Lord Archer of Sandwell, which should finish its passage through the House of Lords tomorrow. It will for the first time secure new conciliation services from ACAS. The Bill not only has all-party support but is supported by the social partners on ACAS the Confederation of British Industry, the Trades Union Congress and the Institute of Directors. It will provide new access to conciliation a cheaper way for employers and employees to resolve disputes in the work place. That is a welcome proposal that I hope will be supported. I hope also that future amendments taking account of those provisions will receive all-party support and that we will not be forced to take time out to vote on amendments which simply change the words "industrial tribunal" to "employment tribunal".
<P>
A number of other questions were raised regarding the precedent for officials acting on behalf of the Secretary of State to take action on behalf of other parties. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) raised this point. The Wages Act 1986 and other wages council legislation enabled enforcement officers to recover underpayments of wages council rates on behalf of employees in criminal proceedings against employers.
<P>
The process in the Bill would be familiar to previous Administrations, both Conservative and Labour, and similar measures introduced by the last Conservative Government in the Wages Act 1986 were consolidated by the Employment Rights Act 1996. This is not a new proposal employers have worked with it for a long period. They understand the proposal and the reasons for enabling low-paid workers to recover moneys owing to them.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) raised the issue of free legal advice and the cost implications of employees having the right to take enforcement officers along to a hearing. The enforcement officer, not the employee, will decide whether to take a case forward, and he must be satisfied that the complaint is legitimate and that the employer has been involved in the consideration of the evidence during the investigation before coming to a conclusion about enforcement. Only at that point would the enforcement officer, having decided that there was a case to answer, start the process of enforcement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> The Minister has made a point of substance. Perhaps I might raise it with him. I hope that I might have your indulgence, Mrs. Dunwoody; it might take a little 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman always has my indulgence. What does he have in mind?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I had it in mind to explain myself, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
Clause 18(1)(c) makes it clear that the officer may act in civil proceedings on behalf of a worker. That would bring an agent of government into the contractual relationship between employer and worker. An employer might contract someone to work for 25 or 30 hours. If the contract did not provide for additional hours worked and was paid on salary basis, not per hour, what would happen 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman may well throw himself on my mercy, but it does not stretch very far. Interventions should be brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I absolutely agree, Mrs. Dunwoody. I was trying to sustain the point to avoid making a speech.
<P>
If the worker regularly worked for longer than the 25 contracted hours, then subsequently claimed the minimum wage for more hours, which contract the explicit one or the implied would the officer enforce?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> That is not as difficult a question as it seems. Contracts of employment can be written, verbal, implied or, as in such a case, based on custom and practice. If an employer has had an arrangement over time with an employee to carry out a task, he is required by the Bill to pay the national minimum wage. It is as simple as that.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> For which 25 or 30 hours?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> He has to pay the minimum wage for the period for which the employee is contracted to work. If 30 hours are worked, the minimum wage has to be paid for 30 hours. There is no difficulty.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We cannot keep having sedentary interventions.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I hope that my response has helped out the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I shall answer a question put to me by the hon. Gentleman previously. He asked about class actions and the basis on which an officer would choose between an industrial tribunal and a civil court. In most cases it will probably be more convenient to take proceedings in a tribunal, but that will be impractical if the time limit of three months has expired. A tribunal may hear a case after that time limit has expired, but there must be genuine mitigating circumstances for that to happen. It is reasonable to assume that officials will follow the tribunal route in most instances.
<P>
The tribunals will not be class actions. If a number of similar cases arise, the aim is to ensure that employers will be assisted, in terms of time, cost and effort, by dealing with those cases as one. That is not unusual: tribunals can already consolidate cases of a similar nature and come to a general conclusion in this case, about whether the minimum wage has been underpaid.
<P>
The overwhelming majority of low-paid workers are under-represented and have little opportunity to act as their own advocates in the work place. The clause will ensure that they have access to resources so that their legal rights can be enforced. The only employers who need be worried are those who wilfully refuse to pay the minimum wage in full.
<P>
The enforcement procedures are clear. Employers have options available at every stage from the moment that a complaint is made. They can challenge evidence of underpayment through the appeals procedure: if they lose an appeal, they can make good the payment; if they decide not to make that good, an enforcement procedure will be applied, against which they can appeal.
<P>
The process does not undermine employers' ability to operate effectively or appropriately. However, employers who do not comply with the law will face enforcement procedures, because the Government intend to ensure that the minimum wage will be applied effectively. People who are not represented by a trade union, or whose workplace is not recognised for the purposes of negotiation, will not suffer from a lack of representation in their efforts to secure the minimum wage.
<P>
If a vote is forced, I urge my hon. Friends to maintain the clause as part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> This has been a constructive debate. The Minister, despite the way in which he began, attempted to answer some of our questions, and his clarifications were useful.
<P>
I am sure that the Committee wants to make progress, so there is only one matter that I wish to raise. I spoke about timing specifically about the gap between the alleged failure to comply with the national minimum wage in a pay reference period and the initiation of the enforcement procedure, the legal process and, ultimately, the penalty notice. There is also the separate matter of offences, which is dealt with in a later clause.
<P>
It would be helpful if the Department could circulate a note of information detailing the operational limits that normally would apply. I should also be grateful for clarification of whether there is specific provision for maximum limits a matter that I should have raised also in connection with the clause dealing with the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service, but which slipped my mind then. Our concern is entirely genuine. We do not want matters to remain open after an unreasonable period of time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> With regard to going to tribunals within three months, an employer might well say on the first day on which he is confronted with the evidence, "Yes, I have underpaid. Let's resolve this matter." The period between the point of a complaint and its resolution will vary. In most instances, underpayment is likely to be the result of a genuine error rather than a deliberate attempt to underpay. Given that genuine errors will be resolved quickly, I expect that delays will be due to either a genuine mistake or a dispute between the employer and the enforcement officer I concede that that could happen.
<P>
I said earlier that an employment appeal tribunal was the likely route, where cases should be dealt with within three months. People will try to deal with matters within that time, but it cannot always be guaranteed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I note that the Minister of State is not prepared to commit himself to a specific timetable. On the other hand, the exchanges have been useful, as was the Minister's response to my brief intervention that there would, in effect, be no enforcement action through the tribunal without the employer having been contacted. I take it that the Minister's silence implies assent to that.
<P>
Despite those assurances, we feel that there is still the potential though we hope not the certainty for injustice to individual employers in circumstances that it is difficult to specify at the moment. With those reservations, we cannot support the clause.
<P>

<P>
Clause 18, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 19</center></H4>
<H4><center>Financial penalty for non-compliance</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 158, in page 13, line 16, leave out subsection (5) and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(5) A financial penalty under this section 
<P>
(a) in England and Wales, shall be recoverable, if a county court so orders, by execution issued from the county court or otherwise as if it were payable under an order of that court;
<P>
(b) in Scotland, may be enforced in the same manner as an extract registered decree arbitral bearing a warrant for execution issued by the sheriff court of any sheriffdom in Scotland;
<P>
(c) in Northern Ireland, shall be recoverable, if the county court so orders, as if it were payable under an order of that court.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would simplify the procedure for the recovery of a financial penalty and make that process more effective. It is in everyone's interest employers and employees to ensure that the national minimum wage is implemented effectively. The amendment forms part of an effective enforcement strategy. It will also ease the burden on the courts by simplifying the process of recovery of the penalty if an employer fails to pay it.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Only one person should be standing in the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I was talking about the process for recovering the penalty if the employer fails to pay it. The amendment removes the requirement to take separate proceedings to recover the debt. I shall briefly clarify how the amendment fits into the Bill.
<P>
In clause 19(5) the financial penalty is recoverable as a civil debt by the enforcement officer. In practice, that would require the officer to prove the debt in civil proceedings before a court. Such proceedings, even at that late stage, could be open to challenge by the employer, which would require the debt to be proved by means of full proceedings before a court. That could potentially drag out proceedings and cause extra work for the courts. The amendment makes the debt recoverable, as if it were payable under a court order in England and Wales or the equivalent in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Recovery under a court order means that there is no need to prove the debt.
<P>
We want to ensure that delay does not pay. We also want to ensure that the Bill provides sufficient balance for employers to be able to appeal. I believe that the Bill already provides every opportunity for the reasonable employer to exercise his or her rights. First, the employer may appeal against the enforcement notice under clause 17(5). Secondly, the employer may appeal against the penalty notice under clause 20, in each case to the employment tribunal. When an appeal is pending, either against the enforcement notice or the penalty notice, the financial penalty cannot be enforced.
<P>
I believe that those appeal mechanisms provide a final and reasonable opportunity for employers to have their say. The amendment simply provides for a more effective, efficient means of implementing a penalty once the appeals process has been exhausted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> As you rightly said earlier, Mrs. Dunwoody, it is the responsibility of hon. Members whether they are in Committee at any one moment. I apologise for having to leave briefly in order to execute an urgent matter of business during the Minister's explanation. It is germane to one of the points that I want to make. I encourage Ministers in the Department of Trade and Industry to adopt the same practice as the Treasury, with which I have recently had dealings, in considering its legislation that is, to publish explanatory notes, not only on the clauses, for which we have already commended the Minister, but on Government amendments. Had I had that explanation and, given that for contingent reasons I had to leave the Committee Room, I would have been a little clearer and better rounded on the Minister's points.
<P>
The issue is not in doubt between us as to whether there should be a proper enforcement procedure. Of course that is sensible. It should be as cost-effective as possible. However, from what I gleaned of the Minister's answer, I am a little unhappy about this matter.
<P>
From what the Minister said earlier today, he still sees the whole business as, not a zero-sum game, but a one-way option. He rightly says that workers' rights should be safeguarded. In order to safeguard them, there must be an enforcement procedure. There is the parallel procedure regarding offences which we shall consider in due course. Despite our efforts and despite the assurances that we sought and, to some extent, received from the Minister, we feel that, although perhaps that is not his intention, the playing field is still not completely level. From what the Minister has said, and in the absence of explanatory notes beforehand, this still tilts the playing field a bit more away from the employer, even when that should not be the case.
<P>
We hold no brief for the indifferent or incompetent employer, nor do we wish further expense on the enforcement officer in securing a fair outcome, but given our concerns, we should give the matter an opportunity for more extended consideration, perhaps at another stage. At this stage, it is necessary to put down a marker by opposing the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am most grateful to you, Mrs. Dunwoody I was awaiting the eloquent contribution of one of my hon. Friends, but was disappointed on this occasion. Nevertheless, I am happy to speak in support of my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry, as I always do.
<P>
I have a concern about clause 19. Let me start, however, by proving my credentials once again. Much of clause 19 is eminently reasonable. There is manifestly no point in having a law unless there is a means by which to enforce it. There is no purpose in having means of enforcement if no decision is made about a penalty. Clearly, that penalty must be enforceable it must be possible to get the money from the person who is judged to have offended against the law. I do not object to that. I would even go so far as to say although I will probably be considered immensely moderate for doing so that the size of the penalty is not unreasonable.
<P>
I have had some discussions with colleagues on the point, although it would not be proper to say what their content was.
<P>
<B>Mr. Huw Edwards </B>(Monmouth): Go on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Despite the entreaties of the hon. Member for Monmouth (Mr. Edwards) and, to a lesser extent, of the Minister, I will not do so.
<P>
As I understand it, the burden in subsection (3) is fairly modest. If the financial penalty is calculated at a rate equal to twice the hourly amount of the national minimum wage for each worker to whom failure to comply relates, that does not amount to a huge sum. To elucidate the issue for the benefit of hon. Members particularly Labour Back Benchers who might not be planning to contribute to the debate, some of whom might not have read the Bill let us be clear about what the penalty constitutes. For the sake of argument, let us suppose that the rate of the national minimum wage is œ4 an hour. As I understand it, the Government would be proposing a penalty of œ8 a day for each worker to whom the failure to comply related, for each day on which that failure continued.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that, in the light of the relative modesty of the penalties that might be imposed, there is all the more reason for the Government to ensure that the penalty is fully recoverable in a proper legal form?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am happy to agree with my hon. Friend, who is invariably correct. He has most helpfully drawn my attention to the important subject of the Government amendment to clause 19, and I am most grateful to him. He is entirely right on that point. I had planned to dilate on several other matters, but I shall resist the temptation. I see the value of my hon. Friend's suggestion, but I reiterate my central point that the size of the proposed penalty is by no means unreasonable. I have many matters about which I wish to complain in relation to this clause and others, but you will be pleased to know, Mrs. Dunwoody, that the size of penalty is not one of them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I cannot add much to what I have said. If the hon. Member for Buckingham supports open government, perhaps we could have an open Opposition and the hon. Gentleman could tell us what discussions he has had with his hon. Friends.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry spoke about explanatory notes, but that was an excuse because he knows that the amendment is effective and commends itself to the Committee. As a former Minister, he knows that it is impossible to provide additional explanatory notes for every amendment. Perhaps we can do a deal: if he provides me with notes to explain his amendments, I might be able to provide him with similar notes on mine. The serious point is that I will assist members of the Committee with additional information when I can, and I have already done so. It is not feasible to give a commitment to provide an explanatory note for every amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I shall be corrected if I am wrong, but I think that my hon. Friend is asking only that the Government should supply notes on Government amendments, as they may be included in the Bill and subsequently interpreted in legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I have nothing to add. I have made it clear where I stand and have tried to help the Committee as much as I can. I ask the Committee to approve the amendment.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendment No. 40.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> These are technical drafting amendments which bring clause 19(7)(c) into line with clause 19(7)(a), and clause 20(6)(b) into line with clause 20(6)(a).
<P>
Some hon. Members have expressed unease about the appeals process, but these amendments are merely technical and underline the Government's commitment to fair enforcement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Briefly, although there is no problem with the substance of the amendment, I find the Government's procedure unfortunate, for the reasons deployed in relation to the earlier Government amendments to the clause. Other Departments, including the Treasury, have been able to circulate in good time explanatory notes on Government amendments when they arise.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. A discussion of notes on clauses is not considered terribly relevant. The provision of such notes is a service by Ministers. To inject a personal note, that service never used to be available and some of us actually had to read the clauses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am obliged, Mrs. Dunwoody. It is interesting how, over the past few years thanks to the efforts of all parties progress has been made in that regard. Even so, that progress has not been evident in connection with this amendment, and I advise my hon. Friends not to support it.

Friend the Member for Buckingham even if they have not all found much resonance there is a good deal of consensus about the structure of the clause. The Opposition wish to make reasonable progress. I do not, therefore, wish to detain the Committee. However, I wish to make one or two small points to which I hope the Minister will respond.
<P>
The first was implicit in a response that the Minister gave earlier, and concerns his view of the structure of penalty notices. I think, and I hope that he will confirm my view, that he saw the processes involved with penalty notices and with formal enforcement notices as an exception. He said that most employers who at any time failed to comply with the national minimum wage, whether for reasons of area or interpretation, would be prepared to take action if the matter were drawn to their attention. He said that his experience of wages councils had shown that most did pay up, or come quietly.
<P>
I have asked another Department about the operation of the agricultural wages order, which remains in force. The Committee will consider the relevant clauses in due course. My experience as a farmer and as a Minister tells me that the Minister's view is correct in relation to that arrangement.
<P>
In such circumstances, not many penalty notices will be issued, not many penalties will be levied, and not much money will come from them. I am sure that the Chancellor of the Exchequer metaphorically wags his tail when he looks at subsection (8). For the first time in the Bill, there is potential for Government revenue. If that potential is sensible, the Opposition welcome it.
<P>
Will the Minister give a better idea of the types and amount of cases that he thinks will be relevant, of the way in which he intends to resource the operation and of how much money the policy will pull in? I am sure that he does not want to oversell that aspect of the clause. I cannot believe that the clause would be called what I should imagine is termed as a profit sector in commercial markets. It would be useful to know how much the clause is likely to bring in, if only because such an income would help to recoup some of the costs that will be incurred by other aspects of the enforcement process. My earlier point about costs dealt mainly with costs incurred in court, as compared with the general costs of enforcement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Opposition Members can appreciate the argument that money raised from the penalty should go to a consolidated fund. If the Bill does not provide for interest to be paid on moneys that are owed to employees, or does not ensure that that money reflects inflation, does my hon. Friend agree that it would be unfortunate if the proceeds of the penalty were to go to the Exchequer while the poor employees were denied the excess to which they might have been entitled?
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend is a remarkable exponent of the rights of workers in these matters. He has brought to the Committee's attention an important point of fairness one recognised by the Government in other contexts. There may be certain difficulties, for interest. It would be unfortunate if the Chancellor waxed fat while the worker did not get a fair return. I hope that his point will be acted on.
<P>
Having praised my hon. Friend on one point, I praise him on another. I have one more contribution to make the Minister may come back to it on Report which relates to the scale of the financial penalty. I was momentarily surprised when my hon. Friends said that the scale was modest. I am sure that the arithmetic of my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham was right: if one assumes a national minimum wage of œ4 an hour, the penalty for not keeping to the rules is œ8 a day. There is also an offence structure, which we shall consider later.
<P>
If an employer persistently non-complies I should not use the word "offends", because this is a quasi-civil matter despite an enforcement order and a penalty notice being served and a penalty being set, and several employees are in the class I used the word loosely before and apologise to the Minister for that the penalties could rack up to quite a bit.
<P>
I am attracted to what might be called escalator penalties, with X being paid for the first week and X plus Y for the second. At some point, the hypothetical employer would sharpen his pencil like fun, get the cheque book out and do something.
<P>
The penalty is twice the national minimum wage. I do not object to that in principle. Its application could give rise to some equity. As my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has said, there may be doubts about what parts of complex remuneration packages should be included and whether what is included amounts to the value of the national minimum wage. Not all employers, even genuine ones, will interpret the rules in the same way as the Minister or an enforcement officer.
<P>
Employers, enforcement officers and employees are dealing with hard cases. The Minister has said that he does not want the policy discredited we want to get it right but I am particularly concerned that a remuneration package may be slightly deficient vis-\ga-vis the national minimum wage. Let us say that the national minimum wage was œ4 an hour. A court could conceivably take six years, but a tribunal might adjudicate after three months, that for one pay reference period, the payment from the employer to the employee, who would presumably but not necessarily be under contract of employment, was œ3.99 an hour. I submit to the Minister that that is somewhat different from an employer not trying at all and paying œ2 an hour. For a normal working day of eight hours, an employee's pay might be 8p short, but the employer could face a bill for non-compliance of œ8 a day. He would be in the same position as an employer who was wilfully paying employees œ2 and hour and therefore shortchanging them much more over a day. The Minister should consider the proportionality.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I regret that I did not hear the earlier part of my hon. Friend's speech, but I have followed the latter part carefully. It seems that his point depends on the employer in question making two mistakes first, neglecting, for whatever reason, to pay the extra 8p; and secondly, on receiving an enforcement notice and neglecting to pay the 8p at that point, as well. Is it not after those two omissions that the penalty comes into play?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is absolutely the case, but it is a general principle of law though it is not for me to lecture the Committee on how the law works that the penalty should be proportionate to the offence.
<P>
My substantive point is not that there would not be opportunities to put right the mistake although there might very well be a disagreement as to rights and wrongs in a marginal case but that the penalty to be imposed would not be proportionate to the offence. A deeply delinquent employer who paid his workers 50p an hour would, under the Bill, be subject to exactly the same penalty as someone who was a penny wrong in an argument about the value of some benefit in kind.
<P>
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire that a reasonable employer would have opportunities to rectify what he had done, but disputes might still go through that process and the parallel process of appeal although one is held up until the other is concluded. The employer might say, "I am not paying this because I think I am right." Some employers will do that not because they are wicked, but because they dig in on a principle. They could then suffer a substantial but disproportionate penalty relating to a large number of employees.
<P>
I have two other points of similar strength. First, the daily penalty racks up for each day that the sum is not paid. I want to relate that to the normal worker's pay pattern. The issue is complex and the Minister could argue to the contrary, but given that employees typically work a five-day week, is it fair to add in the weekends to the penalty calculation? I am not talking about truck issues, but some employees' remuneration is not paid entirely by the hour or the day. Surely it is not fair for each day, rather than the normal days of employment, to be subject to a penalty until the matter is resolved and the money paid. There is potential inequity there.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I confess that I had not thought of that interpretation that for each day that elapsed after the employer had first failed to comply which would include holidays, Saturdays and Sundays a penalty would be payable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That may be the case. My concern about that brings me to my third point. Subsection (2)(c) provides, quite properly, that the notice should specify
"the period to which the financial penalty relates".<P>

<P>
What troubles me and may be the source of the confusion that Opposition Members feel is whether we are talking about a pay reference period or a different kind of period. I looked at the definitions clause at the end and there is no defining reference for period. We have elsewhere in clause 1, and in extenso at the beginning of the Bill, a reference to a pay reference period. There is a clash of two concepts here. First, there is the pay reference period which is used for determining whether the national minimum wage is being complied with; and secondly there is, I suspect, a period to which the financial penalty relates. That could be the pay reference period when it was not paid. Alternatively, it could mean for an employer, "If you do not pay this by X date, the taxi meter will start and you will pay a penalty based on twice the hourly rate of the national minimum wage each day, whether it is a normal working day or not."
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that it makes no sense for penalties to be exacted in relation to a pay reference period or part of a pay reference period because an employer should be allowed until the end of any given pay reference period to pay the national minimum wage? To intervene half way through is unfair to the employer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is a valuable confirmation of a point that has concerned us. What may be meant is a pay reference period. A penalty notice would say to an employer, "You have failed to comply over a pay reference period". That period would have had to have concluded because only at that very point could compliance or otherwise be established. The notice would continue, "A financial penalty will start from a certain date. That is when the taxi meter will start running."
<P>
These are small-print issues, but it is important to get them right so that the penalties are levied if necessary we hope that it will not be and when they are levied there should be fairness between different categories of employers and the nature of offences or non-compliance which they have committed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I should like to raise three points about the clause. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry that it is an uncontroversial provision. There must be penalty arrangements for non-compliance.
<P>
My first point is that nowhere do I see a reference to a period of time in which an employer has to comply with the initial notice that is served upon him before he becomes liable to a penalty notice. In the most extreme case, it would be extraordinarily unfair if, for whatever reason, an officer dealing with an employer perhaps because that employer was, or was suspected to be, a habitual offender chose to serve a notice and then immediately served a penalty notice. I am sure that that is not the Minister's intention. The clause would read better if it provided that when an employer had within a period of X weeks or days from the issue of a notice failed to comply with that notice, an officer might issue a penalty notice in those circumstances. That is a simple point of practicality and fairness.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> To follow my hon. Friend's argument, the starting date of the notice should be specified.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank my hon Friend for that intervention. It would be logical for the administrative penalty, as opposed to any compensation which the emplyee might be entitled to receive, to run from the date of issue of a notice either the first notice or the penalty notice. It should not relate to the length of time for which the underpayment had been made. That underpayment may have been inadvertent. If the employee was to be compensated, there would be a clear argument that the compensation should relate to the period for which there had been underpayment.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am sorry to trouble my hon. Friend and the Committee, but I am worried about the use of the word "period" in connection with a notice specifying the starting point from which the taxi meter of a financial penalty will run. What is the point of using the word "period" in that context? Should not such a notice make it clear that, at the end of the enforcement process, an employer who still fails to pay the national minimum hourly rate will have to pay at double that rate for each day that the offence continues?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I confess to being as confused as my hon. Friend over the reference in subsection 2(c) to[Mr. Hammond]
"period". I hope that the Minister will clarify what that word refers to, if not to a pay reference period.
<P>
My second question deals with the circumstances in which a penalty notice could be issued. An enforcement notice is issued if an officer considers that an employer has failed to pay the national minimum wage. A penalty notice is issued if that employer is considered to have failed to comply with the enforcement notice.
<P>
This morning, the Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry did not answer because of time constraints a question that is also pertinent to this clause. If the remuneration being paid is complex if it is made up of cash, benefits in kind and other components that cannot be identified because we have not seen the regulations and if the officer considers that those components do not add up to the national minimum wage and so decides to serve a notice, how can the employer be certain that he has complied with that notice before a tribunal or other forum has determined the definitive value of the remuneration package?
<P>
The only way for the employer to be sure that he had complied and so avoid being issued with a penalty notice under the clause would be to pay a sum in cash equivalent to the national minimum wage.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am trying to follow the hon. Gentleman, but the clause is very specific and deals with the financial penalty for non-compliance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> All I am seeking to establish, Mrs. Dunwoody, is the procedure by which an employer paying a mixed remuneration package who has received an enforcement notice can ensure that he is not liable to a penalty notice 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I understand the hon. Gentleman's point perfectly, but some of those matters have been raised in the Committee before. I simply wish to draw his attention to the fact that this is a stand part debate on clause 19.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank you for that, Mrs. Dunwoody. I merely wanted to raise a genuine problem overlooked by the Under-Secretary this morning. I hope that the Minister of State will clarify the matter.
<P>
Finally, my hon. Friend has already drawn attention to subsection (8), which states that any penalties received will go to the Consolidated Fund. That is a natural and obvious way to proceed, but it has been suggested that those funds could be used to compensate employees who are the victims of underpayment. It is possible that, if penalty receipts are paid into the Consolidated Fund and the Bill does not provide for compensation for underpaid employees, there would be a powerful incentive for those employees to go down the civil route to recover moneys owed to them because they might then be entitled to damages. They might do that rather than go down the administrative recovery route of employment tribunals.

<P>

<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): I have three separate points to make on the clause two relate to subsection (3) and the other to subsection (4). First, I am grateful to the west midlands Low Pay Unit for drawing my attention to a dangerous ambiguity in subsection (3). My hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham has been accused of being a remarkable defender of workers' rights, so those of us who are normally regarded as being on the more socially moderate wing of our party should perhaps seek guidance from institutions such as the west midlands Low Pay Unit.
<P>
The unit complains about the ambiguity of line 12 and asks whether "failure to comply" relates to failure to comply with paying the national minimum wage or with the enforcement notice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the fact that the west midlands Low Pay Unit has just submitted evidence to members of the Committee today causes some concern about our speeding through the Bill at an excessive pace? We must consider the Bill properly and it is important that we have such valuable advice so that we can do so.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are not discussing a timetabling clause. I hope that the hon. Member for Ashford has taken note of the fact that I do not want a repeat of arguments that we have heard before. Furthermore, although it is nice to have briefings, we are not called on to discuss them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Indeed not, and I am grateful for that guidance, Mrs. Dunwoody. I will restrict myself to comments on subsection (3) which arise from the briefing. I referred to the point that the unit made, but I disagree with its conclusion that the penalties should be as big as possible.
<P>
The ambiguity in subsection (3) sends a confusing signal about how onerous the penalty is meant to be for individual businesses. I assume that the Government will want to be seen to extract reasonably fierce penalties from businesses that are accused of avoiding national minimum wage regulations. With that in mind, I am sure that the Minister will want to clear up any ambiguities in subsection (3).
<P>
On the surface, the penalty is designed not to be punitive. If the national minimum wage was œ3.50, and the penalty was set at twice that, it would be œ7, which is not especially punitive. I am sure that the Minister will clarify whether the penalty is meant to be a slap on the wrist a public symbol or a shaming mechanism or a practical hard penalty.
<P>
The other point that I want to make on subsection (3) is that a flat rate might be inappropriate. It would clearly affect businesses of widely different sizes. If the purpose of the penalty is to do more than simply give a public signal of disapproval, and it is designed economically to punish the individual enterprise that has offended, a rate that is based on percentage of turnover or something that relates to the size of the enterprise might be more appropriate. I would be grateful if the Minister could tell us where the provision is meant to lead.
<P>
Under the current terms of subsection (3), the penalty is designed to be cumulative. That means that long-stay offenders who are determined to resist will suffer more, but not much more. If the Minister wants to be harsh, an escalating penalty would be more appropriate.
<P>
Secondly, the Minister is not confident about the rate. Subsection (4) states:
"The Secretary of State may by regulations from time to time amend the multiplier".<P>

<P>
It may have occurred to Ministers that twice the rate may not be appropriate; they may want to move up to three or four times the rate. That provision could be improved. A different structure that did not simply multiply the minimum wage, but allowed the Secretary of State wider discretion, would be better. The system will have to bed down. The number of offenders and the sort and size of business involved will become apparent. In a few years, Ministers may think that a different multiplier might be more effective.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Would not recasting subsections (3) and (4) to make the financial penalty some multiplier of the national minimum wage that was set by regulations have been simpler than allowing the figure of twice the rate to be charged?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is helpful to have these oral redraftings, but members of the Committee are able to table amendments. We should stick to debating the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Indeed, Mrs. Dunwoody, I trust that I will succeed in doing that.
<P>
The ambiguities of enforcement reflect badly on the clause which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry said, is broadly non-controversial. The clause is necessary to the Bill, but it must be tightly drawn there are too many loose parts. The degree of discretion given to enforcement officers to decide whether financial penalties should be imposed does not appear in any specific paragraph, but infuses the clause.
<P>
The Minister should reflect on the fact that whatever guidelines are produced by the body to which enforcement officers will report, variations in the use of powers are likely. That will cause peculiar effects. An enforcement officer in one area might be more willing to impose fines than an officer in a neighbouring district. Businesses would be treated differently possibly unfairly even though they might be on opposite sides of a street or on the same industrial estate.
<P>
One does not yet know how wide an area each enforcement officer will cover. The clause gives officers discretion to impose financial penalties. Given that the minimum wage is national, there should be a national enforcement strategy. If you have different enforcement officers 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Throughout the evening, hon. Members have been asking me for advice. I should be quite clear that I have no enforcement strategy at the moment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful, Mrs. Dunwoody. I will replace "you" with "one".
<P>
Rogue businesses will get to know if one enforcement officer is more lenient softer than another. They may move so that they are less likely to pay the fines. The Government are leaving themselves open not just to regional variations, but to local variations that may lead to companies moving. The clause's three overall problems the ambiguities at the heart of subsection (3), the slightly peculiar degree of toughness that is not specified in the fines as they are outlined, and the fact that too much discretion is given to enforcement officers in imposing the penalties mean that it is seriously defective in many respects.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute. I had wished to make five points, but happily four of them have been dealt with. I shall therefore make only one.
<P>
The issue which I shall raise arises in relation to subsections (6) and (7). As I understand it, subsection (6) and especially subsection (6)(a) ensure that an enforcement notice will continue to have effect even if an appeal has been made. That is right anything else would be unfair to the worker involved. In the great majority of cases, the enforcement notice is correct, whether or not it is appealed against. It should be applied, and the employer should pay the national minimum wage. If not, there would be a perverse incentive to appeal against the notice.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Subsection (6)(b), however, states that an officer may serve a penalty notice when an appeal is being heard and when it has not yet been determined. That seems odd. Surely the whole point of an appeal is for a question to be determined. It would be doubly unjust if an employer who was being asked to pay additional remuneration that he or she felt that an officer had incorrectly calculated were at the same time to receive a penalty notice.
<P>
Subsection (7), however, states that until the appeal is concluded, the penalty notice that has been served will not be enforceable. The purpose of that subsection is to state that if the penalty is not enforceable during the appeal, it will subsequently become enforceable in relation to that period if the appeal fails. As a result, an employer who is served with a penalty notice will not know until the conclusion of the appeal whether that additional penalty is payable.
<P>
That seems unfair. I am sure that employers who have appealed against an enforcement notice should pay while the appeal is heard. I do not believe, however, that they should pay an additional penalty.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Would my hon. Friend's anxiety be dealt with by a provision that would allow the employer to pay the disputed sum into court, to show his or her good faith? Thereafter, if appropriate, the money could be made available as a penalty.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am learning not to offer solutions so much as to comment and ask questions. If I did not do that, you, Mrs. Dunwoody, would rightly ask me why I had not tabled an amendment.
<P>
I do not think that my hon. Friend's suggestion is right. I am suggesting that while an appeal against an enforcement notice is being heard, it would be wrong for the penalty notice to be served at all. It would be better for an appeal to be heard and determined, and for a penalty notice to be issued if the employer is found to have failed to pay the national minimum wage according to the enforcement notice. A provision could be included to state that if an appeal has failed, the penalty could take into account the period during which the appeal has occurred. There is a danger of employers being subject to the time used by bureacracy to determine an appeal's outcome. Considerable sums of money might accrue in potential penalties, whose realisation will depend upon the outcome of the appeal.
<P>
Rather than reaching my hon. Friend's conclusion, I concluded that the sums due to a worker should be paid to him, even though the appeal is pending. The officer should hold off serving a penalty notice in respect of the enforcement notice until the latter has been finally determined. To do so beforehand is to add an unnecessary risk to employers who might be perfectly honest and well-intentioned, but who believe that the enforcement notice is incorrect. A potential injustice lies in the measure. Will the Minister explain, not simply how it works I have tried to do that, although if I was wrong, I am sure he will correct me but the rationale behind the idea that employers should suffer an additional penalty during the appeal period? I see no incentive for employers to go to appeal to avoid a penalty notice if they wanted to avoid a penalty notice, they would pay the enforcement notice and have done. There would then be no question of the penalty accruing.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Would my hon. Friend accept that, in the absence of any mechanism for recovering the money paid if it later turns out that it was not payable, employers might be reluctant to do that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I understand that point, but I do not think that it is right. Recovery of such a debt would remain possible through court proceedings. We discussed that in relation to clause 18 and we do not need to discuss it again. If the Minister is following this, he may be able to help us. I have explained the point of principle, but perhaps the Minister could take us further on the technicalities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> The purpose of the clause is to ensure that delay does not pay for employers, because they will have to pay the money owed to their workers eventually. The longer they take, the bigger the penalty they have to pay.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ashford asked what this meant on the Richter scale of Government intentions. In football rather than geological terms it would be a yellow card, or in rugby league, it would be a sin bin. I think that a yellow card is slightly more difficult to deal with than a sin bin, but it is at that level. It is an indication of a failure to comply with a proposal after a range of procedures, including an appeal process, into which the employer had a full input.
<P>
The hon. Member for Buckingham called this a modest measure. That is a fair description, given that Opposition Members sometimes over-egg the pudding in criticising Government proposals; I did it myself when I was in Opposition. It would ensure an effective way of enforcing a decision going through the appeals procedure.
<P>
The clause simply enables the enforcement officer to levy a financial penalty by issuing a penalty notice when an employer has failed to comply with an enforcement notice. As Opposition Members noted, the penalty is twice the hourly amount of the minimum wage for each worker who is underpaid and each day of non-compliance. The penalty is payable to the Secretary of State, who may change the rate by regulation. I do not think that Opposition Members have commented on this, but the regulations can be changed by the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> It is certainly true that the clause provides for amendment by regulation via, as I understand it, the multiplier. However, it is not clear whether the Government are prepared to consider a higher penalty for those employers who fail to pay for a substantial period. In other words, to refer to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry, is he prepared to consider extracting more from those who delay payment of the fine?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I believe that that is an unnecessary question in the context of this clause, which simply specifies the process by which a financial penalty is levied for non-compliance. The procedure is straightforward, and there is no need to detail some complex aggregate of fines according to whether an employer is bad, very bad or somewhere in between. Nor is there any need to make provision, as one Conservative Member suggested earlier, for an employer who did not comply as a matter of principle and who therefore should not suffer as a result.
<P>
The system is clear, specific and modest and does not need such complexities. The employer is in control. He it is who will decide not to comply or to continue to withhold compliance. Employers will have the clear and certain knowledge that they will be liable to a penalty once the appeals procedure is exhausted and they still do not comply. The proposal is fair and reasonable and should stand.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry raised several matters. First, he asked about the likely number of cases and penalties. That is impossible to estimate. I cannot guess how many employers will decide not to comply with the law or, having gone through the appeals procedure, decide still not to comply. As I said, I expect the number to be insignificant in proportion to the total number of employers.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also asked how much money is likely to be involved. Again, that depends on the level of the minimum wage and on what turns out to be the answer to the first question. The amount is impossible to guess: it would be unfair to the Committee to try.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked whether the penalties will be modest or whether the amounts will rack up. Clause 19(4) provides that the Secretary of State can adjust the penalty by altering the multiplier.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman was worried that the penalty would not be proportional to the offence. However, the offence under discussion is not the original underpayment but the failure to comply with the enforcement notice, so the question of proportionality does not arise. The penalty indicates the employer's failure to comply with the notice.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry also asked whether the words "each day" in clause 19(3) included weekends. My advice is that the answer is yes: "each day" includes Saturday and Sunday. The provision has nothing to do with whether the worker normally works at weekends he or she might, of course. Interestingly, I am nearly tempted offside not literally and to say that a tribunal may decide that the penalty should apply to the employee's normal working week. I shall consider the matter further, even though the intention is clear, for my own benefit. I shall not seek advice even though not seeking advice is dangerous for Ministers but in the past the interpretation has varied. I want to be clear in my own mind about the question before the Bill finishes its passage through the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister is being most helpful. I understand that in strict logic the penalty notice relates to a failure to comply with the enforcement notice, and one might say that the level of non-payment is neither here nor there.
<P>
I am grateful for the Minister's assurances. I urge him to bear in mind that there might be a practical interaction, not least if the employment continues through another pay reference period that has not yet been concluded in which non-payment may also be relevant.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> That is exactly the advice that I have been given. The logic is that it is not a penalty for non-payment, it is a penalty for non-compliance with the process by which the non-payment is made good. That is the logic of what is in the Bill.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Runneymede and Weybridge raised the issue of remuneration that is of a complex nature. If I understood him rightly, he was asking about components other than cash payments, such as bed and breakfast accommodation or board and lodging, and what proportion of the minimum wage might be paid in cash and what proportion might be paid in kind. That seems to be a difficult issue; it is not, for two reasons.
<P>
First, the Low Pay Commission will recommend which components can be included in determining the national minimum wage. I assume again, it is an assumption that that process will necessitate a regulatory regime to ensure that it will not be possible, for instance, for someone to be paid 95 per cent. of the minimum wage in kind, and 5 per cent. in cash. It must be clear to the employee and the employer what the proportions should be.
<P>
Secondly, an employer is required by the Bill to maintain records. Those records will give an employer a fairly good idea of whether he is fulfilling his obligations under the national minimum wage, and they will be critical in dealing with any complaint that an employer is not fulfilling his obligations. I do not see the mixed package payment as preventing the clause being anything other than one that ensures that an employer assists in the process of compliance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Would the Minister not accept that benefits in kind, and other non-cash remuneration, will be complicated and will vary enormously across the country? The regulations cannot prescribe precisely for every case; they will have to lay down general rules for valuing non-cash components. The situation I posited was one in which the dispute about whether or not the minimum wage had been underpaid centred on the valuation of one such component. That was a genuine dispute within the rules laid down by regulations. In such circumstances, how would an employer deal with a notice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I believe that it would be a simple process. A complaint would be made about an employer making an under-payment. The officer would investigate that complaint, and if he found that there was no case to answer, that would be the end of the matter. Alternatively, the officer might seek further evidence, which might also suggest that there was no case to answer. However, were the officer to be mindful that there had been an under-payment, an appeal procedure would be set in motion. The employer would have two alternatives: he could accept the recommendation that he had failed to comply, or he could appeal to an employment tribunal. That tribunal would then decide whether or not the employer had failed to pay the legal minimum remuneration. If not, the employer's appeal would not succeed, at which point he could either comply or fail to comply. At each stage, therefore, it would be up to the employer to take responsibility. Employers would not be disengaged from the process; they would be central to it. Therefore, although the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge raised his point fairly, I suggest to him that it is more than answered by the clause and by the process of the appeals procedure. On that basis, I ask my hon. Friends to support the clause.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 175, in page 13, line 40, leave out "dismiss" and insert "uphold".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 176, in page 13, line 41, leave out "(a)".
<P>
No. 177, in page 13, line 41, leave out "no".
<P>
No. 178, in page 13, line 41, leave out from "notice;" to end of line 43.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The purport of the amendments, which stand in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, is to change the burden of proof from the Government's proposal to a provision that Conservative Members find acceptable. I am sure that the Minister of State and the Minister for Small Firms are aware of the amendments' effects, but I shall inform any Labour Back Benchers who are not familiar with them of the facts.
<P>
Amendment No. 175 would remove the word "dismiss" in reference to appeal and replace it with the word "uphold". Amendments Nos. 176 and 177 would delete "(a)" and the word "no". If those amendments were accepted clause 20(3) would read:
"On an appeal under subsection (1) above, the industrial tribunal shall uphold the appeal unless it is shown that there were grounds for the service of the penalty notice".<P>

<P>
We believe that the Government have gone about matters the wrong way. We have no objection to penalty notices and we do not criticise the intention to ensure that employers comply with those notices. There would be no point in having a national minimum wage unless there were means to ensure that employers complied with it. Our objection is that the clause as it stands is unfair to employers, and the amendments would make it more acceptable and just.
<P>
In the course of our debate on that principle though not specifically on the amendments the Government have argued that the approach is not new. If I remember rightly, it was the Minister for Small Firms who, confronted with our opposition and with an expression of genuine surprise on her face, said, "This has been done before in employment legislation. There is nothing new about it," and she went on to support her thesis by citing legislation that Conservative Governments introduced.
<P>
The Minister will understand why I was not terribly impressed by her argument. We are meant to be debating the National Minimum Wage Bill, not other pieces of legislation. I concede that I was not familiar with the legislation that she prayed in aid but, even if I were that would not matter one jot. Ministers must get used to the fact that Conservative Back Benchers cannot be held responsible for the deeds of previous Governments.
<P>
We object to the clause because quite simply it is unfair. If the Minister's argument is that such unfairness has been previously perpetrated in different circumstances, I am happy to concede that it might have been, but that does not influence me at all. It should not be perpetrated in this case. The presumption of innocence is the essence of English jurisprudence, and our legal system has always operated on that basis. What I wish to know from the Under-Secretary, who in a former guise was a distinguished lawyer, is why she thinks the burden of proof has to shift. I cannot see any practical reason why that should be so.
<P>
If we are to believe that the enforcement officer will be a dedicated public servant who will take his or her responsibilities seriously, go through preliminary investigations, attend the workplace and talk to the employer suspected of failing to comply with the legislation, presumably that officer will be confident or his case by the time he comes to the tribunal. [Interruption.] My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry is creeping around in an elegant fashion, but he has interrupted my flow, although, he will be pleased to know, only momentarily. I am delighted to see his reassuring presence on the Opposition Front Bench.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
As I was saying, it is unfair. If the enforcement officer has gone about his business properly, presumably he is confident that he will win the case. Therefore, he should not be fearful of the prospect of having to prove guilt if I may use that term in this context beyond reasonable doubt. It is the responsibility of the enforcement officer, acting on behalf of the state, to demonstrate beyond peradventure that an employer is guilty of the non-compliance of which he is accused. Yet no, say the Government: the presumption will be that the employer is guilty. It will be for the employer to demonstrate that what is being done to him, including the serving of the penalty notice, is unjustified.
<P>
Therefore the clause tilts the scales against the employer and in favour not just of the employee but of the state. That is a matter of particular concern to me and to my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge because, to all intents and purposes, it will mean two against one. The employee and the enforcement officer acting on his behalf will be one side and the employer, possibly unrepresented, certainly financially unsupported in any representation that he might enjoy, will be on the other. That seems wrong and we simply want to change it. Let us proceed in these cases in accordance with the Government's legislation, but on the basis that those who are bringing the case must prove it beyond all reasonable doubt. That is not the position at the moment, so it is a significant objection to the Government's proposal.
<P>
There are a number of other objections on which I do not intend to dwell while moving the amendment, but there is the problem that the Government have not considered the possibility of premature action by an enforcement officer. It must be conceded that that could happen. Circumstances can readily be envisaged in which an enforcement officer, perhaps inadvertently, takes precipitate action and I should have thought that that should be reflected in the Bill. However, because the overwhelming burden of responsibility is on the employer to prove innocence rather than on the enforcement officer to prove guilt, the employer is again at a disadvantage. To what extent the question of prematurity can be brought into the debate is unclear.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The amendments are precisely and narrowly drawn. If the hon. Gentleman goes wide of the amendment and chooses to present his case in a rounded fashion, I shall bear that in mind later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am most grateful to you, Mrs. Dunwoody, for your entreaty that I should stick to the narrow terms of the amendments.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Forgive me less an entreaty, more an instruction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Oh, Mrs. Dunwoody. The joy of the instruction issued from your point of view is as nothing to my joy upon its receipt. Therefore, of course I intend entirely to comply with it. Perish the thought that I should fail to do so.
<P>
What is the Government's intention? Do they believe that, as a result of the burden of proof being shifted in this way, it will be easier to secure successful actions against employers? If so, that suggests a certain lack of confidence in their case. It follows from that that enforcement officers will be more inclined to bring cases than they would otherwise have been, which could lead to wholly unnecessary expenditure of time and money.
<P>
If enforcement officers had to satisfy a tough test, they would consider carefully whether it was necessary or advisable to proceed. If there is to be a tough test in an industrial tribunal case, the enforcement officer will more carefully consider the desirability of compromise or resolution, which is a compelling argument in itself.
<P>
However, that does not apply to the Bill. There is no discipline, restraint or check on the enforcement officer's appetite to proceed to industrial tribunal and every encouragement on him to do so. He does not have to prove his case beyond reasonable doubt as the presumption in his favour supports the state's position over that of the employer. That is quite wrong.
<P>
If the Government argue that they are not anxious to increase the possibility of success against employers, why does the amendment worry them? What harm is there in using the normal test of English justice? I am nore sure whether the Minister's background is in employment law; if it is, well and good. Can she give me particular reasons [Interruption.] I am addressing the amendment and shall continue to do so Mrs. Dunwoody. If the Minister can cite particular objections to my amendment, I should be pleased to hear them. If there are practical reasons why the requirement to satisfy beyond reasonable doubt is damaging in this context, I should be glad to know what the damage would be.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge and I believe the Bill to be unfair. Other aspects of the clause are not unfair and, before I am accused of digressing the question of motive has been raised several times and I have proved beyond reasonable doubt that my motives are good. Where people are shown to have failed to comply, it is right that the machinery of the state should deal with them.
<P>
However, it would be quite wrong for that machinery to be excessive and unduly burdensome on an employer. That would be unfair and unjust. I am not satisfied by anyone who simply says that the clause aims to achieve a fair and decent outcome. That is no justification. I appeal to the Minister to rest her case, as lawyers often do, on precedent. I am not interested in precedent but in the intellectual, legal and political justification for imposing the burden of proof on the employer rather than satisfying ourselves with a clause that, in keeping with the traditions of English law and justice, requires guilt, or non-compliance, to be proved by the person bringing the case. I rest my case and invite the Committee to support my amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I shall be brief. I want to add one point to what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham. Like him, I am offended by the Bill's burden of proof, but he has addressed that matter.
<P>
An employer who is served with a penalty notice and required to prove his innocence under the Bill will have some difficulty because of the total absence of any[Mr. Hammond]
provisions that give the power to require workers to maintain relevant records. In conjunction with the reversal of the normal burden of proof, that will be distinctly onerous. I have therefore tabled the amendments, which re-reverse, if I may put it that way, the burden of proof. I should be grateful if the Minister would address herself to the difficulties that would face an employer in such circumstances.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sure that the Minister will apply herself to the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham for tabling the amendments. We owe him a debt of gratitude for three reasons. First, he was kind enough or flattering enough to refer to my crawling around the Committee in an elegant fashion. Many people, no doubt, have referred to my crawling, but never in an elegant fashion. You and I, Mrs. Dunwoody, appreciate the importance of flattery.
<P>
Secondly, my hon. Friend's drafting is impeccable in the way that he has conceived the amendments. They bear on the issue of the reversal of the burden of proof and relate to other amendments, including some rather more lamely drafted by myself, to a later clause. I readily accept that those are separate questions that arise on a separate clause. Thirdly, however, he is right to draw attention to the Bill's systematic reversal of the burden of proof.
<P>
My hon. Friends the Members for Buckingham and for Runnymede and Weybridge have expressed anxiety about the likely impact of the Bill on small businesses. I have before me a representation about tribunals from the Federation of Small Businesses.
<P>
In the 1995 figures, of 12,000 cases before tribunals relating to unfair dismissal, the employee was successful in only half 6,000. Logically, therefore, 6,000 were resolved in favour of the employer. That raises two points that are relevant to the amendments. First, the burden of proof is by no means always in favour of the employee. To put it more simply, as, strictly speaking, it is an enforcement issue rather than an employee rights issue, the employer is not always wrong. Secondly, however well intentioned they may be, appeal procedures may occasion the genuine, innocent employer considerable embarrassment. I therefore endorse the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry (Mrs. Barbara Roche):</B> It is important to emphasise that the Bill's proposed procedures for appeal are designed to be fair to both the employer and the employee. I start on a note of agreement with the hon. Member for Daventry. He is absolutely right. Tribunals often do not find in favour of the employee; often the employer is proven to be right in the decision.
<P>
It is important that the legislation is made to be as effective as possible so that it cannot be evaded. I know that the hon. Member for Daventry agrees, as perhaps do other Opposition Members. However, unfortunately, the amendments would make effective enforcement much more difficult. As the hon. Member for Buckingham said, the amendments deal with the question of the burden of proof.
<P>
During their remarks, the hon. Members for Buckingham and for Runnymede and Weybridge gave the impression that, with the clause, the Government were going against the great body of English law, and that their amendments were an attempt to rectify that. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is an appeal process. In every appeal process it is for the appellant to prove his or her case.
<P>

<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>

<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Oh I am so tempted. Who shall I have first. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge perhaps.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> For breakfast perhaps.
<P>
I defer to the Minister's superior knowledge, but while the points she makes about appeals are true, normally an appeal would follow some kind of judicial process which had already proven guilt. The problem here is that guilt is being assumed from day one and the so-called appeal is nothing of the kind. It is a first hearing of the case.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Not at all. The clause is entitled "Appeals against penalty notices". There has been a process before that. When the Committee deliberated earlier it gave powers to the enforcement officer. There is a process before that in which there will probably have been discussions between the employee and the employer. There would have been proceedings taken by the enforcement officer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Just let me finish my sentence. This is an appeal process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The hon. Lady referred to what has transpired before. Will she tell the Committee precisely what is the judicial content of what proceeds the appeal?
<P>
There are all sorts of examples. Governments of any party issue things such as parking notices, and there is then an appeal process which may be judicial in nature. It is not unusual in our system. I was also challenged earlier by the hon. Member for Buckingham to talk about practical examples of why we have this. The hon. Gentleman is seeking to jettison not only the way in which we have dealt with things in the past legally, but also the approach that successive Governments took in this area.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry showed in his remarks about unfair dismissal that there were many cases in which the employer was successful at the industrial tribunal. I thought that the implication in his remarks was that that contrasted with what would happen in these cases.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The point that I was trying to make I apologise if I did not make it entirely clear is that, in contrast to criminal proceedings in a magistrates or a crown court, the number of convictions, and I appreciate that we are talking there about criminal law, would be a much higher proportion of the total number of cases than the 50:50 that applies in industrial tribunals. It would suggest that the employers are at least in the right more often in those tribunal hearings.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's point and it makes my case. I shall use his analogy of industrial tribunals and unfair dismissals as it is a helpful one. Let me say what happens in those cases. First in an unfair dismissal case, it is for the complainant the employee to show that he or she was dismissed. After that first test, the burden of proof shifts to the employer the respondent in the case to show that the dismissal was fair. That is the current position.
<P>
Nobody is saying that the enforcement officer will always be right and that the employer will always be wrong. That is nonsense. The tribunal must judge, and that is why there is an appeals procedure. If the enforcement officer is wrong and there are no grounds for issuing a penalty, it should not be problematic for the employer to demonstrate that providing he has kept the records that he should be keeping. The employer will, or should, know from the records whether he has paid the national minimum wage.
<P>
I have explained to the hon. Member for Buckingham the practical reasons for the provisions. The hon. Gentleman nods his head.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Shakes it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I apologise. I find it difficult to see the difference. However, I accept that it was a shake rather than a nod.
<P>
When one considers the records of past Secretaries of State in the Department, including Mr. Portillo and Lord Tebbit, it is difficult to understand why, given the hon. Gentleman's approach to politics, he wishes to dissociate himself from them.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, but he made a fundamental error that he would wish me to point out. He spoke of a burden that was beyond reasonable doubt. I remind him that that is a criminal standard and that we are talking about civil, not criminal proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> This time the hon. Gentleman is nodding, not shaking, his head.
<P>
The provisions leave the employer ample scope to make his case. I am confident that tribunals will deliver a fair and proper judgment. If the amendment is not withdrawn, I ask the Committee to reject it.

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> It is convenient to discuss these amendments together as they all bear on a single issue, as we move to the section of the Bill that covers the right not to suffer detriment. Opposition Members have no difficulty with the principle of no detriment. The Committee has already debated procedures to secure the rights of workers under a national minimum wage. It would be entirely wrong if those rights were to be nullified by employers, in particular cases although I hope that they would not occur often penalising workers who had the impertinence to take matters to a tribunal, or to involve an enforcement officer. I understand that. We need to find the right balance in the matter, as we have often done in the Committee through our useful debates.
<P>
The Engineering Employers Federation has drawn my attention to potential problems with the clause. The federation thought that claims made by workers in good faith were understandable and proper. However, it also suggested that a claim should be a reasonable claim when viewed objectively, and that is the wording that Conservative Members propose in the amendment. The Committee has had extensive debate about the opinions and the state of mind of enforcement officers, but the only test of a claim made by a worker is that it should be made in good faith. In other words, there is to be no objective test about what the applicant might have in mind. Anyone could enter an objection and say that it was made in good faith. It would be difficult for a tribunal, using the procedures that the Minister set out this morning, to expedite matters and weed out unsuitable cases because it could use only the good-faith test.
<P>
Clause 21 gives workers an almost unlimited right to take action against their employer on the ground that some detriment has been done to them as a result of their attempt to claim payment at the level of the national minimum wage. It does not take great imagination by Members of the Committee to see that that facility could be abused and could cause great difficulty to employers. I do not want to repeat the evidence from the Federation of Small Businesses. However, it might not be easy for many small employers to cope, if they are not sophisticated operations with personnel departments or access to expensive or even cheap legal advice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> There is no such thing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend says from a sedentary position that there is no such thing as cheap legal advice, which is an unfortunate comment. There is perhaps no such thing if the advice concerned is wrong; that may be the right qualification or gloss to his remark.
<P>
Our concern is particularly with small business. The Committee hopes that relations between employees and employers will be good, as they usually are. The Under-Secretary has not tried to deny that. It is true probably overall, whether in large industrial firms whose strengths and weaknesses relate to their scale and the length of their line of communication, or in smaller businesses, where relationships are sometimes unfortunately more intimate. The greater intimacy is unfortunate, of course, where a dispute arises. In such cases it is important that legislation should facilitate resolution of a dispute, if possible by conciliation, or a fair outcome. We are far from satisfied with the balance in the present instance.
<P>
An example of what I mean might arise in a small business in the hotel or catering sector to move from my earlier perspective of the Engineering Employers Federation, which has generally taken a constructive attitude to the practical implementation of the Bill. A smaller, tourist business such as I envisage might employ one or two people beyond the proprietor's immediate family. Employment in that sector, as has been argued in Committee, is often seasonal and short term. Pay is likely to be in the region of the minimum wage target zone. Working well in the tourist industry is not simply a matter of fulfilling the letter of the contract. It is vital to be courteous, efficient and pleasant to customers and guests, even when the guests may be crotchety, difficult or unreasonable. I expect that we could all think of examples, although my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham would not be among them. No clearer example than that of the tourist sector can be found of the aptness of the saying, "The customer is always right."
<P>
Let us suppose that an employer in a business such as I have described were forced by the Bill to increase pay for one of his employees. That would not necessarily be the only difficulty. The employee might prove unsatisfactory; he might be a stroppy waiter, or a slow barman. However, under clause 21 he could claim that he had been disciplined, disadvantaged or dismissed simply for triggering his entitlement to the national minimum wage. The Minister will no doubt say that the question of good faith could be determined in a tribunal. However, the matter would be part of a complex of disaffection. The opportunity in question could be enlisted as a weapon in the dispute.
<P>
If small businesses in the tourist sector my concern, however, is not confined to tourism become afraid or unable to enforce proper standards of staff discipline, standards in the trade could collapse. That would be another of the Bill's inimical effects on employment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the amendment is specifically designed to reinforce the reference to good faith that already appears in the Bill? It would tighten the test required for what would be aneffective injunction against dismissal from the time a worker makes a claim until it was determined.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valuable point.
<P>
The amendments seek to insert an objectivity test into clauses 21, 23 and 24. The burden must be placed on the complainant, not on the accused. That is one of the first principles of justice, and I shall not rehearse the debate that we have just had. In the clause we have just discussed and again in clause 26, it is noticeable that the Government are happy to put in the Bill their readiness to reverse the burden of proof. It is clear that, without an objective test in clauses 21, 23 and 24 on the basis of the claim, the employer is likely to be put in an invidious, if not impossible, position if the provisions are used as a weapon in a dispute.
<P>
I look ahead to clause 23(1) which will make section 104A(2) of the Employment Rights Act 1996 read:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is immaterial...
<P>
(a) whether or not the employee has the right, or
<P>
(b) whether or not the right has been infringed"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
providing a claim has been made in good faith.
<P>
The essence of our case is that good faith is a subjective concept. It is difficult to define, let alone to measure or analyse effectively. That is why the amendments in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) seek to place in the Bill a requirement for an objective test. They also bear on our earlier discussions about casting out frivolous or evidently unfounded allegations that would tie up still more time for a hard-pressed proprietor or self-employed business person with one or two employees.
<P>
There is also the question of tribunal time. If the tribunal cannot sling a case out because there is no objective sign of trouble all that happens is the employee self-certifies that he has a problem we shall face a difficulty. The amendments are designed not to subvert the Bill's intention, but to improve its operation. I commend it to the Committee.
