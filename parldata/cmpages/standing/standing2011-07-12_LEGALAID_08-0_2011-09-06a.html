                  </strong> Welcome back to the Committee, Mr Sheridan. As
I was saying earlier, these would be emergency cases: instances where
the clients have been assessed by the mandatory single gateway within
the last 12 months as requiring face-to-face advice and are seeking
further help from the same face-to-face provider to resolve linked
problems; clients in detention, including prisons, detention centres
and secure hospitals; and children, defined as those under 18. Where an
operator is in any doubt about whether a caller’s problem is
within scope or whether the caller is financially eligible for legal
aid, he or she will be referred to a specialist adviser. Gateway
operators will not offer the callers any advice tailored specifically
to their circumstances, so legal qualifications will not be a
contractual
requirement.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000029">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
the consultation response, we announced that where clients access the
community legal advice helpline through the mandatory single gateway in
those four areas of law, clients who are eligible for legal aid will be
transferred to CLA specialist telephone advisers. That will be subject
to exceptions where face-to-face advice is more appropriate, such as
when clients are in detention, including in secure hospitals. In
addition, both gateway call operators and specialist advisers will
assess the specific needs of all callers case by case, and will, as
appropriate, refer them to a face-to-face advice service if that is
considered necessary. Subject to those exceptions, legal aid specialist
advice in those four areas will be available only by
telephone.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000030">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government have considered carefully the issues raised in the responses
to the consultation paper regarding the provision by telephone of civil
legal aid services. However, it is appropriate that we seek to provide
services in a cost-effective manner that meets clients’
needs.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000031">&#160;</a>

missed something that the Minister said; the break for lunch has left
me slightly out of mind of what he was saying earlier. He has been
clear that gateway operators will not be contractually required to have
legal qualifications, but did he make clear the position in relation to
the specialist legal advisers who will offer telephone advice once
people have passed through the

hon. Lady and the hon. Member for Hammersmith queried how the telephone
service will work. I need to tell them as a starting point that the CLA
helpline is a successful operation. It already handles more than
500,000 calls each year and provides a full casework service at the
level of civil legal help, offering more than 100,000 acts of
assistance each year. It is clear from the remarks made by the hon.

90% of clients who spoke to a

                  </strong> I was saying that more than 90% of clients who
spoke to the CLA specialist adviser said that they would recommend the
service to others. In addition, cases typically cost significantly less
than the equivalent face-to-face service. The hon. Member for Stretford
and Urmston asked about the cost specifically. There should be no net
cost as it is clear that significant savings can be achieved by
increasing both the proportion of applications to legal aid made by
telephone and the proportion of legally aided advice provided by
telephone. She also asked about the qualifications of specialist
telephone advisers. I can tell her that they are required to have the
same level of qualifications as their face-to-face equivalents and a
supervisor would have to be legally qualified. Contracted specialist
telephone advisers are required to meet a higher peer-review standard
than face-to-face advice providers as a
consequence.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000037">&#160;</a>

hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston asked whether the telephone
service is financially viable for providers. Tenders for CLA contracts
attracted a great deal of interest, and there have not been any
instances of CLA providers going into
administration.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000042">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
87 would place a duty on the Lord Chancellor to undertake a further
consultation and a further cost assessment on the use of the telephone
gateway to apply for legal aid services. We have consulted on the
proposals. The Government asked five questions about the CLA helpline
in the consultation paper. Those questions covered the mandatory single
gateway to apply for civil legal aid, receiving legally aided advice by
telephone and paid-for
advice.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000043">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On
7 January this year, the Government published further detail on the CLA
helpline proposals alongside the consultation paper. The document
clarified the fact that the helpline would not be the mandatory single
gateway for emergency cases and set up further information on the
operation of the current CLA helpline. In addition, a revised impact
assessment on the telephone helpline proposals was published with the
Government’s consultation response in June. I can confirm that
we will review whether further consultation is appropriate before
extending the mandatory nature of the helpline 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 296<a class="bkMark" name="Column296">&#160;</a>
                  </div>to other areas of law. There is no need for a statutory duty to conduct
a consultation or to perform a cost
assessment.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000044">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
88 would place a duty on the Lord Chancellor to ensure that provisions
were put in place so that people with specific needs could apply for
civil legal aid advice without using a telephone gateway. The
Government accept that a mandatory single telephone gateway and
mandatory specialist advice by telephone could, in principle, present a
barrier for some people applying for legal aid services. That point was
made by the hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston and the right hon.
Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd. However, we believe that the design of
the existing CLA telephone helpline service and our proposed future
gateway service will ensure that those barriers can be removed
sufficiently for the effective delivery of the required
service.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000045">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Specific
examples of existing adaptations to the CLA service that will continue
to mitigate against barriers include a three-way translation service
for clients with limited or no spoken English or Welsh; a British sign
language service available via webcam, minicom, and Typetalk for deaf
and deafened callers; and, where clients give approval, friends, family
members or other professionals calling the service on their
behalf.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000046">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In addition,
the needs of all callers will be assessed case by case, and, where
appropriate, callers will be referred to a face-to-face advice service.
The key consideration will be whether the client is able to give
instructions and act on the advice given. Where an operator or, in case
of doubt, a specialist telephone adviser believes that a caller is
unable to give or receive legal instruction by telephone, the caller
will be referred to a face-to-face
provider.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000047">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
108 would prevent the Lord Chancellor from insisting that legally aided
services be delivered by telephone, or by some other electronic means,
if an individual eligible for such services requested that they be
delivered by a face-to-face provider. In addition, the amendment would
allow individuals in civil proceedings to select their own legal
representative if representation were required in line with the
provisions made for the selection of a representative in criminal
proceedings.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000048">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
specialist telephone advice hotline will provide a consistent level of
service to all callers, irrespective of where they are located, and it
will be of additional benefit to those who cannot easily access
face-to-face advice, such as those who live in remote areas or those
who have a physical disability. Callers can access the service at a
time and place convenient to them and they can quickly get help. As I
said, the helpline also offers a range of facilities to help people to
access telephone advice.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000049">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government accepted the argument that introducing the mandatory single
gateway in areas of law in which the majority of clients would
ultimately require access to face-to-face advice would be of limited
benefit at this stage. However, we will review implementation of the
mandatory single gateway and mandatory specialist advice over the
telephone for the four areas of law, and we will use the outcome of
that review to determine any expansion of the helpline to other areas
of law in due course.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000050">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston asked about people who have no
access to the phone, but Ofcom data indicate that only 1% of the
population are in that position. In such cases, clients can allow third
parties—family, friends or professionals—to call the
service on their
behalf.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000054">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady also expressed concern about the possibility of deprivation
of client choice. In the four areas to which the gateway applies,
people seeking legally aided advice must access the gateway service,
but they will be given some choice about how to do so. For example,
they can request a call-back through an online request form or by
sending a mobile phone text message to the gateway. Clients with
problems in areas of law that are in scope of legal aid, but where the
gateway does not apply, have the choice of calling the helpline or
contacting a face-to-face provider
direct.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000055">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
108 relates to giving an individual in civil cases the same rights as
those in criminal cases concerning the choice of a legal
representative. In criminal cases, people will be able to select their
own representative, subject to regulations in clause 26, which may
limit choice in the ways referred to in subsection (6). For example,
the right may be restricted to choosing a representative
from a prescribed area only, or of a prescribed description. Choice is
currently limited to those who hold contracts with the Legal Services
Commission. Representation in criminal proceedings will always require
someone to represent an individual in court. Civil advice may not be
related to court proceedings and a representative may not be required.
It is right, therefore, for the Lord Chancellor to decide the most
appropriate type of advice for the individual, and that the provisions
on representatives in criminal proceedings should not
apply.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000056">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Some
low-level criminal cases receive telephone advice only via Criminal
Defence Service Direct at the police station stage. Amendments 109 and
118 would add provision about the choice of provider in clause 15 and
omit subsections (8) to (10) of clause 26. Those provisions in clause
26 relate specifically to an individual’s choice of provider of
criminal legal aid or representation. Amendment 115 is a consequential
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000057">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Our
intention is that in criminal cases, as at the moment, an individual
must select a provider with whom the Lord Chancellor has entered into a
contract or other arrangements. The Government believe that it 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 298<a class="bkMark" name="Column298">&#160;</a>
                  </div>is important that only those providers that have been assessed as having
the necessary capability to deliver legal aid services can be paid
under the legal aid scheme. As currently under section 15 of the Access
to Justice Act 1999, clause 26 enables particular restrictions to be
placed on an individual’s ability to select a representative for
representation for the purposes of criminal proceedings. One of those
restrictions is dealt with in clause 26(8) to (10). It would allow the
Lord Chancellor by regulation to require an individual to choose a new
representative in prescribed circumstances. The current power to impose
such a restriction is in section 15(5) and (6) of the 1999
Act. The circumstances in which an individual is required to choose a
new representative for representation for the purposes of criminal
proceedings are intended to be limited. The provisions are not intended
to require a change of representative, unless there are sound policy
reasons for doing
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000058">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
might assist the Committee if I provide an example. In the past, the
Criminal Defence Service (Very High Cost Cases) Regulations 2008 have
required an individual to choose a new representative. The regulations
became necessary when a very high cost case panel was set up by the LSC
to provide representation in very high cost cases. If an
individual’s representative was not a member of that panel, the
individual was required to choose a representative who was a panel
member.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000059">&#160;</a>

response, because I respect the argument that telephone advice and,
potentially, a telephone gateway have an important place in the range
of services offered. As the Minister went on, however, it was
increasingly clear that the service will be insufficient to meet the
needs of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged. Indeed, his remarks
were complacent on ensuring that those needs will be adequately met. I
accept that there are circumstances in which telephone access can work
well, but it is wrong for the Bill to leave that as the only route to
advice for those who are coming forward with cases in the four
categories of law
proposed.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000061">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
hope that the Minister will reassure us that calls will be fully
recorded. We need to understand the nature of that recording: will it
be a live recording, so that we can hear what the adviser and the
caller said to each other, or will the records merely be on paper
which, unless they are transcriptions, will inevitably contain an
element of interpretation that could also be open to
challenge?<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000062">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> It is a pleasure to see you chairing the
Committee again, Mr Sheridan, after the recess. I know from your
comments at the beginning of the first sitting of debate that you
favour brevity, and I shall be brief in discussing the amendments. We
are informed—<em>[</em>
                  <em>Interruption.</em>

good that I did not hear that.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000093">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We have
pointed out that we are concerned about quality, given the amount of
money and resources being taken out of the legal aid system. It is
therefore important to discuss amendments to the clause,
which deals with standards. Briefly, it is more
imperative than ever for the Lord Chancellor to set high
standards, and we therefore think that there should be mandatory,
rather than optional, provision, as set out in amendment 3.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000094">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 5
is a probing amendment. The provision could be read in two ways, and I
hope that the Minister will clarify how it should be read. If the
purpose of subsection (5) is to establish a level playing field, we
have no problem with it; if it is to create a postcode lottery, we have
many problems with it. There will clearly be difficulties when cuts of
this order go through, and there will be different difficulties in
different parts of the country.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000095">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The level of
need and complexity of cases in urban areas and constituencies such as
mine, is different, perhaps, from that in other parts of the country
that are more monoglot, with less social need, fewer social problems
and less mobility and diversity of population. However, I am well aware
that there is equal concern among hon. Members who represent rural
areas about the prospect that they might become advice deserts, where
there is less provision, with long distances to travel, and where there
is less specialism and expertise, and in some cases no service at
all.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000096">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Perhaps the
Government want, notwithstanding the Minister’s earlier
complacent comments, to deal with each constituency or local authority
area on the basis of what is required to ensure that there is a proper
standard or degree of provision of advice services in an area, and we
would support that. However, there is an ambiguity, which suggests
that, as in other areas of Government policy, we may be moving towards
local choice and a situation in which whoever has the most money and
the loudest voice gets the best deal. That is something that we would
not support. I shall say no more about that now, and if the Minister
wants to respond on that point it would be a
delight.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000097">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
do not want to pre-empt what my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield
will say on her slightly more interesting amendment, save to make one
or two points. Fees are a thorny subject, and they have been
caricatured somewhat unfairly in parts of the press, no doubt with
encouragement from the Government and their press officers, as being
about fat cat lawyers. Some of us know—some of us might not
appreciate the point—that legal aid lawyers on the whole are not
fat cats, and that when they and their representative associations
speak, they do so on behalf of their clients and the people whom they
represent. I met the new chair of the Criminal Bar Association
yesterday, who tells me that the number of people in criminal legal aid
pupillages—those seeking to do legal aid work—has gone
down by about 50% over the past two
years.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000098">&#160;</a>

                  </span> I am a registered
pupil master—a trainee supervisor. The hon. Gentleman makes a
proper point about the decline in criminal legal aid pupillages, but
that has been going on for about five or six years, because of the
progressive cuts to criminal legal aid that the previous Government
initiated and revelled in, as evidenced by the shadow Justice
Secretary’s remarks when the Lord Chancellor announced the Green
Paper.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000099">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> If that is the hon. Gentleman’s best
point, I wonder what regard he would give to it if he were sitting and
that point was made before him. If he is saying that the decline is
because there were cuts right up until the end of the previous
Administration—I accept that there were, and I will not shy away
from the issue of fees—that draws more attention to the fact
that there will be a further cut
now.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000100">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government have characterised the hit that legal aid
practitioners—both criminal and civil—are being asked to
take as taking their fair share, by putting it alongside the public
sector pay freeze and other cuts in that sector. Yet, the hon.
Gentleman’s point is that they have had real terms cuts in
relatively recent history and that now there will be additional ones. I
therefore put 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 301<a class="bkMark" name="Column301">&#160;</a>

much as he wants, but let us deal with the proposals in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000101">&#160;</a>

Therefore, the hon. Gentleman’s original point about pupil

Government have brought in, but to cuts under the previous
Administration.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000102">&#160;</a>

mouth. My point is that we take the situation as it is at the moment.
The Government have said, I think—the Minister might or might
not share this view—that they believe that some contraction in
the legal profession is appropriate. At what point does that stop? At
what point does it become necessary to look at the overall provision in
that
way?<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000103">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I hope that the Minister will supply those
figures, and that we will deal with objective facts rather than with
rumour and innuendo, which is, I feel, how the Government have
conducted this, through the press. They are at liberty to do that, but
it means that they will be taken considerably less seriously when they
try to make their points. I hope that the Minister accepts that, and
that he accepts that the legal profession wishes to have a coherent
system with high standards. I hope that those issues are put before
personal gain in many cases, and that the Government will also
objectively want to see
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000105">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_ParaIndent">As
it has been explained to me, the recent consultation on fees was not a
happy one. It was a brief consultation in August, and there was a large
number of responses that the Government did not appear to take
seriously, seeming to have just gone through the motions. As I have
said, I do not want to trespass on what my hon. Friend the Member for
Makerfield is going to say, but amendment 70 relates to consultation.
It does not address absolute levels of fees, or what is right and
wrong. It simply states that there should be proper consultation which
should be written into the Bill, and that, where there is a clear
opinion in the profession, due note should be
taken.</p>

sufficient quality to provide a sufficient level of service. It is
necessary to have qualified providers and to ensure that we are not
constantly levelling down because the levels of remuneration available
attract only those who are qualified at a very early level. We are
fortunate in this country that barristers and solicitors at all levels
undertake publicly funded work. They may undertake it as a mix, but one
can certainly not say, as one can say in other
jurisdictions—whether they are prosecutors or defenders, in
civil or criminal work—that one is getting a lower standard of
service from publicly 
<div class="columnNumber">

               <p class="tabbed">That safety
net was provided by section 25 of the Access to Justice Act 1999, to
which the right hon. Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd referred, and is
repealed by schedule 5 of the Bill. We will no longer have that, so it
is more important than ever to ensure that standards are preserved. The
amendments ask the Government to ensure that that happens. One way in
which that will happen is to ensure that, in collaboration and in
co-operation with the professions, fees are set at an appropriate
level. That will ensure a consistent, high and universally available
standard of legal representation, be it publicly funded or
not.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000107">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Amendment 70 would mean that, before making
changes to remuneration, the Lord Chancellor was obliged to discuss the
changes with the Law Society and the General Council of the Bar. Most
importantly, it would ensure that the regulations keep in mind the need
to maintain a sufficient body of competent providers. Significant fee
cuts, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith said, would create a
climate in which legal aid work becomes the domain of the inexperienced
legal professional, regardless of the complexity of the
issues and the importance of the interests at stake.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000108">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">All legal aid
providers, both solicitors and not for profit, have a break-even point
and a point where services break down. If fees for providers continue
to be arbitrarily reduced, they could back out. There is already a
shortage of legal aid providers in many areas, creating advice deserts
that we have heard about from my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford
and Urmston. They may opt to continue with less supervision, less
experienced and qualified staff, and drive down costs further. Legal
aid work has to be of a consistently high standard equivalent to
privately funded work, or else we cannot guarantee equality of justice.
It cannot be ensured by using less experienced staff if they are
expected to carry out complex work beyond their experience and without
adequate levels of supervision and training. People with complex cases,
unusual cases and cases that require a knowledge of the past, case law
and a breadth of experience could very well lose out.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000109">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The amendment
simply adds a requirement that the Lord Chancellor consults prior to
setting remuneration and listens to those representing the front line,
has a conversation about the stability of the legal aid scheme and the
fact that it will apply across the board based on the proposed fees,
and then makes a decision in the full knowledge of the effect that that
will have on the legal aid profession.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000110">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> The amendments seek to convert the power of the
Lord Chancellor, set out in subsection (1), into a duty to remove the
Lord Chancellor’s powers to make different arrangements for
different areas, cases and persons. The amendments also seek to include
provisions in relation to the matters that the Lord Chancellor must
take into account when setting remuneration rates. A statutory
requirement would also be created to consult the Bar Council and the
Law Society when setting remuneration rates. Amendment 3 is
unnecessary, because clause 1 already places a clear 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 303<a class="bkMark" name="Column303">&#160;</a>
                  </div>duty on the Lord Chancellor to ensure that legal aid is made available
in accordance with part 1 of the Bill. To fulfil that primary duty, it
will be necessary—indeed, essential—for the Lord
Chancellor to make appropriate arrangements. As a Minister of the
Crown, the Lord Chancellor already has many of the powers that he needs
to perform his functions under part 1—for example, to enter into
contracts relating to his functions. Clause 2 complements the existing
powers and will ensure that the Lord Chancellor may make any other
arrangements that are appropriate for fulfilling the legal aid
functions. That important measure of flexibility will ensure that the
most appropriate arrangements can be put in
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000111">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
current arrangements made by the Legal Services Commission are
generally contracting arrangements that act as a licence to solicitors
firms to carry out certain types of work. In addition, applications for
funding in individual cases often cover advocacy services. Those
arrangements are likely to continue under the new scheme, although it
is important to retain the flexibility to adapt, given the wider
regulatory changes currently being made to the legal services
market.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000112">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
reiterate that amendment 3 is unnecessary, as clause 1 will
ensure that the Lord Chancellor must secure the availability of legal
aid in accordance with part 1, while clause 2 builds on that by giving
the Lord Chancellor the power to make appropriate arrangements in
carrying out that duty. An obligation on the Lord Chancellor to make
such arrangements as he considers appropriate would add nothing to the
primary
duty.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000113">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
5 would remove subsection (5), which is designed to provide the Lord
Chancellor with a degree of flexibility and replicates a similar
provision in the Access to Justice Act 1999. I confirm to the hon.
Member for Hammersmith that it is not an attempt at postcode lottery.
Retaining that flexibility is important for several reasons. Its
primary purpose is to allow the Lord Chancellor to conduct pilots of
new arrangements, such as the current virtual court pilot that is being
run, under the Access to Justice Act, for individuals arrested and
taken to specific police stations in specific
areas.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000114">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
clause may be used to deal with emergency situations—for
example, where a police station is unexpectedly closed. Police station
work is in part geographically bound under LSC contracts and the
ability to divert additional resources to any police station, absorbing
increasing volumes as a consequence of another closing, is therefore
extremely important, as was seen in Hull following the devastating
flooding in 2007. As similar provisions allowed at that time, the
clause will allow the Lord Chancellor to put in place special
arrangements when they are required in a particular area and to depart
from the standard arrangements that would already have been
made.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000115">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Should
the provision be removed, the Lord Chancellor would lose that important
flexibility and the opportunity to respond to changes in circumstances,
practices and technology, which would be highly undesirable. It is
difficult to amend primary legislation, but that would be the only
option were a change in approach to be necessary and if the power in
the clause were not available to the Lord
Chancellor.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000116">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
am sure that hon. Members will agree that, when setting remuneration
rates, the Lord Chancellor should properly have regard to all relevant
considerations and that the Bill should not imply otherwise.
Amendment 70, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 304<a class="bkMark" name="Column304">&#160;</a>
                  </div>which would retain the duty to consult on remuneration orders with the
Bar Council and the Law Society, is also unnecessary. We will continue
to engage with them about remuneration matters whenever it is
appropriate and constructive to do so, which is not precluded by the
absence of a statutory duty. On that basis, the amendment is not
needed.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000117">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
say to the hon. Member for Hammersmith that we understand that the
professions want a coherent and solid structure to their legal aid
fees. That is exactly why we have carried out a proper consultation
rather than having the ongoing rounds of cuts that took place under the
previous Administration, who carried out more than 30 consultations and
failed in their criminal contracting
proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000118">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Several
hon. Members referred to the issue of market sustainability. We made it
clear in the consultation response that we will work in conjunction
with the LSC to develop and to put in place a new and robust client and
provider strategy that both reflects the demands and requirements of
the new legal aid market and extracts the maximum value from ongoing
structural developments in the legal market. We are confident that
there will be sufficient providers willing to undertake legal aid work
under the new strategy once the proposals have been implemented.
Therefore, there is no need for a statutory requirement, such as there
is in section 25(3) of the Access to Justice
Act.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000119">&#160;</a>

Everyone, including the representative bodies, had the opportunity to
respond to that consultation and detailed comments on fee reforms were

set out in the consultation response. However, those reforms are not

provision that this amendment seeks to replicate. The consultation
response includes a detailed analysis of the issue of market
sustainability and, as set out in the consultation response, the
conclusion that we reached is that, on balance, the proposed fee
reforms are likely to be sustainable. In addition, if there should be
any short-term disruption in supply in some areas, mitigating measures
are available to manage that disruption. Therefore, I urge hon. Members

as poor as church mice, legal aid rates were plainly not commercial

                  </strong> Amendment 64 would ensure that the Lord
Chancellor takes account of the comparative quality of advice and
representation and ensures equality between legally aided clients and
those with the funds to afford private advice. Currently, that is done
through membership of one of the Law Society’s accreditation
schemes, which certify providers’ expertise. Each area has
different accreditations, and the further restriction of tolerances
after close examination of equality demonstrates the complexity of each
subject and the fact that professionals concentrating on and working
within that area provide a better standard of service to their
clients.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000163">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">Accreditation
is important, but the monitoring of standards and quality assurance
throughout the life of the contract are equally important. The
specialist quality mark is much prized and not easy to gain; it takes a
lot of work and demonstrates a wide range of managerial and
subject-based knowledge. However, having worked within the system, I
think that peer review demonstrates quality and provides a great basis
for improvement. By sending off cases to an experienced adviser and
getting back comments a few months later, advisers can discuss where
they disagree or agree and what they could improve. It is expensive,
but it is vital that the quality of legally aided work is not allowed
to slip and that a two-tier legal system is not created that allows
those who can pay a higher standard of service. What will replace the
current accreditation, awarding of contracts and monitoring? Will there
be a new system? How will it be developed, and who will pay for
it?<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000164">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 65
is a simple amendment to change “may” to
“must” to reinforce the Lord Chancellor’s duty to
monitor service standards. I will not rehash the arguments, but I
stress that the standard and quality of service to legally aided
clients must be continually kept as high as that of service to
self-funded clients. Legally aided clients have the least financial
resources and often the most complex problems. If we let their
standards slip, we fail them. “May” is not enough. This
is an absolutely crucial duty of the Lord Chancellor that needs to be
enshrined in
law.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000165">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
71 would reinforce the mandatory nature of the Lord Chancellor’s
duty to make sure that providers are vetted and competent before being
allowed to do legal aid work. I can remember a time when there were no
standards for legal aid work and people could just apply for it. We had
a lot more complaints at Citizens Advice at that time than we have had
since a quality mark was
established.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000166">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
would like to discuss amendment 67, which, again, is about the quality
of work. Standards are important and must be monitored, but having
worked with the Legal Services Commission, I have to say that it is now
noticeable that the cost of monitoring is slipping from the
purchaser—the Legal Services Commission—to the provider.
Together with the cuts in the fees, that is putting an incredible
burden on providers. When I managed the contract, even before the 10%
proposed cut in fees, there were discussions regarding the cost-benefit
analysis to the rest of my service, because approximately 60% of
management time was spent monitoring 30% of the income stream. That
detracted from my ability to go out and get more funding for the
service. If the burden is increased by insisting that providers pay for
accreditation and monitoring in addition to managing, it may well tip
the
balance.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000167">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Another
issue relates to joint working with agencies that already monitor
standards of information. I remember when I had three audits in a week
that all looked at the same management systems and placed a totally
unnecessary burden on my organisation. I would have happily looked at
quality of work as often as required, but having three people, all of
whom work with and talk to each other on Citizens Advice and the Legal
Services Commission, looking at the same accounts and financial
planning information is surely not the way to run a service. The cost
of the administration of the LSC appears to have gone up and up. The
goalposts have continually changed 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 308<a class="bkMark" name="Column308">&#160;</a>
                  </div>and providers have always felt as if they were being kicked down the
line. There must be regard to the monitoring given to sustainability
and the ability to bring through new entrants to the
profession.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000168">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Supervisors
should not be so overloaded with bureaucratic requirements that they
have no time to mentor and train new and inexperienced staff.
Sometimes, it was felt that we were monitoring for monitoring sake and
left wondering what was happening. As I say, quality should not be
compromised and peer review was extremely important. However, some of
the best and most dedicated lawyers and advisers in the country work
with legally aided clients, and any scheme put in place must not deter
those people from continuing to work in the
sector.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000169">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I will be brief. I shall just speak to the
amendments in my name because I have made the comments that I wish to
make in relation to a two-tier legal system, and my hon. Friend the
Member for Makerfield has said everything that needs to be said on her
amendments. On her point about accreditation and
its costs, I would like to add that this is yet
another way of bearing down on the already very
tight margins that exist on legal aid providers. The measure comes in
addition to fee reductions, the reductions in scope and the other
squeezes on the budget as a result of cuts from other sources of
funding. It is effectively the fourth nail in the coffin. As my hon.
Friend says correctly, there is an increasing trend to put the burden
on
providers.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000170">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Accreditation
in the legal profession has moved on in an extraordinary fashion in the
past 20 years, which is not to say that there were not always high
standards. There was not an effective system of accreditation, yet we
now have quality marks and peer reviews. Those continuing methods of
professional development are taken very seriously by the profession. I
can remember trying to qualify for the Bar mark and the effort that was
put in to ensure that that happened. What were once regarded as rather
fusty professions are now leading the field in their ability to
interact with their consumers. That must be right, but it cannot be
right that an increasing number of additional burdens should be put on
those providers that are trading at the margins. We would simply insert
the word “not” with amendment 6, so that the Lord
Chancellor could not impose accreditation
charges.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000171">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> All the amendments relate to the standards of
service of legal aid under part 1. Amendments 6 and 67 seek to prevent
the imposition of charges in relation to the accreditation and
monitoring of services by the accredited. Amendments 65 and 71 seek to
put a duty on the Lord Chancellor or persons authorised by him to set
and monitor standards of service. Amendment 64 seeks to require the
Lord Chancellor, when exercising his legal aid functions, to have
regard to the need to ensure that legal aid services are of a
comparable quality to non-legal aid services. Amendment 67 seeks to
place a further duty on the Lord Chancellor to consider the financial
and administrative burden placed on the legal profession, the long-term
sustainability of the legal profession and the need to train and
supervise new entrants to the profession before setting standards of
accreditation and monitoring.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000172">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">I shall deal
first with amendments 64, 65, 67 and 71, which seek to impose various
duties on the Lord Chancellor in relation to standards of service.
Under clause 3, the Lord Chancellor will be given the power to ensure
the quality of services delivered under the legal aid scheme by making
provision on the accreditation and monitoring of standards. The
provision will enable the Lord Chancellor to establish a system of
accreditation of legal aid service providers. Accreditation may be made
by the Lord Chancellor or those authorised by him to do so. Such powers
are similar those currently given to the Legal Services Commission in
relation to the criminal defence service and community legal
service.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000173">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
LSC’s existing quality assurance standard is, of course, the
specialist quality mark. That standard ensures that organisations that
hold a contract with the commission are well managed, provide good
client care and have systems in place to ensure the delivery of good
quality advice. However, the commission also accepts the Law
Society’s Lexcel quality standards as entry criteria to
providers seeking to obtain an LSC contract. It is important that we
retain the flexibility to adopt those professional standards alongside
our own. That reflects the Government’s commitment to reducing
unnecessary administrative and financial burdens on the legal
profession when appropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000174">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Creating a
duty to establish and monitor those standards is neither proportionate
nor necessary. It could result in a system that is too onerous and
potentially costly for the providers of legal aid. Amendment 64 is
therefore unnecessary, as it seeks to include a requirement that does
not exist in the Access to Justice Act 1999. Under the solicitors code
of conduct 2007, solicitors are required to provide a good standard of
service to their clients. That applies whether or not they are legally
aided; legally aided clients must not be in a better or worse position
than privately paying clients. The LSC is committed to ensuring that it
contracts with providers that deliver high-quality services for
clients. Its successor will have the same job.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000175">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Currently,
all legal aid providers must meet the specialist quality mark or the
Lexcel standard. Those standards must be held prior to the award of
contract and throughout the lifetime of the contract. That compares
favourably with the privately funded market, where such standards are
not mandatory. Providers must meet accreditation standards when set.
Once a provider holds a contract, its quality of work is checked
through peer review. The provider must also meet a number of key
performance indicators, which include criteria such as beneficial
outcomes for clients and the cost of work not falling significantly
below the fixed or graduated fee. That is all done under the existing
arrangements, which ensure high-quality advice. To answer the hon.
Member for Makerfield, we see no reason to bring in anything new; we
will review the administrative burden of the current
standards.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000176">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I turn to
amendment 67. A balance needs to be struck between reducing bureaucracy
and ensuring that providers meet the required standards of service.
That is an important safeguard for clients and the taxpayer. A specific
requirement to have regard to the financial and administrative burdens
on providers is unnecessary. It could imply that the interests of
providers should have 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 310<a class="bkMark" name="Column310">&#160;</a>
                  </div>precedence over those of clients and the taxpayer. As for the second
part of amendment 67, we are struggling to see how the Lord
Chancellor’s accreditation and monitoring standards directly
affect the sustainability of the legal profession, and we know that
that specific issue arises for discussion in respect of other
amendments. Training and supervision of new entrants to the legal
profession is a matter not for the legal aid system, but for the
profession
itself.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000177">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Turning
to amendment 6, the provisions under the clause will enable the Lord
Chancellor or persons authorised by the Lord Chancellor to charge for
the accreditation and monitoring of persons providing services.
Historically, the LSC has authorised certain organisations to carry out
the accreditation and ongoing monitoring of those standards, with
groups such as Citizens Advice and Shelter having provided such
services in the past. That has previously proven a sensible and
practical solution to what is a large-scale exercise, given the
extensive number of legal aid providers, and the use of such
alternatives in future is considered
attractive.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000178">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">As
the hon. Members for Makerfield and for Hammersmith said, significant
resource implications are attached to the running of such schemes. The
provisions would allow an accreditation body to meet its costs in
carrying out the accreditation and monitoring functions. We believe
that to be entirely appropriate if it is to commit resource to such a
function, and it reflects the current statutory provisions under the
Access to Justice Act. The same considerations arise when the Lord
Chancellor undertakes accreditation and monitoring. Significant
resource implications are attached to accreditation and monitoring, and
it is perfectly proper that those who wish to seek accreditation in
order to undertake legally aided work are able to be charged in respect
of the accreditation and monitoring of the services that they
provide.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000179">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
conclusion, the provisions on the charges for monitoring and
accreditation are legally appropriate and reflect the current statutory
position. I therefore urge the hon. Lady to withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000180">&#160;</a>

break-even point. However, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

will not say much about amendments 72 and 68 other than that the
Minister might say that of course civil servants will be competent, pay
regard to fundamental principles of such measures and act in the
interests of justice. All civil servants would hold that as their sine
qua non, but it is worth our adding such provisions to the Bill because
significant changes will be made, principally under the Public Bodies
Bill, but that is also a reflection of the trend to internalise and
return to within the ordinary civil service functions that have been
independent or
semi-independent.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000191">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
make a comparison with a contentious body in the Public Bodies Bill,
the Youth Justice Board, with which the Minister will be familiar.
There are considerable concerns that when the Youth Justice Board is
returned to within the Ministry of Justice, the uniqueness that its
independence gives, its dedication to its specific remit for young
people before and after they enter the criminal justice system, the
expertise that it has built up and its ability to attract staff will be
dissipated, and that over time it will be absorbed and simply become
another part of the empire that is the Ministry of Justice. By analogy,
the same could be said about the demise of the LSC. My hon. Friend the
Member for Makerfield may want to say more about that.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000192">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 9
is simply an additional provision, a one-way valve allowing a review by
the Lord Chancellor. Obviously, we are concerned that the functions of
the director should remain independent of the Lord Chancellor, but it
seems to us that that would not be affected by allowing the Lord
Chancellor to extend the remit when he believes that circumstances
permit it. The amendment would be an additional mechanism to allow the
grant, not refusal, of legal aid in individual cases, and it speaks for
itself.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000193">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
will spend a little more time on amendment 10, the most important in
the group. It seems to us to provide something that is
lacking—independent review of the director’s decisions.
We debated the issue before the summer recess, when we looked to other
common law jurisdictions for guidance on how we should conduct
ourselves here. Our proposals are modelled on the New Zealand Legal
Services Act 2011, which made a change similar to the one that the
Government propose, and indeed that we would have proposed but with the
important caveat that it provides for appeal against the
director’s decision.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000194">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To explain
how the New Zealand system works, there is appeal from the director of
legal aid casework to an independent tribunal. It arose because
following a review of the legal aid system in New Zealand, it was
decided in the interests of efficiency and effective policy
communication that the Ministry of Justice there should take over the
responsibilities of the Legal Services Agency—it mirrors almost
exactly the process here—but that the independence of decision
making should be maintained through the investiture of a statutory
officer with the power to act independently of the Minister. The need
to maintain the function of the legal aid review panel, as it was then
called, was taken as given, and there was no question but that there
would be some form of appeal against decisions that were manifestly
unreasonable or wrong in law.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000195">&#160;</a>
               </p> 
               <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 313<a class="bkMark" name="Column313">&#160;</a>
               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">The reason why
the New Zealand agency was brought in house was primarily, again,
increased expenditure. Also—I make no comment on this, other
than stating the fact—the relationship between the New Zealand
Law Society and the agency was poor, and it was believed that the legal
aid services provided were of variable quality. In any event, it was
decided that the powers should be vested in a statutory officer, but
also that the review panel should be maintained and moved into what was
the tribunals division of the Ministry of
Justice.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000196">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In our
opinion, because of the important policy role played by legal aid, it
is appropriate, as it was in New Zealand, for legal aid to be close to
the Ministry. It is also important that the Government have a role in
determining the level of legal services they can afford, but the
safeguard must be that it is not just a fact, but clearly a fact, that
decisions on individual access are free from political interference.
That is the role with which the director is charged. The question is,
what happens in cases when the director may fall into error? The answer
is that the statutory officer model was approved in the New Zealand
case. Interestingly enough, significant savings were not thought to
accrue—it is too early to say whether they will; nevertheless,
on policy grounds the matter was proceeded with, although at that point
there was a reconstitution of the existing review
mechanism.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000197">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
I said, the grounds for review are fairly narrow: applicants may apply
for review when they think that the decisions of the statutory officer
are manifestly unreasonable or wrong in law. However, that review could
apply to decisions on applications, conditions on grants, amounts
repayable to the provider, the maximum grant, withdrawal of or
amendment to a grant, enforcement conditions and charges on
property—a fairly wide range of issues, albeit on narrow terms.
The tribunal sits in the tribunals division of the New Zealand Ministry
of Justice for its independence and although the members are appointed
by the Ministry, a non-lawyer always chairs
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000198">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Given
the limited range of grounds for appeal, asking for such a mechanism
seems entirely appropriate and reasonable. If the Minister wishes to
dwell on the matter and return to it at a later date, so be it, but we
feel strongly that the need for independence following the abolition of
the LSC is of paramount importance. We will return to the subject when
we reach clause 12, even if not today, but if we are to continue to be
seen as behaving fairly and impartially in the grant of legal aid, it
is essential that there is some check on or review of the powers of an
officer who is within the Ministry of Justice and who reports to the
Lord
Chancellor.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000199">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> As my hon. Friend said, both amendments are
really about the independence of the new body. The Bill requires the
Lord Chancellor to appoint a member of the civil service to the
statutory post of director of legal aid casework. That is a major
change, placing a Government official in charge of deciding who should
or should not receive legal representation and of making decisions on
individual cases. The decisions will be made by the director or the
delegated official, and amendment 72 seeks to place an obligation on
the civil servants who work in legal aid to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 314<a class="bkMark" name="Column314">&#160;</a>
                  </div>understand fully not only the provision of services and the work of the
courts but the social conditions in which problems might arise. They
must also understand how the providers manage their services. The
decisions made by the director will have a huge impact on the life of
individuals and on their ability to deal with issues; the officials
need to take a fully rounded view and, equally, must not look from a
Government perspective but stand outside that, as their first duty
should be to promote access to justice and equality of
arms.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000200">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
will be a huge number of cases, and it would be irresponsible to deal
with them in isolation. I am reminded of the old citizens advice
bureaux aims—I am afraid that I am a traditionalist and can only
remember the old ones—which include exercising responsible
influence on the development of social policy. People who see a large
number of cases have a responsibility to say where things are going
wrong and to suggest and promote improvements. In the range of civil
and criminal services, a vast amount of cases will be seen, and that is
key to seeing where services are being provided well or accessibly;
services have to be made accessible to those who need them. Providers
will demonstrate a range of innovative and good practice, which should
be promoted, similar to a Legal Services Commission scheme I think
called PIP—the positive improvement programme. Innovative
schemes were trialled as a pilot and then throughout the country as an
example of good practice on how to reach people in secure units or
prisons.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000201">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">There
has also been a concern about how services are provided and their
appropriateness to various groups of issues, particularly the
introduction of the telephone gateway. Putting that duty on the civil
service would ensure that the services provided are appropriate, given
the nature and importance of the issues. Basically, that duty would
ensure a well-trained, competent cadre of civil servants who pay regard
to the fundamental principles of the law and to the needs of the legal
aid profession and its
clients.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000202">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
68 emphasises the independence of the civil servants who work on legal
aid, as placing a Government official is, as I have said, a major
change. Respondents have raised some concerns to the Committee. For
example, the Law Society has raised the concern that many of the cases
in which the individual will decide whether to award legal aid will be
cases against the Government. The amendment clearly sets out that all
decisions would be based on the interests of justice, and not on
arbitrary considerations of the public purse or even on the effect on
the Government. Without public confidence in the idea that justice can
be administered fairly and without bias, a lack of respect for the law
would begin to creep in and our justice system would start to be
undermined.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000203">&#160;</a>

discuss amendment 8, which suggests that any person appointed to the
directorate should be subject to a pre-appointment hearing by a Select
Committee of the House of Commons, which would be a useful step
forward. I am a member of the Select Committee on Justice, as is my
friend Mr Buckland. We have dealt with several appointment hearings
recently, and it would be eminently reasonable to request the
appointment to be subject to a pre-appointment hearing. I will say no 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 315<a class="bkMark" name="Column315">&#160;</a>
                  </div>more, other than it is an extremely important, core function within the
workings of the Justice Committee and the Ministry of Justice. The

hearing.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000204">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On
amendment 72, I have some misgivings about appointing a civil servant
to that job without advertising externally. Through the amendment, we
want to ensure that the person has experience of criminal and civil
legal services, of the work of the courts, of social conditions and
management, and crucially, of the all-important principle of the
equality of arms. I am not here to denigrate the civil service, because
it does a fine job and should often be applauded for its work. To my
way of thinking, however, we have a Bill that is driven more by
cost-cutting than by anything else. In some instances, the cuts have
not been thought through, and we will live to rue this day and the next
couple of weeks when the fallout begins to appear. I say that most
sincerely. I am not here to oppose for opposition’s sake, but I
have been here long enough to see when mistakes are being made due to
the need to cut costs at all costs. That did not sound eloquent, but I
am sure that members of the Committee know what I mean. There would be
a temptation—I put it no higher than that—on the senior
civil servant appointed to the post to look at the cost of granting
legal aid rather than at the fairness and equality in so doing. I leave
the matter there, but the point is
valid.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000205">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On
amendment 10, which the hon. Member for Hammersmith eloquently
discussed, I am regrettably of the vintage who can remember the days
when legal aid was given by a local director. For example, the local
director for north and mid-Wales and Shropshire headed the Legal Aid
Board under the Law Society in an office in Chester. If an application
were refused, the solicitor concerned would apply to the director
asking him to review the decision. The director would then place the
matter before a panel of legal aid lawyers, of which I was one. It was
not rubber-stamping to help out our mates, because I remember most of
the requests being turned down, although several were not for very good
reasons. The process was not costly—I was given my travelling
expenses from Bala to Shrewsbury twice a month. It did not take up a
great deal of time, because it involved two afternoons a month. If
there were a large panel to draw from, it would be easy to do. I
commend that system to the
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000206">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
see that the Ministers are not of my vintage, which they will be
pleased about, but I ask them to examine how that procedure worked, in
case there is something to be learned and in case it could be done
expeditiously and cheaply. In those days, the procedure was always
fair, and I do not recall anyone feeling that they were hard done by by
such a decision. The cases were carefully looked into and granted or
not, depending on the case. Many were not granted, but many were. If it
is a question of law, that is a different thing altogether. Those
decisions were often based on the facts and on the importance of the
matter to the
individual.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000207">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
digress for one slight minute, but I remember a solicitor from Wrexham
writing in on behalf of his client, who was in prison in Liverpool. His
complaint was that he wanted to sue the governor, because when the tea
came round there was sugar in it already. I was looking at the papers
before going to the committee and I realised that the individual had
been released a month 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 316<a class="bkMark" name="Column316">&#160;</a>
                  </div>before. That application still came before us and we asked the solicitor
concerned, “Why are you concerned? This man is on the outside
now.” He said, “Oh no. No doubt he will be back in before
long.” The Committee will not be surprised to learn that that
application was turned down, with good
reason.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000208">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The serious
point is that a procedure was available. I am sure that the legal
profession would be prepared to roll up its sleeves and make the
procedure work as it did then. It would not be costly and it would be
expeditious. I commend it, and I hope that the Minister will consider
it in due
course.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000209">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The proposed amendments to clause 4 have a range
of effects. Amendment 8 would make the appointment of the director of
legal aid casework subject to the approval of a Select Committee of the
House of Commons as well as by designation by the Lord Chancellor. Our
position is that the amendment is unnecessary. Clause 4 provides that
the Lord Chancellor must designate a civil servant as the director.
Civil servants are subject to a fair and open recruitment process. The
creation of a statutory office holder ensures independence in making
funding decisions, free from any political interference. The director
is a separate office from the Lord Chancellor, created by
statute.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000211">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
9 would provide the Lord Chancellor with a new power in relation to the
decision making of the director of legal aid casework, permitting the
Lord Chancellor to give directions or guidance in relation to an
individual case<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000212">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p>I
agree with the hon. Members for Hammersmith and for Makerfield that the
question of the director’s independence is important. The
amendment, unfortunately, would make serious inroads into the
director’s independence. The protection of the director against
interference in individual cases is an important safeguard.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000213">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
protection of the independence of decision making is a fundamental
tenet of the new arrangements, which recognises the structural changes
to legal aid embodied in the Bill and the requisite safeguards that are
required to make these new structural arrangements work. Any power to
interfere with the decision making of the director, however ostensibly
benevolent that power may be, remains highly unattractive in achieving
the necessary protections that the Bill must provide to give confidence
in the new arrangements. That provision also reflects what is currently
in the Access to Justice Act 1999. The Lord Chancellor cannot give the
Legal Services Commission directions in relation to individual
cases.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000214">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have already acknowledged the vital importance of protecting
fundamental rights of access to justice. That has been central in
developing our proposals for reform, including the role of the
director. The director has an important role to play in the reforms
that we have put forward to establish an affordable system, while still
ensuring that no one is denied their fundamental rights of access to
justice. The director must make decisions in accordance with the
protections afforded by the Bill. The right hon. Member for Dwyfor
Meirionnydd spoke about the old way of awarding legal aid. It was
certainly 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 317<a class="bkMark" name="Column317">&#160;</a>
                  </div>interesting to hear, and he had a great anecdote. I am not entirely sure
whether the modern LSC accounting requirements would tie in with the
old way of looking at legal aid, but it is something that we can
consider.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000215">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
10 seeks to remove the Lord Chancellor’s duty to publish
guidance or directions given to the director concerning the carrying
out of the director’s functions. It would remove the Lord
Chancellor’s power to vary or withdraw guidance or directions at
any time. In place of the provisions, the amendment seeks to establish
an independent tribunal to hear appeals against eligibility decisions
made by the director. The amendment is unnecessary. The Bill already
establishes the director in a way that maintains and protects the
director’s independence of decision making. The director is
created by statute. The Lord Chancellor cannot give directions or
guidance to the director about individual
cases.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000216">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
is also already provision in the Bill for a review of the
director’s decisions and appeals against the director’s
decisions. This means there is no need for an amendment to create a
separate tribunal. Clause 11(5) requires that the regulations must make
provision for procedures for the review of the
determinations director under clauses 8 and 9 as to whether
a person qualifies for civil legal aid and the withdrawal of such
determinations. There is also power in clause 11(6) to make provision
for appeals to a court, tribunal or other person against the making or
withdrawal of a determination in relation to civil legal aid. There are
currently review arrangements under the Access to Justice Act 1999, and
it is our intention to continue with the current arrangements,
including the use of independent funding adjudicators, rather than
moving to another model, such as that of New Zealand, as suggested by
the hon. Member for
Hammersmith.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000217">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">This
is more than adequate provision to ensure that scrutiny can be applied
to the decisions of the director where an individual believes that
there are grounds for review. Ultimately, it will be possible to seek
to judicially review decisions. There is also provision for making
regulations about the review of, and appeals against, the
director’s determination on criminal legal aid. I refer
Committee members to clauses 14(9), 17(4)(i), 17(6) and
18(4).<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000220">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
proposed amendment to remove the current duty in relation to the
publication of guidance and directions would remove one of the key
provisions ensuring transparency in the new arrangements. As a result
of having a duty to publish any guidance or directions given, those
applying for legal aid have a clear framework against which to assess
the director’s decision in relation to their application, and,
if an individual believes the decision to be inconsistent with any
guidance or directions given, has a clear basis for challenge under the
review procedures that I have mentioned. This transparency 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 318<a class="bkMark" name="Column318">&#160;</a>
                  </div>provides certainty and clarity to would-be legally aided clients and to
firms of solicitors making applications on their
behalf.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000221">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
proposal to remove the Lord Chancellor’s power to vary or
withdraw guidance or directions is therefore unhelpful. These
provisions allow the Lord Chancellor to respond to changes in
circumstances, such as changes in legislation and changes in response
to case law, both domestic and European. This important flexibility is
key. The Lord Chancellor must have the power to be able to amend or
withdraw any directions or guidance issued in order to be able to
reflect any wider changes that may influence the operation of the legal
aid system.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000222">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 68
requires that the director make decisions independently of Government,
and that these decisions are taken in accordance with the interests of
justice. In relation to criminal cases, the Bill requires the director
to make decisions in accordance with what is required by the interests
of justice. In relation to civil cases, the director will make his
decision in accordance with the criteria set out in regulations made
under clause 10. In making those regulations, the Lord Chancellor must
have regard to matters such as the importance to the individual of the
matters concerned, the nature and seriousness of those matters and the
public interest. Amendment 68 is accordingly
unnecessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000223">&#160;</a>

It is not one of our best, so I will not pursue it. Quid pro quo, I ask

relatively straightforward way of ensuring the independence and the
scrutiny of what is a new and highly responsible post to which will
attach the suspicion, at least in the early days, that it is less
independent and more prone to political influence than the
current set-up. It is the one serious reservation that we have—I
do not think that we are alone in having it—in relation to the
abolition of the LSC.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000225">&#160;</a>

more eloquently than me—that the Select Committees are there to
perform a variety of functions, one of which is the pre-appointment
hearing. Nothing the Minister has said has persuaded me that this is a
post that is not suitable for that; it seems eminently suitable for
that. I am not going to push the matter to a vote, but I hope that the
Minister will consider it. It is a straightforward matter that is
inexpensive and simple. It would be an important signal as well as,
hopefully, an important actuality. There are several Select Committee

are oiled and that, for a very good price, the public gets something of
very high quality. All we are saying is that there needs to be some
formal check. If the tribunal never sits because there are no appeals
to it, I am sure that I will be the first person to say that it was
unnecessary. I am sure that the Government will vote against it now,
but I ask the Minister to go away and think about it again. We must
have assurance and certainty that under the new regime that the measure
brings in, particularly given the concerns that we all have about
clause 12, the decisions that are to be made by the director will be
fully independent of Government and the proposal seems the simplest and
most elegant way of achieving

and insert—<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000258">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">‘of

mediation and other forms of dispute

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">However
disappointing and inadequate we found clauses 1 to 4, it is clearly
necessary to have some form of delegation or authorisation arising from
them. I do not have a lot to say on clause 7, save that
amendment 13 should be regarded as an amendment that needs
to be flagged up at this stage, although we may well return to the
issue of mediation subsequently.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000259">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I think that
I made clear in the discussion about clause 1 before the summer recess
the importance that we give to the role of mediation, the importance of
extending the role of mediation and the importance of the additional
funds that the Government are putting into mediation. We have no
problem or issue with
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000260">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is the relationship between mediation and litigation that we have some
difficulty with, and that mediators too have some difficulty with. The
purpose of amendment 13 is to put that in the Bill, so that
it is clear that legal representation is essential in some cases and
mediation is only an alternative to it, which does not substitute for
the determination of an applicant’s right in a courtroom and is
not to be used instead of representation because it is not what the
applicant wishes. That is the effect. As I say, mediation is a powerful
tool, but it is underpinned by the rule of law and in the end it can
only be enforced through litigation. We are all too aware of what might
happen if mitigation fails, if there is no settlement or if there is
inequality of arms.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000261">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In an earlier
debate this morning, I quoted from the research paper on litigants in
person that the Ministry of Justice published earlier in the summer. I
shall read a paragraph from that paper that is relevant to the
amendment:<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000262">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Parties
in mixed representation cases (where one party was represented and the
other was not) were more likely, than cases where both or neither
parties were represented, to report feeling unprepared to mediate, and
concerns and fears about mediation.”<a class="bkMark" name="11090720001018">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>Mediation is not a
panacea. It does not create a level playing field. On the contrary, the
ability of a represented party is important. Particularly in family
disputes, it is often the case that the man is the represented party
and the unrepresented party is the woman.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000263">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I shall also
read briefly from an article written by a mediator. As I have said,
mediators have some of the strongest concerns about the
Government’s policy, and if I read one or two sentences from the
article it will become clear
why:<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000264">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“it

               </p>
               <p>The
article concludes
that<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000266">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“it
would be ironic if the downsides of the policy under consideration may
simply make it significantly harder for mediation to be successful, if
implemented as
announced.”<a class="bkMark" name="11090720001021">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Minister is a bit like a stuck record on this: the Government are
determined to force people into mediation, and determined not to offer
an alternative. In the interview from which I have quoted, given by the
current Attorney-General when he was in the shadow role two years ago,
he said:<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000267">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“As
for mediation more generally, it can be very useful, but it
shouldn’t be transformed into a system that effectively
discourages people from getting access to the
courts.”<a class="bkMark" name="11090720001022">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>In
my submission, that is exactly what the Government are doing. They are
using mediation as a way of preventing access to the courts, which is
not appropriate. Not only is it not appropriate in itself, but it is
not appropriate in ensuring good, effective mediation.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000268">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I do not
expect to get anything other than a dusty answer, but it is important
to put on record that this is a serious and significant change in how
dispute resolution is conducted in this country. It takes advantage of
the fact that there is a general willingness, which has existed since
the Woolf reforms and for many years before that, to see the expansion
of different forms of dispute resolution that do not involve the
formality, cost and processes of going to court and possibly to trial.
That is all well and good, but it is a serious error of judgment to
make the leap of faith to saying that in many cases, particularly in
family disputes, mediation is the only option available to
parties.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000269">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As I have
said, the change is being made purely as a cost-saving measure. If it
were not for the wish to save costs and court time, it would not have
been proposed. In the end, not only will it be unhelpful in itself, but
it will result in more dissatisfied clients and more playing of the
system by those who abuse mediation and who will not have the rigour of
the court process to bring them to heel. It will stir up many, many
problems for the future.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000270">&#160;</a>

               <p>Although
amendment 13 suggests that advice and assistance would primarily be in
the form of representation, it would not substantially change the
effect of clause 7, so it is unnecessary. I welcome the apparent
recognition by the hon. Member for Hammersmith that mediation can hold
considerable advantages over contested court proceedings, because it
can be cheaper, quicker and less acrimonious. Of course, we do not say
that mediation is appropriate in all circumstances. That is why
clause 10(4) makes it clear that in setting merits criteria
the Lord Chancellor must seek to ensure that where more than
one type of service could be provided for an applicant who
qualifies, the service that is provided is the most appropriate in the
circumstances. The benefits of mediation are particularly
well illustrated in private

assessments, and take a view on the data we present. We have said that
legal aid will no longer routinely be available for representation in
most private family law cases, but that family mediation will, and
legal aid will be available for legal advice in support of mediation.
It is right to encourage families, where appropriate, to resolve their
disputes without recourse to the courts. We expect to spend an extra
£10 million on mediation and legal advice in support of
mediation, bringing our total spend to about £25 million. There
are private family law cases for which mediation would obviously not be
suitable, such as those involving domestic violence or child
abuse.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000276">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">We
have also made an exception for private law children cases involving
children at risk of abuse, and where there is objective evidence of the
risk of abuse, legal aid will be available for the parties seeking to
protect the child. We have also ensured that legal aid will be
available for children who are parties in private family law
proceedings, primarily when a judge decides that it is in
the best interests of the child for them to be represented separately
from the other parties in the case, who are usually their parents. In
addition, legal aid will continue to be available for public
law children cases, such as those in which a local authority seeks to
take a child into care. After the changes, we expect to still spend
£120 million per annum on private family law, including domestic
violence, and up to £300 million on public family law. The total
spend on all family legal aid will still be well over £400
million.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000282">&#160;</a>

need to target legal aid at the cases that are most in need means that
tough choices must be made about funding priorities. Prioritising our

will be available for the cases in which the most serious issues are at

                  </strong> Sadly, I will not; I will press the amendment
to a vote. The Minister has not dealt well with the point
made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston.
In essence, the Minister has said, “Yes, we will deal with the
matter in more detail when we discuss domestic violence specifically,
but legal aid will still be available for such cases.” My hon.
Friend’s point is that, in private family law cases, an
undercurrent of, if not violence, oppressive behaviour, is often the
reason why the dispute in the separation has occurred—over
residence, contact and so on. Commonly, evidence in such cases
demonstrates clearly that there has been oppressive behaviour from one
party or the other.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000285">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Despite that,
the Minister is saying that, in such cases, it is suitable for the
parties to sit round a table and try to reach a resolution through
mediation. That simply will not happen. In such cases, the issues of
oppressive, violent or intimidating behaviour will simply be pushed up
the agenda, which is not helpful to resolving matters in any event.
Often, although a court will take cognisance of the fact that there is
a background of hostility, it will still concentrate on the issues
before it and will try to reach a resolution. I do not believe that
that will be possible, in many cases, with mediation. The Minister is
wilfully closing his eyes to such possibilities because he has a budget
to run to.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000286">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> The amendments go to the heart of our
opposition to the Government’s strategy of restricting legal
aid. I do not need to say much about them because we will shortly
debate schedule 1, when we can consider the related matters in more
detail.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000316">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Legal aid was
devised to allow those who are impecunious and cannot afford access to
legal advice to get their cases into court to reach a fair resolution,
to be put on a level peg with those who have such resources. Over time,
the areas that are subject to dispute—which become more
complex—and relevant to society, change significantly. We have
seen such changes clearly over the past 40 or 50 years, and
many of the areas that the Government propose to take out of scope have
worked their way into scope over that time.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000317">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government’s approach here is not permissive. They are simply
saying, “Unless we have put it down in black letters that we are
going to allow legal aid in a restricted number of cases, it will not
be allowed. We will have a list of matters that are not allowed and we
will allow the Lord Chancellor by secondary legislation to continue to
remove but not to add matters to that list.” That triple whammy,
as it were, of proposals makes the Government’s intention very
clear: to be as restrictive as they can possibly get away with being in
the provision of social welfare legal aid and to allow exceptions only
where they believe it is untenable not to, either for public relations
reasons or for reasons of 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 325<a class="bkMark" name="Column325">&#160;</a>
                  </div>simple morality. Otherwise, they will do their level best to close down
those options for legal aid that have grown over
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000318">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">By
removing the wording in clause 8 that allows the Government to take
this reductive approach, we are saying through these amendments that we
wish to stay potentially with the status quo. That does not mean things
should not be reviewed. On the contrary, the point I am making is that
if we want to constantly review what is and is not appropriate, we
should not set up a system so restrictive that it will give little
justice to anybody who is seeking that in any of the areas currently in
scope.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000319">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
mentioned amendment 77. I can anticipate what the Minister will say on
amendments 75 and 78. I will conclude, so he can tell us what he wants
to say on that. I do not know what he will say on amendment 77 because
it is difficult for him to argue that schedule 1 should be capable of
modification only to omit rather than to omit or add. As I say, I am
keen to hear his explanation on
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000320">&#160;</a>

                  </span> I share the concern of the hon. Member for
Hammersmith about the wording of the clause, particularly the fact that
the Lord Chancellor will be given the power by order to delete further
services from scope. We are having a full day’s
debate on the absence of some of these services from scope, yet in this
subsection we are expected to give leave to the Lord Chancellor on a
whim to delete any further services from scope. We often say that the
devil is in the detail. There is quite a devil in this particular
detail, and I am very concerned about it. That is not to cast any
aspersions on the present holder of the office or, indeed, anybody on
the Treasury Benches. However, it is absolutely unacceptable to leave
it open to delete other areas from scope another
day.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000321">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If
there is an insistence on having that power, it is perfectly reasonable
in my view, and in the opinion of the hon. Member for Hammersmith, that
there should be an amendment to allow services to be added. For
example, after the reference to schedule 1 in subsection
(2), the amendment I have tabled could be inserted, which
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000322">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“or
by amending any description of services included in that

               </p>
               <p>In
other words, amendment 77 and my amendment 159 would allow the Lord
Chancellor to include services at a future date. The reason for cutting
back on services and taking them out of scope is largely, if not
entirely, being justified by the current economic circumstances and,
indeed, we all hope and pray that the outlook will improve. Therefore,
it would be sensible and prudent to allow the Lord Chancellor to bring
back services within the scope of legal aid in due course, particularly
because I am afraid that we will revisit the Bill in the not too
distant future. I was around when the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 and the
firearms—pistol—legislation were enacted, and they proved
to be as useful as a chocolate
teapot.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000323">&#160;</a>

                  </div>there are concerns among the Opposition, and I believe that there are
Members on the Government side who are concerned about several aspects
of the changes as well. Amendments 77 and 159 are both designed to
provide, reasonably enough, a power for the Lord Chancellor, in due
course, to add services back to scope and not to prepare the way to add
yet further services to the swathes already taken out of
scope.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000324">&#160;</a>

out or how it can be altered.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000325">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 75
would remove subsection (1), removing schedule 1 in its entirety. I
assume that the intended effect of the amendment is to prevent civil
legal aid from being limited to the matters listed in schedule 1.
However, removing the operative part of it in that way would
technically prevent the director from providing civil legal aid to any
individual, which presumably is not the
intention.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000326">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Clause
8 allows the Lord Chancellor to modify schedule 1 by
omitting civil legal services from part 1 of the schedule, whether by
modifying part 1 or other parts of the schedule. Amendment 78 would
remove the Lord Chancellor’s power to modify schedule 1 by
omitting types of civil legal services from part 1. We think the
amendment is motivated by a concern that the Lord Chancellor should not
be able to further narrow the scope of the civil legal aid scheme
without primary legislation. I think that has been reflected in
Members’ comments. However, the power allows the removal of
civil legal services where it is no longer appropriate to fund them. An
example of where that might be necessary is where the governing
legislation behind an area of law is repealed or otherwise altered, and
we need to alter civil legal aid provision accordingly. Another example
is where particular court proceedings are moved to a tribunal, and it
ceases to be appropriate to provide funding for advocacy for such
proceedings, so an amendment to part 3 of schedule 1 would be needed.
Any changes made to the scope of part 1, using the power in clause 8,
would be subject to the affirmative resolution
procedure.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000327">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
intention of amendment 77 appears to be to allow out of scope civil
legal services to be added back in by secondary legislation. Amendment
159 would allow the descriptions of funded services to be changed,
essentially allowing the schedule to be substantially revised. We have
been clear. I hate to say this to the right hon. Member for Dwyfor
Meirionnydd, but in the current fiscal climate we have to make these
tough choices about which civil legal services should continue to be
funded by the taxpayer.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000328">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Given the
importance of the issue, we believe that the scope of civil legal aid
should be set out in primary legislation, which the Bill places before
Parliament for approval. Therefore, I urge the hon. Member for

                  </strong> The Minister has correctly interpreted the
intention of the amendment. I hear what he says, but in light of the
way the clause is drafted there was little or no alternative but to
draft the amendments in this way. There is no meeting of minds on these
issues. The very real concerns we have about many of the

continues. We need to get on to that. We simply do not believe that
parts 1 and 2 are an appropriate way to administer and apply legal aid.

want to make it clear that we do not believe it appropriate for areas

                  </strong> I shall speak to amendments 73 and 74 together,
as they work together to allow legal aid for any instance in which an
individual challenges a public authority. My hon. Friend the Member for
Stretford and Urmston has given well-argued and cogent reasons why
individuals need legal aid to challenge such decisions, and I do not
wish to repeat them all, but the inequality of arms is never more
obvious than when an individual comes up against a decision made by the
state or an agency of the state. Such decisions are invariably made by
individuals and institutions whose powers are advised by law, and they
are based on laws, legal advice and rules, so such cases are inherently
legal. It is the state’s responsibility to ensure that the
individual can effectively hold the state to account.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000342">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Resources
available to the state are absolutely enormous—individuals
consider them boundless—and public authorities have the
immeasurable advantage of familiarity with procedures. The Minister can
repeat as many times as he likes that the tribunal procedure is simple.
It is simple to those who have been to one, or who can imagine standing
before three people and having their life examined. However, many
individuals and families with no access to specialist support to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 328<a class="bkMark" name="Column328">&#160;</a>
                  </div>prepare their case and establish the limits of state powers, or the
evidence to take their case further will simply give up. That gives the
state an immeasurable
advantage.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000343">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendment will not extend the scope of legal aid to include
representation at tribunals; it will simply allow the preparation of
the case and the explanation of the process, removing the fear of the
unknown and providing a more level playing field for the individual who
feels that they are pitting themselves against the might of a state
that holds all the
cards.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000344">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Amendments 136, 137, 145, 148 and 151, which stand
in my name, would amend schedule 1. They are tabled with a view to
altering the list of excluded services in part 2 of the schedule to
remove the specific exclusions or withdrawals from scope relating to
breach of statutory duty, claims against public authorities involving
the Human Rights Act 1998, welfare benefits claims and applications to
the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority. Several of the amendments
are consequential to those removals from the list, which would
effectively bring the items back into the scope of legal aid.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000345">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendments reflect our concern, which I am sure other Committee members
share, about the large-scale exceptions to funding envisaged in the
Bill. It will create alarming gaps in protection and hits the most
vulnerable the hardest. In particular, applications for criminal
injuries compensation, benefits claims and claims regarding the Human
Rights Act will typically be made against a strong and powerful
authority, and individuals will therefore be deprived of the
opportunity to have their day in court and to have their rights
properly
upheld.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000346">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
135 is consequential to amendments 73 and 74, which were tabled by the
hon. the Member for Makerfield, and these comments are consequential to
the arguments that she put forward. We may keep returning to the same
point, but it is important that we show our concern. We are concerned
about those who will be deprived of their voice as a direct result of
the cuts introduced by the Bill. We may continue saying that today,
tomorrow and the day after, and I hope that, at some point, the
Government will
listen.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000347">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> The amendments are contrary to the basis of our
whole programme of reform and would undermine our goal of focusing
limited resources on the cases that need them most. Amendments 136,
137, 145, 148, 151 and 160 seek to extend the scope of legal aid to
cover claims in respect of a breach of statutory duty and claims for
damages in respect of a breach of human rights by a public
authority, where those arise in relation to a matter that is within the
scope of civil legal
aid.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000348">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is important to emphasise that schedule 1 makes legal aid available for
the most serious damages claims against public authorities. The Bill
ensures that funding may be made available for claims regarding a
breach of statutory duty or a breach of convention rights against
public authorities, where the matter concerns an abuse of position or
power, a significant breach of human rights, allegations of the abuse
of a child or vulnerable adult or allegations of sexual offence. Hon.
Members should also be aware that funding may be made available 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 329<a class="bkMark" name="Column329">&#160;</a>
                  </div>for a judicial review of an enactment, decision, act or omission, which
is a clear way of holding public authorities to
account.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000349">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendments proposed by the right hon. Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd,
however, would go much further. They would make funding available for
any claim for breach of statutory duty or breach of convention rights
that arises in relation to a matter within the scope of legal aid, no
matter how frivolous. Amendments 73, 74 and 135 would bring into scope
for advice almost all immigration, education, welfare benefits and
clinical negligence cases. They would make funding available for any
claim relating to any act or omission by a public authority, subject to
merits of financial eligibility. In some respects, that would expand
the scheme beyond even its current
bounds.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000350">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Starting
with welfare benefits, while we recognise that many people rely on such
benefits, these cases are primarily about financial entitlement, and we
generally consider them to have lower importance than those concerning
the liberty or safety of the person. Appeals are heard before a
relatively informal tribunal, which is well used to individuals
presenting their own appeal without legal assistance. Legal aid would
be retained for judicial review on welfare benefit decisions and for
claims relating to a contravention of the Equality Act 2010
that concerns welfare
benefits.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000351">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On
special educational needs, the Government were persuaded by the
strength of the arguments that legal aid should be retained for advice
in such cases. We have therefore decided to modify the original
proposal, so that legal aid should continue to be available for SEN
cases where it is currently available. We do not consider that legal
aid is needed or merited for other education matters such as admissions
and exclusions. In most cases, parents can simply raise any concerns by
writing to the school
governors.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000352">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendments would also make legal advice available for various
immigration cases, including applying for study or work visas,
appealing family visit visas or getting advice on citizenship
applications. While we appreciate the importance of those matters to
the individuals concerned, immigration tribunals are
designed to be user-friendly and interpreters are provided free of
charge. The issues at stake are generally factual, rather than points
of law. Most immigration cases do not routinely justify taxpayer
funding, and they are therefore being removed from the scope of legal
aid. We are, however, retaining legal aid for the most serious cases,
such as domestic violence immigration cases, cases before the Special
Immigration Appeals Commission and immigration detention cases,
including advocacy before the
tribunal.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000353">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
previously debated, we recognise that claims of clinical negligence
often raise serious issues. We also recognise that there is often a
viable source of alternative funding for those cases through
contingency fee arrangements. We therefore consider that legal aid is
not justified in those cases and that our limited funding should be
better targeted at other priority areas, such as those concerning
physical safety, liberty or homelessness. I therefore urge right hon.
and hon. Members to withdraw their
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000354">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I have to say that was the reply I expected from
the Minister. If the Minister had not been persuaded previously, he was
not to be persuaded now. However, I am sorry that the myth of the
tribunal being user-friendly is still being perpetuated, when the
majority of people who use advice agencies are absolutely petrified of
the idea of going to a tribunal, and take a considerable amount of
reassurance from the agency in order to get them even to set foot over
the threshold. However, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720001074">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> We heard from the Minister a few minutes ago that
removal of clinical negligence from scope could be made up in some way
by the contingency fee arrangements. That is not as simple as it
sounds. I am concerned about people who, at the beginning of such an
arrangement with solicitors, would perhaps not be able to afford a
policy that would cover them for the initial medical examinations that
need to be undertaken—I have in mind children who have been born
with paraplegic conditions and so on.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000387">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I have heard
the Minister say more than once when giving evidence to the Justice
Committee that the change in question was necessary first because there
was the cover of contingency fees and, more importantly, because it was
an expensive area of law. His opinion was that lawyers tended to draw
and drag things out on behalf of claimants, but I can tell the Minister
that it is quite the reverse. In my experience of litigating against
health authorities, they are the least helpful bodies on earth. They
will withdraw or hide evidence until the very last minute, and in some
way they believe that the claimant, or the next friend, will go away
and leave the matter alone. They think in some weird way that things
will be improved if they sit on evidence for five or six years, rather
than coming clean from day one.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000388">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If there were
a duty on responsible bodies such as health authorities to come clean
immediately, we would probably not be having this debate because it
would not be a high-cost area. Of course damages are huge, and rightly
so, particularly in paraplegic cases. That is understandable because
that young person or child will have to be looked after for the rest of
their life. However, in many cases over the years I have found that
health authorities are the worst bodies against which to litigate, and
the least credible litigators. As I have said, on numerous occasions
crucial evidence has been withheld for years for one reason or another,
and then it suddenly appears and a settlement is brought forward. If
that kind of behaviour had not occurred, I dare say there would be no
move to withdraw clinical negligence from the scope of the legislation.
I regret to say it, but that is what I have found over some years of
practice.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000389">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendments
161, 146, 147 and 149 are designed to amend schedule 1 to bring
clinical negligence cases back within scope. Amendment 161 covers cases
involving the abuse of a child or vulnerable adults;
amendments 146 and 147 cover the abuse of a position of
power by a public authority; and a breach of convention rights by a
public authority is covered by amendment
149.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000390">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Clinical
negligence cases will evidently be against the NHS or public
authorities, and they will be difficult to fund in any other way. I
understand that the Government have moved their position slightly so
that some initial medical fees might be covered. I do not know what the
Minister will say in response, but if there were a strict duty of
candour on defendants in such cases, I hope that we would not be in
this position.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000391">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Although
cases could be brought under amendment 73, amendment 149,
which stands in my name, would stand alone as it retains specific
prevision for tort and damages claims engaging convention rights, and
extends provision to cases that involve clinical negligence. Amendments
146 and 147 provide specifically for cases involving a particularly
serious variety of public wrongdoing and would remove the exclusion of
clinical negligence cases in such a context. They could be grouped with
amendments 160, 145 and 148, which remove later references in schedule
1.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000392">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
can anticipate what the Minister will say, but I hope that, the
Government having moved on the question of the cost of initial medical
examinations and reports, they will look further at the matter. They
cannot just say that contingency fees are the answer; they are not the
answer. For many parents, they cannot be the answer, because the
parents do not have the money up front to buy a policy to provide cover
when making an arrangement with the lawyers at the beginning. No firm
on earth seems to be prepared to take on a massive case on a no win, no
fee basis because clinical negligence is the most specialised and
complex area of civil
law.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000393">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
know that there are concerns on not only the Opposition side but the
Government side of the Committee, and that there are divisions in the
House of Commons on the issue and certainly across the board in the
House of Lords. I ask the Government to reconsider the measure, because
it is thought to be very cruel outside Parliament. In effect, it is
cruel; it is not meant to be cruel, but it might create a disastrous
situation for parents. It will be unbelievably worse for them, because
they will not be able to provide for their loved one for years to come,
which is the current position in litigation for clinical
negligence.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000394">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
am making an appeal to the Government. I ask them to think again about
the matter and to reflect between now and the conclusion of the
Committee’s proceedings; I can tell the Minister that there will
be an avalanche of opposition up the corridor and that it would be good
to think carefully about the change before the Bill reaches the other
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000395">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
Opposition feel strongly that clinical negligence must remain within
scope. There are about 1 million adverse incidents, as they are called,
in the NHS every year, about 10,000 of which lead to action being taken
against the NHS. In themselves, those statistics give the lie to the
assertion that we often read in the press that there is a compensation
culture and that people are keen to seek redress through the courts on
such matters. On the contrary, it is the other side of the coin, and
the right hon. Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd made the point about the
behaviour of health authorities.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000399">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I am sure
that we have all had experience of the behaviour of aggrieved parties
at our surgeries and when dealing with complaints procedures. There are
comprehensive, if somewhat labyrinthine complaints procedures. My
experience is that in most cases, individuals want an explanation,
perhaps an apology, and the assurance that whatever has happened will
not happen again in other cases. They seek compensation, if that is the
right word, only when there is an absolute need and because negligence
has caused harm that needs
redress.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000400">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">What
is swimming around in the background is that somehow the NHS is abused
through the court process by claims for negligence and that that is one
reason why the amendments may be necessary. On the contrary—I
entirely agree with the right hon. Gentleman that the experience of
many people who find themselves forced to sue a health authority is
that they are the worst people to sue. There may be a number of reasons
for that. There may be pressure from the alleged tortfeasors that they
do not wish to admit culpability, and pressure is put on the litigation
authority. The authority may be overly bureaucratic in the way it
behaves, but the opinion not only of those who have had to take action,
but of many judges, particularly cost judges, who have reviewed the
behaviour of health authorities and the NHSLA is that the primary
role—I go as far as saying the primary role rather than a shared
role—in inflating costs and delaying proceeding lies with
defendants in such
cases.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000401">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
will not go over the wrongly given figures for costs on each side, and
how much are costs and how much is compensation, but I think the
Government have learned their lesson, and have apologised for the
figures that were wrongly given to the House earlier. I say for the
avoidance of doubt that we do not approach the matter as a cause of
great concern. What is of great concern is ensuring that as little
suffering as possible is caused through negligent treatment or
behaviour of the national health service. None of that detracts from
the fact that, given the debate in the Chamber at the moment, the huge
respect that we all have for the national health service, the high
regard in which it is held, and the very high rating that the public
give to the NHS, they are concerned about the damage being done by the
Government. In an organisation of that size, there will always be areas
of neglect. We have seen that with hospitals, with individuals, and
with individual tragic cases. I will come to one or two in a moment. It
is essential that such matters are dealt with.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000402">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">Let us
consider cost. Legal aid for clinical negligence cases is the cheapest
route for both litigating parties when looking at the alternatives.
Taking clinical negligence out of scope for legal aid would cost the
state more overall if access to justice remains possible for all
deserving claimants. Most costs will simply be transferred from the
Ministry of Justice to the NHS, but the Ministry of Justice’s
impact statement takes no account whatever of
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000403">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If
many people are denied access to justice, which is not the stated
policy intention, the result of the reforms will be additional expense
for the state overall. For example, the Ministry of Justice estimates
that it would save just £10 million a year by taking clinical
negligence out of scope—I have heard a different estimate, but
it would certainly be between £10 million and £20
million—and we estimate that if all cases that are currently
successful under legal aid were successful under the revised no win, no
fee arrangements, the cost to the NHS of investigating new claims and
settling previously legally aided cases under the reformed system would
amount to at least as much, and I will return to those figures later.
That is mainly because the NHS will have to pay expensive insurance
premiums to cover the cost of medical experts’ reports. It will
also have to spend money investigating and defending more spurious
claims generated by throwing the market open to non-specialist
solicitors and claim farmers without any of the controls offered by
legal aid. We will address that area when we reach part 2 of the Bill,
but we have concerns not only about the Bill’s restrictions on
access to justice but about more spurious claims. The Bill is doubly
defective in that
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000404">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Later
we will no doubt hear the Minister praise Sir Rupert
Jackson’s proposals on the reform of no win, no fee. In the very
same report on the subject of legal aid, Lord Justice Jackson
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000405">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Legal
aid is still available for some key areas of litigation, in particular
clinical negligence, housing cases and judicial review. It is vital
that legal aid remains in these areas. However, the continued
tightening of financial eligibility criteria, so as to exclude people
who could not possibly afford to litigate, inhibits access to justice
in those key areas. In my view any further tightening of the financial
eligibility criteria would be
unacceptable.”<a class="bkMark" name="11090720001028">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If
that is not good enough for the Minister, I suggest that he reads the
NHS Litigation Authority’s response to the consultation, which
criticises the removal of legal aid. I will quote one or two
paragraphs, because I want the arguments on the record, as they are
most persuasive. They come from exactly those proponents of reform in
the system that the Minister relies on when wearing another hat, and
they also come from exactly the people whom one might think would be
the beneficiaries—defendant insurers or, in this case, the
NHSLA. The NHSLA

have serious concerns over the proposal to withdraw legal aid from

question whether CFAs are likely to be readily available to fund many

               <p class="hs_brev">“we
have doubts about the operation of a scheme which, according to
paragraph 4.167, would cover high-value obstetric cases in particular.
No details are provided as to how such a scheme would operate and what
the eligibility criteria would be. For example, would this scheme only
cover cases of the most severe brain damage, or would it also extend to
claims for moderate brain damage, shoulder dystocia or to children

disabilities?<a class="bkMark" name="11090720001032">&#160;</a>

believe that the position needs to be made much clearer before we could
consider supporting such a proposal. We note, for example, that in
paragraph 4.53 it is proposed that…‘very serious cases of
negligence’ might receive funding. How will it be possible to
define ‘very serious negligence’? Will this be akin to
the manslaughter test? In truth, we suspect that it will be impossible
to achieve a satisfactory definition, at least prior to any judgment.

sufficient to amount to criminal
negligence.”<a class="bkMark" name="11090720001033">&#160;</a>

have all received a lot of briefings on this subject, so I suspect that
Members have read some extremely heart-rending cases. It is said that
hard cases make bad law, but there are so many clear cases,
particularly of children with injuries of the very greatest severity,
that are occurring on a daily or weekly basis and being reported in the

get into court without the provision of legal aid. Let me cite one or
two of those cases.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000411">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Sophie Tyler
is a 14-year-old—Members may have read about her in the papers
over the past two weeks—who went into Birmingham
children’s hospital for a gall-stone procedure and a spinal
epidural device was left in her body for two days. Clearly, there was
negligence in that case. Sophie’s solicitor said it was
important that lessons were learned and he pointed out that the case
could not have come to court without legal
aid.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000412">&#160;</a>

important, both to protect future patient welfare and to provide public
reassurance, that the hospital learns important lessons from what
happened to Sophie…We very much hope that the staff responsible
have already been retrained so that similar tragedies can be avoided
and I am glad that they have now admitted
responsibility…Although, no amount of compensation will ever
turn back the clock for Sophie—she will need specialist care and
support for the rest of her life…The trust’s full

               <p class="tabbed">Let
me mention the case of Andrew Green, who suffered from cerebral palsy
due to clinical negligence at birth. He recently went to No. 10 Downing
street to deliver a letter asking the Prime Minister and Lord
Chancellor to think again on these legal aid reforms. His case is
perhaps even more relevant to the case. Andrew’s mother, Julie,
was initially told that her negligence claim would fail, so she
enlisted the support of a specialist legal aid lawyer, which eventually
resulted in a seven-figure compensation package. Using legal aid, the
Green family was able to secure financial support to enrich the quality
of Andrew’s life through care and support. The Green family
would never have been able to afford a lawyer through private funding.
In Andrew’s letter to the Prime Minister, he
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000416">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Regardless
of the cost to the government, legal aid medical negligence is part of
civil rights that everybody should have access to, whether

money.”<a class="bkMark" name="11090720001037">&#160;</a>

               <p class="hs_brev">“My
parents were not in a financial position to support my case against the
NHS Trust Diana Princess of Wales hospital, which lasted eight years,
when they found out I had cerebral palsy due to a mismanaged delivery
when I was born, and so had to rely on legal aid. Even then, it was a
great struggle to even receive admittance or an apology, let alone, a
financial reward which was much needed…The award from the case,
firstly, and possibly most importantly, allowed us to change our highly
unsuitable terraced house to a bungalow, where my confidence and skills
could develop. It would have been almost impossible for me to learn to
walk in my old house and the fact my bedroom was upstairs was very
impractical. Now, I am able to walk and even play football totally
unaided, despite being told I would never be able to walk…the
funding has allowed me to gain access to appropriate and much better
education, where the staff at the schools have supported me to keep
going and train. All these have been radical changes to my life that
before almost certainly would not have been possible, but my
achievements in computing would never have been possible without legal
aid. I now own my own company that sells the software I produce, as
well as setting up and owning multiple
websites”.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720001038">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The two cases to which the hon. Gentleman refers
have several things in common. First, they were very serious cases in
terms of damage to individuals. Secondly, they were fairly long drawn
out due to intransigence by the defendant authority. Thirdly, they were
successful, which meant that all the costs to the legal aid fund were
paid by the
defendant.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000422">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Those are three good points concisely made. To
add to the last point, I note that the success rate in clinical
negligence cases has increased from 80% to 91%. What that says about
the defendant, I leave for other Members to judge, but it certainly
means that the LSC has paid out less money year on year. In some ways,
publicity is intrusive, but obviously, the claimants in the cases that
I mentioned wished their cases to be publicised for others’
benefit and to explain what happened.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000423">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Other Members
might have read today about the cases of Cayden Davies, a brain-damaged
child, and Annie Burchell, a severely physically injured child. The
cases were similarly serious and similarly reliant on legal aid. I drew
three points from that. The first involves the necessity of legal aid
in the UK. The second is the consequences of legal aid. That is why I
read out the Andrew Green case. Legal aid utterly transformed that
child’s life from a state of despair to a life that he can live
not only productively but successfully and in comfort, playing sport
and setting up a business. The third point concerns the difficulties.
The letter from Andrew Green
says:<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000424">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“My

               <p>Even
under the current regime, these are not easy rows to hoe. I pay tribute
to the individuals and their families, and to their lawyers, who
persisted in the cases.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000425">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Before I
finish, I have two other points for the Minister to answer in his
response. First, Action against Medical Accidents, an independent and
well-respected charity, estimates the net cost of the changes at
£1.8 million. That is, AVMA says that they will save £17
million but cost about £18.8 million. If that is right, why are
the Government persisting with the changes? Secondly, we need clarity
on exactly how the Government propose to deal with the problems that
will arise if legal aid for clinical negligence is withdrawn and the
reformed no win, no fee provisions go ahead. The costs of getting to
the stage where a no win, no fee agreement can come into play are
estimated at up to £50,000 in complex cases, due to the need for
medical reports and to other costs that are not recoverable at that
stage. If those costs are not recoverable, that will be an effective
barrier to cases proceeding.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000426">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Such cases
are compelling, and not just due to the individual circumstances, which
we should put aside and consider the lessons to be learned. What is the
current product of legal aid in clinical negligence cases, and what are
the risks if it is withdrawn for a relatively small saving in public
funds?<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000427">&#160;</a>

                  </span> I just want to
make a few brief comments. I have some sympathy with the amendments

<div class="columnNumber">

                  </div>against Medical Accidents. Its chief executive is, in fact, a
constituent of mine and I have had regular contact with him over a
number of years, particularly about the issue of the duty of candour,
which was referred to in an earlier contribution to the debate. I hope
that it might be possible to get more movement on that issue, because
clearly it involves what are often the most distressing cases and those
where the largest financial settlements might be
available.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000429">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If there is
not going to be any movement on that issue, I hope that at the very
least strong pressure will be put on other Government
Departments—such as the Department of Health, but not only the
Department of Health—to ensure that they are much more open and
transparent, and less obstructive, when it comes to litigation. We have
heard that the Department of Health is not exactly prompt in seeking to
tackle these issues. If we can do something culturally about ensuring
that the Department of Health responds more promptly and more openly,
that will be beneficial to people who are fighting medical negligence
cases, and in relation to other Departments more promptness and
openness will be beneficial in other cases where an individual is
facing a large Government
Department.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000430">&#160;</a>

duty of candour might be the subject of debate in the main Chamber at
the moment. That duty can make a contribution, in terms of addressing
issues related to medical negligence. If it forces just one, two, three
or four more clinicians to come forward with a statement that accepts
that there was a mistake made at a very early stage, that could take
heat out of the proceedings. It might not necessarily be in this Bill,
but I hope that in the other Bill that is being debated at the

duty of candour is
reflected.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000431">&#160;</a>

the scope of legal aid to bring clinical negligence cases into the

by the public authority, a significant breach of human rights by the
authority or an abuse of a child or vulnerable adult. Amendments 169
and 223 also seek to widen the scope of legal aid to cover all claims
involving personal injury, death, assault or battery and false
imprisonment that occur while an individual is in the care of a public
authority, as well as claims for clinical negligence brought against

other priority areas, such as those concerning physical safety, liberty

propose an exceptional funding scheme to ensure that some clinical

legal aid under the Human Rights Act 1998 or EU law. When considering
whether exceptional funding should be granted, we will take account of
the ability of the client to present their own case, the complexity of
the matter, the importance of the issues at stake and all other
relevant circumstances. As a result, the impact assessment estimates
that we will continue to spend £6 million of the £16
million legal aid that we currently spend on representation in clinical
negligence cases.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000436">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The right
hon. Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd and the hon. Member for Hammersmith
seemed to suggest that costs to the NHS litigation authority would be
increased by ending legal aid. The impact assessment on civil
litigation costs shows that there should be a saving of £50
million to the NHSLA. The Ministry of Justice is discussing with the
NHSLA and other stakeholders how the process of claims can be improved.
I am pleased to tell my right hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and
Wallington that those discussions will continue. Despite the many
opinions voiced against the NHS this evening, in my meetings with it
the NHSLA has been most productive and helpful; it wants to move this
issue forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000437">&#160;</a>

claims. I cannot talk about individual situations—I am sure that
they exist—in which claims have been fought, perhaps to a degree
or extent that the hon. Gentleman finds unacceptable, but I am not
qualified to comment on the individual legal circumstances. However, I
can tell him that the Government have taken up the matter with the
NHSLA. Indeed, we believe that the commissioning of reports can be
improved by working with the NHSLA in clinical negligence cases; for
example, joint expert reports should be commissioned whenever possible.
It will not always be possible, but it could significantly lower costs
and save time. In turn, that would encourage the early notification of
claims.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000439">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">As the right
hon. Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd mentioned, one aspect of clinical
negligence cases is the significant up-front costs involved in
obtaining expert evidence. Following consultation, the Government
accept that this is a significant problem, which is why the Bill
introduced a tightly drawn power to allow the recoverability of
after-the-event insurance premiums in clinical negligence cases.
Details will be set out in regulations. I should also point that
qualified one-way cost shifting will mean that in the majority of cases
in which damages for personal injury are sought—that includes
clinical negligence—the claimant will not be at risk of having
to pay the winning

               <p class="tabbed">With regard
to the other claims that would be brought into scope by amendments 169
and 223, it is important to emphasise that schedule 1 makes legal aid
available to the most serious damages claims against public
authorities. The Bill ensures that funding may be made available for
damages claims against public authorities if the matter concerns an
abuse of position or power, a significant breach of human rights,
allegations of abuse of a child or vulnerable adult, or allegations of
sexual offences. Right hon. and hon. Members should also be aware that
funding may be made available for the judicial review of enactments,
decisions, acts or omissions; that is clearly another way of holding
public authorities to account. We will continue to spend approximately
£10 million on judicial review as a similar public
law remedy.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000443">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">As members of
the Committee will be aware, we have had to make some difficult choices
about legal aid and have focused limited resources on those who need
them the most and on the most serious cases that justify legal advice

available for each and every claim involving a public authority, but it
will be available for the most serious cases and to address serious
abuses, so I urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his

been unconvincing. I hope that that might be an indication that the

                  </strong> The amendment addresses an important omission.
Under the terms of the Bill, only cases of international abduction will
be covered by legal aid. Domestic abduction—abduction within the
UK—will not be so covered. Domestic child abduction is
considerably more prevalent than international abduction and the child
welfare issues are exactly the same. The child is usually taken by a
non-resident parent who has been denied all contact with the child.
They have been taken by somebody whom they may not know that well to
somewhere they may not know that well, whether it is inside or outside
the UK. Expecting a bereft parent, regardless of whether or not the
child remains in the UK, to navigate the court system without advice
and representation is not just untenable but cruel. I do not wish to go
through the law in detail because there are people here who know the
law much better than I do. Nonetheless, it is a complex area of law
that involves both civil and criminal law. It is different if it
happens in the UK or abroad or if it happens in Northern Ireland.
Imagine a parent who has had their child taken from them and who may
believe that they are still in the UK. How a parent who is in the
middle of such a traumatic experience can be expected to cope without
advice, support and representation beggars belief. To distinguish
between children abducted abroad and children abducted in the UK is
perverse in the extreme. No one should be placed in that position
without access to support, advice and representation, and I urge the
Minister to accept the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000466">&#160;</a>

separation. That move is welcome, and it will help to ensure that the
financially weaker member of a couple is able to apply for such a lump
sum to cover their legal costs, guaranteeing equality of arms. At the
moment, however, the Bill does not provide legal aid to enable the
financially weaker party to make an application for such a sum. Such
provision seems to us to be entirely logical and sensible and the
purpose of the straightforward amendment is to add it to the Bill. I
hope that the Government will accept the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000468">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
191 takes us back to mediation in, I hope, a positive way. As we have
heard, mediation will continue to receive funding under the Bill. That
is welcome, but although mediation is a highly valuable non-court
option it is not suitable for all cases. When mediation fails or is
deemed unsuitable by the mediator, neither party will be able to choose
other publicly funded non-court options, such as collaborative law,
which I shall come on to in a moment, or to obtain publicly funded
legal representation to continue negotiations and ultimately pursue
their claim in the courts, if
required.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000469">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendment sets out narrow circumstances in which other options may be
made available. It states that prior to commencing mediation the
mediator must assess both parties to decide whether mediation is
suitable. Mediation requires both parties to voluntarily agree to take
part. Mediation can be effective when both parties voluntarily enter
into it in good faith and demonstrate a willingness to listen to and
consider each other’s views, but if one party is not properly
engaged with the process, it is unlikely to work, and might
fail.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000470">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Many
couples have significant issues relating to their children and their
finances that are not easily resolved in mediation, and often one party
simply refuses to mediate. For example, mediation is unlikely to
succeed in a contact dispute in which there are no allegations of
domestic abuse and the parent with residence fails to properly engage
in a voluntary dispute resolution process. Even if a compromise is
reached, if it is not converted into a court order, there is often
little chance that the parent with residence will adhere to its
terms.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000471">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Under
the Bill, once mediation has failed, the non-resident parent will have
no way of pursuing the other party in the courts, save appearing before
the court in person. When mediation has failed, or is assessed as
unsuitable, it should be possible to continue negotiations via
solicitors, because the overwhelming majority of cases are settled
without recourse to the courts, many of them through negotiations
conducted by lawyers. It is a small minority that end up at trial, and
therefore, where appropriate, public funding should be made available
for that.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000472">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">With no
expert legal advice on law and procedure available, some parents will
be forced to leave issues unresolved, which is often not in their best
interests or 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 344<a class="bkMark" name="Column344">&#160;</a>
                  </div>those of their children. For example, if non-resident parents do not
pursue legitimate contact applications, their children often lose
contact with them. Others will be forced to use the courts without
legal representation, in proceedings issued either by them or the other
party. One party might pay for legal representation privately, while
the other is unable to afford it. A parent who has no contact with
their child and whose ex-partner refuses to co-operate in or to attend
mediation, will be expected to conduct their own application for
contact with the child. Finally, many will be put off by the idea of
representing themselves even if the courts improve their ability to
deal with litigants in person, which seems doubtful. People will simply
not progress their rights if they cannot obtain legal representation,
because they will feel unsupported or they lack the confidence or
skills to represent themselves. Research by the Rights of Women
organisation shows that 73% of its survey respondents were reluctant to
represent themselves in family law issues. The net result is that, if
cases are pushed into mediation, success rates will worsen and the
whole process will be
undermined.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000473">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
220 deals specifically with the issue of collaborative law, inserting
it as an alternative. Collaborative law, although I am not familiar
with it, is a recognised alternative method for resolving family
disputes outside court that could offer another workable alternative to
the court process for legally aided parties and another opportunity to
reduce the number of cases taking up court
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000474">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
the collaborative process, each party appoints its own lawyer and,
instead of a series of negotiations by letter or telephone, the lawyers
and their parties seek to resolve matters in several face-to-face
meetings. Each of the parties has their lawyer by their side throughout
the process and so benefits from legal advice as they proceed. Both
parties sign an agreement at the outset, confirming that, if the
process fails and the couple decide to pursue their claim through the
court, those representing them must withdraw and new legal
representatives be instructed to represent them in the court process.
Family lawyers wishing to offer the process must attend specialist
training. The skills required and the techniques employed by
collaborative lawyers are similar to those used by mediators in
mediation. Many lawyers who have LSC contracts have already trained as
collaborative
lawyers.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000475">&#160;</a>
               </p>

addition to mediation, which could be offered to parents as an option.
Advantages of the collaborative process over mediation are that the
parties can receive legal advice throughout and that the lawyers assist
with the drafting and submitting to the court of the consent order once
agreement has been
reached.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000477">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
collaborative process should be available to all. Currently, legal aid
is not available for the process, denying people requiring publicly
funded representation in private family law cases access to the
collaborative option. Unless the same information on available
processes is offered to clients seeking public funding, they are not
getting equal and proper access to justice. In preserving parenting
relationships and avoiding parental conflict, the use of the
collaborative process is just as effective in 
<div class="columnNumber">

                  </div>encouraging effective co-parenting as other forms of alternative dispute
resolution, and might be more effective than
some.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000478">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
2008, Resolution commissioned a survey of collaborative family law,
covering the two previous years, and respondents represented 30% of the
then trained collaborative lawyers. The research showed that, where
clients would be suitable for either mediation or the collaborative
process, some would choose collaborative law over mediation because
they felt that it could offer more support if their lawyer was there
beside them when the issues were
discussed.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000479">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Some
respondents who carried out publicly funded work report that they had
clients eligible for public funding whose cases would have been
suitable for the collaborative process had public funding been
available. Many lawyers undertaking legal aid work in private family
cases with clients who are suitable for collaborative law are unable to
act for them as collaborative lawyers solely or mainly because legal
aid is not currently available for the process. In conclusion on that
amendment, as the Government are promoting mediation so heavily as an
alternative dispute resolution, why have they not considered
collaborative dispute resolution as an acceptable
alternative?<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000480">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> We have a situation that is anomalous and creates a
perverse incentive, which I am sure the Minister will want to consider.
Under the current provisions in the Bill, legal aid will be available
for mediation provided in relation to family disputes and civil legal
services provided in connection with the mediation of family disputes.
That would, for example, include conveyancing services where they are
provided in the course of giving effect to arrangements for the
resolution of family disputes, and where they have been in relation to
the dispute under the arrangements made for the purposes of this part
of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000486">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
anomaly is that where settlement is reached without mediation, legal
aid is not available, even for conveyancing services that are provided
to give effect to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 346<a class="bkMark" name="Column346">&#160;</a>
                  </div>the arrangements that have been arrived at, but that as funding is
available for the mediation itself, it would arguably create an
incentive for cases that could be settled without mediation and simply
between the two parties ending up being sent to mediation and
unnecessarily attracting the additional costs to the public purse,
simply because they would attract legal aid funding. It would also of
course build in a delay in the successful settlement of such disputes.
So the amendment is designed to extend the availability of legal aid
services that have been provided to give effect to agreed settlements,
including conveyancing services. It would remove the incentive to refer
cases to mediation unnecessarily, while retaining the incentive to
refer cases to mediation where settlement is otherwise unlikely. It
would also, of course, create an additional incentive to settle, even
in the absence of mediation.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000487">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I do not
intend to press the amendment to a Division, but I hope that the
Minister will consider the perversity in what is provided and seek to
ensure that those who are able to arrive at settlements of their family
disputes without the need for mediation are treated in the same way as
those who have taken the mediation route when it comes to giving effect
to such
agreements.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000488">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> This rather lengthy group of amendments concerns
legal aid for private family law cases, with the general theme of
increasing the scope of legal aid so that more cases—in the case
of some amendments, many more cases—would be covered.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000489">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I want to
speak first to amendment 162, which seeks to keep all family disputes
as a category within the scope of legal aid. That would completely
undermine our targeted approach to legal aid reform. We have to reduce
expenditure on legal aid, but we also want less reliance on litigation
as a means of solving problems. We have to make tough choices and
target legal aid on those who need it most. The amendments also go
against the shared view in the House that savings to family legal aid
must be made. The hon. Member for Hammersmith, for example, has
previously made it clear that the Opposition would now be making cuts
to private family legal aid if they were in power.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000490">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We have
sought to prioritise legal aid for the cases where there is the
greatest risk of harm and where it is most needed—for example,
for domestic violence remedies or child parties. The amendments,
however, would retain funding across the board, without regard to
relative priority and alternative methods of resolving disputes, and
would lose an estimated £170 million of annual
savings.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000491">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
remind the Committee that after the changes we will still be spending
£120 million a year on funding for private family law, including
domestic violence. We will be spending an extra £10 million a
year on mediation, and exceptional funding will be available where
required for out-of-scope cases. The total funding for all family legal
aid including public family cases will still be well over £400
million. Although money is important, I appreciate that it is not only
about the money. The Government believe that the approach to, and the
culture of, litigation in this country must change. The family justice
review will make its final recommendations later this year, and it has
indicated a clear direction of travel towards a family justice
structure that directs people at every stage towards resolving their
disputes without recourse to litigation. We will retain legal aid for
mediation,

               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 191
essentially seeks to retain legal aid for cases in private family law
proceedings where mediation has failed or has been deemed unsuitable.
Given that we already require both privately paying and publicly funded
clients to consider mediation before bringing proceedings, it is
difficult to see how this would change the status quo. We would end up
retaining legal aid for all or most family cases, so the arguments that
I have just outlined would apply. It might also actively discourage
people from trying to succeed with mediation if a failed mediation were
to become the route to legal aid.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000495">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 231
also relates to mediation, and proposes that legal help should be
available in family cases in order to give effect to a settlement that
is reached without recourse to mediation. As I understand it, the
intention is to allow access to legal aid for conveyancing and drawing
up a financial agreement or similar formal steps, as well as attendant
advice, for those people who are able to reach an agreement themselves
without funded mediation. The suggestion is that this would be
cost-effective by reducing the demand for unnecessary mediation, where
the main purpose is simply to seek the legal services that go with
mediation.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000496">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Although I
have some sympathy with the intention to encourage the resolution of
problems outside court in a cost-effective way, I fear that the
proposal is impractical. It would be very difficult to limit, and there
is obvious scope for claims that some sort of agreement was in place in
order to access legal advice. We think that the likely cost would be at
least £10 million a year. There follows the question whether we
should focus legal aid resources on people who can reach agreement
themselves without the need for either a lawyer or a mediator, and the
Government think not.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000497">&#160;</a>

seeks to make legal aid available for collaborative law as well as
mediation in private family cases, and I note that the hon. Member for
Hammersmith asked why that is not in the Bill. The Bill does not
exclude the possibility of funding collaborative law, because clause 7
refers to
funding<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000498">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We would not
rule out the funding of collaborative law to some extent at some point.
However, because it involves two lawyers rather than one mediator, with
all the costs that that entails, we do not plan to fund it at this
stage, bearing in mind its current uncertain value 
<div class="columnNumber">

seeks to extend the availability of legal aid funding to cover measures
to prevent purely domestic as well as international child abduction. We
initially proposed that legal aid would remain to secure the return of
a child who had been abducted overseas. After listening to consultation
responses, however, we have decided to extend it to cover prevention of
abduction in such cases, for example for a prohibited steps order. That
makes sense on the basis of the complexity, the cost and the consequent
practical disadvantages involved in dealing with a foreign
jurisdiction. I hope the hon. Member for Makerfield is pleased with
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000501">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">We
do not consider purely domestic cases to raise the same difficulties as
international abduction cases, because a resident parent would not be
dealing with a foreign jurisdiction. Seek and locate orders, which are
commonly employed in cases of children being removed within the
jurisdiction without the other parent’s consent, are relatively
straightforward to obtain. Many domestic agencies, including the
police, can be engaged in trying to retrieve a child without the need
for proceedings in court. If domestic violence or child abuse, and so
an additional risk factor, is involved, legal aid would be
available.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000504">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Any abduction in the UK starts with a domestic
abduction, which may lead to abduction abroad. It seems to be more
sensible that funding for legal aid should be available at the first
stage, when the child is seized, rather than waiting for the child to
be taken out of the country, which would be far more expensive and far
more
troublesome.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000505">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Amendments
155 to 158 would keep legal aid for all parties in private family cases
in which the court has made a child a party to the case. The
Government, of course, intend to keep legal aid for child parties in
such circumstances. We do not accept, however, that, as a matter of
routine in cases in which a child requires representation, adult family
members should also get access to legal aid. Just because a child needs
to be represented, it does not follow that the case would be so complex
as to require representation for all parties. Of course, by their
nature, some cases will be complex, as in the examples that many of us
know, and in some circumstances people will not be able to represent
themselves. The exceptional funding scheme will ensure that legal aid
will be available where required—those cases in which people
genuinely could not manage by themselves, and in which a failure to
provide legal aid would be likely to breach an individual’s
right to legal aid under the Human Rights Act 1998 or EU
law.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000511">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Amendments
142 and 190 seek to make legal aid available to eligible applicants in
ancillary relief and corresponding civil partnership proceedings who
wish to apply to the courts for an order for the other party to fund or
pay towards their legal costs in the proceedings. As the amendments
anticipate, we propose to make changes to court powers in ancillary
relief cases and the equivalent proceedings relating to dissolution of
civil partnership in order to enable the court to make orders for
payment against a party who has the means to fund the costs of legal
representation for the other party. In other words, although legal aid
will no longer be available for such cases unless domestic violence is
present, there will be an option in some ancillary relief cases for a
measure of funding to be made available by one party to the other. We
accept that that will not apply in all cases; nor should it, as most
cases do not present a need for extensive legal representation.
Nevertheless, it will provide a route for private funding of legal
costs in some cases where it is appropriate to the need and the
available
resources.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000512">&#160;</a>

have considered whether funding should be available for applications
for and the enforcement of such orders for payment. We appreciate that
in some cases, there will be disagreements about the amount of assets
available to the party being asked to fund both sets of legal
representatives. However, we do not think that it will be necessary to
go into extensive and expensive detail about the other party’s
assets at the application stage. The power is designed to be flexible
and to allow for staged orders or orders covering specific arguments or
points in the proceedings. It is not necessary to cover in one
application every possible argument for the entire
proceedings.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000513">&#160;</a>

readily apparent whether the other party can afford to fund his or her
own legal representation, and basic factual information about the
couple’s standard of living before their break up and the other
party’s job or other declared sources of income or assets, as
well as any available bank statements and so forth, will be relatively
straightforward to collate, particularly as standard disclosure of such
matters is required from both parties before the first appointment in
the proceedings. That information is likely to be sufficient to enable
the argument, for example, that the other party is being less than
forthcoming about their available assets and that it is appropriate for
them to provide funding for initial argument about those assets. If
appropriate, further applications can be made subsequently to cover
later stages of the
proceedings.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000514">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">In
some cases, the party seeking the order may have a solicitor working
for them on a contingency basis, on the expectation that the order will
be granted. In any event, it would be inconsistent to provide legal aid
for the purposes of disclosure, or other issues relating to application
or enforcement, in such cases but not in other ancillary relief cases
where the issues are similar and we do not consider it appropriate to
maintain legal aid funding. Essentially, it should be within
the capacity of most litigants in person to explain their former
partner’s basic financial position to a judge and point to
relevant evidence. In very exceptional cases where that is not at all
possible and the applicant has no form of advice or assistance and no
means of securing it, exceptional funding might be available if funding
is necessary to avoid a breach of the Human Rights Act or EU law. I
urge hon. Members to withdraw their

responses, particularly in this case, as he has misrepresented the
position that we set out clearly. He is right that we have not
maintained throughout the process that we wish a wholesale restoration
into scope of private family law. We accept, as we have accepted
throughout, that savings must be made from the legal aid budget.
However, there are crudities and problems with how the Government have
gone about it, and we have sought—I thought in a positive
way—to perfect the proposals with relatively minor but important
changes, in the spirit that the Government have adopted in relation to
considering alternative dispute resolution and in ways that would make
the system work better for those party to it without costing a great
deal more money. However, he has chosen not to accept that, which does
not come as much of a surprise.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000516">&#160;</a>

press amendments 190 and 220. However, in amendment 191, we
are making a clear point that the circumstances for mediation should be
narrowly defined and controlled. The mediation system has the potential
to be misused, or at least used in a way that to all
parties—certainly to a trained mediator—is clearly
inappropriate. The Government’s answer to that is, “Well,
that is tough.” Either nothing happens and the issue remains
unresolved: one party becomes the victim to the other or one party
tries to get into court as a litigant in person. All of those are very
unsatisfactory answers and I hoped for a slightly more constructive
response to that but we did not get it.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000517">&#160;</a>

The fact that we are not dealing with a foreign jurisdiction does not
make English law simple to deal with when people are in a particularly
stressful situation. It seems perverse that parents can get assistance
when the child is being taken abroad, but not when it is taken to the
other end of the country. To give the parent an extra hurdle to prove
that they cannot manage without support, to make it exceptional, in a
circumstance like that, which I would have said was exceptional in any
case, is perverse. I shall therefore press my amendment to a

               <p>The Bar Council in
particular argues that in paragraph 10, the Bill uses a
narrow definition of domestic abuse, which it believes is inconsistent
with that used by ACPO. The definition that ACPO adheres to
is:<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000559">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Any

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
reason for the amendments is that it is not understood why, under
schedule 1, the provision of legal aid is limited to provisions
relating to the children, and not the associated financial remedy
proceedings linked in with the children. Surely, the child’s
economic welfare is vital in abuse cases, particularly given the higher
incidence of abuse in low-income
households.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000564">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Bar Council’s amendments would bring within scope, first,
proceedings leading to an order under section 37 of the Children Act
1989, in other words, directing investigation where a care or
supervision order may be appropriate; and secondly, all subsequent
steps in family proceedings once a section 37 order has been made. The
amendments would also ensure, like those proposed for paragraph 10,
that the person against whom allegations of abuse are made is within
scope. They would be important additions to the Bill, and I would be
interested to hear what the Minister has to say in his
response.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000565">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> First, let me associate myself with the comments of
my right hon. Friend the Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd and, in
particular, with my amendment 218, which covers substantially similar
ground to the amendment tabled in relation to the definition of
domestic violence. I wish to take the discussion a little further. The
purpose of my amendment is to align the definition of abuse for the
purposes of the gateway to legal aid for victims of domestic abuse
involved in private family law matters relating to children and
finances with that adopted by the Association of Chief Police Officers,
as my right hon. Friend has also sought to do.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000566">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Anyone who has
looked at what the Government are proposing in respect of the
definition is at an absolute loss to understand why they will not just
accept the ACPO definition. It is now well established and understood
and, as a result, means much less scope for argument and delay in the
courts while people establish whether they fall within the particular
definition. There is now good case law and history to be made clear
about what does or does not constitute abuse within the ACPO
definition. If Ministers believe that the definition that they are
proposing for the Bill covers the same ground as the ACPO definition,
why not just adopt the ACPO definition? If they consider that it will
do something different from the ACPO definition, I should like to
understand why they consider that something different is appropriate
when it comes to domestic abuse in relation to the provision of legal
aid.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000567">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Minister is nodding, so perhaps he will offer some clarification on
such matters. I have to warn him that there has been no endorsement of
the differentiation in matters of legal aid from any of the
organisations that have contacted us about it. I am sure that they have
contacted those on the Treasury Bench, too. Perhaps the hon. Member for
Ipswich can tell me one that
has.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000568">&#160;</a>

have made it absolutely clear that the ACPO definition is the right

               <p class="tabbed">The Minister
appears to believe that there will be an explanation. It will be an
explanation that I very much looking forward to hearing, and I am sure
that the many organisations that have been in contact with us will want
to consider it with great care,

               <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull East will be discussing
other concerns, as indeed has the right hon. Member for Dwyfor
Meirionnydd, in relation to what evidence the Government actually take
in respect of determining that domestic abuse has been present, and
some real concerns have been expressed about the narrowness of the way
in which they are approaching the matter. It is also unclear from the
Bill whether there will be provision for legal aid for victims to
obtain the initial legal advice and to get the warning letter sent to
their abusers, which will be a prerequisite of getting into some of the
situations that the Bill suggests will be recognised within the ambit
of the definition of domestic abuse. It is important that the Minister
clarifies whether 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 355<a class="bkMark" name="Column355">&#160;</a>
                  </div>legal aid will be available in relation to such warning letters;
otherwise, only those cases where the risk of violence poses an
immediate danger necessitating a same-day application report for an
injunction will receive legal
aid.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000574">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Minister will also be well aware of the significant under-reporting of
domestic violence. Indeed, a survey undertaken by Rights of Women and
shared among members of the Committee showed that the majority of women
had not reported domestic violence to the police or other authorities.
Given that much of the way in which the policy will be
applied will come through under regulations, it is important
that Ministers think widely about the evidence that they will regard as
acceptable to show that domestic abuse has taken place. That could
include not just the non-molestation orders and legal actions that are
proposed in the Bill, but evidence that someone has accessed domestic
abuse services, a rape crisis centre, a women’s refuge or other
similar organisations in the community, or help from social services,
or, for that matter, where a mediator has determined that a case is not
suitable for mediation because of the presence of domestic abuse. I
look forward to hearing the Minister’s comments on the
willingness of the Government to take a wider range of evidence in
relation to domestic abuse.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000575">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I also
highlight for the Minister that we know there is a particularly high
risk of domestic abuse taking place when a woman is pregnant, or
shortly after the birth of a new baby, or—more pertinently
perhaps for the Bill—at the point of separation and particularly
when child contact matters are in dispute. It is therefore particularly
important that, where there is already additional tension and
difficulty in a family, we make certain that there is proper legal
advice to ensure that the best interests of all family members, but
especially the children, are properly protected.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000576">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I hope that
Ministers will revisit the domestic abuse proposals to ensure that they
do not increase the obstacles faced by victims of domestic abuse
seeking help, that they ensure that victims are able to obtain legal
aid for early advice on intervention, and that there is absolute
clarity about the definition of domestic abuse, which is well
understood, well accepted and will serve to cut through a
great deal of delay and uncertainty for those who are experiencing this
particularly nasty form of violence.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000577">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Amendments 229 and 230 give the director of legal
aid casework the leeway to decide whether abuse has occurred for the
purposes of awarding legal aid. Amendment 229 would insert the
following:<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000578">&#160;</a>

cases of:<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000579">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">The provisions
leave open the means by which it is determined whether A has been
abused by B or is at risk of being abused by B, and where the child is
or would be the subject of the order is at risk of abuse from an
individual other than A. It is intended that the means of determination
will be set out in regulations by the Lord Chancellor, as I understand
it. My concern is that that is too rigid. The Government have stated
that for the purposes of clauses 10 and 11 of the Bill, it will require
objective evidence that the conditions are met and that the evidence
must satisfy at least one of the criteria—I think there are
seven criteria in all—which are essentially protective
injunctions which are either in place or have been in place within the
past 12 months.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000582">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In relation
to abuse of adults, there are multiple objections to making those
exclusive grounds for establishing abuse or the threat of abuse.
Victims of domestic violence or domestic abuse are very often reluctant
to report abuse to the police or, for that matter, in my experience, to
any agency, whatever it might be. They may be unwilling to make public
their private suffering for fear of further reprisals or to protect
others, such as the children in that family. I am sure that hon. and
right hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will appreciate that
genuine and perhaps dangerous incidents of domestic violence will go on
as a result of the proposed legislation, and I have no doubt that that
is not the Government’s intention.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000583">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government’s refusal to accept an undertaking by a party to
civil proceedings not to commit acts of abuse may, in many cases,
aggravate domestic violence. Evidence such as a finding of fact or a
criminal conviction would be necessary to satisfy the criteria as set
out. It makes no sense for eligibility for legal aid under
paragraphs 10 and 11 to be dependent on taking unnecessary
and, in my view, very divisive legally aided proceedings under
paragraph 9, which will burden the police or social services, perhaps
unnecessarily. The amendment would allow prima facie evidence, such as
police reports, hospital admissions, GP reports, evidence from refuge
centres or undertakings in domestic violence cases, to be
used.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000584">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
230 would insert:<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000585">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“the Director of
Legal Aid Casework shall be entitled to determine whether a child who
is or would be the subject of the order is at risk of abuse from an
individual other than A on the basis of evidence that he considers
sufficiently compelling to make such a determination”.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720001052">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>With regard to
incidents of child abuse, it must be said that similar objections
arise. As it stands in the Bill, an adult seeking a residence order
would not be eligible for legal aid, even if they had evidence of
previous abuse, unless they could satisfy one of the conditions. It
just does not seem
right.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000586">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
respectfully submit that the Government should consider the position
for the reasons given by the right hon. Gentleman whose constituency,
despite your earlier warning, Mr Sheridan, I have absolutely no chance
of pronouncing, and by my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford—I
can manage that. <em>[</em>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I shall speak briefly, because my three
colleagues have covered the amendments very well. This subject, along
with clinical negligence, is the area that 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 357<a class="bkMark" name="Column357">&#160;</a>
                  </div>the Government struggled with when they responded to the consultation
responses. They made some concessions, which were welcome, but they did
not go far enough. As was highlighted by the amendments in the group,
first, there is a question of definition. Notwithstanding the comments
from the Government Benches, there is very wide and broad agreement
that the ACPO definition is a sensible one. That is certainly the
conclusion that the right hon. Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd and my
hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston reached with their
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000588">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
the question of making domestic violence the gateway to legal aid in
both private children and financial matters cases has been a thorn in
the Government’s side. Such a provision—and all the
baggage of perverse incentives that comes with it—is unseemly in
restricting and funnelling access to legal aid through the medium of
violent behaviour. That point is similar to the one made about complex
cases, to which we shall probably return when we discuss welfare
benefits. In such cases there might be a reason for providing legal aid
in one respect, but that deals with only part of a legitimate claim.
The Government have failed to deal with such
inflexibility.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000589">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <h4 class="hs_Timeline">9.45

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">Thirdly,
my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull East made a point
about the other so-called objective tests, which effectively require
victims to jump through a series of procedural and legalistic
hoops—it is almost a Catch-22 situation. Only in a very few
cases will people arrive at a position from where they can prove
sufficiently to obtain legal aid. One of the corollaries of that is the
question of undertakings. It is a long time since I practised family
law, but I suspect that in the vast majority of cases—there are
other more expert people in Committee so I had better be careful what I
say—the family courts would be unable to cope were it necessary
in every case to prove violent incidents rather than to accept
undertakings. That is another important matter that the Government have
failed to deal with.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000590">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Again, we are
not asking for the baby to be thrown out with the bathwater; we are
asking for a sensible review to meet the facts on the ground in
domestic violence cases. There has been a move forward in dealing with
such cases in both criminal and civil law over the past 20 years, and
domestic violence now courts a much greater appreciation by the police
and prosecuting authorities, and a much more responsive attitude by the
family courts. The provision goes against the grain of all that, which
is why there is such concerted opposition to it. We need the Government
simply to reconsider the measure in the context of the amendments. I
shall leave it to my hon. Friends to decide which amendments they wish
to press to a vote, but the matter needs further attention if we are to
avoid undoing a great deal of good work that has been done in tackling
domestic violence.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000591">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I shall speak
first to amendments 100, 229 and 230. Amendment 100 would set out in
the Bill three sets of circumstances that would be accepted as
demonstrating the fact of domestic violence for the purpose of
qualifying for legal aid in private family law cases.
Amendment 229 would provide for the director of legal aid
casework to determine whether a person has been abused by the other
party in a case or is at risk from them<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000593">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“on the basis of

               </p>
               <p>Amendment 230 would
provide for the director of legal aid casework<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000594">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“to determine

the same
basis.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000595">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
domestic violence exceptional gateway, as it were, is a difficult
balancing act for the Government. On one hand, we want genuine victims
of domestic violence to receive the benefit of legal aid in cases in
which they will face their abuser as the other party; on the other, we
heard many concerns during consultation that such proposals might cause
a rise in unfounded allegations. We want to guard against
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000596">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We need
clear, objective evidence of domestic violence to target legal aid on
genuine cases in which the victim needs assistance. Such people will
need assistance because of the history of abuse and the risk of further
abuse by the other party, and the effect that that may have on the
victims’ ability to conduct proceedings.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000597">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Forms of
evidence that will be accepted for that purpose are not set out in the
Bill; instead, they will be set out in regulations under clause 10. We
believe that it is appropriate to set out such detailed provisions in
secondary rather than primary legislation. We listened carefully to
views expressed in response to the consultation about what should be
accepted as evidence of domestic violence and, as a result, we have
widened the criteria originally suggested. Legal aid will be available
for victims of domestic violence in private family law cases in which
one of those criteria is
met.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000598">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
first criterion is that a non-molestation order, occupation order,
forced marriage protection order, or other protective injunction
against the other party is either in place or has been made in the past
12 months. The second is a criminal conviction for a domestic violence
offence committed by the other party against the applicant for funding,
unless the conviction is spent. The third is that there are ongoing
criminal proceedings against the other party for a domestic violence
offence by that party against the applicant for funding. The fourth is
that the applicant for funding has been referred to a multi-agency risk
assessment conference as a high-risk victim of domestic violence and a
plan has been put in place to protect them from violence by the other
party. The final criterion is that there has been a finding of fact in
the family courts of domestic violence by the other party, giving rise
to the risk of harm to the
victim.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000599">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Opposition Members are extremely concerned about
the criteria and the high hurdle that the Minister is setting. I am
sure that he is familiar with the facts. The truth is that many women
have suffered an average of, I think, 35 instances of abuse before they
even go to the police to report, yet the Minister does not accept that
hurdle. He is setting a hurdle that would 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 359<a class="bkMark" name="Column359">&#160;</a>
                  </div>require a far higher level of domestic violence to have already
occurred, a level that is so high that there would already have been a
court order. That is the main objection to the definition that he
proposes in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000600">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The hon. Lady has made her point. The criteria
all avoid self-reporting and involve a significant level of state

purposes.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000601">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
hope it will be helpful if I give the Committee some idea of the
prevalence of those forms of evidence. About 24,100 domestic violence
orders were made in 2010. About 74,000 domestic violence crimes were
prosecuted in 2009-10 and there were 53,000 domestic violence
convictions. About 43,000 victims of domestic violence were referred to
multi-agency risk assessment conferences in the 12 months up to June
2010. Clearly, those numbers will overlap to an extent, but, to
compare, the LSC funded legal representation in about 69,000 private
family law cases in 2009-10, not including legal aid for a protective
injunction.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000602">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
will address each of the circumstances proposed in amendment 100 in
turn. We are concerned that to include admission to a refuge in the
criteria would be to rely on self-reporting, as well as place pressure
on those organisations that provide refuges. Their assistance may be
sought with greater frequency if they have a role in triggering access
to legal
aid.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000603">&#160;</a>

Minister’s remarks are fanciful. Refuges are significantly
over-subscribed and are already having to be quite stringent in

                  </strong> Again, the hon. Lady has made her point. We are
not persuaded that medical professionals would be best placed to assess
whether domestic violence has occurred. Although they may witness
injuries, it may be difficult for them to determine how they occurred.
Again, there would be a strong element of self-reporting, rather than
objective evidence. Evidence from medical professionals could, however,
depending on the circumstances and the assessment of a judge, lead to a
finding of fact in the family courts that domestic violence has
occurred, which would trigger funding. Moreover, of course, evidence of
having entered a domestic violence shelter may similarly trigger a
finding of
fact.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000607">&#160;</a>

amendments 229 and 230, we have sought to be clear about the forms of
evidence of both domestic violence and child abuse that will be

able to grant funding quickly and minimise bureaucracy the criteria
will need to be clear. Setting out the criteria 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 361<a class="bkMark" name="Column361">&#160;</a>
                  </div>in secondary legislation will enable greater transparency and
consistency than would be the case if decisions were taken without
evidential criteria. It is important to remember that legal aid will
remain available for exceptional out-of-scope cases where it is
required as a result of our domestic or international legal
obligations, including article 6 of the European convention on human
rights.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000621">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 163
would provide for legal aid to be made available for any private family
law cases where there are allegations of domestic violence or a risk of
domestic violence, as opposed to evidence of abuse or risk of abuse.
Clear objective evidence of domestic violence will be needed in order
to target legal aid to genuine cases without providing an incentive for
unfounded allegations to be made. If we were to accept allegations of
domestic abuse or the risk of abuse without requiring any objective
evidence, we would expect there to be a significant increase in the
number of allegations.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000622">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendments
164, 165 and 218 would put parts of the definition of domestic violence
used by ACPO in the Bill, in paragraph 10 of schedule 1, in place of
the existing definition of abuse or, in the case of amendment 164,
simply remove the definitions of abuse so that the term is left
completely open. The amendments also seem to allow any incident of
abuse to be accepted as sufficient evidence of abuse for the purpose of
qualifying for legal aid in a private family law matter.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000623">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I turn to the
issue of the definition of abuse. The existing definition of abuse in
the Bill is a broad one that is explicitly not limited to physical
violence. It is used elsewhere in the Bill, in paragraph 3 of schedule
1, which provides civil legal aid for child abuse cases. The definition
is intentionally flexible and enables funding to be given, where there
is a genuine need, on the facts of the case. Let me confirm that the
definition of abuse embraces mental abuse as well as physical abuse. It
specifically includes neglect, maltreatment and exploitation. These
references would cover, for example, abusive behaviour relating to
family finances. We do not consider that the Bill definition will
restrict the availability of legal aid in comparison with using the
ACPO definition and therefore this part of the amendment is
unnecessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000624">&#160;</a>

such that the victim would not generally feel inhibited in pursuing
litigation against the other party. The touchstone for whether a party
obtains funding must be whether the abuse was such as to inhibit their
ability to present their case against the other party. The
circumstances that would be accepted as evidence of the abuse will turn
on the application by courts, prosecutors and other agencies of their
existing criteria, which would generally reflect the cross-Government
definition of domestic violence. It is where the courts and others have
determined that abusive conduct is of a level that protective action or
prosecution must be taken that the gateway will apply.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000630">&#160;</a>

ACPO definition of domestic violence is designed to ensure that
allegations of domestic violence are properly investigated—I
repeat the word “investigated”. That is a different
purpose and a different stage from the purpose of the criteria being
proposed by the Government as evidence of abuse that calls for funding

               <p class="tabbed">I will now
turn to the other amendments relating to private law children cases,
such as disputes about custody, where a child is at risk of abuse. The
amendments are to paragraph 11 of schedule 1, which provides for legal
aid to be available in those cases for the party seeking to protect the
child where there is objective evidence of risk of abuse. Amendment 152
would provide for applications for financial provision for children to
be in scope for legal aid where the child is the subject of one or more
of the measures listed in paragraph 11(1) of schedule 1. That list of
orders is wide and includes contact and residence orders. The effect of
amendment 152 would be that child maintenance applications
would be in scope whenever a contact or residence order has
been made.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000635">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The original
legal aid proposals were silent on the issue of children at risk of
abuse in private law children cases. We listened to concerns raised
during consultation on that point. For example, one party might be
seeking an order barring an abuser from unsupervised contact with the
child. We agreed that child protection is an issue of great importance.
We also recognised that it would be difficult for the protective party
to act in person in cases of potential complexity and heightened risk
to the child, requiring prompt and clear action. That is a separate
rationale to the situation where the adult himself or herself has been
subject to abuse such that he or she cannot be expected to represent
themselves against their abuser. We do not consider that cases
concerning financial provision are of equal priority, nor do they raise
the same issues. Financial matters are of a lower objective importance
than child protection, and we would not expect the protecting party to
encounter the same level of complexity, still less a need for urgent
protective action in a case about financial provision.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000636">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Furthermore,
the person presenting the risk of abuse might not be the other party in
the financial provision proceedings. Although protecting a child from
abuse is clearly of high importance, it is not appropriate that, in a
case for financial provision, which is a separate matter from the
consideration of protective measures, a distinction should be drawn
between maintenance for children considered at risk of abuse and
maintenance for other
children.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000637">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
153 would bring into the scope of legal aid the entirety of any
proceedings in which the court was considering whether to direct the
local authority to investigate the circumstances of the
child. Under section 37 of the Children Act 1989, the court
may make such an order if it appears that it may be appropriate for a
care or supervision order to be made. The amendment appears to be
unnecessary; in any event it goes too far. Under paragraph 1 of the
schedule, legal aid will be available for public family law cases such
as care and supervision proceedings, as at present. We believe that the
state should ensure that families are able to challenge decisions made
by public authorities about the provision of care for children. Orders
under section 37 of the 1989 Act are considered to be public family law
matters for legal aid purposes, and fall within the list of public law
proceedings in paragraph 1 of schedule 1. Funding is therefore
available in relation to the section 37 issues. There is no reason in
principle why a case could not be adjourned briefly in such a situation
to allow the parties to seek a legal aid lawyer for the section 37
issue, if that were warranted. Providers are able to use devolved
powers to grant immediate funding in emergency situations, subject to
means and merits-testing. The funding would be on only that point,
rather than on the main subject of the
proceedings.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000638">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
154 also references section 37 directions. The amendment would bring
into scope any private family law proceedings that involved a child in
respect of whom a direction under section 37 of the 1989 Act had been
given, regardless of the outcome of that section 37 investigation. That
is a remarkably broad proposition, which I do not think can be
justified. Under the amendment, a section 37 order, regardless of the
outcome of the investigation, would trigger funding for all parties in
any private law family proceedings in which the child was involved. A
section 37 order in itself 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 364<a class="bkMark" name="Column364">&#160;</a>
                  </div>does not mean that the child is at risk of abuse. The local authority
staff could conclude, once they had completed their investigation, that
the child was not at risk and that no further action was needed. If the
local authority concluded that action was needed, it would put a child
protection plan in place, which would be accepted as evidence that the
child was at risk of abuse and would trigger funding for the party
seeking to protect the
child.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000639">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Providing
for legal aid to be available for any family proceedings involving the
child, as amendment 154 would do, would mean that legal aid would not
be targeted on proceedings about protection of the child, but could be
available for proceedings that might not concern protection at all. For
example, a case about financial relief for the parents could be covered
if an application were made for financial relief for the child, given
that the words “involving a child” do not give much
indication of how closely the child needs to be concerned. It might
even be that a case between the parents about a matter that did not
directly concern the child was
included.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000640">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
154 would also provide for legal aid to be available for all parties to
the proceedings. We intend to target funding on the protecting party,
and where a party is not the person taking action to protect a child
from abuse the same level of importance and risk would not
apply.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000641">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Finally,
amendments 166 and 167 would also widen the availability of legal aid
under paragraph 11, beyond the party seeking to protect the child. The
amendments would mean that legal aid would be available for the other
party in private law children cases where a child was at risk of abuse.
We decided to keep the cases in scope for the protecting party because
protecting children from abuse is of paramount importance. The party is
effectively acting on the child’s behalf, to protect that child.
As I said in respect of amendment 154, where a party was not the person
taking action to protect a child from abuse, the same level of
importance and risk would not apply. The tests that we wish to use to
determine the availability of legal aid in such cases are designed to
be as objective as possible and to minimise the risk of false
allegations. The tests are for where there is a criminal conviction or
ongoing criminal proceedings for a child abuse offence. Where a local
authority has put a child protection plan in place to protect the child
or where there is a relevant finding of fact by the family courts that
child abuse has occurred, they will provide clear, objective evidence
of the risk of
abuse.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000642">&#160;</a>

               <p>Again,
I want to see that provision reinstated. Having had some experience
from when I was a solicitor, making an application to that authority is
not a straightforward matter. It has become a rather judicial forum.
The board is normally chaired by an experienced silk, and those
appearing before it need to know what they are talking about when it
comes to cases, the quantum of 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 368<a class="bkMark" name="Column368">&#160;</a>
                  </div>damages and so on. They have become not just a quasi chamber, but a
fully legal chamber, and assistance is therefore deserved. Individuals
without some expertise in court procedure would not find them palatable
or reasonable to try to take on. Much as the chairs of such
boards—the nominated silks—do their best to assist, if
somebody comes their way hopelessly ill-prepared, it will not be a good
experience for anybody and will be a waste of everyone’s time.
Indeed, given the situation that they were in, it may undermine that
person’s legitimate expectation of proper
compensation.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000738">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I want to discuss amendment 91, which would
widen the scope of advice on housing when an individual’s
financial difficulties could lead to the loss of a home. Dealing with
the preventing problem in the short term will simply mean that the
client is likely to return if the underlying issue has not been dealt
with. I have seen this time and time again in the advice agencies. The
test that the Government would apply to determine immediate loss of pay
is specifically legalistic. Possession proceedings, court orders,
eviction notices and bankruptcy petitions come into play, which make it
potentially harder to deal with the context in which homelessness
situations arise and court proceedings are
issued.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000740">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">By
far the most effective solutions and outcomes are likely to
be achieved by focusing the scarce resources on
early interventions to prevent the possession proceedings in the first
place and on the triggers and causes that lead to people losing their
home. They start long before the parties, whether they are landlords,
tenants, homeowners or owner-occupiers, reach the door of the court. By
the time a case reaches court, the relationship with the lender is
likely to have broken down irretrievably. There are usually many
reasons for that, such as misunderstood letters, letters that go behind
the clock, other creditors that shout a lot louder—particularly
those who knock on the door—changes in tenancy conditions and
changes in circumstance and income. All of those have to be solved at
an earlier stage, but they need legal advice to identify and separate
the issues and find a
solution.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000741">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That
early resolution also fits well with the wider housing policy context.
There is no doubt that last-minute action can prevent the loss of the
home, but the legal costs simply inflate the debts owed. Early action
could prevent that and keep the debt at a more manageable level. A
range of legal options are available to home owners and tenants,
provided they are brought into play at the correct time, which I
suggest, is not the stage of actual
eviction.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000742">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
am also aware of many people coming at an earlier stage, who are at the
end of their tether. They cannot cope with the feeling of hopelessness
or the letters coming through the door, and they are insistent. They
want to hand the keys back to the mortgage lender or the landlord. They
feel this is their only option, and they are completely desperate to
avoid the stress of any court action, even if it is not imminent. To
say to that individual, “I’m sorry, but you need to go
back now and wait till you are absolutely on the brink before you can
be helped,” is absolutely unthinkable to most advice 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 369<a class="bkMark" name="Column369">&#160;</a>
                  </div>agencies. The amendment, which would allow the advice process to start
earlier, is small, but it would make a big difference and it would be
more cost-effective.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000743">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendments 92
and 93 are also in my name, and I would like to speak to them together.
The benefits system is notoriously complex—I have stated how
many pages of instructions there are for DWP officials—and
generates 160,000 appeals, over half of which are decided in the
appellant’s favour. It is going through systemic transition
under the Welfare Reform Bill, which will add to the morass of the
social security statutes and case law. Amendment 92 would reinstate all
advice on benefits, and claimants would be able to receive advice to
assist with the unprecedented level of changes that the introduction of
universal credit will bring to 19 million individuals and 8
million households.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000744">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">At the same
time, not a single benefit case will qualify for that assistance under
the legal help scheme—not even for initial advice, which can
assist in identifying whether there is a justiciable issue under social
security law and can either steer cases away from a tribunal, or ensure
that they are processed correctly. It is, of course, beneficial if
cases are right first time, and there should be fewer disputes and
errors, but removing the specialist advice before the changes have been
proven is a big risk—not for the Government, but for individuals
who are in and out of work and depend on such benefits to supplement
their income and pay their bills.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000745">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 93
would limit the advice to reviews and appeals. There is, as I have
stated, a high level of decision-making error within the DWP agencies,
in applying the law correctly. The resulting issues, which often end up
at tribunal, are extremely complex, involving interpretation of
difficult statute and case law precedents. It is unrealistic to expect
people without specialist knowledge to put together coherent review
requests or appeals with no input from an independent specialist
adviser, and advice agencies really cannot deliver advice at this level
without funding specialist caseworkers. Volunteers do an excellent job,
and they are the bedrock of advice services—particularly, the
CAB. However, when the Government forms send people to the CAB for
specialist advice, expectations are raised that advisers will deal with
the most complex issues. Such cases are referred to the specialist
adviser by the generalist adviser, performing a triage function. It is
the continuity of the advice and the experience of the adviser that
gives the excellent advice that is delivered by such
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000746">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">For example,
in my bureau in Wigan, a client came in who was at risk of loss of
liberty because of a benefit problem. They had been charged with
£220,000 of fraud by the Department. It took 18 months and
appeals to the highest court for this case to be resolved, and the

They needed an experienced adviser, whom they needed to see around
twice a month—which I think is how often they saw that adviser.
They also needed to see that same adviser, and to be sure of doing
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000747">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Advice on
legal issues at the review stage can also avoid the need for an appeal
or tribunal. Advisers can sift the evidence. They know how to look at
the facts and they can ensure that the relevant facts, statutes and
case law, backed up with the right evidence, are made available to
decision makers, saving them time.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000748">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Preparing
cases for tribunals helps to reduce the time needed for tribunal
hearings. Claimants who go without advice quite often do not know what
is relevant. An adviser spends a considerable time going through the
case with the client, preparing them for the tribunal and often
listening to quite an amount of irrelevant information. Sometimes, it
is necessary for the client to get that off their chest, but they also
need to be told that the tribunal does not need to hear it. Therefore,
experienced advisers and welfare benefits advice actually save
money.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000749">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Citizens Advice service has costed how much it would cost to keep
reviews and appeals in scope. Work on reviews and appeals accounts for
approximately 66% of current welfare benefits casework, so, in monetary
terms, there would be an expenditure of approximately £16.5
million. If the amendment applied only to appeals, that would cover 49%
of casework, which would be an expenditure of £12.5 million. In
context, supporting advice for benefits reviews and appeals is 0.8% of
the legal aid budget, and yet that could help 100,000 people, who might
find their income at risk and who, on the Government’s own
assessments, are among the most vulnerable, ill and disabled people.
Some 58% of the people affected by the removal of welfare benefits are
in that
category.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000750">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Naturally,
it would be necessary to reduce the number of appeals—it would
be wonderful if that could be done—but a study in Nottingham
found that 31% of the demand for advice services is caused by
preventable failure, primarily by the DWP and Jobcentre Plus systems
and decision making. The potential for cutting the legal aid budget in
that way is significant, if simplification is part of the answer, but
if just 30% of appeals could be taken from the system, the savings to
the legal aid budget would be about £8 million. However, we
cannot guarantee
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000751">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Any
new system that is introduced brings its own problems—we saw
that with tax credits—and to remove legal aid from all welfare
benefits cases is to put on people who are often the most vulnerable,
ill and disabled a disproportionate burden of the legal aid
savings.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000752">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Many
points have already been made about the importance of those categories
of law and the need to ensure that people can access top-quality advice
in relation to the justiciable matters that they face. We have
discussed the boundary and cost-effectiveness issues, and the fact that
those are often complex matters that people struggle to deal with on
their own. In particular, very good points have been made by my hon.
Friends in relation to homelessness and debt, which can frequently
overlap. Indeed, many of the categories of law that will remain in
scope will give rise to aspects of people’s difficulties with
debt or housing that are not
covered.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000754">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Now
that employment falls out of scope, I am particularly concerned that
cases of discrimination in the workplace are unlikely to be picked up,
because the lawyers who 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 371<a class="bkMark" name="Column371">&#160;</a>
                  </div>are currently able to deal with discrimination matters under their
employment contracts will no longer hold such contracts and will not be
able to take on such cases. There continues to be a substantial amount
of pregnancy discrimination, for example, in the workplace. Research by
the then Equal Opportunities Commission highlighted that that remains
an ongoing concern. It is important to recognise that by the removal of
employment and therefore, indirectly, of discrimination in the
workplace from scope, we would potentially be in breach of our
international obligations in relation to protection from
discrimination.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000755">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
would like such matters to be brought back into scope to ensure that we
have the right provision of holistic legal advice. For that reason, I
commend the amendment to the Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000756">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Amendment 225, which stands in my name, also
deals with the reversion into scope of employment law, which affects
the most basic and the most complex advice in that area. The right hon.
Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd mentioned the complexity to which the
tribunal service has run since its inception. At one level—I am
looking at the Citizens Advice brief—the issue is about giving
people basic but nevertheless legal advice when they go into advice
agencies. Citizens Advice notes, perhaps not surprisingly given rising
unemployment levels, that discrimination problems relating to
employment increased by 7% to 2009-10, and that three quarters of all
discrimination advice recorded by bureaux in 2009-10 related to
employment. Citizens Advice makes this general
comment:<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000757">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Timely
advice can reduce stress and mitigate the economic cost and some or all
of the personal negative impacts of employment problems and related
impacts can be eased by good advice. As a result of bureau advice,
clients with employment problems can retain their job, protect their
terms and conditions, or, where it is not appropriate for them to
return to their job, Citizens Advice Bureaux can help
them…financial compensation through
tribunals.”<a class="bkMark" name="11090720001057">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That
seems to be an entirely sensible way to proceed. At the other end,
Members will have received the Equality and Human Rights
Commission’s response, which makes this point about
employment:<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000758">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“The
Commission has serious misgivings about the proposal to remove
employment law from the scope of legal aid. In the year 2009/2010,
nearly 32,000 new employment cases were started with Legal Help
funding. While there is no legal aid for representation at the
Employment Tribunal, this is currently available for cases before the
Employment Appeal Tribunal and beyond. Removing legal aid for
representation on employment matters in the higher courts will
undermine access to justice in relation to a civil right (i.e., rights
under a contract between an employer and employee). This is potentially
in breach of Article 6(1) ECHR, especially if the client is facing an
unusually complex employment law problem or if they would have
particular difficulties in representing themselves. As we have already
suggested…the MoJ’s forthcoming proposals for exceptional
funding should be designed to deal with such situations to avoid the
need for legal challenges by individuals who believe they should be
granted legal aid on human rights grounds.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720001058">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">We also have
concerns about the chilling effect on access to justice for
workplace-based discrimination cases, were employment law to be removed
from the scope of legal aid. Research conducted for the Equality and
Human Rights Commission demonstrates that there are already significant
gaps in the provision of discrimination advice in England, Scotland and
Wales.”<a class="bkMark" name="11090720001059">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
measures are another stroke of the pen to remove an entire area of
social welfare law from scope, and they will have significant effects
on employee-employer relations 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 372<a class="bkMark" name="Column372">&#160;</a>
                  </div>and the equality of arms between employers and employees. They are
likely to lead to more cases of unfair dismissal and of people unjustly
losing their jobs, and to more unemployment, with relatively little
saving for the Government. The Government always think that they know
best in such matters, and take the quick win and the money up
front.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000759">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_ParaIndent">Housing is
another subject that my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and
Urmston discussed. I used to do quite a lot of work in that area of
practice. Even with further amendments, about 40% of the current
provision will still be lost as a result of the changes. The Government
say that homelessness cases will be dealt with. I note that we are
coming to one or two Government amendments containing what appear to
be—the Minister will correct me if I am wrong—concessions
relating to parts of unlawful eviction and counter-claims in respect of
disrepair. Of course, any concession is welcome, and we will clearly
not oppose those, but as always, although not too late, it is certainly
too little. I would like the Minister to clarify whether this will deal
with the whole of unlawful eviction, including damages claims, which
are complicated. They involve exemplary damages, and they are important
matters that need to be tackled.</p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
concessions clearly do not deal with housing benefit issues, which form
part of many claims because of the inefficiency of the housing benefit
system as it is administered by local authorities. Debt arises as a
consequence of delays in claims being paid. There are statutory,
non-discretionary grounds for evicting tenants, and without proper
advice—often quite assertive advice—before the courts,
people can find themselves losing their homes.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000760">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Again, the
proposal is very short-sighted of the Government. It is penny pinching,
and in the end it will cost a great deal more money. The figure, which
I am sure the Minister is sick of hearing now, for the cost-benefit in
relation to housing for every £1 of legal aid spent is a saving
of £2.34, rising to £2.98 for debt, £8.80 for
benefits and £7.13 for employment.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000761">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I will not
detain the Committee long, because most of these points have been well
rehearsed in debates over the past year, but I want to put it on the
record that we oppose the scope changes in social welfare law,
including those that this group of amendments addresses. We do so
because each of them individually plays a role in giving representation
and advice to people who would otherwise go without and would be
unfairly treated, and because it is the right thing to do not only
socially and morally but often economically. When we look as a package,
rather than discretely, at housing, debt and welfare benefits, we see
that there are substantial links between them. The same problems often
occur to the same individual or the same family, and often one leads
into another. Debt leads to non-payment of rent and housing crises, and
failure to be awarded welfare benefits when one is entitled to them
again leads to debt. The link is there, as is the benefit to the state
of dealing with such problems early.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000762">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My hon.
Friend the Member for Makerfield has said that from her own
experience—as a result of her job for many years, her experience
in these matters is probably more extensive than any of ours,
notwithstanding our surgeries—the clients whom one sees at
advice agencies are in desperate need of help, and I imagine that that
is true throughout the country. They need a certain amount 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 373<a class="bkMark" name="Column373">&#160;</a>
                  </div>of help, which some people in society would find it easy to deliver
themselves; they have got themselves into a situation that they cannot
get out of, but with a limited amount of professional help that could
be effected. In making the changes, the Government are taking away that
lifeline. That is why, even at this late stage, we urge the Minister to
think again about the scope change in social welfare law, because of
the cumulative ills that will affect not only the recipients, but the
public purse as a
consequence.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000763">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 91
appears to be aimed at making legally aided advice, assistance and
representation available when a person’s financial difficulties,
such as debt problems, could lead to the individual losing their home.
Amendment 150 is also aimed at making legal aid generally available in
relation to debt and personal finance matters, regardless of whether
the client’s home is at immediate
risk.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000765">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="hs_ParaIndent">In
our consultation on legal aid reform, we proposed that funding should
be prioritised for cases where the individual is homeless or at
immediate risk of homelessness. We are, therefore, retaining legal aid
in relation both to court orders for possession or sale of the home,
and to eviction. We generally consider that other debt matters are a
lower priority and do not justify public funding for legal aid and
representation. We recognise that early advice can be helpful in a
range of contexts, but what people often need is general
advice—for example on welfare benefits, debt or
housing—rather than legal advice. There are many alternative
sources of help with debt issues, including Credit Action, the National
Debtline, the Consumer Credit Counselling Service and local
authorities, which also signpost people to local sources of advice and
assistance on debt matters. In addition, the Money Advice Trust has
recently launched “My Money Steps”, an online tool that
advises people with debt problems, and the Consumer Credit Counselling
Service offers “Debt Remedy”, a free online
service.</p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Makerfield went a step further. She said,
“Isn’t it too late to provide legal aid only for
possession and eviction? By that point things have progressed too far
for legal aid to help someone save their home. It is about early
intervention.” Indeed, it is about early intervention, but we do
not accept that providing legal aid for possession or eviction is too
far down the line to make a real difference. The effectiveness of legal
advice provided in court when possession proceedings are already under
way has been recognised by CAB, Shelter and Advice UK. In any event,
legal aid will be available earlier than that. It will be available
when repossession is contemplated—when a person is threatened
with repossession action unless they immediately pay their outstanding
debts, for
example.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000766">&#160;</a>

also recognise the arguments that the withdrawal of legal aid for any
issue may lead, through a chain of events, to serious consequences. We
considered those points carefully when formulating our final proposals.
Our view, however, is that the limited public funds for legal advice
and representation should be focused on those cases in which the client
faces serious direct consequences. We do not propose, therefore, to
devote limited public funds to less important cases on the basis that
they could indirectly lead to more serious consequences for that
person. As I have already said, general non-legal advice on debt is
available from a variety of sources to people who are not at immediate
risk of losing their

claims related to unlawful eviction, even where the occupier is not

               <p class="tabbed">Amendments
95 and 225 seek to make legally aided advice, assistance and
representation available for all employment matters. Employment

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 375<a class="bkMark" name="Column375">&#160;</a>
                  </div>to be simple, to enable parties to make or respond to a claim without
the need for representation. While we recognise that clients find
advice in the preparation of their case useful, we do not consider that
that group of clients are generally likely to be particularly
vulnerable, and we do not accept that the tribunal cannot be accessed
or that justice cannot be obtained without legally aided advice. Given
the need to prioritise resources, we consider that employment matters
are of a lower objective importance than cases involving life, liberty
or homelessness.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000777">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Stretford and Urmston asked a couple of questions. She asked
what help there would be for those claiming unlawful discrimination in
an employment matter. We are retaining legal aid for unlawful
discrimination cases. Legally aided advice will continue to be
available for employment tribunal discrimination claims, and legally
aided advice and representation will be available at the employment
appeal tribunal. We recognise the importance of the issues at stake and
claims relating to a contravention of the Equality Act 2010,
addressing societal prejudice and ensuring equality of opportunity. In
our view, other employment cases are generally about monetary damages
or earning potential. We do not consider such cases to be of such high
priority as to justify funding, and there are often other ways of
funding them, such as damaged-based agreements.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000778">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In addition,
advice is available from the ACAS free helpline, and is usually
available from trade unions. ACAS also offers a free arbitration
service for some disputes concerning unfair dismissal or flexible
working. In some cases, an employer may be willing to engage in civil
mediation, which is sometimes paid for by the employer. There is also
help available from the pay and work rights helpline and the redundancy
helpline, and the tribunal’s public inquiry line can provide
factual information, though not legal advice. Voluntary organisations
or charities may also offer
assistance.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000779">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendments
92 and 133 seek to amend parts 1 and 2 of the schedule to make
available civil legal services for welfare benefits matters and
Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority claims. Amendments 93 and 138
would then delete the exclusions for welfare benefits matters and CICA
claims in part 2 of the schedule. Amendments 134 and 143 would make
consequential changes as a result of the welfare benefits amendments by
removing the provisions that lift the exclusions for welfare benefits
that appear in the provisions regarding equality or judicial review
claims.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000780">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
right hon. Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd asked about welfare benefits
and judicial review, relating to paragraph 15 in part 2 of the
schedule. That paragraph generally excludes legal services in relation
to welfare benefits from scope. In general, legal aid will not be
available in respect of welfare benefits. However, judicial review
proceedings in relation to welfare benefits will remain in scope by
virtue of the provisions in paragraph 17 in part 1 of the
schedule. That is because the welfare benefits exclusion is disapplied
by paragraph 17(2)(a). Legal aid is currently available for legal
advice in relation to decisions on welfare benefits. Legally aided
representation is not available for tribunal
hearings.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000781">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government’s reforms to scope are designed to refocus legal aid
on those who need it most and for the most serious cases in which legal
advice and representation are justified. Given that, and the need to
prioritise 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 376<a class="bkMark" name="Column376">&#160;</a>
                  </div>funding, we have decided to remove legal advice for welfare benefits
from the scope of the legal aid scheme. While we recognise that many
people rely on benefits, such cases are primarily about financial
entitlement, and we generally consider that the importance of such
cases is lower than that of those concerning the liberty or safety of
the
person.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000782">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">For
those who need assistance on a welfare benefits matter, there is
factual advice available from, for example, Jobcentre Plus, the
benefits inquiry line and the tribunal itself. I should also make it
clear that, although legal aid will be removed for welfare benefits
cases, it will be retained for judicial reviews of welfare benefits
decisions, and for claims relating to a contravention of the Equality
Act 2010 that concern welfare
benefits.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000783">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_ParaIndent">While
we recognise that the people making applications to the Criminal
Injuries Compensation Authority might be vulnerable having often been
through a traumatic event, we consider that, generally, the application
forms are straightforward to complete and the authority itself provides
help and guidance for applicants to help them through their claim. We
have prioritised funding and we consider that these cases are primarily
financial claims, which are of a lower priority for public funding. For
the reasons that I have given, I ask members of the Committee not to
press the
amendments.</p>

funding scope, particular immigration judicial review cases that are
very likely to be without merit. Such cases will either have already
had a hearing on the same or substantially the same issue within a
period of one year, or will be judicial reviews of removal directions 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 377<a class="bkMark" name="Column377">&#160;</a>
                  </div>where there is less than one year between the giving of the direction
and the determination of the decision to
remove.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000791">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In response
to our legal aid consultation, the Judges Council highlighted the large
number of immigration judicial reviews that were without merit and
which, in effect, simply clog up the system. Only a minority of such
cases would receive legal aid. The Government’s view, as
expressed in this part of schedule 1, is that it is wrong in principle
for such cases to remain within the scope of funding.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000792">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The first
category of case that we seek to exclude is one in which there has
already been at least one appeal before the tribunal, or another
judicial review within the last year, on the same or substantially the
same issue. Judges in immigration judicial reviews too often see
attempts to litigate on the same points again and again, essentially to
string out the removals process. We do not think that taxpayer funding
should be available in such instances.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000793">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The second
category relates to judicial reviews of removal directions rather than
the underlying decision. Such proceedings are often brought at the last
minute, sometimes literally as people are being put onto a plane.
Again, they are essentially designed to frustrate the removals process.
Similarly, we do not think that the UK taxpayer should be asked to foot
the bill for such
claims.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000794">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There will,
of course, be some genuine although unusual cases in those categories
that would still, in principle, warrant legal aid. That is why we have
made exceptions to our proposed exclusions. These principally take into
account the potential for changes in an individual’s
circumstances over time. In both categories the exclusion is subject to
a one-year time limit. Judicial reviews of a refusal by the Secretary
of State to treat a claim for asylum as a fresh claim—one with
new facts or circumstances—will also be retained by making sure
that when there is a possibility that there has not already been an
opportunity for appeal, legal aid for judicial review will still be
available, subject to the normal means and merits
test.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000795">&#160;</a>

emphasise that we are retaining legal aid for most judicial reviews,
immigration or otherwise. We accept that an individual’s ability
to hold the state to account is an important one, but where it has been
abused, combined with the need to target resources effectively, we
think removing legal aid from those discrete categories of cases is
justified, especially with the safeguards I have set out. I hope that

                  </strong> The Government amendments relate to housing
matters at paragraphs 27 and 29 of part 1 of schedule 1. They do not
represent a change in policy. They are aimed at giving better effect to
our stated policy intentions. In our consultation paper and our
response to that consultation, we announced our intention to prioritise
funding on housing cases where the individual is at immediate risk of
homelessness, or where there are disrepairs to the home that seriously
threaten the health of the individual or their family. As both
amendments 170 and 171 relate to the loss of the
client’s home through possession or unlawful eviction I will
deal with them together.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000826">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In our
consultation paper we proposed to retain legal aid funding for housing
disrepair damages claims that are brought as counter-claims in rent
arrears possession cases. The rationale for this is that these
counter-claims can help an individual who is at immediate risk of
homelessness to remain in their home. Legal services provided in
relation to such counter-claims fall within paragraph 27(1) of part 1
of schedule 1. In the circumstances, such counter-claims form part of
the legal services being provided for the client in relation to the
possession proceedings. However, counter-claims for housing disrepair
naturally concern damage to property. Paragraph 27 of part 1 of
schedule 1, which covers loss of home cases, is subject to certain
exclusions set out in part 2 of schedule 1, including an exclusion for
damage to property. It has come to our attention that in order to give
effect to our stated intention to fund these counter-claims to
possession proceedings we will need to lift that exclusion for the
purpose of such counter-claims.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000827">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In addition,
it has become apparent that counter-claims in possession proceedings
are often brought on grounds other than housing disrepair, such as
harassment related counter-claims brought under the torts of trespass
to the person, land or goods. Legal services in relation to those torts
are currently excluded by part 2 of schedule 1. 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 379<a class="bkMark" name="Column379">&#160;</a>
                  </div>Amendments 170 and 171 therefore lift those exclusions to counter-claims
brought in proceedings for possession orders. That is important because
such counter-claims also have the potential to keep the client from
becoming homeless and therefore they should remain in
scope.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000828">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is the
Government’s policy that legal aid should continue to be
available for unlawful eviction cases. Tenants usually bring unlawful
eviction claims based on breach of the covenant for quiet enjoyment
that is part of every tenancy agreement. However, this course of action
is not available to other lawful occupiers who do not have a tenancy
agreement. These lawful occupiers may rely on various heads of claim,
including trespass to the person and/or goods and breach of the
statutory duty. Those particular heads of claim are currently excluded
by part 2 of schedule 1. Amendments 170 and 171 will therefore lift
those exclusions in relation to unlawful eviction and will ensure that
funding for these cases is available to lawful occupiers and not just
to tenants.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000829">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I turn to
amendment 172. Freestanding housing disrepair actions are dealt with
under paragraph 29 of part 1 of schedule 1. That paragraph is subject
to certain exclusions, including the tort of breach of statutory duty.
However, it has come to the Government’s attention that one
common course of action in use for housing disrepair claims is a breach
of section 4 of the Defective Premises Act 1972, which constitutes a
breach of statutory duty. We therefore wish to lift the breach of
statutory duty exclusion in relation to housing disrepair actions by
means of amendment
172.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000830">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I shall respond to the Minister before my hon.
Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston moves her amendment. It
would be churlish not to say that we welcome any concessions, because
they are so few and far between. That sounds rather churlish, but we
will put it down to the
hour.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000831">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
provision is symptomatic of poor drafting and schoolboy errors in
relation to the Defective Premises Act and is trying to eke out as
slowly and carefully as possible every single concession that the
Government are willing to give. Why do the Government not just sit
around the table with Shelter and other interested parties who have
been dealing with these matters for many years, if not decades, and
come to a conclusion about what is reasonable in terms of disrepair,
unlawful eviction and, indeed, in terms of claim, counter-claim or
however the matter may
arise?<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000832">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
am still not clear from what the Minister said whether all parts of
damages only claims for unlawful eviction, which in my experience are
more common than reinstatement and injunction claims, are covered. That
is essential because we are talking about vulnerable people who have
often been evicted from their homes but for whom there is no point in
applying for re-entry to their property because they do not want to go
back to a landlord who has been harassing them. There may well be a new
tenant in the property and they may well find that they can be taken by
the local authority at that point, if they are lucky. However, they may
still have lost possessions and suffered personal injury or certainly
great distress. I would like the Minister to clarify whether all
aspects of unlawful eviction will now be
covered.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000833">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
regards disrepair, I take the point about the intention where there is
serious risk of harm to health and safety. That is not always the case
with disrepair, but it can still 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 380<a class="bkMark" name="Column380">&#160;</a>
                  </div>be very serious disrepair in terms of causing personal injury or a great
deal of distress. It can be infestation, it can be severe damp, or it
can amount to a form of harassment. It can, effectively, amount to a
form of homelessness, because a property is often in such a condition
that it is impossible, for reasons of damp or cold or other matters, to
continue to live there. It would therefore have been far more sensible
and saved us the palaver of an amendment at this stage if the
Government had simply taken a more expansive view. It would not have
changed the cost to a great extent.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000834">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Housing,
according to Shelter, is one of the top three priorities of three
quarters of MPs. I suspect that it is the top priority for all London
MPs. It is about half my work load as a constituency MP, because of the
severity of the housing problem, including the standard and quality of
private sector property and the severe housing need. It is therefore an
area that the Government should have taken more care over.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000835">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Yes, we
welcome these amendments and yes, I would like clarification from the
Minister on how far he is prepared to go in the area of disrepair and
unlawful eviction, but despite the risk of this falling on deaf ears, I
urge the Government to look again at the provisions so we have a proper
package of housing legal aid, rather than the tawdry effort that we
have been left
with.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000836">&#160;</a>

brought to our attention by certain experts in the field that the
drafting needed tweaking slightly. That is exactly what we are doing

whether legal aid will be available for unlawful eviction damages, that
it will be available, even where reinstatement is not
sought.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000837">&#160;</a>

Members will be aware that European directives are directly enforceable

directives in force in relation to discrimination and other areas of
employment law are directly enforceable against the state or bodies
emanating from the state, but it is also sensible to take action under
the Equality Act. A person might choose to use the directive where
there are discrepancies between the directive and its implementation in
UK law. There could also be cases outside the scope of the 2010 Act,
which European principles of equality could cover. The key equalities
directives are: 75/117/EEC, the equal pay directive; 76/207/EEC, the
equal treatment directive; 94/33/EC, the young persons work directive;
97/80/EC, the burden of proof directive; 2000/43/EC, the race

47 of the charter of fundamental rights of the EU enshrines the right

law, as implemented by member states. The text of the article

of the amendment is to ensure that we have comprehensive access to
funding for legal advice in relation to the legislative framework that
governs equalities in this country, be it the 2010 Act or the wider EU
legislative framework, which also has effect. I urge the Minister to
take on board the amendment and I look forward to his
comments.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000849">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The amendment would extend paragraph
37 of part 1 of schedule 1, so as to include explicitly within scope of
legal aid contraventions of any European directive regarding equality
or discrimination. The amendment is unnecessary: the Bill continues to
retain in scope all equality cases in all areas of law, which are
currently within the scope of legal aid. The Equality Act 2010, which
paragraph 37 explicitly covers, already takes full account of our
obligations under European Union law in the field of equality and
discrimination, and legal aid will continue to remain available for
such cases. The amendment, therefore, adds nothing to what we already
have in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000850">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Moreover,
if a dispute arises about whether the Equality Act fully implements
European Union directives about equality legal aid, legal aid will be
available, because the proceedings themselves will be under the
Equality Act. I hope that in the light of my response, the hon. Lady
will withdraw her
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000851">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I am grateful to the Minister. While I appreciate
the explanation he has offered, it is my understanding that there is a
risk of a discrepancy, which would mean that access through the
Equality Act could not be guaranteed in all cases, not least because we
do not know what future European Union directives might come forward,
which would be seen to be beyond the scope of the Equality Act. It is
therefore my intention, Mr Sheridan, to press the amendment to a
vote.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000852">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> In speaking to the lead amendment, which stands in
my name, I shall try to be brief, given the hour that we have reached.
This is an important amendment. It would provide for advocacy services
to be provided for individuals in any proceedings against a public
authority and it lists five or six categories. The first is the general
regulatory chamber of the first-tier tribunal, to deal with freedom of
information under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and data
protection under the Data Protection Act 1998. The others are the
health, education and social care chamber of the first-tier tribunal
regarding care standards; the health, education and social care chamber
of the first-tier tribunal regarding mental health; the health,
education and social care chamber of the first-tier tribunal regarding
special educational needs and disability; the immigration and asylum
chamber of the first-tier tribunal; and the social entitlement chamber
of the first-tier tribunal. The other two amendments are consequential
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000997">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">The
main amendment would ensure that individuals challenging the decisions
of local authorities in all the contexts will be able to do so
effectively and efficiently. It would make provision for legal
challenges to be brought by, among others, those detained on mental
health grounds; those excluded from certain professions or activities
under the vetting and barring scheme; parents appealing against
decisions affecting the education of their children; and those affected
by immigration and welfare benefits decisions, including asylum
support. While representation would be provided for some of those
individuals under the Bill, the amendment reflects the importance of
proper legal representation in formal legal proceedings for all
individuals facing a public body in court or a tribunal in the areas of
law identified. The amendment is designed to address the practical
difficulties faced by litigants in person, particularly when they are
facing a public authority with the disparity of resources that that
entails—equality of arms once more.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000998">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As the
Government acknowledge in their literature review, the weight of the
evidence demonstrates that litigants in person face a wide range of
problems, including understanding evidential requirements, difficulties
with forms, problems identifying which facts are relevant to their case
and even understanding the nature of proceedings. The evidence also
supports the contention that litigants in person are frequently
overwhelmed by the procedure and oral demands of the court room and
have difficulty explaining the details of their cases. The
Government’s literature review also acknowledges the views of
court staff, the judiciary and other parties and representatives, who
have reported that they are forced to compensate for the difficulties
experienced by litigants in person, producing extra work and presenting
them with ethical
challenges.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720000999">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government’s answer, apparently, to such conspicuous
difficulties is to point to the availability of assistance such as
guides to court procedure, assistance from court staff and online help,
which I do not think are adequate at all. I am obliged to Liberty,
which assisted me in the preparation of the amendments. Put succinctly,
those are the amendments proposed, and I would be interested to hear
what the Minister has to say in
response.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720001000">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> The amendments are contrary to the basis of our
whole programme of reform and would increase the cost of legal aid
dramatically at a time when we are seeking to focus it on the highest
priority cases. As members of the Committee will be aware, we have had
to make some difficult choices about legal aid, and we set out our
rationale for changes to the scope of the scheme in the consultation
paper published last November.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720001001">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 139
seeks to bring into scope advocacy for appeals in the first-tier
tribunal against public authorities for a wide range of matters. It
seeks to extend legal aid for advocacy to areas where it is not
currently provided, such as for first-tier tribunal appeals concerning
welfare benefits, special educational needs, asylum support and
information rights. In practice, the amendment would provide advocacy
only for matters falling within the scope of part 1 of schedule 1, but
its intention is clearly wider than that.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720001002">&#160;</a>

               <div class="columnNumber">

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">We maintain
the view that legal representation will generally not be necessary in
these cases, given the user-friendly and accessible nature of the
tribunal. Furthermore, while legal aid is no doubt useful in appeals
concerning areas such as information rights, we consider that such
cases are not of high importance when compared, for example, with
issues of safety or homelessness. By way of example, the amendment
would make advocacy available for an individual in proceedings against
a public authority in various immigration cases. While we appreciate
the importance of such matters to the individuals concerned,
immigration tribunals are designed to be user-friendly, and
interpreters are provided free of
charge.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720001003">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendments
140 and 141 make consequential changes as a result of the amendments
that I have already discussed. Those amendments not only seek to retain
existing provision, but also seek to extend legal aid for advocacy to
hundreds of thousands of new cases. Legal aid for advocacy has never
been available for appeals in 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 388<a class="bkMark" name="Column388">&#160;</a>
                  </div>the first-tier tribunal on welfare benefits, asylum support, information
rights, Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority or special educational
needs cases. In 2009-10, there were 339,000 social security and child
support appeals to the first-tier tribunal. Extending legal aid for
advocacy for these appeals alone could cost up to
£500 million a year. I therefore urge the right hon.
Gentleman to withdraw his
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11090720001004">&#160;</a>
