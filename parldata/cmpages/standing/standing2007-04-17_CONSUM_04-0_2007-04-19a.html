					<a name="07041988000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">The twofold
effect of the amendment is to provide, first, that an affirmative vote
of the House is needed for Postwatch to be merged into the new National
Consumer Council and, second, that no such order can be made before
2010.</div>
					<a name="07041988000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
Minister will have gathered that my party is extremely concerned about
the timing of the merger of Postwatch into the NCC. We do not doubt the
long-term value of the merger, but we think that the NCC and its role
are sufficiently important that the council must start well, function
well and serve the long-term purpose in such a way as to be well
regarded by consumers in this country. In other words, it should not
get off on the wrong
foot.</div>
					<a name="07041988000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We
are also entering a crucial period for the work of the current
Postwatch. As we said earlier our debates, and as others have
acknowledged, we are facing the closure of probably 2,500 post offices
under a compulsory 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column112" />Column number: 112</div>programme. In addition, there will be voluntary closures&#151;there
always are. There is every reason to think that the pace of voluntary
closure may tend to increase, rather than decrease, as uncertainty is
added into the general picture. There is a general sense of a network
in decline, rather than a network in
revival.</div>
					<a name="07041988000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition,
Postwatch is taking on a second role, because Royal Mail has now
informed Postcomm that it wishes to change the way that it prices to
business. It is interested in a zonal system, which will have a huge
impact on rural businesses, which might well face much higher prices
for business post. Initially, the price differential would be small
but, from a reading of the details from Royal Mail, it would increase
significantly over time if the system were to go ahead.</div>
					<a name="07041988000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The same
issues will face businesses in outer London, including&#151;I may
say, for the purposes of conflict of interest&#151;my constituency.
Consumers will be impacted upon, because, undoubtedly, business is
likely to change how it communicates&#151;certainly with businesses
in rural or suburban areas, given the change in the pricing profile.
Postwatch is now taking on the work of surveying business, to feed into
the consultation on the issue, which will probably run until at least
this November. We are looking at two absolutely massive pieces of work,
which, frankly, do not overlap; they are completely different aspects
of the mail
service.</div>
					<a name="07041988000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">We were
concerned earlier that the core structure of the NCC&#146;s remit is
not regionally based. The council has the ability to put in place
regional committees, but that is not the core of its structure.
However, that is the core of Postwatch. In a sense, that is the
mechanism, through Postwatch, which will particularly focus on the
closure of those 2,500 post offices and any additional voluntary
closures. The Postwatch structure currently works regionally, and that
is how staff are organised, how the information flow is managed and how
authority spreads throughout the
system.</div>
					<a name="07041988000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We
are looking at those massive pieces of work at the same time as the
proposed changeover. Unfortunately, I have spent a significant amount
of my life in business organisations going through great change. From
direct knowledge, I can assure the Committee that nobody ever
overestimates the damage to morale that happens in a period of
uncertainty and change. It is always underestimated. The impact will be
devastating, even on people who are responsible and determined to carry
out their job well and to function best&#151;in this case, for this
country&#146;s consumers. The uncertainties are shared by families,
friends and neighbours. The people affected must make decisions about
whether they are going to move, and they do not really know whether
they will have a job or quite what is entailed. There is no way to give
adequate reassurance. We will be asking people not only to function in
that particularly difficult environment, but to carry out those two
major cases of
work.</div>
					<a name="07041988000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also
evident from our discussions in prior phases of the Committee and today
that much of the work that needs to be done to implement transition is
still in its early days. How is a vulnerable postal customer
identified? If someone calls in to complain about a letter, how do we
know whether they are vulnerable if we know nothing about their income,
their background or their history? All kinds of questions must be
answered before the NCC can step in properly to fulfil its
remit.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column113" />Column number: 113</div>
					<a name="07041988000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are not opposed to the merger
of Postwatch into the NCC, but it must be done with clarity and
effectively. If it is rushed, that causes various problems. To rush it
in the context of two crucial and critical pieces of work that will
have a great impact on both consumers and businesses is asking for a
disaster in the NCC&#146;s early days and would fail the public. This
is a crucial set of issues, and I urge the Government to think again,
and 2010 would seem the ideal date to aim for. Let us make sure that
everything is done and dusted, and done well, and that the public have
been properly served before making this change. The NCC is a body to be
there for the long term; it loses nothing by having a little patience
at the
start.</div>
					
					<a name="07041988000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07041988000170"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Mark Prisk</b> (Hertford and Stortford) (Con): I welcome you
to the Chair this afternoon, Mr. Caton.</div>
					<a name="07041988000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Richmond
Park has highlighted many of the issues that we would like the Minister
to address. I do not intend therefore to repeat them at length. The
Opposition are concerned about the merger of Postwatch and the new
council, both in terms of the principle and the timing. The hon. Lady
mentioned the latter. While far from perfect, certainly in the view of
the National Audit Office, Postwatch is very important in ensuring
effective representation for all mail consumers.</div>
					<a name="07041988000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Postal services are different
from utilities such as gas and electricity, both in their nature and
character, as the hon. Lady suggested. Sector-specific expertise needs
to be carried over. The Minister alluded to that in an earlier debate.
Therefore, what inquiries has he made to satisfy himself that such
expertise will be maintained? What processes and sector-specific issues
does he believe the new council will need to transfer? Is he satisfied
that the timing of the merger will not cause consumer interests to be
diminished? That is the heart of the concern, and it would be helpful
if he clarified that issue.</div>
					<a name="07041988000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before I was elected to the
House, I worked in the business world and it was clear to me that
mergers distract organisations and their management from focusing on
day-to-day issues. We have to be convinced that the Minister has taken
all reasonable steps and has considered what the problems will be, to
ensure the vital role of representing those consumers will not be lost
or diminished in the coming
months.</div>
					
					<a name="07041988000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07041988000171"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Jim
Fitzpatrick):
						</b>
						AmendmentNo. 13
would prevent the abolition of Postwatch under the Bill and would
therefore deny consumers in the postal services sector the benefit of
having a stronger, more coherent consumer advocate to represent their
interests.</div>
					<a name="07041988000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Amendment No.
22 would require the Secretary of State to carry out the abolition of
Postwatch by making an order, approved by a resolution of each House.
Concerns were raised on Second Reading about the timing of the merger,
which coincides with the post office network restructuring programme.
Amendment No. 22 seeks to delay the abolition of Postwatch until at
least 2010, by which time the restructuring programme should have been
completed.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column114" />Column number: 114</div>
					<a name="07041988000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						One of the
most fundamental objectives of the Bill is the creation of a
cross-sectoral consumer advocacy body, which is stronger than the sum
of its parts, to address the consumer issues that frequently exist
across sectors of the economy. The new body must have the critical mass
to engage effectively with the Government, regulators and industry
sectors, on the basis of expert and informed analysis, and the benefit
of being able to draw on experience and expertise from a number of
sectors.</div>
					<a name="07041988000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
Opposition Members have said, maintaining the existing sectoral
expertise in the postal services sector is vital to the new
body&#146;s success and to the Government&#146;s proposals for a
sustainable post office network. A strong consumer advocate and the
expertise that it will inherit will be important in a sector that has
only recently been opened to
competition.</div>
					
					<a name="07041988000142"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div>
					<a name="07041988000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						In
recognition of the importance to consumers of post office
restructuring, the new council will be given the specific function of
investigating any matter relating to the number and location of public
post offices, as we discussed under clause 16. That replicates the
provisions in the Postal Services Act 2000 that apply to Postwatch. The
new council will therefore continue the role of Postwatch in
representing the views of consumers in the post office restructuring
programme, thus offering consumers a strong voice on that issue and on
similar matters that arise in other
sectors.</div>
					<a name="07041988000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Delaying
the inclusion of Postwatch in the new arrangements for consumer
advocacy would not only delay the benefits to consumers of having a
strong voice to represent them, but prolong the period of uncertainty
for existing staff and consumers and increase the likelihood of staff
departures and retention
problems.</div>
					<a name="07041988000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						As
I mentioned this morning, we envisage that the new arrangements will be
in place within a year of the Bill&#146;s receiving Royal Assent.
Postwatch is fully engaged in early planning for the implementation of
the new arrangements. Two groups have been set up, tasked with ensuring
that the consumer interest continues to be effectively represented
during the transition to the new arrangements and when the new
arrangements are in
place.</div>
					<a name="07041988000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						For
example, work undertaken by the groups so far includes the preparation
of a timetable setting out key milestones on a critical path to
implementation; the mapping of existing work, resources and best
practice to be transferred to the new council, as well as additional
work that the new council could usefully undertake, such as greater use
of web-based consumer advocacy; the identification of tasks required to
close down Energywatch, Postwatch and the NCC; and early planning to
extend the consumer direct service to the energy and postal services
sectors. That service already provides help and advice to consumers
with inquiries and simple complaints relating to other sectors. Its
extension to consumers in the energy and postal services sector will
provide them with a first port of call for help, whatever sector their
inquiry or compliant relates to.</div>
					<a name="07041988000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						As hon.
Members would expect, we are taking great care to ensure that the work
being undertaken by Postwatch on post office network restructuring will
not be disrupted during the transition period. Additional staff and
other 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column115" />Column number: 115</div>resources are being allocated to Postwatch to assist with the programme,
and those resources will be carried forward into the new arrangements
for the duration of that
work.</div>
					
					<a name="07041988000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07041988000172"></a>Mr.
Prisk:
						</b> I am interested in the additional resources. By
whom are they being provided and who is
paying?</div>
					
					<a name="07041988000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07041988000173"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:
						</b> Postwatch is working up what it believes to
be the appropriate number of additional staff, and discussions are
going on with the shareholder executive. No financial problems have
been flagged up, so as far as I am aware, the budget is covering the
resources that are required.</div>
					
					<a name="07041988000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07041988000174"></a>Susan
Kramer:
						</b>
						Is the Minister referring to the
temporary staff that Postwatch always takes on to deal with a project
on this scale, or is he suggesting that an additional resource is being
put in, because he is trying to manage the transition on top of that? I
had understood that the standard number of staff associated with a
project on this scale would be involved.</div>
					
					<a name="07041988000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07041988000175"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:
						</b> The hon. Lady is correct in her assumption
that the additional staff are those who will have to deal with the
additional work load that will need to be undertaken when Post Office
Ltd publishes its proposals in the way that we have described and has
to engage with local communities, parliamentarians and so on.
Arrangements are in hand for them. Discussions are taking place to
identify what is required to make the transition as smooth as
possible.</div>
					<a name="07041988000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
underestimate the challenge, as the hon. Lady depicts it, that the new
NCC will face in ensuring that the transition is as seamless as
possible. Discussions and negotiations are taking place to ensure that
the appropriate arrangements are in place. The need for resources, such
as staff, will have to be taken into account. In the same way, full
weight is being given to the need to provide certainty to Postwatch and
the other consumer bodies about the location of the new
council&#146;s headquarters.</div>
					<a name="07041988000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are considering the issue
with the benefit of input from each of the consumer bodies. The
decision about where the new council will be located will take into
account such matters as the cost of the existing property portfolio and
concerns about the retention of staff and therefore the expertise of
the sector&#151;issues raised by the hon. Members for Richmond Park
and for Hertford and
Stortford.</div>
					<a name="07041988000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
recognise the importance that Postwatch places on the work of its
regional committees and the role that they will play in the assessment
of the post office network restructuring programme. The Bill makes
specific provisions to enable the new council to establish regional
committees where it considers that they will be beneficial to
consumers, as we have already discussed. That is a matter for the new
council to determine. However, as I have said, we are working with the
existing consumer bodies to plan for the implementation of the new
arrangements.</div>
					<a name="07041988000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
role of Postwatch in handling complaints by consumers is self-evidently
important. The new arrangements for the postal services sector as a
whole 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column116" />Column number: 116</div>include the introduction of redress schemes, to ensure the resolution of
complaints and to provide compensation or other forms of redress where
they are warranted. The redress mechanism must be independent from both
parties involved in a complaint, to ensure that the decisions reached
on each case are fair and impartial. That is why Postwatch does not
have the statutory functions to ensure complaint resolution, rather
than simply complaint handling. However, the redress schemes will
ensure that consumers receive resolution of each complaint, as the
decisions made by the redress schemes will be binding on suppliers in
the postal services
sector.</div>
					<a name="07041988000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Richmond Park raises an important point about the
identification of vulnerable consumers. She raised it this morning,
too. Obviously, we recognise the need to ensure that vulnerable
consumers can be identified, and, in any case, that process goes on at
present.</div>
					<a name="07041988000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I can
understand why the hon. Lady discussed Postwatch and Energywatch. They
deal with all complaints, and therefore evidence of a customer&#146;s
vulnerability can emerge during their exchanges with the consumer. We
are currently working with consumer bodies, businesses and established
redress schemes on all aspects of addressing complaints in practice,
including the identification of vulnerable consumers. However, the new
council will need to ensure that there are strong and effective
communications with Consumer Direct redress schemes and electricity,
gas and postal services companies. Some companies already have
specialist teams to help vulnerable consumers. We need to capture that
expertise and provide a system of communications to ensure that,
wherever vulnerability is identified, the right sort of help can be
provided.</div>
					<a name="07041988000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We all know
that consumers will contact anyone in the first instance&#151;that is
entirely understandable&#151;and they often contact us as Members of
Parliament, or write directly to Ministers. What we need to do and what
we will do is to bring to bear a new, coherent and cohesive approach to
dealing with consumer complaints generally and dealing with vulnerable
consumers in particular. As I mentioned to the hon. Lady, that work is
ongoing.</div>
					<a name="07041988000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
that these amendments do not best serve the interests of consumers. We
understand exactly why they have been proposed, and we recognise that
there is a genuine concern. However, we are confident in the
arrangements that we are making, and we therefore believe that the
amendments are unnecessary. I ask the hon. Lady to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

Kramer:
						</b>
						I appreciate the answer that the
Minister has given, and he was very good in expanding beyond the
narrowness of some of the issues that I raised; I appreciate that.
However, one of his arguments was that to delay the merger&#151;I
think that it is actually the takeover by NCC of Postwatch and that it
is clearly not a merger&#151;would deny mail users the advantages of
a redress scheme. I point out to him that, for a lost letter, the
typical redress is one book of 12 first-class stamps; that is hardly
what one would call a massive financial benefit. The value of following
up complaints in the mail service is to get improvements for the
future. So the redress scheme, although it will always be valuable and
I would always like one to be in place, is not the most urgent element
when dealing with the post.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column117" />Column number: 117</div>
					<a name="07041988000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister was very kind in
addressing the issue of vulnerability. I raise that matter at this
point&#151;it will be raised again at other points&#151;to
demonstrate how early in the process we are, because it is exceedingly
difficult to find a way to identify vulnerable users. I am talking
about a clause affecting the Post Office. However, as I said before,
when someone calls up and complains about a lost letter, what is done?
There is not some sort of financial history, as there might be if they
were being provided with electricity and they have an account. What do
we do? Do we say, &#147;Are you recently bereaved and feeling great
grief, so you cannot deal with this? Is your IQ rather low? Have you
had a recent bout of depression?&#148; How does one identify a
vulnerable user in that case? Perhaps there is a way to do it, but we
certainly have not arrived at it.</div>
					<a name="07041988000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are talking about merging
the organisations. Anybody who raises a complaint will lose the benefit
of Postwatch, which followed through any complaint, and complaints will
be narrowed down to the specified group. If we were doing only the
merger, I would understand that the Minister needed to progress as fast
as possible, but it is being done in the context of two major pieces of
work. One of them tends to be missed; I heard no reference to the
enormous piece of work that must be done on zonal pricing. It deals
primarily with the business sector and with consumers who will be
impacted, in addition to all the closures.</div>
					<a name="07041988000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate that the Minister
intends for all the work to succeed; I am objecting not for the purpose
of prevarication, but because I want the process to be successful, both
for consumers and for the NCC. I must therefore press the amendment to
a Division.</div>

						My
noble Friend, Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer, gave a very full
explanation of why the Liberal Democrats believe that 2011 should be
the earliest date. She referred to the time line of various framework
water directives and pricing rounds, and to the draft river basin
management plans, which are to be published for public consultation in
December 2008. The process will run until 2009, after which the revised
plans will be published and there will be a formal response. To
interfere with that and with the work of the CCW before then would be
unfortunate and disruptive.</div>
					<a name="07041988000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The pricing round that my noble
Friend mentioned relates to 2009. In January 2010, companies will
decide whether they want to appeal to the Competition Commission on the
price limits that will have been set for them in 2009. The pricing
round will have almost but not quite finished. Until 2009, the
CCW&#146;s input into that round will be very important
indeed.</div>
					<a name="07041988000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">The CCW has
undertaken work on the problems that have been experienced by all of us
recently in relation to the lack of water, hosepipe bans and the
difficulty of ensuring that people are treated fairly with regard to
water matters. That work indicates that it would be better to allow the
CCW to get off the ground.</div>
					<a name="07041988000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government still need to
make a case for incorporating the CCW into the NCC. There will be a
hiatus in the way matters progress. Important plans and important
pricing considerations will come to fruition by 2011, with a hiatus
before the following round, so we believe that 2011 is the right date
for any amalgamation of the CCW into the
NCC.</div>

								Mr.
Prisk:
						</b> I suspect that the amendment will encourage us to
drift beyond its terms into the substance of the clause. We discussed
some of the issues on Second Reading, and the argument of the hon.
Member for Solihull has considerable merit. As I believe most people
would recognise, the CCW is in a slightly different situation from the
bodies that deal with gas and electricity. It has been around only
since 2005, whereas the other bodies have existed for five or so years.
There are also differences in the markets in which they operate: water
supply is perhaps more naturally the subject of a monopoly than postal
services, as we have heard in debates.</div>
					<a name="07041988000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the price review that is
due in 2009, there will clearly be a problem with any merger that
happens at that time. I seek a coherent plan either to bring forward
the price review or to postpone the merger&#151;we can do one or the
other. The Minister indicated on Second Reading that the Government
were willing to consider the form of the change. In fact, it might not
have been the Minister himself; it may have been his colleague. I am
not saying that they are interchangeable&#151;they each have their
own merits.</div>

Kramer:
						</b>
						I very much appreciate the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s giving way. I was present during the Second Reading
debate and thought that I heard something rather different. I thought
that we heard from the Secretary of State that he proposed to
accelerate the merger, so that it would take place ahead of the price
review and the implementation of the directive. I thought that I heard
from Conservative Front Benchers some warm words suggesting that that
might appeal to them as a strategy. That is rather different from
accelerating the price review. It is obviously impossible to accelerate
the EU directive timetable. I wonder whether my interpretation was
right. If not, I am somewhat befuddled about the position of either of
the other
parties.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07041988000192"></a>Mr.

						</b> That was a fascinating intervention, not least
given the Minister&#146;s expression. He clearly does not recognise
that interpretation of the debate that we all attended
either.</div>
					<a name="07041988000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Coherence is
needed between the two events&#151;the price review and the change in
the role of the CCW. We are reasonably open to suggestions on how that
should be done, but it is unclear in the Bill how the Government intend
to square the circle. We need to hear that from the
Minister.</div>

						<a name="07041988000193"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Ben Wallace</b> (Lancaster and Wyre) (Con): I wish to ask the
Minister for one point of clarification on subsection (4). As a former
member of a devolved Parliament, I keep an eye on such matters from
time to time, to the boredom of most people. The subsection
states:</div>
					<a name="07041988000138"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;An
order under this section may only be made with the consent of the Welsh
Ministers.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07041988000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand the relationship between the Welsh Assembly and this place,
which is sovereign, but it is curious that the subsection says not that
the Government must consult Welsh Ministers but that they must have
their consent.</div>
					<a name="07041988000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Welsh Assembly chooses different parties in the election at the end of
the month but the Government decide to proceed with the abolition of
the council, we could be almost held hostage. Welsh Ministers could
say, &#147;We don&#146;t give you the consent. We just like it the
way it is, thank you very much.&#148; We might find ourselves in a
long-winded process if we decided to go ahead with the abolition, which
we could eventually achieve. I should like the Minister to clarify why
we are tied into consent, rather than consultation or any other
option.</div>
					
					<a name="07041988000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07041988000194"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:
						</b> May I say to the hon. Member for Hertford and
Stortford that when I referred to pay grades, I was not making
reference to remuneration and the loss of it on his side or the little
of it on mine? It was said in the context of decision-making progress 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column120" />Column number: 120</div>way above my pay grade. That was why I did not recall making any such
statement, as the hon. Member for Richmond Park suggested. I do not
believe that I would have the authority to make a statement about such
changes, but my right hon. Friends the Minister of State and the
Secretary of State could certainly have done so.</div>
					<a name="07041988000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the timing of the
consultation on the inclusion of the CCW, I am advised that my right
hon. Friend Minister of State said that he was in contact with it about
the potential for bringing forward the consultation on its inclusion
from 2008 if that would be helpful. That is the essence of the issue of
timing.</div>
					<a name="07041988000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">The effect of
the amendment would be to prevent the Secretary of State from making an
order to designate the CCW for abolition before 2011. The Bill provides
that the Secretary of State must consult the CCW, the new council and
other persons as appropriate before making an order designating the CCW
for abolition and subsequently transferring its functions to the new
council. Any order to include the water sector within the new
arrangements will therefore be made only after public consultation. I
hope that that gives the hon. Ladies some confidence about the
proposal.</div>
					<a name="07041988000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Assuming
that the results of the consultation suggest that there are significant
benefits to consumers from incorporating the water sector in the new
arrangements, any delay by the Secretary of State in making the order
merely delays extending those benefits to water consumers&#151;the
same consumers as those in the energy and postal services sectors. If
the new arrangements are shown to benefit consumers in the water
sector, we ask why we would wish to delay. Any delay would also prolong
the period of uncertainty for existing staff and consumers and increase
the likelihood of staff retention problems, because, as I said in
respect of the other bodies, staff departures would probably
increase.</div>
					<a name="07041988000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Delaying the
incorporation of the CCW will delay the benefits to consumers of having
a stronger voice to represent them and delay the extension of redress
schemes to the water sector to ensure that consumers benefit from
complaint resolution rather than simply complaint handling. Only
independent redress schemes, which can award redress such as an
explanation, apology or compensation as appropriate and whose decisions
are binding on regulated providers, can offer customers the certainty
of resolution.</div>
					<a name="07041988000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We recognise
that there will always be significant events in any market sector, such
as the price review in the water sector in 2009, or ongoing work on the
water framework directive and the river basin management plans that
require the consumer interest to be represented effectively, but that
is exactly what the new council will be designed to do. It will be an
even stronger voice for consumers across all sectors, with the critical
mass to engage effectively with the Government, regulators and industry
sectors, and with the benefit of being able to draw on experience and
expertise from a number of sectors.</div>
					<a name="07041988000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Price reviews
are not peculiar to the water sector. Europe now has an influence over
most sectors of our economy and the environment has never had a higher
place on the agenda. These issues should not be considered in
isolation, sector by sector. Experience and expertise can be taken from
one sector and applied to others, resulting in a more beneficial
outcome for consumers.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column121" />Column number: 121</div>
					<a name="07041988000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">We accept the need to retain a
degree of sector expertise, which is an integral part of our reforms.
The new council will be in an ideal position to benefit from the
sectoral expertise of the existing consumer bodies and from the lessons
learned in each sector, and to apply best practice across the
sectors.</div>
					
					<a name="07041988000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Lancaster

31(4) could arise with subsection (5) of this clause. If I may, I shall
repeat the point about clause 31. If there is a problem, the House
should deal with it in a responsible and balanced way. If the Minister
felt that he wanted to amend the provision at a later stage, perhaps on
Report, I would certainly be prepared on my party&#146;s behalf to
listen to him with

						This
probing amendment relates to subsection (3)(c). Its purpose is to
ensure that the Secretary of State consults other stakeholders when
extending the NCC&#146;s functions. Given that the NCC will, under
clause 21, have the power to establish business connections and
therefore receive support from business and industry, it is important
that those companies should be consulted if the functions of the
council change. The purpose of the amendment is to seek the
Minister&#146;s view and to discover exactly how the Government
intend to
proceed.</div>

						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his
characteristic generosity, which is so typical of his noble spirit, in
allowing me to intervene yet again. How would he define
&#147;industry experts&#148;? Karl Marx was an expert on industry,
and if he were alive, I doubt whether he would want to be
consulted&#151;or perhaps he would. What is an industry expert?
Surely, either we are all industry experts, or there is a specific
category of people who belong to the national federation of industrial
experts.</div>

be a fascinating body. What a gathering it would be and what a
glitterati of business expertise would
join.</div>
					<a name="07041988000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman rightly points out that the language must be clear. This is a
probing amendment, but my interpretation is that industry experts would
be experts in their industry, and would principally be trade and
representative bodies. Their expertise might be sector specific, but it
might not. The aim is to ensure that, as principal players in the
field, they should be consulted
appropriately.</div>

						I want to make one short
comment, which was made earlier. The NCC&#146;s primary role is to
represent consumers. It is obviously appropriate to consult with
industry when it might be brought under the umbrella, and there are
occasions when industry is a consumer. Will the Minister reinforce the
perspective of the NCC, which will not primarily be open to lobbying by
business? It will primarily face the consumer&#146;s
lobby.</div>

							<a name="07041988000208"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:
						</b>
						 I shall respond to the hon.
Lady&#146;s point. We had a useful discussion on Tuesday about the
definition of &#147;consumer&#148; and we agreed that businesses,
particularly small businesses, are consumers in many respects, so there
is a role for the NCC to represent business in a number of ways. That
is not what the amendment is about; it is about consumer entitlement.
None the less, I hope that I have clarified the hon. Lady&#146;s
point.</div>
					<a name="07041988000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful
to the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford for tabling the
amendment, but I am not saying that we will accept it&#151;one is
probably enough today. There was a good debate on this point in the
other place, but perhaps this is an opportunity for further
clarification.</div>
					<a name="07041988000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
37 will permit the Secretary of State, by order, to confer on the new
council any other function if he</div>
					<a name="07041988000139"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;considers that it in the
interests of consumers generally, or consumers of a particular
description, to do
so.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07041988000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
provides two key conditions for the use of that power. First, the
functions envisaged must relate directly to an existing or former
function of the council. Secondly, before making an order under the
clause, the Secretary of State will be obliged to consult the council,
Welsh Ministers in cases that might affect 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column124" />Column number: 124</div>Wales and the functions exercisable by Welsh Ministers, and such other
persons as the Secretary of State considers
appropriate.</div>
					<a name="07041988000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment to the last category would add</div>
					<a name="07041988000140"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;including companies and industry
experts who would be affected by such an
order&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07041988000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any consultation
undertaken under the clause would be public consultation. As is our
established practice, any consultation should try to reach all those
who may have an interest in the subject, together with all those who
may have a valuable contribution to make if their interest can be
sparked. It follows that it is part of good consultation practice to
seek to reach all those potential consultees who are affected by the
proposals and who may have a contribution to
make.</div>
					<a name="07041988000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The range of
stakeholders consulted will depend very much on the nature of what is
proposed and on those who may be affected by it. However, it stands to
reason that if businesses would be affected by the proposed new
functions, it would be right, proper and necessary for the Secretary of
State to consult businesses and trade associations as appropriate. In
addition, as the consultation would be public, it would certainly be
open to anyone, including companies and industry experts affected by
any proposed extension of functions, to contribute their
views.</div>
					<a name="07041988000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
believe that the existing provision makes sensible and adequate
provision for consulting a range of appropriate persons, and for those
reasons and my additional clarification, I hope that the hon. Gentleman
will understand why we do not believe that the amendment is
necessary.</div>

Minister&#146;s opening remarks that we were going to get two crumbs
from the table; but sadly, it is not to be. Nevertheless, his remarks
that it would be right, proper and necessary for the organisations to
which I refer, including industrial experts of all character, to be
consulted are encouraging. On that basis and having heard that and got
it on the record, I beg leave to withdraw the
