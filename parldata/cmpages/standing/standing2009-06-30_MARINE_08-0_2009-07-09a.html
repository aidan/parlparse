Richard Benyon</b> (Newbury) (Con): I beg to move amendment
44, in clause 296, page 192, line 21, at end
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(3A) Where a person
with a relevant interest in affected land has requested Natural England
to provide a map showing the landward boundary of the relevant coastal
margin, but the report contains a description of that boundary pursuant
to subsection (3)(b) instead of a map, the report must also contain a
statement of Natural England&#146;s reasons for declining to comply
with the person&#146;s request for a
map.&#146;.</div><a name="09070988000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would provide for owners and occupiers of land to make a
formal request to Natural England for a map. It would require Natural
England, if it declined such a request, to state its reasons for doing
so in its report to the Secretary of State. That would discourage
vexatious requests and encourage close co-operation between the owner
or occupier of land and Natural England to identify the most
appropriate method of defining the extent of the coastal
margin.</div><a name="09070988000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the Bill stands, unlike the coastal route itself, the spreading room
associated with it is not automatically subject to a mapping
requirement. Instead, we are to rely primarily on the descriptions in
the reports made by Natural England to the Secretary of State. Given
that a reduced liability will be associated with spreading room, it is
all the more important that there be clarity on legal responsibility,
to protect the landowner or occupier of the land and the user. A
textual description alone, especially in respect of complicated areas,
may result in considerable confusion in the minds of all users: the
landowners, occupiers and
walkers.</div><a name="09070988000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
progress was made on the issue in another place. An amendment to clause
296 has given owners and occupiers the right to request a map if one
has been produced to show the extent of any spreading room on their
land. However, that amendment does not adequately deal with the
problem, as it remains the case that Natural England is not committed
to produce a map in the first place. That is an essential difference
with the Countryside and Rights of Way Act
2000.</div><a name="09070988000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
simple amendment would deal with a problem that is likely to arise,
without individuals having to invoke the appeals process. It would be
absurd for owners and occupiers to have to invoke the new objection
procedure merely to obtain a map to clarify the boundaries of spreading
room on their land. If genuine doubts are expressed by owners and
occupiers about the clarity of any description of the boundaries of
spreading room, Natural England should consult them closely and look
favourably on any reasonable request for
mapping.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column260" />Column number: 260</div><a name="09070988000017"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09070988000311"></a><b class="B">Andrew
George</b> (St. Ives) (LD): I support the amendment. I cannot
see how any progress could be made in any consultation regarding a
proposal for a coastal route, particularly in relation to spreading
room, unless it was made clear where the spreading room would extend.
At many places along the coast, there is no obvious physical boundary
to any potential spreading room. If the spreading room were to spread
inland as well as in a seaward direction, because of the physical
constraint created by a path that would need to be very close to a
cliff line or to the coast to achieve the spreading room required,
there would often be no clear visual or physical boundary to guide
anyone on their access
rights.</div><a name="09070988000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is important, because the uncertainty created by the lack of
a clear mapping exercise could result in confusion and dispute, which
would be left to the landowner to resolve on each and every occasion
when a user of that coastal access demonstrated their lack of clarity
and certainty about the extent of the spreading room. So I hope that
the Minister reflects carefully on the proposal and considers its
reasonableness.</div>
<a name="09070988000019"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000312"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs (Huw Irranca-Davies):</b> I think that I can provide
reassurance. I take seriously the concerns of the hon. Members for
Newbury and for St. Ives. I agree with the comment made by the hon.
Member for Newbury about the need to avoid confusion. We need to avoid
confusion, but we also need to avoid mapping for mapping&#146;s sake,
with all the resource and funding implications, particularly if there
are other ways in which that clarity can be given and where absolute
mapping can be avoided.</div>
<a name="09070988000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me try to
explain how that might work. Natural England will be required to
describe the route in reports proposed under section 51 of the National
Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. The boundaries of the
coastal margin must be clear in the report, so that those with the
relevant interest can make representations and objections and the
Secretary of State is sufficiently informed to be able to make a
determination on the report. In light of the concerns that were
expressed in the other place, and recognising that the clarity of the
location of the route and coastal margin is an important issue to both
landowners and users alike, we introduced an amendment to require
Natural England to include in its coastal access report, under clause
296, a map to show a landward boundary of the relevant coastal land
where it was unable to provide a description of the boundary sufficient
to identify the relevant coastal margin. Let me just repeat that
Natural England must include such a map when it is unable to provide a
description of a boundary, which the hon. Member for St. Ives was
talking about, that is sufficient to identify the relevant coastal
margin.</div>
<a name="09070988000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">We talked
earlier about descriptions of physical features. We have all been out
walking along the coastline and in other areas. We said that
traditional stone walls, trenches or ditches are highly unlikely to be
easily shiftable or mutable overnight. On one of my favourite walks, I
go along the outer limit of a hill fort near a cliff within that sort
of spreading room area where there is access. I walk there with my
children, and it is enjoyable to go into the hill fort and tell them
about its history. We could define its area by the outer limit of the
ditches and its raised enclosures, hedgerows and so on. Those 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column261" />Column number: 261</div>sorts of things are pretty clearly identifiable, but the amendment that
we introduced in the other place dealt with circumstances where Natural
England could not provide a description of the boundary with sufficient
clarity to determine the relevant coastal
margin.</div><a name="09070988000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have made it clear that we do not believe that maps will be necessary
for clarity about where the coastal margin lies in most situations. We
expect that the vast majority of Natural England&#146;s descriptions
of the margin will be sufficient to suit all parties, but I acknowledge
that it may be necessary for it to provide a map to help to clarify
certain situations&#151;for example, where the coastal landscape is
complex or difficult to describe in
words.</div><a name="09070988000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, a map may also be useful where Natural England uses its
discretion for the margin on the landward side of the route to extend
to a physical feature, as set out in section 55D(2) of the 1949 Act,
where the feature is not immediately apparent to the eye. The hill fort
that I mentioned is pretty darn clear and has been there for a few
thousand years. It would be pretty hard to miss those humps and
ditches. However, if an archaeological feature or something else is
referred to that cannot be seen by the untrained eye, it makes sense to
produce a map. It would not be sensible or appropriate for Natural
England to be required to engage in what would be&#151;if it was done
on every occasion, let us be frank&#151;an expensive mapping process,
when the money could be better spent on matters such as better
interpretation facilities of the coast, better signage or work to
facilitate good access.</div>
<a name="09070988000024"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09070988000313"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Hugo Swire</b> (East Devon) (Con): I am surprised to hear the
Minister say how expensive it would be to provide the maps, given that
it is pretty easy to map nowadays with satellite usage. Google Maps,
for example, does quite a good job. What sort of figure does he have in
mind to produce a comprehensive
map?</div><a name="09070988000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000314"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> We do not have a figure, which is one of
the amendment&#146;s problems. The funding that we have suggested for
the coastal path and the coastal margin over the 10-year period is
adequate and has an element of mapping within it. To do that
universally would require additional resources. However, it is not
beyond the realms of possibility that one of the commercial providers,
such as Ordnance Survey, will undertake to do it in detail. The coastal
margin beyond the coastal path, which may be a path with a couple of
metres either side, will not always be massive. It may be quite narrow
and may not be mappable by Ordnance
Survey.</div><a name="09070988000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000315"></a>Mr.
Swire:</b> The Minister has said on several occasions during
the past few minutes that a substantial cost would be unjustifiable.
His Department must have made a stab at what the cost will
be.</div><a name="09070988000027"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000316"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I will try to return to that. I do not
think that we have an accurate figure, but it is reasonable to say that
the cost of mapping, in terms of its resource implications, will be a
burden for Natural England that could be put into other important parts
of the coastal network, not least the aspects that we  have
already described, such as interpretation for  visitors and
tourists, signage, seasonal variations and  so on. There will
be a resource implication one way or the other.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column262" />Column number: 262</div><a name="09070988000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
said&#151;I will go into some more detail&#151;it is perfectly
within Natural England&#146;s remit to produce maps where they are
needed. It should be for Natural England to decide whether a map is
required, because it will be best placed to do that. I would also
expect that the question of a map will be raised during any early
discussions with a route&#146;s landowner. A conversation should be
held between the relevant parties about the best approach to the
circumstances surrounding that stretch of coast. I would also expect
Natural England to deal sympathetically with landowners&#146;
concerns. Should there be a reasonable expectation to produce a map and
Natural England decide that it is not required, I would expect it to
explain in writing why it made that decision. I do not believe that
that needs to be covered by the Bill, because I firmly believe that the
system will work well in
practice.</div><a name="09070988000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
recognising the genuine concerns of landowners, I am happy to keep the
system under review and ask Natural England to report back within five
years. That will provide an incentive if it is needed&#151;I do not
think that it is&#151;to Natural England to act reasonably, as I
strongly expect it to in any case. If there are problems in practice,
we will find a way to deal with them. In light of that, as well as the
available flexibility to introduce mapping and the fact that, in most
cases, that will be agreed, the amendment proposed by the hon. Member
for Newbury does not need to be included in the Bill. I am convinced
that the amendments that we have already included to assure landowners
and members of the Committee will be
sufficient.</div><a name="09070988000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000317"></a>Mr.
Swire:</b> Can the Minister assure the Committee that, if
there is a dispute between the landowner and Natural England about the
route or the spreading room and a map is produced at the insistence of
the landowner, none of the expense would fall on the
landowner?</div><a name="09070988000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000318"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> The expense of mapping would fall on
Natural England, which is the converse of the point that we were just
discussing. It is ready to do that, so that is not a problem. The issue
is whether Natural England should have to map every single part,
because the matters under discussion are coastal margins and aspects of
spreading room. Most of that will be done via the process that we have
described through genuine consultation with landowners. When features
such as a wall or the edge of a hill fort cannot clearly be identified,
we would expect Natural England to introduce mapping for the benefit of
the landowner. With those strong reassurances, I ask the hon. Gentleman
to withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="09070988000278"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000319"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> The main plank of the Minister&#146;s argument
seems to be cost. He might have given us more detail on the costs. I
notice that in Natural England&#146;s draft scheme, which I seem to
be quoting from the whole time, there are some excellent maps,
lifted&#151;if the small print is to be believed&#151;from Ordnance
Survey. I suspect that they were a desktop operation. What they try to
achieve and to show is clear, and so I suspect that the cost is not
massive.</div><a name="09070988000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Throughout
this part of the Bill, we are being asked to put a lot of faith in
Natural England&#146;s ability to come up with the right balance. I
am happy to go along with the Minister&#146;s assurances of a
four-yearly review, which 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column263" />Column number: 263</div>the Conservative party would undertake if it were in government. We
would be keen to ensure that Natural England was operating in a
proportionate way, and showing consideration for the fact that we are
setting new parameters for people&#146;s livelihoods and businesses
and placing new factors in their lives. In some cases, those represent
a considerable imposition on members of the public, and in others
little. It is important that we get that balance
right.</div><a name="09070988000034"></a>

is me again, I am afraid, Mr. Pope. With this amendment we
seek to examine again the relationship between the proposed coastal
path and the planning system. Despite much discussion on this on Report
in another place, and a paper from the Department for Environment, Food
and Rural Affairs, it is still unclear to many people how the
relationship between the coastal margin and the planning system will
work. Will, for example, the coastal path or the coastal margin be a
material consideration for planning purposes? Will designation of
either serve to restrict or limit development? What guidance will be
provided to local planning authorities? We discussed some of those
questions this morning, but some of them still need to be answered. The
Minister has suggested that the point of designating coastal access
under the CROW Act 2000 was that it could be flexible and accommodate
changes in land use over time. However, he was less clear about how
that would be communicated to local planning authorities.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column264" />Column number: 264</div><a name="09070988000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a

response to the market place...However, the danger...is that

addition, if the development is permitted, or if the landowner changes
the use of his land, there is no right in the Bill and no process set
out by which landowners can require Natural England to review the
coastal access reports. Although Natural England has the ability to
review the reports, it is at its discretion. That may cause problems
especially for smaller landowners or businesses that may end up trying
to manage changes in their business alongside unchanged access because
no review of the coastal access report has been undertaken. Lord Davis
accepted that land managers must have flexibility, so that they can
change the use of their land as they need to. There therefore needs to
be some process in place so that Natural England can be required to
review reports when those changes
arise.</div><a name="09070988000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
amendment would help to remove uncertainty over future changes in land
use by ensuring that the Bill enables landowners to request a review of
a report to take account of the changes. It is a sensible and necessary
safeguard. If not, owners will have to wait until Natural England
chooses to review a report, which is likely to stifle coastal
businesses, particularly those where only small changes are required to
enable them to continue to grow and thrive. Failure to include such a
provision in the Bill will cast doubt on the Government&#146;s stated
commitment to ensure that businesses will have the flexibility to adapt
and
change.</div><a name="09070988000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09070988000323"></a><b class="B">Mr.

which is whether this Government are serious about being on the side of

Bill is not only about access to the coast&#151;to which all parties
are signed up&#151;but about ensuring that there is a fair
compensatory scheme for those who will suffer and about balancing the
rights of the landowner and the farmer with those of people who wish to
make use of the facility. As the Bill is currently constructed, the
rights are not balanced. That would be greatly improved if the
amendment was included in the Bill, as it underscores
flexibility.</div><a name="09070988000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the seascape and landscape change over generations, so may the
requirements of the landowner to take advantage of the coastal changes.
The Minister referred to hill forts. Well, there was not always a hill
fort there, but it is now something that needs to be preserved.
Likewise, if students of John Fowles&#146;s &#147;The French
Lieutenant&#146;s Woman&#148; walked that wonderful bit of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column265" />Column number: 265</div>south-west coastal path between Seaton in my constituency and
Uplyme&#151;the famous Undercliff&#151;which is the one of the
great walks in the UK, I would submit, they would be aware of the slip
at Bindon. The Bindon slip was a great tourist attraction in the 19th
century, when an enormous slippage of land created Goat island, which
itself became a huge tourist attraction. Physically, the landscape was
changing. Without the ability in the Bill to change or re-examine
coastal access&#151;if it was fixed in stone&#151;that could not
have
happened.</div><a name="09070988000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are other uses that landowners may want to change, such as the planting
of trees for shelter, some protective work against the elements and
walling and fencing to keep livestock in. Such work will not
necessarily happen often, but unless it is in the Bill, it will not
happen at all, because there will be no inherent flexibility.</div>
<a name="09070988000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000324"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> If a landowner&#151;I have done this on
land that I own, which is not on the coastal strip&#151;were to bring
forward a proposal, for example, to plant deciduous, woodland trees,
which would diminish our carbon footprint and enhance biodiversity, I
suspect that Natural England, as our statutory and principal adviser on
conservation, would be banging on the door and offering to work with
that landowner. The Bill has the flexibility for
that.</div>
<a name="09070988000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000325"></a>Mr.
Swire:</b> Natural England might do that, but it might involve
an alteration to the spreading room or indeed the access, which is
surely the point. We need a clause that can cover any eventuality. Just
as the Minister prayed in aid the fact that there was no need to have
universal mapping, because the occasions when a dispute would need to
be settled in that way would be few and far between, likewise, the
provision might be used on very few occasions, but it needs to be in
Bill. We are not taking a strong position, but encouraging grown-up
flexibility, which should be the keystone in making this a workable
piece of legislation.</div>
<a name="09070988000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000326"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Ann
McKechin):</b> I welcome the debate on the amendment, but let
me reassure the hon. Gentleman that the Government have no intention of
being vindictive or having a fixed position&#151;nothing in our
debate so far on the Bill has provided evidence of that. We are
certainly on the side of promoting business and tourism. One of the
major reasons why people have pointed to the benefit of greater coastal
access is that it is likely to lead to substantial growth in local
economies&#151;particularly in the tourism business. Each year in
this country,  over 70 million trips are made to the coast,
with over  &#163;1.4 billion being spent. That helps to
support a large number of small businesses, particularly in Devon,
Cornwall and other parts of the country with quite vulnerable economies
and where the tourism industry is key and vital. The Bill is
tourism&#146;s friend, not its enemy.</div>
<a name="09070988000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">I recognise
the reasoning behind amendment 49, which would allow any person with a
relevant interest in land to trigger a review on certain grounds.
Natural England is already able to review a report if it thinks that
necessary. Provisions in the National Parks and Access to the
Countryside Act 1949 and in the Bill envisage that Natural England will
do that of its own volition. Section 55(2) of the 1949 Act also gives
the Secretary of State the discretion to review the report. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column266" />Column number: 266</div>He may do that if it is brought to his attention by landlords,
businesses or the general economy that issues need
change.</div><a name="09070988000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
the CROW Act there is nothing to prevent land from becoming excepted
land under schedule 1 by reason of development. I reassure the hon.
Member for Newbury again that there is nothing in the nature of the
provision to restrict development or change. He also mentioned material
considerations. The court rulings on this issue and under planning law
have held that virtually anything can be a material consideration in a
planning case, so we can use wide discretion in defining that. That
would be the guiding factor in any challenge.</div>
<a name="09070988000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Chapter 2 of
the CROW Act already contains mechanisms for a landowner to apply for
new restrictions and exclusions of access for certain reasons. Those
will remain in place for the coastal margin with certain modifications
to take account of the coastal situation.</div>
<a name="09070988000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000327"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> I hope that before the Minister sits down she will
explain what guidance the Government or, through them, Natural England
will provide to local planning authorities on how they should view the
relationship between this provision and possible future
developments.</div>
<a name="09070988000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000328"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> I will come to that.</div>
<a name="09070988000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is also
a right of appeal in the CROW Act against a refusal to make a
direction, which will be preserved for the coastal margin. That is an
important protection. Natural England also has a power to provide an
alternative route to the ordinary route during any period in which
access to the ordinary route is excluded by reason of a direction for
an exclusion or restriction. There is no particular need for an
additional review of exclusions and directions.</div>
<a name="09070988000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I recognise
the concerns expressed in the other place about the impact of
development on the route, where the route could later be interrupted by
development. Those concerns may lie behind the amendment. The new right
of access to coastal land given under provisions in the CROW Act is a
flexible right to allow for the changes in land use. We are holding
talks at present with the Department for Communities and Local
Government on the nature of the guidance that will be provided to local
authorities in terms of the Planning
Act.</div><a name="09070988000279"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30
pm</div><a name="09070988000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
consultation, which we discussed in our debate on amendments 42 and 55
and which Natural England will undertake prior to drawing up a coastal
access report, will identify likely new developments so that it can
take them into account when drawing up the proposals. It is unlikely
that Natural England will not be aware of nationally significant
developments. Should there be developments after the route has been put
in place, Natural England will have a power under section 55 of the
National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 to draw up a
report proposing a variation of the route, subject to the full
consultation and representation process. I hope that I have reassured
hon. Members  that there already is adequate provision to cater
for any developments that may affect the route, including
action<i class="I"> </i>by the Secretary of State under the 1949 Act. On that
basis I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000329"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> That shows why this is a subsidiary piece of the
Bill. A body of effort quite rightly went into preparing for the marine
Bill, which we all want to see on the statute books as quickly as
possible, but this part of the Bill has not been properly thought
through. It has been brought to this stage of the parliamentary process
without proper consultation with planning authorities and I can
guarantee that some planning authorities will interpret it in a
completely different way from others. I just do not believe that this
can be allowed to drift in this way. I therefore think our amendment is
right. It secures a requirement on the Government to develop and
clearly state that relationship with the planning
system.</div><a name="09070988000058"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000346"></a>Mr.

page 196, line 23, at end
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(3) Nothing in this
section shall preclude a person with a relevant interest in affected
land from making an appeal under section 30 of the CROW Act for an
exclusion or restriction of the right of access at a subsequent date
after approved proposals have been
implemented.&#146;.</div><a name="09070988000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
we welcome the inclusion of amendments made in another place to rectify
the fundamental omission from the Bill of an independent appeals
process, we remain concerned that there may be cases after the
establishment phase, possibly several years later, in which changes to
circumstances make adjustments to local land management necessary. For
example, walkers&#146; exercise of their right of access might prove
different from what was expected, or, if ownership of the land changes,
the new owner might want to manage the land differently. Perhaps the
physical features of the coast itself will have altered over time due
to erosion, climate change and so on, a factor noted in the
guidance.</div><a name="09070988000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be desirable, of course, for adjustments to exclusions and
restrictions to the right of access to be put in place by agreement
with Natural England and/or the local access authority. However, where
no such agreement can be achieved, it is important that occupiers
should be able to appeal against a refusal by Natural 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column268" />Column number: 268</div>England to alter a restriction or exclusion regime, as occupiers of open
country can do currently under  sections 24 and 30 of the CROW
Act. Our amendment&#146;s intention is simply to confirm that owners
and occupiers of land and those on coastal margin will be able to
appeal against refusals of their applications for changes in the
exclusions and restrictions regime in the same way currently allowed in
relation to open country under the CROW
Act.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000347"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> We might be able to deal with this
relatively quickly. I will give an assurance right at the outset,
because I think that the issue comes down to how the CROW Act can be
used. This Government have no intention of amending the provisions for
appeals in section 30 of CROW, to which I will turn in a moment. Any
such amendment would be made under a section 3A order, which would
itself be subject to affirmative resolution in Parliament, and I am
sure that that would inspire lively debate. It is not the
Government&#146;s intention to change the categories of person who
might make an application for restrictions and exclusions under section
24 of the CROW Act, and I suspect that the hon. Gentleman, if he were
in my place, would have no intention of amending them.</div>
<a name="09070988000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said
that at the outset, I will go into detail. Clause 296 inserts new
sections into the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949
to provide for the coastal route. New section 55D(5) requires Natural
England to identify and include in a coastal access report all
restrictions and exclusions that would be necessary if the coastal
access report were approved. Landowners and others may also make
representations on the final report, including proposals for additional
exclusions and restrictions or changes to those proposed by Natural
England.</div>
<a name="09070988000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition,
as we have discussed, those with an interest in affected land may make
objections on certain grounds, including the inclusion or failure to
include a proposal for a restriction or exclusion. New
section 55F(2) requires Natural England to make directions
relating to any exclusions or restrictions in accordance with its
proposals set out in an approved coastal access report, or with any
variations of those proposals made by the Secretary of State. Taken
together, the provisions require all exclusions and restrictions
necessary at the time when the coastal access report was drawn up to be
included in the report and directions to be given putting in place the
exclusions or restrictions proposed in the
report.</div><a name="09070988000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsequent
changes to the situation necessitating new or different restrictions or
exclusions are catered for in sections 24 and 25 of CROW, under which a
person with an interest in any land may make an application for an
exclusion or restriction of access for land management purposes. We
debated that to some extent in earlier clauses, and I have made clear
my intention not to revisit it. The applicant may appeal to the
Secretary of State where the relevant authority fails to make a
direction in accordance with the
application.</div><a name="09070988000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
45 would insert a new subsection to section 55J, to provide that the
new provisions inserted into the 1949 Act by clause 296 do not preclude
a person with a relevant interest in affected land from appealing
against a decision to refuse application  from an exclusion or
restriction of access after the approved proposals and report have been
implemented.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column269" />Column number: 269</div><a name="09070988000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say to the
Committee, as I have said in our earlier discussions on relevant
interests, that those with relevant interests, as defined in section 45
of the CROW Act, will have the same rights as they do on CROW land to
apply for restrictions and exclusions of access for land management
reasons. Natural England must issue a direction for a restriction or an
exclusion if it is necessary and access cannot be suitably managed in
any other way. If the application is turned down or a direction
proposed by Natural England is not in accordance with the terms of that
application, there is a right of appeal to the Secretary of State under
section 30 of the  CROW Act.</div>
<a name="09070988000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">I repeat that
it is not the Government&#146;s intention to make changes to the
categories of people who may make applications for restrictions and
exclusions under section 24 of the CROW Act. Once again, I make it
clear that the Government do not intend to amend the provisions for
appeals in section 30 of the CROW Act. As I have said, any such
amendment would be made under a section 3A order, which itself would be
subject to the affirmative resolution process in both Houses of
Parliament. Therefore, any such amendment would come under a fair
degree of scrutiny and we have no intention of making any such
amendment. We have already indicated the main measures that we intend
an order, under section 3A, to contain. We will consult on these
proposals before submitting them to Parliament. I have already
clarified what matters we do not consider relevant to bring
forward.</div>
<a name="09070988000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
that the extensive consultation and representations process before the
position of the coastal route is determined, combined with those
provisions in the CROW Act for a relevant interest to apply for
restrictions or exclusions to access, will indeed create that
principled point behind the Bill, which is getting that fair balance in
ensuring that all views are appropriately
considered.</div><a name="09070988000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
given that clarification and reassurance, I urge the hon. Gentleman to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09070988000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000348"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> The Minister&#146;s words are on the record and
I am happy that that clarification has been given. Therefore, I beg to

<a name="09070988000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000349"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> Before we leave clause 296, may I ask the Minister
to give assurances about the physical feature issue of a coastal
margin? There is concern about certain areas where there is no
definable point at which the spreading room could be deemed to be
finished. There are plenty of places where, for example, a large field
runs down to the coast. What I do not want to see is landowners rushing
before the Bill comes in to place fences in what were formerly open
fields to reduce both the visual and physical amenity for walkers and
anyone else who enjoys that part of the countryside. Therefore, some
explanation needs to be given about what features constitute a limit to
where the spreading room finishes.</div>
<a name="09070988000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suspect
that we will come on to this issue when we discuss amendment 66, in
respect of park land. However, it is conceivable that there are areas
where it would be impossible for the walker to determine right of
access, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column270" />Column number: 270</div>unless enormous amounts of effort are made on signage and possibly even
on creating barriers that none of us want to see. I would welcome any
explanation that the Minister could give on that
issue.</div><a name="09070988000280"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45
pm</div><a name="09070988000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000350"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> To expand on the debate that we had on
this issue earlier, it is certainly conceivable that, for example,
where there is no clear physical feature that can be easily identified,
Natural England, in consultation with the landowner, could flag up an
area in one way or another to identify exactly where the spreading room
is. That possibility is there.</div>
<a name="09070988000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I concur with
the hon. Gentleman. It had also gone through my mind that a concerned
landowner might rush to move that field fence. I am not saying that
many would do&#151;I do not think so. But if they were worried about
where the spreading was going, that picket and wire fence might
suddenly go 10 yd seaward. I do not think that would happen, by and
large. Clear physical features can be described; an absence of clear
physical features enters the realms of mapping, or using some other
flexible approach such as determination by a marker. A variety of
approaches can be used to reassure landowners as well as walkers about
where they should walk and for Natural England to do a proper localised
approach to bring in this fore edge, which I think we would all want to
do.</div><a name="09070988000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
I would not want to limit the flexibility to use appropriate physical
features. It may not be easy to identify them all in advance. However,
Natural England may want to consider whether it can give clarification
in its scheme, which will set out in more detail the approach it wants
to take in implementing this part of its coastal access duty. The
scheme will be subject to public consultation once the Bill becomes
law. That will be a chance for all Committee Members and others with
concerns to have an input into the final scheme, including where the
boundary is on the landward side. The final scheme has to be approved
by the Secretary of State. I urge Committee Members and those listening
to our deliberations who have concerns to input into that consultation
so that the final scheme is
clear.</div><a name="09070988000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000351"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000352"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> I beg to move amendment 48, in schedule 19,
page 305, leave out lines 33 to
35.</div><a name="09070988000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are making great progress but this is a really important issue. I hope
to get reassurance from the Minister and for her to understand what we
are trying to achieve. The amendment is designed to firm up the
objection process in schedule 19 to ensure that the Secretary of State
cannot overturn a recommendation of the independent appeal body except
in very limited circumstances. Proposed new paragraph 16(3)(a), which 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column271" />Column number: 271</div>we seek to remove, states that the Secretary of State is bound to adhere
to the recommendation of the independent appeal body on an objection
unless that recommendation
involves</div><a name="09070988000260"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an
assessment of the
significance&#148;</div><a name="09070988000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">of
a coastal access matter to someone with an interest in the land. That
means that the Secretary of State can overturn the decision of the
independent appeal body if the significance of the coastal access
rights has been assessed. I would be interested to learn when such
rights would not be assessed with regard to an objection. How could the
appointed body make a recommendation about fair balance without
considering the impact of the proposals on the landholder and the
public? Indeed, the appeal body would be failing in its duty if it
were not to consider the significance of matters to users
and owners. It would, therefore, appear
that sub-paragraph (3)(a) &#151;introduced as an
amendment on Third Reading in another place&#151;provides a loophole,
giving the Secretary of State the ability to overturn any decision made
by the independent appeal body. I reiterate that we were glad to see
the addition of the independent appeal process in another place.
However, we are concerned that this sub-paragraph serves to dilute the
authority of the independent body&#146;s decisions.</div>
<a name="09070988000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the
appeal process was debated in another place and with industry bodies,
it was repeatedly asserted that any objection or appeal process must
meet the terms of article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights
and, in particular, provide an independent appeal process that had some
validity and would not be overturned by the Secretary of State. If the
Secretary of State is able to overturn almost any decision, it makes a
mockery of the so-called independent appeal process. That is not what
was intended by the noble Lords in another place, or the industry
bodies that were extensively consulted. Paragraph 16(3) of schedule 19
specifies the circumstances in which the Secretary of State might
reasonably go against the recommendation of the independent appeals
body and includes the ability to overturn recommendations that are
&#147;perverse or irrational&#148; or for which there is
&#147;insufficient evidence&#148;. We have no problem with the
Secretary of State exercising his powers in such circumstances.
However, through amendment 48, we seek to remove
sub-paragraph (3)(a), which effectively gives him the power to overturn
any decision. It completely undermines the whole objection appeals
process. Indeed, peers, in the other place, have expressed their
concerns about whether the provision even complies with the European
convention on human rights. In order to ensure that the objection
process is enacted as originally intended, we seek the removal of this
provision.</div><a name="09070988000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000353"></a>Mr.
Swire:</b> The retention of sub-paragraph (3)(a) raises a
question about why, if the Secretary of State has so little faith in an
independent appeals body, he bothers to have one at all. If he wants to
decide all these matters himself, why does he not just strike out the
appeals body and make decisions himself based on each and every
representation? It seems to be pretty straightforward. An independent
appeals body, the decisions of which, in exceptional circumstances, the
Secretary of State could overturn&#151;but only with good
reason&#151;will give comfort to landowners and land users alike.
That is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column272" />Column number: 272</div>where the final decision in any arbitration should take place. In order
to reassure all land users, the Minister should agree that our
amendment is a positive step towards a
solution.</div><a name="09070988000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000354"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> This is an important debate and I would like to
spend some time trying to answer concerns raised this afternoon and in
another place. The objections mechanism set out in proposed new
schedule 1A to the 1949 Act in schedule 19 to the Bill was of great
concern to those in another place, many organisations and a number of
committees. I appreciate the time and help that many gave to help us to
introduce the process through which objections may be made. An
objection can be made on the grounds that the proposals do not strike a
fair balance within the meaning of clause 293, in so far as they relate
to any of a list of particular matters, including the position of the
route. The Secretary of State will make a determination, under section
52(1) of the 1949 Act and Natural England&#146;s coastal access
report, while having regard to any objections, Natural England&#146;s
comments, any representations forwarded to the appointed person and the
recommendation of the appointed
person.</div><a name="09070988000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
48 would delete paragraph 16(3)(a), which deals with a situation in
which the appointed person considers a question of fact, and would
change an amendment tabled by the Government in the Lords, the purpose
of which was to ensure that if a report by an appointed person relating
to an objection contained a statement of a finding or fact, the
Secretary of State, in making the determination, would be bound by that
finding, unless they were satisfied either that it was &#147;perverse
or irrational&#148;&#151;in one of the ways that a court might find
an administrative decision perverse or irrational under judicial review
before setting it aside&#151;or else that it</div>
<a name="09070988000261"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;involves an
assessment of the significance of a matter to any person with a
relevant interest in land or to the
public&#148;.</div><a name="09070988000108"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09070988000355"></a><b class="B">Angela
Watkinson</b> (Upminster) (Con): I am not sure whether this is
the correct time to raise this point, but I have received a letter from
a constituent of mine who is also a naturist. Other Committee members
might have received similar letters. My constituent was inquiring into
their right to access beaches, the legal definition of the word
&#147;annoyance&#148; and the question of alarm and distress. I
apologise for springing this unexpected question on the Minister, but I
would value her
advice.</div><a name="09070988000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000356"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for raising that
question; I have to say that that issue does not often arise in
Scotland because it is usually too cold and wet. In Scotland, breach of
the peace legislation usually deals with alarm to the lieges and other
things. I will write to her on that particular point because, as she
will appreciate, I want to get clarity. English law on the matter is
very different, as I observed when I was down in London for the
trooping of the colour ceremony. I happened to be walking along
Piccadilly in the afternoon wearing my nice smart dress when I observed
the naked bike ride coming down the road. I have to say that it was
quite a shock because we never see anything like that in Scotland. That
shows that that the laws in England and Scotland on that question are
materially different.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column273" />Column number: 273</div><a name="09070988000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I return to
the issue that we are trying to debate today about the significance to
any person and why it is important that the Secretary of State has the
discretion to review it, which, in answer to the hon. Member for East
Devon, would occur only in exceptional circumstances. We do not want to
reverse the decisions in every case, but there are differences. First,
it would be difficult to reconcile the role of the Secretary of State
in approving the proposals as a whole with the fact that, in relation
to a particular part of the proposals, the appointed person would have
already taken a decision that was binding on the Secretary of
State.</div><a name="09070988000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
there is a significant risk to consistency of approach, both in
relation to other parts of the proposals that are the subject of the
same report and in relation to proposals in other reports that relate
to other parts of the English coastal route. There might well be
generic types of topography&#151;headlands, for example&#151;on
which it may be anomalous and unfair not to adopt a broadly consistent
approach in the absence of local circumstances justifying a difference.
There are likely also to be other parts of the route where similar
considerations arise but which have not been the subject of objections.
The question would then arise of whether the decision of the appointed
person in relation to an objection relating to one part of the route
constrained the Secretary of State from achieving consistency between
the approach to that part and to other parts where no objections had
been raised.</div>
<a name="09070988000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, it
would be difficult to require the inspector to consider everything that
the Secretary of State would take into account. For example, it would
not be appropriate to require the inspector to consider representations
relating to other parts of the route that were not subject to
objections, but those representations might mention considerations
relevant to maintaining a consistent approach to the route that was
subject of the report as a whole.</div>
<a name="09070988000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Fourthly,
given the structure in which the Secretary of State has power to
propose modifications himself, as in the 1949 Act that provides for it,
the appointed person cannot know what they might be in advance.
Modifications proposed by the Secretary of State in relation to
contiguous land might necessitate consequential changes to the
modifications proposed by the inspector in relation to the land subject
to the objection, if the continuity of the route is to be preserved
without a mismatch. The Secretary of State might propose more extensive
and radical modification proposals that make the appointed
person&#146;s decision on a particular spot no longer applicable. For
example, in a case where the objection links to a part of a route that
runs along an estuary or around a headland, the Secretary of State
might decide that the route should not run up that section of estuary
at all or should run across the neck of the headland. Where the
proposed route crosses the neck of the headland, he might decide that
the route should instead go around the periphery of the headland. Where
the route crosses in front of a house, he might decide that it should
skirt, not only behind that house, but also behind an area of land. In
such cases the decision of the appointed person in relation to the spot
subject to the objection might well be superseded by the more radical
modifications proposed by the Secretary of State. Under those
circumstances, it would be entirely inappropriate for the appointed
person&#146;s decision still to be binding on the Secretary of State
if he is going to make a modification.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column274" />Column number: 274</div><a name="09070988000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed new
schedule 1A, paragraph 16(3)(a) to the Parks and Access to the
Countryside Act 1949 refers to a finding
which</div><a name="09070988000262"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;involves
an assessment of the significance of a matter to any person with a
relevant interest in land or to the
public&#148;,</div><a name="09070988000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
is necessary to ensure that the Secretary of State is not precluded
from reaching a view on the significance to the landowner or the public
of, for example, the proposed position of the route. That clarifies
that such an assessment is not to be treated as a finding of fact for
the purpose of the schedule. So, for example, where the assessment
relates to the significance of the position of the route, whether to
the landowner or to the public, either assessment may be regarded as a
mixture of fact and judgment or opinion. A judgment as to such
significance in not separable in any sensible way from the judgment of
the relative significance of the position of the route to the landowner
and the public, which is at the heart of the assessment of whether a
fair balance has been struck. It is quite different from ordinary
questions of
fact.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000357"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> Will the Minister clarify how the independent
appeal process will work? Let us suppose that landowner A disagrees
with the designation and takes the matter through the objections
process as described in the document. To whom does he or she take it,
and at what point does the Secretary of State get involved if they
disagree with that decision?</div>
<a name="09070988000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000358"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> The decision will normally be made by a planning
inspectorate. It is an intermediate stage of considering
representations, including representations of factual issues. That,
together with the availability of a digital review, provides the normal
decision-making process. As I said, there are circumstances where the
Secretary of State might be required to intervene, particularly on the
issue of consistency, or, for example, where they decide to modify a
route. That would mean that some of the decisions taken would no longer
be applicable or binding on the Secretary of State, as they might apply
to a different piece of ground from the route that it was proposed to
change.</div>
<a name="09070988000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">The appointed
person may have made an assessment of the underlying facts on which the
assessment of significance is based. For instance, those could include
the periods during which the landowner uses his land for a particular
purpose&#151;I will come on to the different circumstances to which
that may apply&#151;the extent of the land subject to that use for
those periods, or the effect on the landowner&#146;s ability to use
his land for that purpose. The Secretary of State would be bound by the
findings of the appointed persons in any of those things, unless the
finding was irrational and could be set aside by the court on judicial
review. We do not consider it appropriate that the Secretary of
State&#146;s discretion in the essential question on which they are
required to decide&#151;that of where fair balance lies&#151;should
be constrained so as to make them bound by the decision of the
appointed person.</div>
<a name="09070988000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000359"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> Does the Minister understand my concern that that
would allow a hypothetically weak Secretary of State at some point in
future to apply the vested 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column275" />Column number: 275</div>interests of those who have badgered him in the golf club about a
particular issue? <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I am not talking
about the present Secretary of State, who I am sure would not behave
like that. However, he could effectively cast aside all the evidence
put to an independent, quasi-judicial process, and overrule it. I
entirely understand the point about the Secretary of State, but the
issue that the Minister raises is a red herring. I accept that where
the decision is perverse or made on the basis of false evidence, it
should be overruled. Nevertheless, this has to be an independent
process.</div>
<a name="09070988000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000360"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> Any decision that is made by the Secretary of
State, an elected representative, has to be accountable. That elected
representative in turn has to be accountable to Parliament. The issue
of precedent will have to be considered by any Secretary of State when
they come to make that decision. It is not a free-for-all made in the
back room of the golf club&#151;far from it. It is based on an
administrative decision, and there are precedents that any Secretary of
State, either now or in future, would be required to
consider.</div>
<a name="09070988000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000361"></a>Mr.
Swire:</b> What about Secretaries of State who have not been
democratically elected to anything by
anyone?</div><a name="09070988000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000362"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> That would refer to something in the future, and
I cannot account for who would make that decision. Elected
representatives are accountable to the House, whose proceedings in turn
are transparent and on the record. Every Minister is subject to oral
and written questions in the House and the other place.</div>
<a name="09070988000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
clarify the various stages of the procedure, because it is important to
realise that it is a four-step procedure. An objection is made and the
information is passed to the appointed person&#151;the nominated
person under the planning inspectorate. The appointed person then
gathers and weighs up the evidence. They make a recommendation to the
Secretary of State, who makes the decision and who must&#151;I
reiterate must&#151;take account of the recommendations of the
appointed person, so it is not a decision in which he has complete
freedom. He must consider the facts of the case and the recommendations
made by the appointed
person.</div><a name="09070988000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also want to clarify the issue of the Bill&#146;s compatibility with
the ECHR, which was raised by the hon. Member for Newbury. The Bill has
been fully compatible with the ECHR throughout its passage in the House
and the other place. As I said, we had a useful and fruitful discussion
regarding the issue of putting in place an intermediate process and
that is why the clause has been put in the Bill. That is welcome. It
shows that we want to ensure that the ability to address concerns is
fully represented in the Bill. On that basis, I urge the hon. Gentleman
to withdraw his amendment.</div>
<a name="09070988000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000363"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> Before I address those concerns, it is right to
pause to consider the important intervention made by my hon. Friend the
Member for Upminster on behalf of naturists. Like many members of the
Committee, I received an impassioned plea from naturists. They should
be considered as interested parties by the Minister 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column276" />Column number: 276</div>and, where possible, she should go to see the problem at first hand to
hear their concerns in attire that they would find
suitable.</div><a name="09070988000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister mentioned the naked cyclists in London. I was appalled at the
heavy-handed treatment by the Scottish police of the naked walker who
walked from Land&#146;s End to John O&#146;Groats some years ago. I
think he deserved some sort of medal for walking in the Scottish
climate.</div><a name="09070988000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000364"></a>Ann

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000365"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> Returning to clothed matters and a very important
point, I do not believe that the Minister can go round claiming that
the Government have listened and yielded an independent right of appeal
if they have the right to overrule a decision in every circumstance. I
hear what the Minister says about the safeguards that have been put in
the Bill, but to introduce this amendment on Third Reading in another
place in a way that would allow a Secretary of State to overrule
decisions reached in a quasi-judicial process is fundamentally
wrong.</div><a name="09070988000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will not press the issue at this point, because I want to reserve the
right to return to it on Report. I am doing so because the important
concerns raised by the pointy heads in another place who understand the
ECHR much better than I do are in direct conflict with the assertions
made by the Minister. I want to ensure that we are compliant with the
ECHR legislation, so we need to revisit the matter on
Report.</div>
<a name="09070988000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000366"></a>Ann

their concerns. I just want to put that on the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000370"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> With that endorsement ringing in my ears and a
sense of end-of-term fever, I rise to speak to the amendment, which
looks again at the issues relating to legitimate businesses around
coastal Britain. We hope to ensure that diversions are made around
commercial developments such as marinas, boatyards and yacht clubs,
because that is essential. Such sites operate heavy machinery
throughout the day, and that could pose a health and safety risk to
individuals. Furthermore, operational sites such as marinas may contain
high-value equipment that could cause a security risk as a result of
unrestricted
access.</div><a name="09070988000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
recreational boating facilities are not designated as excepted land
under schedule 1 to the CROW Act, there must be provision in the Bill
to exempt those sites and establish diversions around them. That is an
attempt neither to stop the path nor to limit walkers&#146; enjoyment
of the coast&#151;in fact, in many cases, their enjoyment will be
enhanced, because they will be away from industrial and work
environments and will perhaps enjoy better views. The amendment would
ensure that safety and security are not compromised in the name of
access. Coastal access designation under the Bill should create a
pathway that passes those facilities, but not give powers to go through
operational sites.</div>
<a name="09070988000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000371"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> This response may seem like
d(c)j  vu, but it is not. It is not even nuanced&#151;it
is something quite different. We need to return initially to schedule 1
to the CROW Act, which, as I have said, contains a list of categories
of &#147;excepted land&#148;, which is not access land for the
purposes of section 2(1) of the Act. It means that there is no right of
access to such land under the provisions of the Act. I have listened
with interest to the concerns raised by the hon. Member for Newbury
about the possible location of the coastal access route as it affects
marinas and boatyards in particular. I also recognise that the other
place discussed the issue to some extent during its consideration of
the Bill. We in the Department have had a number of discussions with
boating and marina organisations, such as the British Marine Federation
and the Royal Yachting Association. I appreciate that they, too, are
worried about how the provisions might impact on their activities, so I
am glad that we have engaged with them extensively on such
matters.</div><a name="09070988000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
turning to the specific points raised by amendment 50, I
wish to say that we have issued two papers that are particularly
relevant to our discussions, the first of which is about the new
section 3A order and the excepted land provisions required under the
Bill. It sets out the main measures that we expect the order to follow
and, in particular, our intentions for the various categories of
excepted land that we intend either to leave unchanged or to amend, as
they may apply to coastal land. I reconfirm our commitment to consult
further on the final contents of the section 3A order, which will be
subject to the affirmative resolution procedure for both Houses to
debate and agree. The order will not come into force unless it is
approved by such a resolution.</div>
<a name="09070988000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
paper is entitled &#147;Accommodating future development
needs&#148;. It sets out specific ways in which we can ensure that
coastal access is appropriate and consistent with the needs of
landowners, including future changes in land use. I hope that members
of the Committee will allow me just a few moments to explain in some 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column278" />Column number: 278</div>detail how we expect the provisions in the Bill and Natural
England&#146;s scheme to affect marinas and boatyards. The excepted
land provisions under schedule 1 to the CROW Act set out the categories
of land that are excepted for CROW right of access, wherever they
occur.</div><a name="09070988000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord

50 would extend the excepted land category to
land</div><a name="09070988000267"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;used
for the purpose of manufacturing...or storage of recreational
vessels and equipment (including marinas, boatyards and yacht
clubs)&#148;.</div><a name="09070988000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me be clear that we strongly hold the view that such land would
generally be covered by the excepted land, buildings and curtilage
provision. There is no fixed definition of curtilage, but when the open
access provisions of part I of the CROW Act were introduced, the
Department helpfully issued guidelines to help identify what was meant
by the excepted land categories, which are also in part I of the Act,
with the general caveat
that</div><a name="09070988000268"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;guidelines
do not provide an authoritative interpretation of the legislation,
which is a matter for the
courts&#148;.</div><a name="09070988000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
provided guidelines on the meaning of curtilage, which state:</div>
<a name="09070988000269"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
term &#145;curtilage&#146; is not defined, but it generally means a
small area, forming part and parcel with the house or building to which
it is
attached&#148;.</div><a name="09070988000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is usually an area of land that is used, or that is intended to be
used, ancillary to that house or building. The guidelines also
state:</div>
<a name="09070988000270"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
most cases the extent of curtilage will be clear: typically, an
enclosure around a dwelling containing a garden, garage and side
passage; a walled enclosure outside a barn, or a collection of
buildings grouped around a farm house and farm
yard.&#148;</div><a name="09070988000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most
people would understand&#151;and understand in a legal
sense&#151;what curtilage is. The guidelines were drawn up primarily
with open country in mind, and we will review them following the
passage of the Bill to ensure that they are appropriate for coastal
access provisions.</div>
<a name="09070988000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000372"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> I just missed what the Minister said. To which
legislation do the guidelines refer?</div>
<a name="09070988000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000373"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> The guidelines were issued in respect of
part I of the CROW Act. When that measure was introduced, the
Department produced guidelines to make the meaning clear. We recognised
that there was no legislative or authoritative interpretation, and we
thought that it would be helpful to issue guidelines on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column279" />Column number: 279</div>what we meant and how it could be interpreted. If the Bill is enacted,
we will review the guidelines to ensure that they are appropriate to
its coastal access provisions.</div>
<a name="09070988000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">I recognise
the concerns that organisations such as the British Marine Federation
and the Royal Yachting Association have expressed, not least about
safety and security. For example, it could be necessary to keep the
public out of places where boats are stored. We have no intention of
seeking to interfere with the normal running of any marina or yacht
club or with the management of facilities. Those facilities are meant
to encourage visitors. We have to get this right: some marinas want to
encourage visitors to take advantage of public facilities such as bars,
restaurants and
shops.</div><a name="09070988000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the route was on land that did not fall within the excepted land
category, which I mentioned, we expect Natural England to take full
account of the safety of visitors and the security of the site when it
proposes the position of the coastal route. If necessary, Natural
England will discuss with the owner or operator the possibility of
making a direction to exclude or restrict access when appropriate. For
example, it might be necessary to close the marina area at night, and
that could be done.</div>
<a name="09070988000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
circumstances of any individual marina or boatyard will be considered
as part of a full and open consultation process led by Natural England,
which we have discussed in some detail. The discussions will consider
the most appropriate place to put the route on land that is not
excepted land, where it is necessary to ensure the continuity of the
coastal route. In doing so, Natural England and, in due course, the
Secretary of State, will be required under the Bill&#151;as we keep
repeating&#151;to</div>
<a name="09070988000271"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;aim to strike a
fair balance between the interests of the public...and the
interests of any person with a relevant interest in the
land&#148;,</div><a name="09070988000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">as
set out in clause 291.</div>
<a name="09070988000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may be in
the interests of the owners for routes to be situated close to a marina
or yacht club, as they recognise&#151;some landowners and land
operators made this point to us&#151;that it may provide them with
the economic opportunities that they want. The interests of those with
a relevant concern in affected land have been strengthened by the
introduction of schedule 1A to the National Parks and Access to the
Countryside Act 1949, as introduced by schedule 19 to the Bill, which
we debated earlier in our proceedings. The Secretary of State will make
a determination under section 52(1) of the 1949 Act on Natural
England&#146;s coastal access report, having regard to any objections
that have been made, Natural England&#146;s comments on them, any
representations forwarded to the appointed person, and the
recommendation of the appointed
person.</div><a name="09070988000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
we discussed earlier, in respect of any future developments of a
marina, boatyard or yacht club, the line of the route and the spreading
room are not permanently fixed. The Bill enables Natural England to
review them and propose changes to the Secretary of State, which will
again be subject to a full consultation and representation process at a
later date. The CROW Act is framed in such a way that it does not
prevent changes in land use, since land can become excepted from the
right of access at any time if some change or development occurs,
making it fall into one of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column280" />Column number: 280</div>categories of excepted land. I can confirm that if a proposal for a new
development on the coastal margin is made, Natural England will need to
consider an alternative route around the marina or boatyard. I can
reassure hon. Members that changes in use and future developments will
be taken into
account.</div><a name="09070988000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
for the benefit of the Committee, I reiterate that Natural
England&#146;s scheme will set out the approach it will take to
implement its coastal access duty. The scheme, I repeat, will be the
subject of full public consultation once the Bill becomes law. There
will be a further chance for those with a specific interest to make an
input into the final scheme, which has to be approved by the Secretary
of
State.</div><a name="09070988000161"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000374"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> Let us take the example of someone living in a
home by the coast. Beneath them, they see the coastal pathway going
past the marina 500 yards from their house. All of a sudden, the marina
puts in an application for development, and that person discovers that
the pathway will be moved up into their garden. Would that be grounds
for appeal to the local authority or Natural England against the
planning
application?</div><a name="09070988000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000375"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> That would reopen the consultation. Any
person would be able to make representations on that. It would not be
the case that an extending marina or boatyard could say to Natural
England, &#147;You now need to find the alternative route, and the
only one available is straight up over the hill and through that
area.&#148; Natural England would have to reopen the procedure for
consultation and seek representations
again.</div><a name="09070988000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000376"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> Could the new properties impacted by the moving of
the coastal pathway seek some form of compensation from the marina? The
marina will be making a commercial gain by expansion, and there might
be a consequential cost, such as a devaluation of property, to those
people who suddenly find the coastal road or pathway at the end of
their
garden.</div><a name="09070988000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000377"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> First, I want to make one thing clear.
Gardens are listed as excepted land, so the pathway will certainly not
go through anyone&#146;s garden. If the pathway goes at the base of
the garden, we have not entertained the issue of compensation, for
reasons that have been debated ad nauseam in the other place, but we
have strengthened the ability to make objections and to appeal to an
independent person. If the householder who owned the garden wanted to
pursue compensation with the marina, it would be entirely up to them,
but it certainly would not fall within Natural England&#146;s remit
to take any part in
that.</div><a name="09070988000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000378"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> I am trying to make the point that the commercial
gain to the marina could result in a material loss to the farm or
business that finds the coastal pathway moved near their
property.</div>
<a name="09070988000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000379"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I understand the concern. It may or may
not lead to a material loss. There is a fair bit of evidence that the
passing traffic on a coastal path or a coastal margin along many
properties has negligible impact on their value. Indeed, it may enhance
their value if people can take advantage of some of the benefits of
accommodation, caf(c)s and this, that or the other. I understand
the point that the hon. Gentleman makes, but it is not pertinent to the
clause. He raises an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column281" />Column number: 281</div>interesting question about whether an altruistic marina might want to
engage in discussions with neighbours who are affected by
re-routing.</div><a name="09070988000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
scheme would be the subject of full consultation once the Bill becomes
law. That would provide a further chance for those with interests to
make an input into the final scheme. I would expect Natural England to
give thought to, and guidance on, the approach that it will take under
the scheme when a marina, a boatyard or a yacht club is situated by the
coast.</div>
<a name="09070988000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, it will be the Secretary of State&#146;s duty to consider
carefully the possible location of the coastal access route as it may
affect marinas and boatyards, based on the advice and recommendations
from Natural England. His determination of the route will be made
taking into account the recommendations from the Planning Inspectorate,
in accordance with any objections processed under schedule 1A. I can
assure the Committee that a decision on the route will be taken only
after extensive consultation with landowners and managers. In the light
of the various safeguards that I have just outlined, I urge the hon.
Gentleman to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09070988000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000380"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> My hon. Friend the Member for Broxbourne raised an
important issue, which we perhaps have not considered enough in our
deliberations. On the small proportion of the route where there will be
conflict, we imagine that the conflict will be between a landowner or
interest and the needs of the path. Very often it may be a triangulated
conflict. If one party sought to amend the route, it could disadvantage
another. We perhaps need to discuss that a bit more. It comes down to
one of my essential problems with this approach: we are putting
enormous faith in one organisation to get this right. I have no reason
to believe that it will not get it right, but it is not perfect to
assume that a Government agency can take on enormous amounts of
responsibility. On the first amendment to this part of the Bill, the
word that I used to describe that approach was &#147;woolly&#148;.
We are going to leave a lot of ends
untied.</div><a name="09070988000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000381"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I understand the point that the hon.
Gentleman is making. He has probably had representations from marinas
and boatyards as well as the federations, which have argued from both
perspectives. Many of them want to have access but would like the
opportunity to apply for exemptions where necessary, rather than have a
blanket approach to exemptions in the Bill that may militate against
any economic
opportunity.</div><a name="09070988000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000382"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> That is absolutely right. Those involved want
managed access, which we all hope to achieve. On the basis that the
specific guidelines under part I of CROW will be reviewed, interested
parties will be offered every opportunity to have their concerns raised
with the Minister. We may have to revisit this later. I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09070988000172"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

purpose of the amendment is to draw a distinction between the
definition of a park and a garden, which is set out in schedule 1 of
CROW as one
item:</div><a name="09070988000272"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Land
used as a park or garden.&#148;</div>
<a name="09070988000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that we can all
agree that putting gardens into coastal access legislation would not be
appropriate and that people tramping across someone&#146;s garden
because of a coastal path is not something that we would want in the
Bill. Nor would we want to revisit, with regards to parks, schedule 1
of the CROW Act, because untrammelled access to a park inland is a
potential difficulty, as that schedule reflected. However, coastal
access would, by definition, not be across a park but at its margins.
In the vast majority of the country, coastal access around the edges of
parks that happen to abut the coast is probably not a difficult
concept. We might think that this is not a serious issue now because
there are many such coastal paths and everyone is happy about them.
However, it is a real issue in terms of what is in the CROW Act and
what might be in this
legislation.</div><a name="09070988000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
example that springs to mind is one close to my constituency. Part of
the Solent way goes within about 150 yd of it, so with a couple of very
long strides it is a constituency issue. It is a 60-mile coastal path,
mostly organised by Hampshire country council, going from Emsworth near
Chichester on the eastern side to Milford-on-Sea on the western side.
It is a 60-mile coastal path, of which only 45 miles are coastal. The
remaining 15 miles are not a coastal path because Hampshire country
council has not been able to persuade the owners of large estates to
the west of the Solent that there should be access around the coast on
those estates. Consequently, not only does the coastal path not do what
it says on the tin, but when someone arrives from the ferry at Hythe,
which fortunately runs all year round, they are treated to an
interesting diversion.</div>
<a name="09070988000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that
it is not possible to print maps on the record, but I have an
interesting map here, which I will briefly describe. The person comes
up to a roundabout and then has to traverse for more than a mile down
the A326, in between a row of pylons and the road, and then turn left
and go down another road for about 5 or 6 miles to the B3054, at which
point they are more than 5 miles inland. Therefore, at that point a
coastal path the Solent way is not, and nowhere on the map can we see
any coast
whatever.</div><a name="09070988000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000384"></a>Mr.
Swire:</b> How many of those 15 miles are currently defined as
parkland?</div><a name="09070988000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000385"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> Almost all of them, in one way or another.
There are two large estates in particular, along with some farming
land. Those estates are the Beaulieu estate and the Pylewell estate,
neither of which has agreed a schedule of access to areas that abut the
coast.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column283" />Column number: 283</div><a name="09070988000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000386"></a>Mr.
Swire:</b> Is the hon. Gentleman certain that the pieces of
land that abut the coast on those estates are
parkland?</div><a name="09070988000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000387"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> The land is a combination of estate land,
parkland and land that is owned by farmers, but the overall issue is
that
of&#151;</div><a name="09070988000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000388"></a>Mr.
Swire:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Pope. I am
sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but we are discussing a tight
clause about parkland. The hon. Gentleman has referred to 15 miles of
coast which, by his own admission, is not all parkland, so I cannot see
why we are debating the clause at
all.</div><a name="09070988000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000389"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I can see why that has been raised as a point of
order, but the hon. Member for Southampton, Test is not out of order at
the moment. I am listening intently to what he has to say. If he strays
out of order, I will advise
him.</div><a name="09070988000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000390"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> For the sake of clarity, I am not claiming that
all of the 15-mile diversion is caused by the existence of parkland,
but that a substantial proportion of it is. The diversion is 15 miles
because it does not go along the coast; it goes inland for a
substantial area. That is what I was attempting to demonstrate. The key
point is whether, if the Bill became an Act tomorrow, I would be able
to say with hand on heart that the Solent way was actually a coastal
path, which is what it is intended to be. The legislation would, I
think, lead ramblers and many others to believe that it was not
classified as such. Because of the Bill&#146;s continued exemption of
parkland, following schedule 1 of CROW, I fear that the Solent way
would not be classified as a coastal
path.</div><a name="09070988000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
accommodation may well be agreed upon as a result of consultation and
discussion with Natural England, the parkland estates and the farmers
concerned. At the very least, I hope that it will be
emphasised&#151;both by the Committee and, on a wider basis, on the
promulgation of the legislation&#151;that there will be a strong
expectation that the negotiations will be based on the assumption that
an accommodation will be reached. Indeed, the legislation includes the
possibility of issuing a part 3A notice, should that not
occur.</div><a name="09070988000186"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09070988000391"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Jones</b> (Clwyd, West) (Con): I realise that the hon.
Gentleman has a local interest in the two estates that he has
mentioned, but has he carried out an assessment of the extent of
English coastline that comprises
parkland?</div><a name="09070988000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000392"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> I do not have to hand exactly what proportion
of the English coastline comprises parkland. However, I can furnish the
hon. Gentleman with a number of other examples where what should be a
coastal path is substantially diverted because of the existence of
parkland or estates that have a similar effect to what I have
described. For example, the Lee Abbey estate on the Devon coast, the
Benacre estate on the Suffolk coast and Grimston Garth on the east
Yorkshire coast have differing circumstances that nevertheless cause
substantial diversions of a path that would otherwise be unbroken along
a stretch of coast.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column284" />Column number: 284</div><a name="09070988000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Solent way
is one of the longest coastal routes in the south of England and also
has one of the longest areas of diversion, but the issue also affects
other areas along the English coastline. It is therefore not a side
issue as far as the legislation is concerned. The issue has
considerable potential to lead to incomplete coastal paths. We may
decide that an amendment would be appropriate or that other methods can
be found to reach the outcome that I think we all want; but if we do
not decide on either of those courses, I fear that we will end up with
either deadlock in the negotiations or incomplete
paths.</div><a name="09070988000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000393"></a>Andrew
George:</b> I am interested in the case that the hon.
Gentleman is making. Would not the problem that he describes&#151;it
is clearly a problem, particularly in his area&#151;be better
resolved by revisiting the definition of parkland, rather than
approaching it in the way that the amendment
does?</div>
<a name="09070988000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000394"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> That is an interesting suggestion and might be
an appropriate way forward. One of the purports of the amendment is
also to provide space for the path, along with access to it. There is
also the issue, which we discussed earlier, of how to ensure that that
is defined as the breathing space for the path, how it is marked and
what arrangements and negotiations might be appropriate. If the
arrangements were not appropriate, the amendment&#146;s aim would
clearly be overthrown, inasmuch as access to the parkland exempted
under CROW would effectively be restored by an amendment. Maybe an
appropriate way forward would be to consider what parkland consists of
as far as coastal walks are
concerned.</div><a name="09070988000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
aim in moving the amendment is to see whether, in one way or another,
we can resolve the issue, which I think will arise in future
negotiations by English Nature, and ensure that the aim of the coastal
path is to be as complete as possible.</div>
<a name="09070988000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000395"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> The point touched on by the hon. Member for St.
Ives is crucial. We need to define what is meant by a park. If the word
were thrown out to a vox pop, people would probably have in mind
something laid out by Capability Brown&#151;no relation to
&#147;Inability Brown&#148;, who went into
politics.</div><a name="09070988000193"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000397"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> Indeed.</div>
<a name="09070988000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">People would
think of a large, open area with mature trees, over which access along
one side, on the coastal margin, would not have too huge an impact on
the owner. The truth is that in many areas along our coast, it is
difficult to distinguish where a park starts and a garden finishes, and
vice versa. That distinction was brought out clearly under the CROW
Act, which attempted to define it thus:</div>
<a name="09070988000273"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
park may include ornamental gardens, water features or other man-made
scenic vistas. A garden is usually enclosed land near a building. It
typically includes areas of lawn, flower borders and other cultivated
plants.&#148;</div>
<a name="09070988000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the best stab

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000398"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> The hon. Gentleman is speaking a lot of
sense about the definitional difficulties with parks and gardens.
During the coastal access part of the Bill, we have had much debate on
the asks and on the implied trust in Natural England to carry out and
balance this fair duty to all persons, taking it forward in a fair,
considered and consultative way. However, does the hon. Gentleman agree
that there is an equal ask of large landowners to engage and get
involved in the spirit behind the legislation by opening up some of
those parks and gardens&#151;that is not all I have to say: the
remaining 30 per cent. is not all parks and gardens&#151;that
ramblers and others want access to, and that where there is no good
reason not to, landowners should engage through that sort of voluntary
approach to see what can be
done?</div><a name="09070988000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000399"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> I always believe that the voluntary approach is
the better one. If that fails, we can have further discussions.
However, I also believe that there would be considerable financial
implications for smaller parks where access is provided and where the
capital value of the property would therefore depreciate. The
perception among possible purchasers of properties, therefore, is a
realistic factor in terms of those people&#146;s needs. Privacy is a
concept that we need to engage with. I am not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column286" />Column number: 286</div>standing here to make an impassioned defence against the impact on a
vast area of parkland. I think that we are talking about a very small
percentage of the 30 per cent., and a very small percentage of that is
areas where there will be or is conflict. The Bill as currently
drafted, with those exceptions, is the right way to proceed, and I hear
what the Minister says about revisiting the issue in
time.</div><a name="09070988000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000400"></a>Mr.
Swire:</b> The issue is one of definition. I fundamentally
believe that there should be as much access to the coast as possible. I
believe that a voluntary agreement in some difficult places is better,
but for me the bottom line is that people should have access to the
coast where possible. However, I also believe in people&#146;s
privacy and the rights of private ownership. Too often, we can neglect
people&#146;s rights when we come to allowing access to all, because
with ownership comes responsibility. I do not see much in the Bill
other than the transference of responsibility to the farmer or
landowner, with not much financial or other
compensation.</div><a name="09070988000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Southampton, Test referred to two places near his
constituency that he felt were blocking the extension of the coastal
path in his area. He alighted on one rather bad example, which is the
Beaulieu estate. I do not know it well, but I have been there. I would
have thought that it was one of the most commercially minded estates in
the country, what with the motor museum, which is a huge attraction for
tourists around the
world.</div><a name="09070988000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Newbury referred to Buckler&#146;s Hard,
which is a picturesque village in the Beaulieu estate. It has a public
right of way already, although it is difficult to stop people veering
off, and people are charged to look at the village.
&#147;Appalling,&#148; one might say. &#147;How dare they charge
people to look at the village?&#148; Why do they charge people to
look at the village? Because they put the money back into preserving
the uniqueness of the village. There are also surrounding issues, but I
do not want to stray too much into the
esoteric.</div><a name="09070988000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000401"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> To make it clear for the record, I have great
admiration for the public work of the Beaulieu estate, with its access
to Buckler&#146;s Hard, the village of Beaulieu, the motor museum and
the area all around there. However, there are wider issues of access
abroad in the estate, which are unrelated to access to, for example,
Buckler&#146;s Hard. I fully agree with the hon. Gentleman about how
that village may best be managed. It is the question of how the
furthest-flung areas of the estate and parkland comprising Beaulieu may
be accessed in a controlled, managed and agreed way. That is the
central issue, rather than the question of access to the central areas,
which is a matter of tourist management, which Beaulieu is adept at and
does
well.</div><a name="09070988000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000402"></a>Mr.
Swire:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an important
clarification. As I recall, there are issues that date way back
concerning access to the private beach on the Beaulieu estate, and
there is some resentment that it, too, is not open to the public.
However, that is private land and I agree that such issues can often be
resolved with the landowner, rather than by
legislation.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column287" />Column number: 287</div><a name="09070988000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have said
already that you would not allow me to veer off into the esoteric,
Mr. Pope, but we need to think carefully about that issue.
The CROW Act is interesting, and the hon. Member for Chatham and
Aylesford recognised the difficulty in defining what is a garden and
what is a park. Before we rush to legislate, I urge the Committee to
consider the uniqueness of what we have in this country: the manicured
landscape, the extraordinary buildings and the way they are married and
interact. My hon. Friend the Member for Newbury mentioned Capability
Brown, and one could also mention Humphrey Repton, who was, with his
red book, perhaps as great a landscaper as Brown, although a little
later&#151;in many ways he was his successor.</div>
<a name="09070988000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
misunderstanding about the English landscape: that somehow it has
always been there and is natural, including the hill forts. But it is
not. It is there because landowners, farmers and the users of this land
over generations have planted copses, moved hills and created something
wonderful and unique in the world. The hon. Member for Telford, who
chairs the all-party group on world heritage sites, would undoubtedly
agree with that assertion.</div>
<a name="09070988000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we talk
about access to parks, we must be careful what we say, because often a
park is, or is part of, a garden. When does it cease to be a park?
There have been times, in war for instance, when the majority of parks
in this country were ploughed up and turned over to agriculture. Does
it lose its status as parkland if it is ploughed, if animals are grazed
on it or if it is used for a different purpose, such as shooting, which
is an incredibly important sport in the west country and is worth
millions of pounds? Often in the south-west, and in other places around
this island, parkland can go down to an estuary or to the sea and is
the garden to the house. If, regardless of that, access to the land is
allowed as a right, with spreading room, that alters the relationship
between the landscape and the building that sits at its
heart.</div><a name="09070988000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
should, of course, look towards opening up our coastal paths, but we
must always bear in mind that there is something as important, and
perhaps more so: the unique relationship between the buildings of this
country, their parklands, the human beings who like to walk there and
occupy them and the future generations who will benefit from
them.</div>
<a name="09070988000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000403"></a>Andrew
George:</b> On that last point, the hon. Member for East Devon
is absolutely right to highlight the relationship between buildings and
the parks and gardens, or curtilage, around them, particularly in the
larger country houses, of which we in the United Kingdom as a whole are
rightly proud. We have a proud heritage of impressive buildings, and
the context in which they are placed, with the parks and gardens that
surround them, is important. However, such a context is not in itself
undermined by allowing a public right of way across a small portion of
it. That is an issue that clearly needs to be resolved.</div>
<a name="09070988000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not sure
that the amendment, as drafted, is the best way to resolve the issue.
The hon. Member for Southampton, Test, by bringing forward the debate,
which he was right to do, has articulated a concern that I do not have
much experience of. Speaking on behalf 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column288" />Column number: 288</div>of my own part of the world&#151;west Cornwall and the Isles of
Scilly&#151;I must say that we do not really have any of the type of
large estates that, as the hon. Gentleman said, exist in the Solent
area, so I have no experience of the type of scale that he is talking
about, in terms of ownership of very substantial areas of land. The
scale of those areas of land clearly has an impact upon the ability to
create coastal access of the kind that I think we are all keen to
establish.</div>
<a name="09070988000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
example of the Solent way, a right of way would need to be diverted
many miles from the coast to satisfy the requirements of the Bill, as
the hon. Gentleman sees them, in terms of the definition of what might
constitute park land. That is clearly a matter of great concern. Until
he had raised this issue, I was not aware that such a diversion might
be necessary. Hence my intervention, to say that perhaps we need to
look again at the definition of park land.</div>
<a name="09070988000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">We may come
up with a definition of park land that will satisfy the hon. Member for
East Devon and others, in terms of the description of what that land
might be, its context and, perhaps in some cases, the historic basis on
which it was originally created, possibly centuries ago. However, I
would have thought that the concept that we, as legislators, should
attempt to preserve is the integrity of that land; that is, the
integrity of the countryside itself and the associated buildings. I am
not sure that public access necessarily undermines that
integrity.</div>
<a name="09070988000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">What is
perhaps most important is to protect privacy. Certainly, the booklet
prepared by Natural England on park land considers the issue within the
context of the provision on privacy. I would have thought that it is
privacy and potential damage&#151;those two elements&#151;that we
are trying to address here.</div>
<a name="09070988000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">In coming up
with a satisfactory definition of park land for the purposes of the
Bill, the two concepts of proportionality and reasonableness should
also be applied. If one is talking about the scale of diversion that
the hon. Member for Southampton, Test described, we come back to a
theme that has underpinned a lot of the debate on this part of the
Bill, which is achieving a fair balance. I think that a fair balance
can be more effectively achieved if one also throws into the melting
pot the concept of what is proportionate. Clearly, a 5-mile diversion
away from the coastline is not proportionate. It is important to find a
tool that will give a proportionate response and giving that tool to
Natural England would clearly help in finding a resolution to this
problem. It is also important to find a reasonable solution.</div>
<a name="09070988000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">Providing
Natural England with the tools to achieve a fair balance, in the
context of defining park land and trying to achieve the fundamental
objective of providing a continuous coastal footpath, is clearly what
we are trying to do. I would hope that we could, on Report, look at the
issue again. Perhaps the Government could come forward with an
amendment which would achieve that fair balance and satisfy the hon.
Member for Southampton,
Test.</div><a name="09070988000287"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000404"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I do not think that we need an amendment,
but I would like to begin this part of our deliberations by putting a
statement on record to see if any member of the Committee will demur
from it. If we proceed with our proposals on the coastal path, the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column289" />Column number: 289</div>coastal margin and parks and gardens, which I am committed to, and any
future Secretary of State&#151;whether it is the hon. Member for St.
Ives, the hon. Member for Newbury, or my hon. Friends the Members for
Reading, West and Southampton, Test&#151;finds that no dialogue has
happened and that no additional land within what we can generally term
parks has been opened up, we will have failed.</div>
<a name="09070988000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part of our
debate here is whether we can proceed in a way that is to do with
voluntarism, dialogue and consensus, and can look at those places,
where appropriate, where it does not damage habitat or the interface
that has been talked about between the fashioning of that particular
landscape and environment. There is a tradition of people straying on
to such environments. Traditionally, they were either known as
trespassers or poachers&#151;myself not included, not that I would
admit to it. However, if we return here without having made progress on
this issue through constructive dialogue, we will have
failed.</div>
<a name="09070988000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000405"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> The Minister sets a very important challenge,
which should be listened to by all the interested parties that
represent landowning interests and walkers&#146; interests.
Accommodation can be found. The worst thing that we can do is legislate
for the lowest common denominator&#151;the cartoon farmer who says
get off my land and is completely unapproachable in any form of
dialogue. However, the Minister puts a very important challenge down.
We can see how that goes and revisit it in the future. I entirely
accept his reasonable
approach.</div><a name="09070988000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000406"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman. I suspect that
we have consensus across the Committee. We have to put this to the test
and see that it delivers&#151;and see that it delivers, not if it
delivers&#151;that it delivers. If it does not, as I will come to in
a moment, we might need to revisit that. I am grateful to my hon.
Friends the Members for Southampton, Test and for Reading West for
raising this important issue. I recognise the desire of individual
walkers and the Ramblers Association to try to obtain access to the
remaining 30 per cent. of the coast that there is still no access to.
There are some good reasons why we do not and will not have access to
100 per cent. of the coast. However, there are some parts that people
would look at and say that there seems to be no good reason for that,
only an unwillingness to enter into a dialogue.</div>
<a name="09070988000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
noted in previous discussions, the Secretary of State may, by order,
modify the provisions of part 1 of the CROW Act in their application to
land which is coastal margin. Concerns and questions about what changes
may be made to the categories of accepted land, as they affect land
that is coastal
margin&#151;</div><a name="09070988000288"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.18

<div class="Column"><a name="Column290" />Column number: 290</div><a name="09070988000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000408"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> Briefly, parks were considered by both the
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee and the Joint Committee,
which were attended by a number of hon. Members. Both Committees made
recommendations: the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee
agreed with the Government&#146;s approach, but the Joint Committee
felt that the Government should give careful thought to what was
included in the parks and gardens exemption and noted that
Parliament  might want to return to that issue with the
introduction of the Bill.</div>
<a name="09070988000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">In response
to those two Committees, we said that we would give further detailed
consideration to the issue. We have done that, and I have heard a wide
range of views. Some say that the parkland should not be excepted in
any way where it is suitably described as a margin, and others dwell on
the continuity of the route. There are also arguments about privacy, as
we feared, and the amenity value related to parkland also needs to be
taken into account. They are all important points&#151;it is a
complex issue. Let me make it clear that we do not want the coastal
route to take long and unnecessary inland detours. However, we also
understand the concerns of landowners. We have touched on the
definitional issues already. I believe that the problem is about a
small number of difficult cases, where land is not integral to the
privacy and enjoyment of the household, but presents a considerable
blockage to any coastal route. I do not want to use a heavy
sledgehammer to crack an albeit sometimes tough
nut.</div>
<a name="09070988000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000409"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> Should a voluntary approach be adopted, albeit
with the possibility of making a section 3A order, is it the case that
a landlord or a park owner may dedicate, outside the Bill, a strip of
land for coastal access or a right of way without incurring
arrangements under the
Bill?</div><a name="09070988000234"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000410"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> My hon. Friend is right. If people were to
dedicate a strip of land for the coastal path, or to allow a right of
way, it could form an integral part of the coastal path, and I welcome
that sort of approach.</div>
<a name="09070988000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">What we have
talked about is the good will of landowners towards the public, who
wish to share the pleasures of a wonderful coastline. I am prepared to
give the good will a trial and see if we can find agreed ways for the
route to go through without having to legislate for the small number of
cases I mentioned. I believe that this Committee has unanimously made
clear that it wishes to see that good will be demonstrated by
landowners in discussions with Natural England. I propose that we give
the system a trial without making any changes to the excepted land
categories of parks and gardens. The trial should investigate how great
the problems are and how evident the good will is. I will ask Natural
England to try to resolve the problems by voluntary means, particularly
where it will lead to secure access along the route&#151;perhaps
along the lines that my hon. Friend has suggested, for instance, by the
dedication of land for public access under the CROW Act
provisions.</div><a name="09070988000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the case that the trial approach does not work, the Secretary of State
retains the powers to amend the excepted land provisions at a later
date by order, subject to affirmative resolution in both
Houses&#151;we have talked  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column291" />Column number: 291</div>about the fact that it will be a pretty lively debate. In our response
to the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee report, we said
that Natural England will return to Parliament to report on progress
after 10 years. I suggest that Natural England should undertake an
earlier interim review and report to Parliament specifically on issues
that have arisen as a result of parks being excepted land, and on the
success of any voluntary agreements to ensure secure public access
along the route through parks. That report should take place within
five years of Royal
Assent.</div><a name="09070988000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that that approach will meet with favour from the Committee, and
that my hon. Friend will withdraw his amendment with the assurance that
we will have the opportunity to review the matter and revisit the
decision, if
necessary.</div><a name="09070988000238"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000413"></a>Andrew
George:</b> I will not extend my remarks on the new clause to
the clause stand part debate. The purpose of the new clause is to
address the issue of dogs and horses. In the debates on the Bill so
far, we have not had sufficient opportunity to debate the accessibility
of the coastal route by equestrians, dog owners or disabled
people&#151;we may wish to return to the issue of disabled people on
Report. Although groups, including the National Federation of Bridleway
Associations and the British Horse Society, have accepted that full
access to the coastal path would be inappropriate&#151;they do not
expect that&#151;they remain concerned that the development of the
coastal path could in some areas reduce their existing rights of
access, such as the non-statutory right of access to the
foreshore.</div>
<a name="09070988000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">Horse riders
and cyclists have access to only 22 per cent. of the current public
rights of way network and only 7 per cent. of the network that
currently exists around the English coast. Public access to the
foreshore&#151;the land between the high and low water
marks&#151;with horses both ridden and driven has been enjoyed for
centuries and is still enjoyed today. That is an issue for Crown land
in England and Wales and the Duchy of Cornwall in Cornwall. Historical
research suggests that that is an ancient common law right. English and
Scottish law are the same in this respect, and non-discriminatory
public access to the coast is now, as I understand it, a statutory
right in Scotland.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column292" />Column number: 292</div><a name="09070988000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
proposes a statutory right of access to the coastal margin, which
includes the foreshore and the beach, but only on foot. Experience with
the recording of public rights of way under the National Parks and
Access to the Countryside Act 1949 and the designation of access land
under CROW suggests that where a statutory right for a limited sector
of the public&#151;that is, those on foot&#151;is legally recorded,
the ability for the rest of the public to enjoy their unrecorded common
law rights is thus compromised. There may be issues regarding access to
the foreshore for other types of recreational users, such as those who
need to bring buggies down to the coast to go kite surfing. The
Minister might be able to clarify that.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000414"></a>Mr.
Swire:</b> Other parts of the foreshore are owned neither by
the Crown nor by the duchy&#151;they are privately owned. I do not
know who briefed the hon. Gentleman on that. There are also other
places where it would be patently wholly inappropriate to allow dogs to
roam freely on the coastal path. I am thinking of the swannery at
Abbotsbury in Dorset, where there are nesting cygnets and swans. The
last thing in the world one would want for the balance of nature is to
have a lot of dogs running amuck among
them.</div><a name="09070988000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000415"></a>Andrew
George:</b> I am not calling for that. As I said in my opening
remarks, that is not what is being called for. I am sorry the hon.
Gentleman did not catch that.</div>
<a name="09070988000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">The matter of
unrecorded common law rights being compromised is particularly
problematic for horse riders. There was all-party consensus in the
other place that something needs to be done for horse riders and the
Government seemed to accept that there were non-statutory public access
rights to the coastal margin that need to be protected, as in the
clause we have just debated.</div>
<a name="09070988000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">In Committee
in the other place, my noble Friend Lord Greaves proposed a similar
amendment to the one before us, which would have clarified the
situation by ensuring that those with a horse or a dog are not included
in the general access restrictions contained in schedule 2 of the CROW
Act. That amendment was withdrawn, but Lord Davies undertook to
reconsider the issue. He made it clear that he understood the concerns
and that there should be clarity that the existing rights of horse
riders are not affected by any new right of access to the coast. He
recognised that there is an issue that clearly needs to be resolved. It
is worth, therefore, taking another look at the amendment tabled by my
noble Friend Lord Greaves in order to probe the Government&#146;s
position on the impact of the development of the coastal path and the
existing non-statutory rights of access that exist in relation to the
foreshore.</div>
<a name="09070988000249"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000416"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> I am sympathetic to the concerns that the hon.
Member for St. Ives raised about horse riders and their existing
customary use of the foreshore. It is important to point out that there
is no general common law right to ride on the foreshore in England. In
certain places there is a customary right to ride or there may be a
permissive right to do so, but that will be due to local circumstances
and it is not a national right country-wide. It was the subject of
debate in the other place and of an amendment tabled by the Baroness
Mallalieu to ensure the preservation of existing rights. In response to
those concerns, the Government introduced an amendment 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column293" />Column number: 293</div>to require Natural England to make it clear that existing rights are not
affected by the new right of access on foot that the Bill provides
for.</div>
<a name="09070988000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
provision at clause 297(7) requires Natural England to ensure that, in
relation to coastal margin land, the public are informed that the legal
position is that the right of access conferred by the CROW Act does not
affect any other right of access that may exist in relation to that
land. It also makes it clear that a separate code of conduct may be
drawn up for coastal
land.</div><a name="09070988000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposal would go further than the existing
provision. As the hon. Member for East Devon has pointed out, giving
horse riders a right of access to the entire foreshore that forms part
of the coastal margin is not always appropriate. A blanket approach
would not include areas that require special protection from animals
running loose, which would not be
helpful.</div><a name="09070988000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any
amendments to the provisions in schedules 1 and 2 of the CROW Act for
the purposes of coastal access will be introduced through an order made
under section 3A, which is provided for in clause 297 of the
Bill. We have published a paper containing the main changes that we
propose to make, and that paper has been made available to the hon.
Members. We will consult on the proposals, which will then be subject
to affirmative resolutions in both Houses of Parliament.</div>
<a name="09070988000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, the
hon. Member for St. Ives mentioned the important point of access for
the disabled. As this is a stand part debate, I can confirm that
Natural England  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column294" />Column number: 294</div>will consider contributing financially to the creation of improved
rights where it makes sense, which is likely to include action to
facilitate access by people with mobility problems along some suitable
sections of the coast. I hope the hon. Gentleman will welcome that and
on that basis withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="09070988000254"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070988000417"></a>Andrew
George:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for her response and
the clarification. Her interpretation of the Bill as it currently
stands, as amended in another place, is that it does not affect
existing rights. The societies and organisations that I mentioned in my
opening remarks will be reassured by that, which is very welcome
indeed. To defend myself from the accusation that I am trying to offer
unbridled rights to the coast and to the foreshore for all horse riders
and dog owners, I made it clear that that is not what was intended in
my opening remarks&#151;I am probing the issue. I am not asking for
complete access, which would be inappropriate and which the hon. Member
for East Devon and the Minister
fear.</div><a name="09070988000255"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
