<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Willis </B>(Harrogate and Knaresborough): I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.

<P>
Good morning to you, Mr. Benton, and to the rest of the Committee. I was tempted to move the new clause formally, because it is so sensible that I am sure that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment, the hon. Member for Croydon, North (Mr. Wicks) will accept it immediately. We ran the same clause through another place, but because it was grouped with two other amendments it did not get a proper airing. I want the Minister to say why he thinks there should be area inspections by Her Majesty's chief inspector and Ofsted but not by the adult learning inspectorate.

<P>
After 1992-93, when further education and sixth-form colleges were transferred from local authority control and became self-incorporated colleges, there was a huge division between what had been the comprehensive provision of further education, community and adult services and the more specialised provision. That is not a criticism of what has happened to further education since then, as there have been some tremendous developments in that sector since incorporation in 1992-93. However, members of the Committee could not put their hands on their hearts and say that what has happened to adult and community education in their constituencies since 1993 has been satisfactory.

<P>
The Government made the right decision to end the ludicrous divide between section 2 and non-section 2 funding and to ask the Learning and Skills Council to look after everything. The Bill makes it clear that the Government expect proper provision for the post-19 sector and for adult and community education; they even want to slice resources from local education authorities to ensure that that provision is right and proper. I am therefore surprised that there are to be no area inspections of general services in adult and community education.

<P>
Baroness Blackstone's reasoning in taking that decision was that there is a statutory requirement in the Bill to provide services for those up to the age of 19 and after that it is discretionary. She said that because education in the earlier years was a statutory provision, and the state provided the resources, it was right and proper to have inspections and audits, but that that was not necessary for services for those over the age of 19. The adult and community education world hoped that the Government's legislative programme would place greater emphasis on the whole lifelong learning product and not create artificial divisions between younger and older people. I hope that the Minister will take on board the fact that we understand and accept that the 16 to 19 group has priority. However, it is important to provide resources to create a genuine lifelong learning society and to allow the Learning and Skills Council to promote lifelong learning, and adult and community education, in all regions. Clearly, the Government envisage that such resources will be made available, so how can they say that they will not inspect provision into which they intend to invest significant amounts of taxpayers' money?

<P>
Without inspection, inequalities between areas could grow, and the quality of provision to the adult age group could become less than satisfactory. The new clause has two aims: to provide for constant monitoring of adult and community education through inspections, and to use such inspections as a tool for ensuring that the quality of delivery in that sector always aims to be the best possible.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): I shall be brief, because the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) introduced the new clause in a modest and exemplary manner. We have considerable sympathy for his serious point. I anticipate that the Minister's response will return to the two inspectorates' relative remits, which, increasingly, I see as a series of potentially interlocking Venn diagrams. We are anxious that they should interlock at some point, so that somebody takes an interest in adult and community education. As the hon. Gentleman said, that evokes a good deal of sympathy from the whole Committee. It is important, and many of us have shared the increasing concern about the extent and quality of provision, which has become uneven between providers and between areas. If we are trying to take an overall view, that cannot be right.

<P>
Technically, the new clause would reverse the burden of prime responsibility, which we debated at length in the previous sitting, and which means that the chief inspector of schools leads, and the chief inspector of adult learning follows in a subordinate position. That relates to what I said about interlocking remits. Further education providers and, I suspect, adult and community education providers, which may not be the same, are unhappy with that relationship. Yesterday, the principal of a major regional further education college repeated to me that the sector remained unhappy about that hierarchy. The Minister will no doubt respond to that, and we shall listen carefully.

<P>
Unless I misheard the Minister or was not concentrating the other day-possibly because of the heat-he did not adequately respond on the issue of subject inspections. Whichever inspector examines an area, as part of his remit he may wish to inspect a particular subject-to use an old-fashioned word-or a particular delivery. In the clauses that we have passed, and the new clause, it might be possible to define the area as England, yet choose a specific subject to study. It would help if the Minister could make it clear that, following the examples of the further education inspectorate in the past and the schools inspectorate, it will be possible to consider areas of study or delivery on not so much a geographic as a functional basis.

<P>
The issue is important and has been touched on in another place. The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough has made his case well and deserves a substantive reply.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mr. Malcolm Wicks):</B> I welcome the opportunity to explain the Government's stance on the significant issue of area inspections. The proposed new clause would make the adult learning inspectorate responsible for area inspections-the opposite of the policy in clauses 63 and 65. It would therefore clash with provisions and cause confusion. The other substantial effect of the new clause is that the adult learning inspectorate would conduct area inspections for the age group to which the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough has referred.

<P>
My noble Friend Baroness Blackstone twice resisted a similar amendment in another place. Let me explain again why we should not go down the route that this clause would take. However, I would not want anything that I said this morning-we had a debate earlier on a not dissimilar theme-to take away from the Government's commitment to lifelong learning and our real concern to boost different aspects of post-18 or post-19 provision. I will say more about that in a moment.

<P>
Area inspections are designed to raise standards of education and training for young people. They examine area-wide provision for 16 to 18-year olds, especially in inner cities, where there is an urgent need to focus
the challenge to raise achievement and widen participation. The need in some areas is so acute that we have asked Ofsted, using its existing but limited powers, to lead some early inspections. It has been working closely with the Further Education Funding Council and the Training Standards Council inspectorates to do that. Last month, I received the first area inspection report-on Hackney and Islington-and I expect new reports on 16 to 18 provision in Newcastle, Coventry, Tower Hamlets and Lambeth to be published in the summer. The purpose of clauses 63, 64 and 65 is to give Ofsted a comprehensive set of functions with regard to area inspections, and in particular to establish a clear statutory basis on which the inspectorates will work together in future.

<P>
Participation and attainment are far too low in such areas, and it follows that the life chances of too many young people are jeopardised before they start. The evidence that we have gained from the Hackney and Islington report proves my point. The inspections will make a major contribution to raising standards and improving relevance of opportunity for young people.

<P>
For example, we can now be explicit about the problems in Hackney and Islington, because for the first time we have objective evidence about the whole area. We have a picture of an exceptionally deprived area, with poor staying-on rates, too many 16-year olds going to unknown destinations, low prior attainment, weakness in pre-16 guidance and information on options, poor uptake of modern apprenticeships, poor collaboration between schools, colleges and training providers, and unacceptable variations in achievement in all post-16 routes. That adds up to a pretty poor picture for young people in the area. If that is not bad enough, last night's football result will not cheer some members of that community either.

<P>
However, the report was not all bad news. Vocational A-level results were good. Levels of achievement in the work-based route are above average. There have been improvements in collaboration between the lifelong learning partnerships that we have fostered. However, the picture is one of 16 plus providers-schools, colleges and trainers-doing their best against the odds. There is no outstanding provision. Achievement is best summarised as too little, too late. We are therefore taking immediate action in Hackney and Islington, and I have asked for an action plan to ensure that some changes are made so that by next September young people in the area get a much better deal.

<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
We certainly want to expand post-19 participation and to make sure that the quality of learning is high, and I appreciate that that was the burden of the remarks made by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough. We have given substantial extra resources, especially in basic skills. The adult learning inspectorate will have a major role in helping to drive up post-19 standards. I can envisage ALI inspecting a number of particular post-19 providers within a locality and taking an in-depth look at how those institutions provide quality education in the area. The powers in clause 54 provide for that activity by the new inspectorate. It will be able to make judgments and draw inferences about the quality of adult provision in a locality.

<P>
One of the crucial differences between an inspection of adult provision carried out on that basis and an area inspection led by Ofsted under clause 63 is that the latter may include an examination of the way in which the LSC or LEA has applied its resources. This additional aspect of an inspection is justified on account of the entitlement that young people have to education and training under clause 2. The adult learning inspectorate has all the powers it needs to examine the quality of provision across institutions in an area, and there is much to be gained from such activities.

<P>
Area inspections under clause 63 are the means by which we can in future judge whether the LSC and LEAs are making provision of adequate quality and sufficient quantity for young people. There is no need for a clause that extends area inspections of provision for people beyond the age of 19 and, similarly, no reason to extend the remit of the adult learning inspectorate.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> May I check with the Minister that what he is saying in English is that if the adult learning inspectorate wanted to examine adult provision in an area, the way they could do so without exceeding their powers would be to consider each single institution or funded body that was offering education and draw a summary conclusion from the results of those various individual inspections, rather than to conduct a formal area inspection as the hon. Gentleman suggests. Is that the drift of his argument?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Yes, indeed. Unlike the hon. Gentleman, I usually speak English, as I am not quite so eloquent in Latin and French as he is. He put it in plain English and I confirm that that is what I meant.

<P>
In another place, my noble Friend Baroness Blackstone explained in detail why the Government have chosen to extend Ofsted's remit under the Bill. The key arguments are that Ofsted has already inspected at least once every single school with a sixth form. It therefore has unparalleled experience in 16 to 18 provision outside the work-based route. It has published influential reports on effective sixth forms and on level 3 qualifications, and it is, frankly, the most powerful influence we have in enhancing standards for this age group. That is why we have chosen Ofsted to take on the remit for 16 to 18 provision under the new regime.

<P>
To summarise, area inspections must have a 16 to 18 focus to make sure that local needs are adequately met. They will provide a good basis for intervention if we need to secure young people's entitlement, and Ofsted has the experience and expertise.

<P>
I suspect that I have not entirely satisfied the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough and I understand his argument, but he conceded that priority should properly be given to the younger age group. I hope, however, that I may have gone some way towards assuring him that our endeavours when it comes to the post-19 group are sincere. As I explained, the powers contained in the Bill will enable the adult learning inspectorate to undertake an area inspection if it feels that that is necessary.

<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) asked about specialist subject inspections. Ofsted already has those powers, and has already issued reports on subjects. Under clause 54(2) the adult learning inspectorate will be able to do a single subject inspection-for example, adult-based skills-either for an area if it felt that to be necessary, or even for the whole of England. It will not be technically an area inspection as defined in the Bill, but it should assuage the hon. Gentleman's concerns.

<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): When we met on Tuesday I made disobliging remarks about the number of amendments tabled by the Liberal Democratics on the Chairman's provisional selection list of that day. I acknowledge that I only referred to amendments, I did not refer to new clauses. If three pilgrimages to St. David's was worth one to Rome, a new clause is clearly worth at least 10 or 20 amendments, and I ask the forgiveness of the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough for any omission of a reference to the new clause when I spoke.

<P>
Moreover, both Liberal Democrat members of the Committee are from Yorkshire. Only one eighth of my genes are Yorkshire genes. The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough and, indeed, various Labour members might say that I would be a better MP and a better man if the proportion were larger. However, I was once in the Gallaher's box and balcony for the Benson and Hedges final at Lords when Yorkshire, whom Lord Hattersley supported-he was also on the balcony-were playing Northamptonshire, whom I supported and whom no doubt my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry would have supported, had he been present. I confessed that only one eighth of my genes were from Yorkshire and the noble Lord, Lord Hattersley, said that although I might think that my Yorkshire blood was running thin, Yorkshire blood never ran thin and therefore I could be confident for the future.

<P>
I was reassured by the Minister's speech in response to the debate. The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough made a good and worthwhile speech. The Minister will recall the exchange that we had the other day about the ability to learn from experiments in diversity under devolution. If I may do a read-across to another world that is also engaged in frequent inspections, English Heritage is having to address the question of categories as we come to the end of the historic process of listing buildings across the country. I take, sadly, derelict textile mills as an example that may involve considerations of preservation, and-in the context of the 20th century and the post-war period-housing and higher education. It may be sensible to consider those issues generically on a sectional basis.

<P>
It is extremely important that there should be flexibility in the inspection process, so that it can respond to future as well as to present circumstances. I hope that innovation and imagination will apply to the inspectorate in future years as the adult education scene unfolds. I was genuinely reassured not only by the spirit of the Minister's response, but by his testimony that there is relevant flexibility in the adult learning inspectorate's powers.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> As Yorkshire are top of the county championship at the moment, I rest my case and move on.

<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): They let Derbyshire score 285 for 8 yesterday.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> The hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) clearly spent yesterday watching the cricket while we were working hard.

<P>
I am grateful to the Minister for his comments. As ever during the passage of the Bill, he has tried to reassure the Committee about the issues that we raise.

<P>
This is an important matter. I am afraid that I do not have the same rosy glow about Ofsted as the Minister and the Government have, but we shall not rehearse that. It has absolutely no expertise or experience in the post-19 age group in community and adult education.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Chaytor </B>(Bury, North): It is important to correct what the hon. Gentleman has said. It is not true, because Ofsted has had responsibility for inspecting local authority adult education services. The fact that since it was given that responsibility it has completed only a handful of such inspections does not deny the fact that it has that responsibility.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I accept the criticism and the correction from the hon. Member for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor).

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> May I finish my point and then I will leave the room, if necessary. My point is that Ofsted has to build up a body of expertise in that area. Would the hon. Gentleman accept that local authorities have been denuded of provision in this area over a number of years, partly as a result of the policy of the previous Government? I give way to the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The hon. Gentleman was doing quite well until that last remark. However, I shall not harass him as one sometimes harasses Ministers. The provisions in these clauses are about the responsibility for leading the inspection, and it would be open to Ofsted to draw on such expertise, including that from the adult learning inspectorate, as it deemed appropriate. Indeed, it would be sensible for it to do so until the body of expertise had been developed.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Daventry who, as always, makes a succinct and appropriate point. He will probably agree with me that, in reality, Ofsted will be the dominant partner in the two inspectorates: the adult learning inspectorate will be very much a second-class citizen. The Minister and the Government have made it quite clear that that is to be the position.

<P>
Last year the Department for Education and Employment published the policy action team on skills report ``Skills for Neighbourhood Renewal''. It was a telling report, which looked into the huge skills deficits of adults, particularly in our poorer communities. We are moving into new territory. The report quite rightly pointed to the really damning inspection in Hackney and Islington and to the fact that those communities have been let down not just over a few years but for decades in the provision that has been made. It seems sad that the Minister cannot accept that, while providing for inspection to support clause 2 is very much at the heart of the agenda for the reasons that he has given, clause 3, which many of us felt was rather weak-a get-out clause yet again in terms of post-19 provision, particularly adult and community provision-does not provide the necessary teeth for inspection to guarantee quality.

<P>
I recognise that the Minister will not move on this issue. He has accepted that while resources are put into education for the 16-to-19 age bracket, there must be inspections and proper audits, yet sees no need to do that for post-19 provision. We find that rather sad. However, having heard the Minister's explanation, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.

<H4><center>New Clause 6</center></H4>
<H4><center>Frequency of joint inspections<p8>`.-It shall be the responsibility of the Chief Inspector of Schools in England and the Chief Inspector of Adult Learning to take such steps as are reasonably practicable to ensure that the frequency of joint inspections is not greater than would reasonably have been anticipated had the inspections been carried out by the two Inspectorates separately; and they should have regard to minimising the potential inconvenience and intrusiveness of the inspection on the institution concerned.'.-[Mr. Boswell.]<w3></center></H4>

<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.

<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.

<P>
Had we been trying to conclude in some haste the other evening, Mr. Benton, I might perhaps merely have said that the new clause speaks for itself and seems eminently reasonable-to use a phrase-and have left it to the attention of the Committee. As this morning is a different scenario, I shall speak briefly to the new clause. It is self-evidently reasonable and I hope that it will provide for good practice.

<P>
The new clause emphasises two separate but related issues. The first is the frequency of inspections. It would encourage the two inspectorates, in working out their frameworks and carrying out their inspections of individual institutions, not to proceed through torture by serial inspection. We should also remember the important role of the professional bodies in accreditation, which was referred to in a previous sitting. The inspectorates should also take into account the likely requirements of the professional and awarding bodies. It would be possible in principle for institutions to have to endure a series of separate inspections.

<P>
A case can be made for having inspections from time to time, particularly regarding a specialist area of operation. The provision of basic skills could be examined one day and physics provision a month or two later. If that happened, it might be for the convenience of the establishment. It would not be sensible and it would be resented if, having inspected one provision under one remit-physics and chemistry teaching for 16 to 19-year-olds, for example-a similar inspection of a different age group in the same subjects were conducted only a few weeks later. If I were a teacher or lecturer in that position, I would take it very ill and I would hope that the management would feel the same and support me. It is essentially a matter of good practice.

<P>
The separate but related issue in the second part of the new clause is the inconvenience and intrusiveness of the inspection to the institution. Again, it is essentially a matter of good practice or, as the Minister frequently says, common sense. We all know from experience of Ofsted inspections in schools that many teachers regard them as highly stressful and intrusive. I do not wish to extend the debate to the wider issues of Ofsted, but the chief inspector and his staff must try to take that into account in carrying out inspections. One could argue for a more rigorous approach in the compulsory sector and extend it to the entitlement sector up to the age of 19, but there is no excuse in any circumstances for inspectors to be heavy handed or to cause distress to individuals.

<P>
It would be inappropriate here to make any definitive statement about the recent teacher suicide. I am sure that it upset the chief inspector as much as any decent person who reads about it. Nobody sets out to create such stress. If, however, inspections are carried out over-frequently, inconveniently and intrusively, they will lose credibility and may give rise to personal distress. I am sure that no member of the Committee wants that to happen and I hope that no one would even anticipate it happening.

<P>
In earlier debates, we stressed the desirability of involving a staff member in inspections. It would certainly be preferable to adopt a more collegiate approach to the business of inspection. The inspectorates do not exist only to sit in judgment-to watch and comment, yes-but to improve standards. The new clause makes the important assumption that an inspection is not cost-free: it has emotional and resource implications. It also takes time, particularly in higher education. We must ensure, above all, that the process engages with, and is met with sympathy by, those who are inspected. It must not give rise, on account of bad planning, to a constant process of irritation, aggravation and loss of good will.

<P>
The Minister could adopt one or two approaches towards the new clause. I hope that he will say that it is a good idea and that something along these lines is right, even though he is wary of imposing general duties. His second line of defence would be to say that it is a good idea and should be incorporated into the framework, though it cannot be enshrined in law. If necessary, I am prepared to settle for the second approach, but I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I recognise the intended beneficial effects of inspections. However, my view of public and private life is illuminated by the observation of C. S. Lewis that if one hears of someone going around doing good to others, one can always tell the others by their hunted look. I suspect that complaints about the frequency of inspections, by whomsoever, are not necessarily statistically well based. Hunted looks and hunting conditions can lead to hyperbole.

<P>
I still bear the scar of an exchange with the then Prime Minister during the 1987 general election. She insisted that a Treasury Minister be present at all press conferences, in case there were any financial figures to which she might need to refer. She had undue confidence in my capacity to produce them. I was drawn in on only one occasion when she made disobliging remarks about the frequency of inspections by Customs and Excise. She turned to me and asked me to confirm the point. I was the Minister responsible for Customs and Excise and believed that I carried responsibility for those who worked with and for me, so I disagreed with her-probably not the most sensible thing to have done. It remains the case that the average small business is visited by Customs and Excise only once in eight years on average, which is hardly over-burdensome.

<P>
I have no doubt that the Minister will be all sweetness and light and that there will be references to reasonableness in his response. He is admirably proficient at responding in that form, and I do not intend my remark at all cynically. My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry was right to raise the issue in the context of a new scenario envisaged by the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> In brief, my answer is, ``Yes, good idea, option two, please''.

<P>
I should like to thank the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) for his interventions this morning. He spoke about inspection by English Heritage. That may not be the most obvious comparison. However, because we live in an increasingly audit society, in which the public expect crucial institutions to be inspected, accounted for and audited in different ways, we must learn the lessons across inspectorates-not least regarding social services inspectorates, which deal with some of the same issues that we are debating in the Bill.

<P>
The right hon. Gentleman told us at the beginning of these proceedings, which seems a while ago now, that he was a slow bowler. Slow bowlers can be very effective, as we have seen. I am not sure whether he meant that if he had a higher proportion of Yorkshire genes, he would be a faster, but less effective bowler, but speaking as a north Londoner, who for some reason supports Yorkshire, I too rejoice in the current position.

<P>
Having charmed the Committee in that way, I acknowledge that there are some generally attractive principles behind this new clause-hence my not altogether cynical remark ``Good idea, but option two please.'' However, I shall be asking the hon. Member for Daventry to withdraw it. At times during these proceedings, my mind goes back, for reasons that some members of the Committee will understand, to the report of the Select Committee on Ofsted, which I had the honour to chair. One or two of us took advantage of the opportunity given to us by Ofsted to observe an inspection in progress. I was able to spend one day in a primary school and another in a secondary school. That taught me two things: first, the inspections I observed were highly professional and well-regarded by the school; and secondly, it is common sense that if any institution or individual is being inspected, it is bound to be difficult and nerve racking and consequently make them anxious. Any inspectorate has to be sensitive to the impact on the institution and the individual. We need to draw lessons from the experiences of inspectorates.

<P>
Taking part in an inspection, albeit as an observer, created on one occasion a slightly ludicrous situation. I was accompanying an HMI who was, in a sense, inspecting the Ofsted team. In one classroom a highly professional young teacher, who was taking the class extremely well, was being inspected by the Ofsted inspector and behind her was the HMI, who was inspecting Ofsted. I, as Chairman of the Select Committee, was behind the HMI, observing the whole process. One of the four of us came out of it very well, and that was the teacher, who managed in those extraordinary circumstances to conduct a first-class lesson with a group of enthusiastic children.

<P>
There are, however, some disadvantages to the proposed new clause. If I can deal with the end of the clause first, there has been a strong public commitment from Ofsted to minimise the bureaucracy associated with inspection. In a letter published in The Independent on 11 May, one of Ofsted's inspectors, Mike Tomlinson, said that Ofsted tries, whenever possible, to reduce the pressures and stresses of inspections. Similar commitments have been expressed by the FEFC and TSC inspectorates, and I have no doubt that the adult learning inspectorate will in future share them. Therefore, current practice fully complies with the second half of the new clause.

<P>
I am prepared to reinforce the existing good practice of the inspectorates. The Government will issue guidance to the inspectorates before April 2001, confirming that they should do all they can to minimise bureaucracy in the inspection procedures. Having reflected carefully, I do not think that the provision in the new clause is necessary to deal with any burden that inspection places on providers.

<P>
I have stronger doubts about the hon. Gentleman's proposal regarding the frequency of inspection. At present, the Bill provides that the interval between routine inspections shall be determined by the Secretary of State. While I can assure the hon. Gentleman that it is not the Government's present intention to shorten the cycle of routine inspections, I hope that he will understand when I say that it would be unwise for any Government to rule out doing so in future, should it prove to be beneficial for standards.

<P>
For those reasons, although I have a good deal of sympathy with the need to ensure that inspections do not impose undue burdens on providers, I cannot accept the amendment, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will consider withdrawing it. I understand his point, not least about the burdens that can affect institutions when the cycle of inspection is insensitive, and we are concerned about that.

<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
May I return to a point made earlier by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough? I want to make it absolutely clear that the adult learning inspectorate will be a serious institution. The hon. Gentleman suggested that it might not have teeth, but the FEFC inspectorate and the TSC have teeth, as has been clear from my talks with them and from the reports that I have read. Their remarks about training within care homes, where many of our frail elderly are looked after, concerned me greatly-that was an inspection with teeth. The adult learning inspectorate will be an extremely serious institution, and it will have teeth. It will go about its task professionally and sensitively, but it will bite when it needs to, and, on occasion, it will bite hard. I hope that with those reassurances, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his new clause.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister came in bang on target. Had I written his speech in advance and presented it to the Committee, it would have been expressed in almost exactly the same terms, although perhaps without his characteristic charm, elegance and reasonableness. If I may tease him for a moment, however, if all this was happening already, it would not be too difficult to put it into law and make sure that it went on happening. Formally, the nature of his argument in rebutting its introduction into law did not stand up. On the other hand, there is a difficult balance for any legislator between creating a piece of law that might give rise to continued litigation as to what was a reasonable frequency and issuing guidance. The Minister has adopted option B by saying that he will issue guidance. That is generous and to the point; it is important that it is done and that the inspectorates bear in mind their relative responsibilities.

<P>
On the point that he raised in relation to earlier discussions about teeth for the adult learning inspectorate, we agree, and we want the credibility of the two existing post-16 inspectorates to be maintained, sustained and improved. Breaking the formal link with funding arrangements in further education may not make that too easy in the short term. The explicit relationship with the chief inspector of schools is possibly a diminution of the importance and status of the new ALI. Neither he nor I wish that to happen and the selection of a powerful chairperson and chief inspector for adult learning are therefore important.

<P>
It is reasonable to discuss these matters, but as we have had a good run on them, I do not wish to press the new clause to a division. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.

I hope that the amendment will be dealt with quickly. It deletes an unnecessary phrase in the clause. The reference to the National Council for Education and Training for Wales should be simply that. The preamble is superfluous. The amendment shortens the clause slightly and reduces the bureaucratic tone of the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I apologise for the large number of Government amendments, for which we have been chided by some hon. Members, including the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster. I assure you, Mr. Benton, that all 27 amendments were tabled simply to tidy up the Bill as it applies to inspections in Wales under part IV. They are essentially technical changes which add nothing of substance. The definition of ``inspectors'' and ``additional inspectors'' is unnecessary because where any enactment authorises or requires action to be taken by the chief inspector of schools for Wales, the School Inspections Act 1996 allows delegation of functions by the chief inspector to any member of Her Majesty's inspectorate, or other member of staff or additional inspector authorised by the chief inspector for Wales to act on her behalf. Most of the amendments are grammatical or small drafting changes to improve the clarity: they do not alter the substance of the Bill. I hope that members of the Committee will accept the amendments with the customary courtesy that they bring to the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales is most beguiling. We have many matters of substance to discuss so this is perhaps one occasion on which we will take his assurances on trust and not cast ourselves in the role even of the one-legged Santa Clause who appeared briefly in a previous debate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> The Under-Secretary referred to me in his admirably brief comments. I once moved a group of 25 amendments to the Finance Bill and took a great deal longer over it than the hon. Gentleman did. In the light of his brevity, the least I can do is sit down immediately.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 326, in page 33, line 14, leave out subsection (3).

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 255.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> May I say at the beginning of what will be brief remarks that Opposition Members do not intend to wreck this part of the Bill or create undue difficulties for the Government. We have intimated that given the decisions that have already been taken, and the important role of the National Assembly, we shall not attempt to overturn the settlement or the arrangements conceived for Wales. There are clearly some advantages in shortened lines of communication and an over-arching remit for Estyn which, together with the strong Welsh commitment to education and training, may prove extremely beneficial to that cause in Wales.

<P>
The amendment simply probes the Government's intentions on providing a structure for what might loosely be called order-making powers, or the ability to extend functions, at the behest of the National Assembly for Wales. The Welsh Minister dealt earlier with somewhat similar exchanges in relation to England, where the extension of functions would, of course, require a procedure, for which the Secretary of State would be responsible. For Wales, the procedure would be remitted to the National Assembly.

<P>
Government amendment No. 255 is not strictly about the removal or addition of functions, but about the exercise of functions generally. It seems to bear across the whole of this part of the Bill. Perhaps the Minister will confirm that. We need to know in both cases what the Government envisage and what the safeguards will be.

<P>
This is by no means a completely trivial matter. The House will soon discuss the Care Standards Bill. It is proposed to extend the remit of Ofsted in England to cover, for example, certain aspects of child minding. That is far from uncontentious. It may be felt that that extends the activities of Ofsted, or that it may be ``intrusive'' if it does so. The amendment's purpose is not to wreck the clause but to probe the Minister's mind about arrangements for the National Assembly to contemplate any extension of powers. When the Minister speaks to the Government's amendment, perhaps he will explain whether it applies to this part of the Bill as well as to additional functions, which are the rubric of the clause, and why it appears under clause 71. Our amendments are probing devices. Although we do not seek to subvert the arrangements and have not tabled a huge series of repetitive amendments, it is important that we pause to reflect on one or two of these major issues.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> We had a discussion earlier with the hon. Member for Daventry. The relationship of the National Assembly, the House of Commons and the British Government is such that primary legislation remains with the House of Commons, and that is right and proper. Essentially today's discussion is about secondary regulation. Similar amendments-Nos. 212 and 232-relating to ALI and Ofsted were discussed in Committee earlier this week. Unfortunately I had to be next door in the Committee of the Local Government Bill, defending clauses relating to Wales. However, I have read the report of the earlier discussion and seen the full detail of the way in which the inspectorate's principal remit could, if necessary, be augmented.

<P>
Amendment No. 326, as it relates to Wales and the National Assembly, would create difficulties, although I realise that that was not the hon. Gentleman's intention. It would deprive the National Assembly of its power in clause 73(3) to make additions and amendments, albeit minor, to Estyn's main remit, which is to ensure that the expertise of the inspectors in Wales can apply to other relevant areas of education and training as provision develops. It is impractical to include a full list of the different types of education and training for England. However, our regulation-making power allows the National Assembly to make additions to the remit. In response to the hon. Member for Daventry, it may be helpful if I define the assembly's approach to regulations.

<P>
The National Assembly's regulation-making procedures are set out in its Standing Orders and are thorough and open to scrutiny. The procedures allow all its 60 members to scrutinise the actions of its Executive, as we do in the House. They can do so in plenary sessions, through the Committee structure and through specialist Committees that deal with particular regulations. So scrutiny is carried out, through the framework of primary and secondary regulation, as determined by the settlement.

<P>
Clause 73 would allow for the National Assembly to consider development of new forms of distance learning such as the digital college network in Wales and the growth of other non-traditional learning routes.

<P>
The amendment would delete clause 73, which will provide the National Assembly with the flexibility to ensure that Estyn has the vires to inspect new arrangements relevant to post-16 learning in Wales. I hope that the settlement, which was mentioned earlier, is clear to the hon. Member for Daventry and that he accepts that the power bestowed by the Bill is entirely within the terms of that settlement. Any extensions are designed by the National Assembly to add flexibility.

<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Amendment No. 255 places a duty on the chief inspector for Wales, when exercising the functions in this part of the Bill, to have regard to the National Assembly's advice and such aspects of the policy as the Assembly may specify. The clause sets out the additional functions of the chief inspector for Wales-for example, to inform the Assembly of the quality of provision and of the standards achieved, and whether the financial resources made available to providers are being managed efficiently and giving value for money. The National Assembly will take a great deal of interest in those matters.

<P>
In carrying out the functions that have been delegated to it, and when asked to do so by the National Assembly, Estyn must arrange for the inspection of provision within its extended remit and give the Assembly advice on such matters. Estyn must also have regard to the Assembly's advice and policy, or the traffic would be only one-way. We debated functions under clause 52 as they relate to England; Estyn is already under a similar duty in respect of schools inspections in Wales. Amendment No. 255 brings Estyn's extended remit into line.

<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Daventry will ask leave to withdraw his amendment and that the Committee will accept amendment No. 255.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister's response to my amendment was entirely satisfactory and it was to the Committee's benefit that he rehearsed the secondary legislation safeguards available to the Assembly. It is for the Assembly to decide how the powers should be exercised.

<P>
I agree that what the Minister described as the two-way nature of the relationship between the chief inspector for Wales and the National Assembly is important, I ask the Minister, rather than responding definitively, to pause and reconsider whether this is the right place for the amendment, because the clause relates to additional functions rather than to the extended remit; in a sense, however, consultation is a function rather than a remit, because a remit can be about anything and the proposal refers to a general obligation. It is probably all right, but I want the Minister to make a mental note to ensure that these do not become contentious issues. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I beg to move Government amendment No. 272, in page 35, line 8, leave out from ``inspection'' to end of line and insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) But it does not apply to a report of an inspection conducted-

<P>

</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment is relatively straightforward. It relates to subsection (1) and clarifies which providers of education and training do not have to respond with an action plan to be published before inspection. The providers fall into two categories: first, providers of education and training who would fall within the remit of the chief inspector but for the fact that they are not funded in one of the ways outlined in clause 72; and secondly, providers of education and training who have previously assisted the chief inspector in an area inspection.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 245, in page 35, line 36, leave out ``way in'' and insert ``methods by''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 246, in page 35, line 37, at end insert ``and the standards attained''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> After that rapid progress, I shall detain the Committee only briefly. The clause will enable Estyn to consider guidance and careers services in Wales, which are somewhat different from the arrangements discussed in a previous amendment relating to England. At first glance, the clause seems to refer to persons who are also providing education, training or an advisory service, and person A appears in the Bill for the first time. I hope that the Minister will explain who is likely to be involved in the process as it is not clear, although there are explanatory notes.

<P>
The purpose of the linked amendments is to probe the nature of the inspection, because the Bill as drafted refers to a review of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the way in which A is providing the education, training or advisory service specified in the request.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The phrase ``the way in which'' caught my eye, and is worth probing with an amendment. At first sight, it would seem that the review by Estyn will be purely formal and will describe the activities in which the education, training or advisory service is provided by the notional person A. In other words, it will look at the form rather than the substance. I am sure that that is not the Minister's intention and the amendments were tabled to beef up the reference to the substance. They would require the review to consider the methods by which the activity was conducted, and, by inference, their appropriateness, and to evaluate the standards that the activities had attained. There are many different ways of educating and training; it may be sensible to have a degree of pluralism rather than identical delivery. Needs and individuals vary, and the quality and strength of those providing the education, training or advice may vary too. We do not want to tie things down to a standardised method, although it is obvious that the method should be appropriate. What really matters is the standard of the provision. If anything has to be done about failure or deficiency, it is probably the standards rather than the method that need to be changed or reviewed.

<P>
That is the purpose of the amendment, so perhaps the Under-Secretary of State for Wales will consider it. He might like to offer a more effective alternative wording or assure me that the present wording is sufficient. It would also help if he explained more of the context of the clause, which is clearly important.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I shall be extremely brief. We are speaking to an amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry and not to groups of tidying-up Government amendments. I recall the first time that I intervened on the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment, the hon. Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills), for an explanation of the tidying up of the Bill. That process was in relation to a series of amendments that transformed, on eight or nine occasions, a person providing a service into a provider.

<P>
I realise that we are now dealing with a person rather than a provider, although the person A who is referred to in the clause is providing a relevant service, the reference being to an
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>education, training or advisory service.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Stylistically, in the light of the way in which the Bill was tidied up, is a person referred to as A to comply with the way in which providers are referred to in the Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998?

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> My hon. Friend wants me to give way. I had finished, but I shall pretend that I was going on.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My right hon. Friend raises an interesting point that prompts me to ask him whether he has been any more successful in uncovering person B than I have. Person B does not exist. My right hon. Friend's point is that there is an implied inelegancy to the drafting that may be in the interests of external consistency. The Under-Secretary of State for Wales might want to respond to that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> As I had said that I had not concluded my speech, I must be true to my word. I shall spend the rest of the consideration of the Bill scrutinising it and the 1998 Act for any references to person B.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I greatly enjoyed listening to those contributions and I hope that I can clarify the points raised. I can say categorically that Mr. B, provider B or person B is not in any of the pages of the Bill, and will not be in the foreseeable future.

<P>
Clause 78 inserts proposed new section 35A into the Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998. It will follow section 35, which authorises inspections of services offered by those providing career services in Wales. The proposed new section provides for inspection of certain other services that they provide, and has been drafted to retain consistency with the wording of section 35. The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Daventry would introduce an unnecessary inconsistency.

<P>
I owe the Committee an explanation of what the provider or person A is deemed to be. Person or persons A is or are the careers service companies in Wales or persons contracted to help them. The clause will enable Estyn to inspect the providers. I hope that that clarifies its purpose.

<P>
I welcome the gentle probing of amendment No. 246, but the amendment is not needed. An inspection under the clause will take place only at the request of the National Assembly, which will specify what it wants. Proposed new subsection (5) will enable it to consult the chief inspector for Wales about what it specifies. I recognise that there may be some value in the points made, but in the light of my explanation in relation to person A and person B, who do not exist, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will-

<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Brady </B>(Altrincham and Sale, West): I am intrigued, as I do not share the Minister's familiarity with the Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998. Can he reassure me that there is such a person as person B in that Act?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I can generally reassure the hon. Gentleman that person B is in the ether-he is not in any previous Acts, although he may appear in future. I do not currently anticipate his or her appearance. Given those reassurances, I hope that the hon. Member for Daventry will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his response. I pay tribute to the vigilance of my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady). I had sought to ask whether person B existed in either piece of legislation, and was disarmed by the Minister into believing that he was answering in the context of both pieces of legislation. Clearly, in the light of his response to my hon. Friend, he was only responding in the context of the Bill. You might have ruled him out of order, Mr. Benton, if his answer had extended further.

<P>
I am a little disappointed that our search for person B has been curtailed, which was slightly spoilsport. Were Committee members categorised as person B, I am conscious that my hon. Friends the Members for Daventry and for Altrincham and Sale, West and I would have a majority in the group. However, we would be happy to make the Government Whip-the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts)-and the hon. Member for Leeds, Central (Mr. Benn) honorary members of the group for the remainder of the Committee.

<P>
I am grateful to the Minister for confirming that the style is derived from the Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998. He will remember that when the Committee discussed amendments on providers, it was indicated that they were a way of improving the legislation. We must be gratified that the Government are not only capable of improving Bills as they go along, but are capable of taking new strides and discarding words that they have used in previous legislation, in the interests of greater clarity in the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> In view of the Minister's assurances and my right hon. Friend's helpful encouragement-albeit an implied deconstruction of the Bs-I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 281, in page 36, line 37, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) If financial resources have been applied by the Council or a local education authority in respect of education or training which is being inspected under this section, the inspection may extend to considering the manner in which those resources have been applied and whether they have been applied in a way which provides value for money.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The new subsection allows the chief inspector for Wales, when commissioning an area inspection, to consider how the National Council for Education and Training for Wales and the local education authority have used the public funds made available to them. The area inspection may now cover how the funding has been applied to the provision of education and training and whether that provided best value for money. The chief inspector will have the capacity to ensure that publicly funded education or training is used most appropriately, with regard to the needs of the individual, to business and to the community as a whole.

<P>
In addition, the chief inspector will be able to introduce providers' accountability when an area inspection is conducted, so that training and education providers must be mindful of providing best value for money. I hope that Opposition Members welcome the amendment, because it provides for tighter control of public finances.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I have no objection to the principle, as the Minister anticipated. Nevertheless, the amendment opens a new front for Estyn in terms of value for money. Can he assure us that there will be the necessary staffing and that persons with financial and accountancy expertise will support Estyn inspections in carrying out this important new function?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> Yes, I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that the National Assembly is mindful of the fact that we have tabled the amendment. It has enthusiastically embraced the concept and will in due course consider its provision of resources to meet the amendment's objectives. As I have said, the amendment is about ensuring that Estyn has the power to examine the use of public money.

</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 286.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> The explanation required for the amendment is short, but perhaps rather longer than those given for previous amendments.

<P>
Under clause 80, the National Assembly for Wales can ask the chief inspector for Wales to conduct an inspection of the education and training provided in a certain area of Wales. That feature is common to England. In addition, the chief inspector has the power to commission an area inspection. The inclusion of the amendments tabled by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment, my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, North means that there is a duty on the chief inspector to produce a report on completion of an area inspection.

<P>
Without the inclusion of the amendment, the chief inspector would be under no obligation to provide a report following an area inspection and any valuable information produced as a result of an inspection would not therefore be considered by the right and proper authority at that time.

<P>
Amendment No. 286 enables the chief inspector to issue a report on an area inspection to anyone whom she considers appropriate.

<P>
An area inspection report considering a specific area of Wales may not focus in detail on an individual education or training institution. It may be necessary to issue a copy of the report to all providers in the area. Where that is the case, we are removing the duty on the chief inspector, but retaining the power to do so.

<P>
The amendment also removes the requirement for the report to include the matters set out in clause 74(3). A similar but more appropriate form of those matters is already set out in clause 80(1). With that short explanation, I hope that the Committee will accept the amendments.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> The clause is similar to new clause 5, which the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Employment, the hon. Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills) moved earlier to tidy the Bill. That was the first occasion on which I asked some probing questions about the Bill's construction. We discussed the issues on clause 53, but the official record of that debate does not include the text of new clause 5, and I am afraid that I have lost my amendment paper from that time. However, my recollection is that the terms of new clause 5 are only marginally different from those of clause 83, and do not change its substance.

<P>
Earlier, we talked about the benefits of diversity under devolution. I do not object to the phrasing in the Welsh clauses being different from that in the English clauses. My parents spent their honeymoon in Wales, and my father reported that in the village in which they stayed, the window of the sub-post office displayed a sign saying, ``Letters for the 5.30 post must be posted by 6 o'clock at the very latest.'' That great Yorkshire man, Lawrence Sterne, started a novel with the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>They order  this matter better in France.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is wholly proper that they should order matters differently in Wales. However, I am curious about why clause 83 was not included when the Bill was tidied.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for his acuity of expression on a point that troubles me, but for which I, too, lack the precise reference. The only relevant story that I can tell is about a visit made 50 years ago by my late father-in-law. I hasten to say that he visited not a resident kinsman at the former mental hospital in Carmarthen, but a kinsman who was a chaplain there. He interviewed many plausible-sounding people of great charm, one of whom assured him with great force that he could ring the chapel bells with equal effectiveness in Welsh and English.

<P>
It would be boring if we had always to say the same things, but perhaps the Under-Secretary will explain the differences on the delicate subject of defamation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> Clause 83 simply says that for the purposes of the law of defamation, any report made under this part is privileged, unless its publication is shown to have been made with malice.

<P>
The policy objectives in England and Wales are the same, but I must tell the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster and the hon. Member for Daventry that England and Wales receive different treatment. There is a technical reason for that, but even for a master technician such as myself, the reason is so technical that I may need to consider it and write a detailed explanation letter that runs to six or seven pages. I am assured that the Bill contains the differences for astute reasons, but I will reflect on that and write to the Committee.

</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time. New clause 7 is not a new policy direction for the Bill. It simply ensures that the report of an area inspection is carried through to its logical conclusion by requiring a statement to be prepared detailing the action to be taken within a specified period. The statement should be prepared either by the council in Wales or a local education authority as necessary, and the person preparing the statement must consult such persons as the National Assembly for Wales directs. That simply firms up the policy objectives of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I shall make a couple of brief comments, one of which I should perhaps have made earlier. The chief inspector can carry out area inspections, and my point is about the action plans that follow them, with which we have no difficulty. I notice that, under clause 81, he may also carry out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a comparative study of the provision made outside Wales in respect of specified matters relating to such education or training.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Secretary of State therefore has at least an opportunity to look over the border. My concern, which echoes earlier debates, is that the two education systems should not operate in isolation, even in slightly different formats. I have no objection to the complexity of the format, not least because I have a daughter who happens to be a Government lawyer and it must be very good for trade to have such distinctions. However, we will leave that aside and move on to the substance of the point.

<P>
If a report of an area inspection is to be made, it will clearly be to the National Assembly, and the action plan that follows will be the responsibility of the assembly and/or the local education authority that is conducting the activity. There is no problem with that. However, will the Minister assure us that if an area inspection takes place-rather the converse of clause 81-it will be run by English interests? On a professional level the two appropriate chief inspectors may talk to one another about it. In addition, and bearing in mind that the United Kingdom Parliament is the overall taxpayer, if there is some question of the use of resources, it must be possible to draw that fact to the attention of Parliament, which produces a block grant for Wales and the National Assembly, as well as having it considered locally. I am not attempting to overturn the devolution settlement or muscle in on the Welsh situation, but it would seem both common courtesy and common sense to have at least some capacity for exchanging information.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I hope that I can reassure the hon. Gentleman. As the Bill states, a comparative study of provision made outside Wales in respect of specified matters is within the remit of the chief inspector, should the National Assembly wish the chief inspector to carry out that function. My understanding from discussions with colleagues in the National Assembly is that they might wish to look at what was happening in England for any lessons applicable to Wales. I am sure that the appropriate authorities with responsibility for England might also wish to look at areas in Wales. Such reciprocity would be natural, because both bodies are funded by the United Kingdom Government-in Wales, through the block grant, and in England, through direct taxation and the block grant to the Department. Co-operation will remain.

<P>
Having said that, the responsibilities for the chief inspector for Wales relate to Wales. The comparative study that has been mentioned would be for interest and information in Wales, and vice versa with regard to England. Estyn cannot undertake inspections outside Wales and would not be expected to do so. As the hon. Gentleman has said, the UK Parliament votes the block grant to the Secretary of State, and although the day-to-day responsibility of administering that grant rests properly with the National Assembly, I can assure him that the Secretary of State takes an interest, as do Members of Parliament, in the end use of that resource. They will continue to do so. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is reassured and will support new clause 7.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Clause read a Second time, and added to the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 84</center></H4>
<H4><center>Dissolution of FEFC for England</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 327, in page 37, line 40, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(c) the Secretary of State shall arrange for the preparation and publication of an accurate description and valuation of property and liabilities, including liabilities for redundancy payments, arising from any transfer under this section.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
We now move from the Welsh parts of the Bill to part V, which is described as ``Miscellaneous and General''. That phrase can cover a multitude of sins, and it certainly covers a multitude of issues that will absorb us over our remaining sittings. Although the main thrust of the Bill is now discharged, these clauses are not unimportant or peripheral. In a sense there is no more important clause than this. It provides for the dissolution of the Further Education Funding Council for England and clause 86 deals with its Welsh counterpart.

<P>
There is certain dramatic finality about the clause. It reminds me of a biography that I once read of Field Marshall Auchinleck who, after a distinguished, although perhaps not unchequered, service in the second world war, became commander-in-chief of the Indian Army. On the day before independence he issued the final Indian Army order. I do not recall the number without checking the biography, but it said ``23.59 hours, 14 August 1947: This is the final Indian Army order''. That was an eloquent and militarily terse statement of the reality.

<P>
I have two things to say to the Committee. First, we may have known, lived and in some cases worked with the further education funding councils, but we should not adopt a sentimental or fractious attitude to the decisions that Ministers have made. We debated them in principle on Second Reading and we are currently considering the details. It would be remiss at this point not to put on record our gratitude to those who have led, managed and participated in the work of the council over the years. When the history is written for the years 1992-2000, this will be seen as an interesting development which, if not universally successful, has on balance been positive. It is one to which individuals have made substantial contributions. I exclude those who are involved in this Room. It is not a matter of our personal contributions, but our experience of those with whom we have worked.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Purchase </B>(Wolverhampton, North-East): The hon. Gentleman is right that we should not be overly sentimental. There have been times during the regime of the FEFC when, given the behaviour of some colleagues, it would have been more appropriate for it to have been a fraud squad than a funding council. I agree entirely that we should not be sentimental, but he should be objective about their dismal performance.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I have considerable respect for the hon. Gentleman. I was not seeking in these brief remarks to give an overview of all the areas of difficulty. I concede that there were some, but they were not always caused by the funding councils, and may have been caused by the governors or the managements of individual colleges. I am happy to say that to him because it is implicit in the structure. That is not to say that everything the funding councils have done is ideal or perfect or that they have always had the easiest relationship with the colleges. Just occasionally they have been wrong and the college has been right.

<P>
We should remember that England-and I speak primarily of the English council of which I have greater experience-has broadly 450 further education colleges. Anyone dealing with large numbers-whether of county constabularies, higher education institutions, health authorities or whatever- knows that one or two are likely to be misfiring at any one time. The errors and deficiencies of individuals should not necessarily be taken as a slur either on the generality of further education colleges, or indeed the conduct of the council that supervises them. The relationship is difficult, but some issues have been exposed that may have been lost in the earlier arrangements.

<P>
As I said earlier, few further education principals and few local authorities want to reopen the arrangements made in 1992 to give separate governance to further education colleges. Introducing a new accountancy regime, a funding council and a funding formula that increasingly emphasises transparency and convergence has thrown up some of the problems.

<P>
Though not ideal, the past eight years under the funding councils have been positive. Progress has been made in a sector that has not always had the attention that it deserves. Nevertheless, important issues about the transition from funding councils to the Learning and Skills Council-or the Council for Education and Training in Wales-remain to be discussed by the Committee. These are sensitive issues and should be handled sensitively, particularly the disposition of property and the handling of staff interests, which are covered in the amendment.

<P>
The Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 and other procedures are relevant. Property must be sensibly disposed of. Above all, the management and momentum of the council, of the separate training and enterprise councils whose licences will be rescinded from next April, and anything else wound up or created by the Bill, such as the new councils, must be sensibly dovetailed together. The moves may be well intentioned, but there is always a danger of transitional problems arising. It might take a year or two before matters are put right. It is therefore incumbent on the Committee to ensure that safeguards are in place.

<P>
I have already referred to my own experience of the fall-out from the divestiture of further education colleges from local education authorities, though it was a year after the event-not on the day because I was not in office at that time. It took time to work out the disposition of the property, to resolve difficulties and, when necessary, to await a ministerial decision. Not everyone goes into such processes with good will or common sense, but it is important to secure those characteristics if possible.

<P>
The Minister has made it easier for himself because the clause wipes out the Further Education Funding Council, and everything it owns-to use the Minister's phrase-will go to the Learning and Skills Council. Similar provisions apply to Wales under clause 86, and clause 85 contains an interesting provision for a preliminary transfer, which is England-specific. The Welsh structure is already differentiated and assets can be treated in different ways.

<P>
Through amendment No. 327, I ask what the Government have done in another context. The Government seem to have forgotten about it, but I remind the Committee that they published a national asset register in order to gain a better measure of what was around and what could be used-or, if appropriate, sold-by the taxpayer.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The Minister will also be aware that we are moving into a world in which resource accounting, not old-fashioned cash accounting, is relevant. The amendment suggests that we need to evaluate the assets. I leave Ministers a degree of flexibility over the precision of the process. It should not be slipshod, but there may be some differences of view, as there would be in the national asset register, about the exact valuations.

<P>
<B>Mr. Purchase:</B> This is well worthwhile as a probing amendment. If we are to move towards resource accounting, it will clearly be necessary to understand the value of the assets. I remain unsure, howver, why we need to move to resource accounting of fixed assets. I accept that the redundancy has to be quantified-that would have to be done in any event-but I cannot think through how to quantify the return on assets employed-the basic purpose of resource accounting.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. He may be more expert in this field than me. He is right that the new council taking over from the Further Education Funding Council must have regard to the value of what it owns in relation to what it has to deliver. The costs of administration in relation to the value of its activities should be taken into account.

<P>
Another important concern relates to capital charging for assets, as under the national health service. Ministers always have day-to-day decisions to take about whether we should spend more on assets currently or save money through capital investment, thereby reducing overall costs thereafter.

<P>
The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East (Mr. Purchase) may have anticipated the point that what the FEFC owns is partly contingent. It may reflect a historic position: it may reflect assets that came under its control at different times. I notice the hon. Gentleman nodding. For example, the regional structure of the FEFC will no longer exist in its current form under the LSC, because 47 English local councils will report centrally. On the other hand, regional development agencies will also be involved and will have to be co-located. The Minister may wish to say something about that. There will be property and we need to know what it is worth and whether it is sensible to transfer it. If I may use a domestic analogy, it is rather like dealing with the transfer of property by bequest to members of a family on the death of a family member. It may not always be the best course of action for someone to go and live in a property just because it has been left to them. It may be better for the person to find a smaller or a bigger property in a different place. The person has to decide and it may be best to take the decision ex post facto.

<P>

<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am trying to follow the thread of the hon. Gentleman's argument. To help me, if not the rest of the Committee, will he give an example of an asset that would not be transferred automatically as a result of the FEFC going out of business and the Learning and Skills Council coming into business? Where might there be a problem?

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The position under the clause is quite clear: the assets would transfer, subject only to clause 85, as the Minister will confirm. Perhaps we should not make too heavy weather of this. As an example, the FEFC headquarters in Coventry, which I have visited in the past as I expect the Minister has, may be fine for the new Learning and Skills Council. The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that the inference, if not the decision, has been that they will transfer as headquarters of the new body. That may be a tidy solution: X owned this; X does not exist; all property is automatically transferred to Y. However, it may be quite inappropriate for that property to transfer. It may be too big-it may have been too big for the FEFC although I do not think it was-or it may be in the wrong place. The mere contingent fact that the FEFC owned the property does not by itself constitute a sufficient reason for the transfer of that property to the Learning and Skills Council.

<P>
Ministers are busy people-

<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster </B>(Worcester): Following the hon. Gentleman's line of argument, would not the best thing be for the automatic transfer to take place from the FEFC to the Learning and Skills Council and then for that body to make the decision as to what to do with that asset?

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The hon. Gentleman is about half a sentence ahead of my argument. I was about to say that Ministers have a responsibility for at least considering the assets under their control. I shall come back to the question of valuation in a minute because it has a slightly different resonance. I am not sure that a clause that simply says that Ministers are to get shot of an asset by transferring it from one organisation to its successor is sufficient. If it is not sufficient, the point made by the hon. Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster) comes to mind. It must be an early duty on the Learning and Skills Council to say, ``Good Lord, we have a white elephant here. We don't need that. We must get rid of it.''

<P>
It is a two-stage process. Either Ministers, in consultation with the FEFC and the shadow Learning and Skills Council when it is appointed, should see what happens and perhaps cut off transfer by prior sale-in order to inform that process, a valuation may be appropriate-or the Learning and Skills Council and its subordinate bodies should have a responsibility, on appointment, to get on with the job of considering whether the assets are appropriate. My preference would be for Ministers, the existing bodies and the shadow body for the Learning and Skills Council to consider the position first, so that there is not merely a collection of assets that transfer. If they believe that, in the interests of smoothness, it is better for the decision on property disposition to be made after vesting, perhaps that is right, but at least they should explain their view to the Committee. I do not want assets that are inappropriate, more costly than they need be or in the wrong place to linger on under the ownership of the Learning and Skills Council if they are not required as the most appropriate assets for the conduct of its work.

<P>
If I may, I shall add a practical example. Many years ago, as I have already mentioned, I led a smallish endowed research charity. We moved our functions over a period of years, and at one stage we had a tangible property including the old house and gardens of a country house which were used for laboratories for specific purposes in connection with animal health. Some may misinterpret that remark: it was in connection with the Animal Health Trust to which it was sub-leased. The trust did not want the property for that purpose any longer and I remember that, although we had important new duties and things to do with our money, we spent an inordinate proportion of our time over a period of years in working out the sale of those physical assets, albeit they were well sold and worth having at the end of the day.

<P>
If the new Learning and Skills Council does not start with a clean sheet but has the acquis-the property that it has inherited-it will have a major problem if its number one task is to appraise those assets. We are trying to assist Ministers with that.

<P>
This is a complex task involving individuals and the transfer of undertakings position is still not too clear-in so far as people do not transfer between the council and its successor, to give just one example-and there may be liabilities for redundancy and other matters. To put it at its worst-I am not necessarily canvassing this-the requirements under the TUPE regulations might knock a hole in the Government's estimates for administrative savings from the transfer to the new structure.

<P>
We cannot decide anything unless we know what those requirements are. There are some big changes happening that will require the movement of significant assets. I do not for a moment seek in the amendment to starve the LSC of the capacity to carry on its activity, but we should not necessarily nod through that transfer without some understanding of where we are, whether the assets are appropriate and whether they are being transferred to the right people. We shall return to that subject on later amendments.

<P>
These are major administrative changes, if nothing else. They involve individuals and significant amounts of property. We should be told as much as possible about them, and Ministers need to inform themselves about the scale of the assets transferring in order to ensure that the process is smooth and worth while and that nothing inappropriate is done.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I support the amendment. I apologise for examples taken from the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, even if their ubiquity and their reputation is such that when an American woman passing through Parliament square on the top of an open bus asked her husband what Big Ben was he replied, ``It's either Oxford or Cambridge but I'm not sure which.''

<P>
The Cambridge example of assets that were long held but simply disappeared because there was no process such as my hon. Friend has described is at a microcosmic level. There is a Cambridge college where a window cleaner on completing his task once said to the college porter as he left,``Why is it that I always clean the window of a room that has no doors?'' On investigation, it turned out that the room had been walled up in the 16th Century, had been available to the college for the following four centuries, had it chosen to take care of it, and was only noticed four centuries later by a window cleaner.

<P>
Turning to the Oxford example, I remind the Committee of Herr Baedeker's advice: the ancient universities of Oxford and Cambridge are both worth visiting; if pressed for time, omit Cambridge. This example is fictional but none the worse for that. It relates to that notable quintet of novels by J.I.M. Stewart, who was an Oxford English literature don who also wrote detective novels under the name of Michael Innes. There was a major architectural problem in the college that was going to require massive funding, and in the course of the novel it emerged that within the very tower that required repair, in a box room, there was a major Renaissance painting that the college had simply allowed to disappear from its assets: it had been mislaid over the years. Nobody was conscious that the college had it, yet it was the solution to the problem.

In my constituency, after the Westway flyover was constructed and opened by Mr. Marples, the vicar of St. Mary's, Paddington Green, a jewel of an 18th-century church standing on land close to the flyover, was having tea with two elderly parishioners.

<P>
At the level of my own constituency, after the Westway flyover was constructed by Mr. Marples, the vicar of St. Mary's, Paddington Green, which is a jewel of an 18th century church standing on land close to the flyover, was having tea with two elderly parishioners. They said to him, ``We hope you got a good price for that piece of church land.'' He said, ``I do not know to what you refer.'' On investigation, it transpired that a small piece of land on which some supporting pillars were built belonged to St. Mary's, Paddington Green. Westway had by then been opened, possibly by the Queen, and yet the land did not belong to the Ministry of Transport at all. Understandably, the vicar was able to secure a handsome price from the Department of Transport in order to prevent the whole process from having to be started again.

<P>
<B>Mr. Purchase:</B> I find it irresistible to say to the hon. Gentleman, in the light of his list of upper class muddle and mess, involving Oxford, Cambridge and the Church of England, that it is no wonder that the country tottered through most of the twentieth century. Does he realise that the techniques of resource accounting and capital asset base are part of modern management and hardly need to be mentioned in the Bill, although it has been worthwhile to explore the issues?

<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I have no problems with the observations of the hon. Gentleman, although I must point out, in passing, that the previous Government debated resource accounting before it was introduced by the present one. As with the Schleswig-Holstein question, few people understand it, but I am happy that the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East is one of them. Perhaps we can have a separate seminar outside.

<P>
At any rate, the money that was raised from the land that belonged to St. Mary's, Paddington Green-where Sarah Siddons's statue stands in the churchyard-was sufficient to completely do up the church. It has to be the case, despite the strictures laid upon me by the hon. Gentleman, that the discipline of examining and determining the best use of assets of this sort, is something that is constantly worth bringing to the attention of those in authority, whatever the business.

<P>
In the context of what the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East said, Murphy's law applies to this Government, just as it does to every other.

<P>

<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> That was an interesting intervention, which reminded us of the names of two of our many universities. I remember the right hon. Gentleman saying in the early stages of this Committee that the three Tory Members present on that occasion had all gone to the same university. I cannot immediately recall which of the former polytechnics he was referring to. Or was it one of the more ancient bodies? I thought at the time that while no doubt there are also hon. Members on the Goverment Benches who can speak about their experiences at Oxford and Cambridge, the rest of us should remind the public from time to time that there are now many more universities. Certainly I hope that one impact of this Bill, which is about post-16 education, will be to enable more students from all walks of life to benefit from universities of different kinds, given that in terms of access and participation some at the moment are more successful than others.

<P>
This is the first of several important clauses dealing with the transfer from the old framework to the new. It is worth pausing for a moment, as the hon. Gentleman did, to consider the wider context of this and later amendments and the work that we are engaged upon.

<P>
Since the publication of the White Paper last year, we have put significant effort into managing the transition process effectively and have been working closely with all the partner organisations directly affected by the changes proposed. As hon. Members may be aware, a national transition plan was published alongside the Learning to Succeed White Paper last June. This was intended to help partner organisations develop and take forward their own transition plans. Since that national plan-not to be confused with an earlier one-was first published, we have continued to develop and refine it with the support of a wide range of partners at national, regional and local level. I am proud of the way in which my officials and the Department have been able to engage in that dialogue as we refine the transition plan. We shall need to continue this.

<P>
An updated version of the plan was published in November and a further update will be published within the next month. That version will reflect the important announcements we made at the end of March on handling the implications for individual staff members arising out of the changes we are making and the second funding consultation documents issued last Friday.

<P>
I should like to put on record my thanks to all those working closely with us from the TECs, the FEFC, the Training Standards Council, local government and many other organisations to help ensure that the new arrangements are put in place effectively and that performance is maintained throughout the transition period. The need to maintain performance in the coming period is vital.

<P>
We recognise that the scale of changes we are making has inevitably caused a period of uncertainty for people working in the organisations affected. That is why we issued a comprehensive statement at the end of March, setting out how we expect the staff transfer process to be handled and the key milestones over the next 12 months. It emphasised our desire to build on the skills of people within existing organisations and our determination to handle the staff transfer process in line with the best employment practice. Hon. Members have been sent a copy of that statement. It has been widely welcomed by the TECs, the FEFC and the TSC.

<P>
We also recognise that the changes we are making require a significant financial investment in the transition process. We currently estimate that the cost of establishing the LSC and adult learning inspectorate over the next two years will be between 60 and 65 million. These costs include the development of new IT systems, premises and, of course, significant investment in staff training and development.

<P>
To ensure that the LSC gets off to the best start possible, we have now made 35 million available this year to meet its start-up costs, which includes an additional 10 million towards the cost of developing the new IT system for the LSC. This investment in transition will soon be repaid by the at least 50 million per year savings that our changes will deliver.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> As the Minister has read out important figures and has implied that the Committee might bury them or leave them unremarked, does he concede that, if his establishment costs for the new arrangements are of the order of 60 million or 70 million as he suggested, then the annual cost of servicing that debt or undertaking should be deductible from the annual savings that he somewhat implausibly claims will be achieved? He cannot on the one hand claim 50 million and then not take account of the fact that there will be a continuing cost for the new arrangements from the upfront costs of establishment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Part of that is a fair question and I shall certainly come back to the hon. Gentleman later today in discussion and/or in writing so that we can establish the precise interface start-up costs and the savings that we are confident we will make.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> Since the Second Reading in another place, and, indeed, throughout the progress of the Bill, this figure of 50 million has constantly gone backwards and forwards, yet we have never had a satisfactory explanation from the Minister as to how it was arrived at. Will he, either this afternoon or in writing, let the Committee have the analysis that the Government used? That might allay many of our concerns that the figure has simply been plucked out of the air. It must have come from somewhere.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right on only one point: the figure must have come from somewhere. I am sure that it was given in answer to parliamentary questions, but I will check my records, given our explanations. We are confident that at least 50 million savings per year can be made.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> Will the Minister give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> If I may, I shall answer the question, although I know that people sometimes like to get the rejoinder in first. The current system is heavily resource-intensive. Each of the 72 TECs and the FEFC currently devise their own funding systems and have their own support services on, for example, IT, personnel, premises and marketing. In future, there will be one organisation, with one set of systems. The LSC will also have the purchasing power of a large organisation to allow it to get best value.

<P>
We are also reducing the number of offices-this relates to our debate on the amendment-so that instead of some 73 sets of premises, there will be 48. We estimate that those benefits will bring an additional 35 million of savings per year. The Government, through the Government offices for the regions, have to contract with 72 TECs individually. In future, there will be a one-to-one relationship between the Government and the LSC. We estimate that that will give a saving of up to 15 million.

<P>
Those savings estimates take no account of the benefits to providers from a single coherent system. They will also be able to invest more in quality and spend less on bureaucracy. I hope that that satisfies hon. Gentlemen that we have thought the arithmetic through carefully and that it adds up.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Can the Minister tell the Committee whether he has taken external advice from, for example, management consultants? Does his chosen structure best reflect the need to balance the economies of scale that he has claimed and the diseconomies of scale from additional consultation costs or sub-optimal delivery at local level? Have his figure work and, indeed, his concept been externally audited or has he made up those figures?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The hon. Gentleman must discuss with my former maths teacher whether I have made the figures up, but I can assure him that the answer is no. We have calculated savings by establishing the current cost of administration, which includes the costs to the TECs, the DFEE, Government offices, the FEFC, the TSC and Ofsted. Then we assessed future administrative costs, taking account of the costs associated with running the LSC and the new adult learning inspectorate, and extending the functions of employment services to take over activities previously undertaken by the TECs.

<P>
That process has enabled us to establish that, in steady state, the savings will be the figure that I have emphasised-50 million per year. As I said, that figure is made up of the 15 million savings that relate to the Government and their offices, and the 35 million savings from the introduction of LSCs, instead of the many more TECs that the previous administration planned.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> When the Minister comes back later, or in a letter to the Committee, will he set out the number of personnel involved under the current system in each of the organisations described? Will he also give his estimate of the number of personnel who will be employed in each of the future organisations?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I can give some information now. We have assessed that between 250 million and 270 million is spent on staff premises, with related costs across the DFEE, Government offices, TECs and the FEFC. We are confident of achieving the saving that I mentioned. In response to the question asked by the hon. Member for Hertsmere, I do not have the exact details at hand, but I will do my best to provide whatever information I can to the Committee, which must fulfil its purpose.

<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry made a point about how we undertook the process. He was intimately associated with the Department, so he knows that it contains much expertise. I hope that he is confident that we are capable of getting the arithmetic right. However, I am sure that I can give the Committee more help on the process that we undertook and on the detailed calculations, and I shall provide information either at a relevant time during our proceedings or in letters to the Committee. The questions are fair, and I want to give fair answers.

<P>

<B>Valerie Davey </B>(Bristol, West): My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary said that at least 50 million would be saved, and although pessimistic Opposition Members question that amount, I alert the Committee to the fact that some in practice in the sector believe that the sum could be higher. One person quipped to me, ``Is there not a nought missing? Should it not be 500 million rather than 50 million?'' The debate is important and the argument should not be one-sided.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I assure the Committee that I will be as helpful as I can be. The issue will be judged over time and I am confident that time will prove the accuracy of our answer. It is not my task today to be unfair to the old regime or the Ministers who presided over it, but I remember talking to a conference of training providers outside of further education who complained that all the TECs had different IT systems and different software, and that it was impossible to make savings or have a reasonable dialogue across the piece. A training provider might have had to participate in detailed discussions about matters such as contracts with several TECs, but nonsensically, nobody ensured that each TEC used the same IT system. We are watching the IT scene carefully and will ensure that the system is coherent. It does not take a lot of expertise to see how we arrive at our savings, and I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, West (Valerie Davey) supports that idea.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> The Under-Secretary accepted three interventions after he refused mine, so I am not being unreasonable or impatient in rising. He gave an illustration of my observations from C. S. Lewis that if somebody does good to others, one can tell the others by their hunted look. I rise to remind him and the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough that the Under-Secretary wrote to me after Second Reading about the savings, and he circulated his letter to the Committee. In the letter, he expanded somewhat on the figures that Baroness Blackstone provided in the House of Lords, but his main paragraph was singularly short on figures, and simply took issue with an assumption that I had made on Second Reading. The mild ambiguity could go in favour of the view of the hon. Member for Bristol, West but equally, it could go in other directions. When the Under-Secretary returns to the issue, it will help to have some figures, and not just words.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I have outlined some arithmetic this morning, but I apologise to the right hon. Gentleman if my letter was short on figures. I was mindful of the fact that he is an extraordinarily busy senior parliamentarian. Perhaps I am wrong, but his strengths are in literature rather than arithmetic. I apologise for underestimating the general nature of his education.

<P>
More seriously, I shall write to the right hon. Gentleman and all members of the Committee with much arithmetic and data, although I have provided some already. Obviously, a bit of politics is going on here, and occasionally, that is not unreasonable between politicians. Part of the Opposition's function is to try to show that the old regime was superior to what we propose. They find it difficult to understand why reducing the number of organisations from 72 to 47 might produce savings and, obviously, that depends on what the 72 did and what the 47 will do. I understand that, but on that basic, arithmetical point, the hon. Member for Daventry might think that we are on to something. If I can demonstrate further I will certainly do so.

<P>
I fully support the principle behind the amendment, so agreement is breaking out already. It is clearly important that we give a full account, including to Parliament, of what has happened to the public assets owned by the FEFC. Indeed, I would go further-I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would join me here although the point is not made in his amendment-and say that we must also account for the property transferred from other bodies, such as TECs, once the transfer process has been completed.

<P>
As drafted, however, the amendment would place a statutory duty to report only on those assets transferred from the FEFC to the LSC and would, therefore, present Parliament with a partial picture. I am more than willing to give the Committee an undertaking that we will present a full account to Parliament of the movement of assets once the transfer processes have been completed. Last week I explained the extensive exercises that we are undertaking to assess TEC assets and this will be part of the process. I shall say a little more about this on later amendments. Given the commitment and our rounded discussion, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Although I deliberately set out to frame my remarks in a non-contentious way, the debate focused on the flow of future assets and liabilities rather than on the stock of current ones, which was the subject of the amendment. As the Minister has given reasonable assurances to the Committee, he might like to reflect on the best way to draw this to the attention to the House. It is sometimes said that the best way of keeping a secret in this place is to announce it in the Chamber. It is an important issue and I hope that he will perhaps give us more indications at a later stage.

<P>
Conscious of the time, I simply say on the more general issue that I still find some of the Minister's figure work implausible. He offered us a small helping of jam this morning and the promise of more jam this afternoon. While I have some reservations and feel that if his calculations and plans had been externally audited rather than created in-house they might be more plausible, this is not the moment to expand on them. It may be possible to return briefly to the issue on clause stand part. The Minister may have something to offer the Committee before close of play tonight. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
