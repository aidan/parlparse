<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Dawn </B><P>
Primarolo): Good afternoon, Mrs. Dunwoody. Before our 
break for lunch, I was explaining to the Committee the likely impact of the abolition of the foreign earnings 
deduction on the charitable sector, which is rightly of 
interest to all Committee members. We discussed with 
charities and the Charities Tax Reform Group the position 
of overseas employees. Our discussions centred on 
whether charities' employees were non-resident, on 
whether they were therefore not liable for tax and would 
not be covered by FEDs, and on whether they were 
therefore not subject to tax because of residency.
<P>
The hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Woodward), who 
takes a great interest in charities, made by points for me. 
He discussed two-year contracts and the situation in 
which overseas workers will be deployed. I said that the 
Inland Revenue had made it clear in discussions with 
charities that a worker who moves from country to 
country is regarded as being continuously overseas and 
that if he goes to work for another charity, he will still 
be regarded as being in continual employment. He would 
almost certainly qualify for relief. We agreed to work with 
the Charities Tax Reform Group to explain to charities 
the rules for non-residency and how their overseas 
workers will be affected. Charities may have an imperfect 
understanding of those complex rules, but we have agreed 
that it is incumbent on the Inland Revenue to assist them 
in establishing when the employees of charities will be 
covered by the provisions.
<P>
Clause 61, which we discussed previously, dealt with 
travelling expenses and subsistence expenses, which will 
benefit the charitable sector and those who are posted 
overseas.
<P>
The hon. Member for Witney asked about consultation. 
He will understand but he may not agree that to 
consult with the charitable sector on changing the 
loophole could have led to its further exploitation. It was 
therefore impossible to have even limited discussions with 
the sector, although such discussions are now underway.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked whether clause 63 would 
require Voluntary Service Overseas to pay national 
insurance contributions. Those rules are unaffected by the 
proposed changes to FEDs.
<P>
I have made it clear that the Government see this as an 
issue of fairness. We are committed to building a modern 
tax system that is fair to all, not just to those 
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown (Cotswold):</B> Will the 
Financial Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Just let me finish. The system 
should not just be fair to those who escape income tax by 
travelling abroad. Those people rely on ordinary taxpayers 
who have to pay their share. I gave the example of 
someone who works abroad and who does not pay tax on 
the £87,600 the figure mentioned in one amendment 
that he earns, and a pensioner who receives a tenth of that 
income and who is liable to pay tax on that £8,760. That 
is not fair. The discrepancy is at the heart of the issue.
<P>
As for the issue of international competitiveness, the 
Government are assisting businesses by establishing 
economic stability and by cutting the main rate of 
corporation tax by two per cent. We are helping business. 
We do not want a badly targeted relief that is widely 
abused and which leaves the ordinary taxpayer to pick up the bill. I was asked about the retrospection issue. I 
explained that the abolition of FEDs means that any 
payments made after 17 March are liable. That needs to 
be clear.
<P>
Several questions were asked about bonuses. The hon. 
Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) will know 
that there is a standard form of ensuring that payments 
can be made in a qualifying period without paying tax. 
Fixed bonuses often go well beyond the employment 
period but are attributed back to the 365-day period 
abroad. The Government see that as a standard form of 
abuse. People may receive payments two, three or four 
years after the end of a contract. Any mechanism that 
allows that exploitation to continue is not acceptable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Fallon (Sevenoaks):</B> If there is 
widespread abuse stretching back months or years, the 
Financial Secretary could close off that fortnight by 
capping the date to the beginning of the subsequent tax 
year. The system is unfair because the bonus can be paid 
after 17 March but before the end of the same tax year 
and still lose out.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's 
point, but why should someone be paid a bonus on a 
contract that ended two, three or four years earlier, before 
the abolition of FEDs, and which is free of tax because it 
is covered by the qualifying period? That cannot be right. 
The hon. Gentleman said that surely there is a way to 
avoid that abuse, but there is not. It is a classic type of 
abuse. The idea of having a phasing out or transitional 
period with a qualifying period that is identified by 
contract leaves an opportunity for the abuse to continue. 
It is possible for people who are at the end of their 
working lives to receive a payment for a contract that 
ended a long time ago but which falls within the correct 
qualifying period. We cannot allow that.
<P>
Although the amendments acknowledge that the FED 
scheme is unfair, they want us to be partially unfair and 
allow this mechanism to continue with a cap, whether that 
is the figure of £100,000 proposed by the Liberal 
Democrats or £87,600 proposed by the Conservatives. 
The suggestion is that we should have a partial unfairness 
so that the rest of the taxpayers pick up only partially 
what is unfair although it still amounts to hundreds of 
millions of pounds that it is not their job to pay. 
Therefore, I ask the Committee to reject the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> If I can just conclude. When it 
comes to charities 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> That was the point I wanted to 
make.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Yes, I understand that, and I shall 
give way to the hon. Gentleman in a moment.
<P>
We need to make sure that charities do not have to rely 
on the exploitation of a loophole in tax law but are 
properly represented in the tax system millennium gift 
aid is an example of that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am grateful to the Financial 
Secretary for giving way. I hope that it will be worth her 
while.
<P>
Would she keep an open mind on the issue of charities 
being given a special exemption from FEDs, and if so, 
would she be prepared to receive further representations 
from charities, possibly in the form of a delegation before 
Report, in order to discuss the matter?



<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am not prepared to consider an 
exemption to FEDs for charities. The Government do not 
believe that that is an appropriate way in which to assist 
charities. However, the Government are conducting an 
extensive review and consulting with charities to ensure 
that they are fairly supported and encouraged by the tax 
system. I am sure that the hon. Member for Cotswold
(Mr. Clifton-Brown) would not want the very valuable 
work undertaken by charities to be underpinned by a tax 
loophole that is exploited by others. The main focus of 
the clause is to remove that injustice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton):</B> 
Will the Financial Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> No. I am conducting my remarks.
<P>
I have made it very clear that I will not consider an 
exception to the FED rules for charities. That position 
would be untenable. In leaving the exemption in place for 
seafarers, we are agreeing with the previous Government, 
who introduced the exemption about the strategic value 
and importance of supporting the Merchant fleet, 
particularly in terms of security.
<P>
In clutching at straws in order to defend a totally 
unjustifiable exemption from tax for one group of 
workers, Opposition Members are trying to undermine our 
arguments by saying that because overseas workers are 
caught by the clause, it is a full-frontal attack on charities. 
It is not. It is about fairness and UK residents being liable 
for UK income tax. The issues raised by charities have 
been dealt with and we have correspondence from the 
Charities Tax Reform Group. We shall continue to work 
with charities to ensure that they understand what reliefs 
are already available to them.
<P>
On that basis, I ask the Committee to reject the 
amendments and ensure that fairness in the tax system 
means fairness for everyone, not fairness for everyone 
except those who work abroad whom the Conservatives 
believe should be immune from tax.

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This might be the point at 
which to inform the Committee that, for the sake of 
conformity and because some people have chosen to enter 
the Room with their jackets off, anyone who wants to 
remove his jacket may do so.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): As we 
discovered this morning, this is a thoroughly bad clause, 
but it has been made a lot worse by the inadequacy of 
the Financial Secretary's reply to our lengthy debate this 
morning. She not only failed to answer many of the 
questions posed by my hon. Friends and others but missed 
the point of our amendments. She started by alleging that 
Conservative Members wanted to give tax relief to the 
very rich. Even if she had not listened to the debate, she 
should at least have read the amendments. The clear 
purpose of amendment No. 63 is to ensure that the 
restriction bites only on the very well paid and very well 
heeled who are allegedly taking advantage of a tax 
loophole. The purpose of the amendment is to exempt the 
more modest overseas contract workers who will be the 
victims of the clause.
<P>
The United States has a limit in recognition of the fact 
that anyone above the limit is probably taking advantage 
of tax avoidance measures and can be caught in the net 
and the need not to damage ordinary overseas workers. 
The United States also understands something that the 
Government do not that they have a duty to maintain the 
competitiveness of their overseas exporting and service 
industries. Most other countries will continue with the 
equivalent of a foreign earnings, deduction, but we shall 
not. We shall put our firms and industries at a massive 
disadvantage just at the time when the balance of 
payments deficit opens up.
<P>
The hon. Lady's main defence was that people based 
in the United Kingdom and citizens of this country should 
pay United Kingdom tax even when working abroad for 
long periods. She gave an example of pensioners who are 
settled here on modest incomes and asked why they 
should pay tax when someone working overseas does not. 
If that is her position, why is she not tightening the bigger 
loophole of exemption from United Kingdom tax by those 
who live abroad for more than a year during a tax period 
from April to April, which achieves non-resident status 
for United Kingdom taxpayers and, in the same way, 
exempts them from United Kingdom tax? If she believes 
that that is wrong, why is she doing nothing about it?
<P>
The practical effect of the clause will be to encourage 
the rich and well-advised to switch to the second option 
of being abroad for an entire tax year. They can do that 
because they can time their absence and their work abroad 
accordingly. That option is much more difficult for the 
army of consultants, teachers, nurses, engineers and aid 
workers whose contracts and aid programmes do not fit 
conveniently into a tax year. It is grotesque to suppose 
that aid workers should schedule their visits to disaster 
and famine areas to fit in with the fiscal requirements of 
the Inland Revenue, but that is what the hon. Lady is 
inviting them to do.



<P>
The hon. Lady's argument is based on a fallacy and an 
anomaly. The very people whom she wishes to target are 
those who will most easily take advantage of the second 
option, which remains available. Labour Members are 
against people failing to pay United Kingdom tax while 
remaining British citizens, but are doing nothing about it.
<P>
The issue of payments earned before 17 March but 
payable either as a bonus or otherwise after 17 March, 
which would therefore be subject to UK taxation, was 
raised by my hon. Friend the Members for East Worthing 
and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton) and other hon. Members. 
The Financial Secretary had no answer to give she 
simply said that she wanted a fairer tax system. What is 
fair about someone who is already on an overseas contract 
or tour, and who has already earned the money that will 
nevertheless be payable after the date of the Chancellor's 
Budget statement, becoming suddenly liable for full UK 
taxation?
<P>
The Financial Secretary said that it would be awfully 
unfair if remuneration were paid by way of bonuses. We 
gave her the example of the Rolling Stones overseas tour, 
on which the technicians and stagehands are paid, as part 
of their normal contract, a bonus based on the profits of 
the tour. Even the Treasury ought to be able to work out 
that the profits of the tour can be ascertained only once it 
is over. It is nothing to do with tax avoidance; it is a 
simple contractual arrangement whereby remuneration is 
properly based on something that can be calculated and 
paid only after the tour is over.
<P>
Despite the fact that that remuneration is to be suddenly 
liable for full UK taxation, the Financial Secretary claims 
that the clause is designed to achieve a fairer tax system; 
indeed, that phrase appears in the notes on clauses. It is 
grotesque to suppose that the retrospective application of 
tax in this way is anything other than unfair.
<P>
Opposition Members then raised the issue of 
competitiveness. I understand that that is chiefly the 
responsibility of the Department of Trade and Industry, 
but I would have hoped that Treasury Ministers would 
have consulted colleagues in other Departments, at least 
to make a gesture towards Britain's export effort and 
maintaining the competitiveness of United Kingdom 
firms. Such firms are based here but work overseas in the 
teeth of international competition.
<P>
It has already been made clear to Treasury Ministers 
that the European Union countries and the United States 
will continue the foreign earnings deduction. I shall quote 
from a letter from Posford Duvivier, which is based in 
Peterborough. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"European (and other countries) competitors all enjoy their 
national equivalent of Foreign Earnings Deduction, with qualifying 
periods which are all less than the UK's 365 days and there is no 
restriction related to the tax year. Thus they can keep their charges 
down, we will now have to increase our charges such that our costs 
will be 40 per cent. higher than our European competitors. This does 
not bode well for UK exporters."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That point has been made repeatedly. I shall quote from 
another letter, which was also written to the Treasury, 
from a firm based in Gateshead I presume that the 
Labour Member representing that constituency should 
have taken this up. It concludes:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I may be wrong but I have been under the impression that our 
Government had stated that they were to provide support and 
assistance to industry...I can now only assume that they are referring 
to foreign industry".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the reality of the Government's policy. They are 
undermining the very people who battle daily for British 
exports in world markets. The Financial Secretary did not 
even mention the issue of competitiveness in her reply.
<P>
The Financial Secretary was entirely dismissive about 
the issue of charities. She said that charities had an 
imperfect understanding of the matter. I do not think that 
that is true: the letter that we all received from the 
Charities Tax Reform Group is entirely factually accurate. 
It points out that charities have already been badly 
damaged to the tune of £400 million a year by the 
abolition of advance corporation tax. The last thing that it 
wanted was a further hammer blow in the form of the 
withdrawal of the foreign earnings deduction. It rightly 
points out that the only alternative for aid workers now is 
to establish non-UK residency for tax purposes. As I have 
already described, that means that they have to be away 
for a specific period that coincides with the tax year. It 
therefore refers, quite rightly, to anomalies such as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"two aid workers on one year contracts travelling overseas within a 
month of each other being treated totally differently for tax 
purposes."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a fact that the hon. Lady has not denied. If one 
worker achieves non-UK residency status and the other 
does not, one will be exempt from UK tax and the other 
will not, even though both do the same job in the same 
country, and both have travelled to that country within a 
month of each other. How can that be fair? How does that 
help the charitable efforts of those who relieve famine and 
other disasters abroad?
<P>
I therefore urge the hon. Lady to think again. If she 
cannot accept any of our amendments now, she should 
get in touch with her colleagues in the Department 
responsible for overseas aid, and in the Department of 
Trade and Industry, in order to produce some considered 
amendments on Report. As it stands, by removing the 
concession, the clause will miss the rich but will hit the 
less well off. It is grotesquely unfair, anomalous in 
practice, and anti-competitive at a time when we should 
be helping our overseas export effort. For those reasons I 
ask the hon. Lady to consider the concessions that we 
have suggested, if not now then at a future date.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I must apologise to the hon. Member for 
Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) for accusing him of heralding a 
Government climbdown. His was the first speech that I 
have heard from a Labour Member that opposes 
Government policy since I first entered the House. I pay 
tribute to his principled stand on the matter.
<P>
The Financial Secretary has failed to answer the main 
points of the debate. She said that the clause will bring 
fairness to the legislation. However, the notes on clauses 
state that the clause is intended to weed out specific tax 
avoidance techniques. They state that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"many of the main beneficiaries of FED have been media and 
entertainment personalities with very high incomes."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In paragraph 23 the document continues by stating that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Inland Revenue have clear evidence of systematic 
exploitation of FED. Various schemes are used to allow UK 
residents to roll up large amounts of income"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and then pay it during a period when an individual is 
outside the UK. Is the hon. Lady saying that the people 
whom we have been discussing nurses, teachers, 
consulting engineers and charity aid workers are 
involved in those schemes that systematically exploit 
FED? Is that what is happening? If so she should say so.
<P>
However, I doubt that that is the Inland Revenue's 
intention. The clause was introduced to tackle such abuse, 
but in such a way as inadvertently to catch those people 
to whom we have referred. It is a sledgehammer that has 
been accidentally used to crack a nut. The hon. Lady now 
claims that such people are systematically exploiting the 
tax system, and that they are intended to fall within the 
purview of the clause. If she does nto intend to include 
those people, why cannot she accept either of the 
amendments?



<P>
A person who leaves this country on 6 April 1998 and 
returns on 4 April 2000 who is away for two years less 
two days will not qualify for any of the reliefs from UK 
tax. However, a person who is away for one year, from 5 
April to 5 April, will qualify. How is that fair? It is an 
unfairness that has been introduced into the system. How 
is it to be ironed out? The Financial Secretary has failed 
to deal with any of the points about fairness. Her 
description of the clause as an attempt to make the tax 
system fairer was grotesque because the clause is so 
harmful.
<P>
The Financial Secretary also talked about residency. 
She said that the remaining loophole cannot be closed for 
international reasons. Someone who is outside the UK for 
a full year, from April to April, will be exempt from tax, 
whereas someone who is away for a year, but not from 
April to April, will not be. She said that that is because 
of international definitions of residency. I am sure that is 
true. However, in effect, she is saying that international 
law is protecting individuals who spend time abroad from 
further penal taxation that the Government would like to 
introduce, but cannot, thankfully, because international 
law provides some helpful definitions.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The hon. Lady does not seem to take any account of 
international competitiveness. What consideration has she 
given to the fact that, as my hon Friend the Member for 
Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) emphasised, other 
countries have more favourable tax regimes for their 
employees working abroad? She cited the 2 per cent. cut 
in corporation tax as a panacea for introducing 
competitiveness for UK companies, but failed to mention 
the £20 billion corporation tax burden imposed by the 
Government.
<P>
The Financial Secretary mentioned the double tax treaty 
regime, and said that where there is no double tax treaty, 
individuals will be entitled to unilateral relief and the 
Inland Revenue will be free and easy about using the 
non-taxable code. However, will she say what 
documentary evidence the Inland Revenue will require to 
enable those arrangements to be put in place, especially 
with regard to the payment of foreign tax?



<P>
As my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. 
Heathcoat-Amory) said, the Financial Secretary did not 
answer the question about bonuses paid after 17 March 
but relating to work carried out before 17 March. She said 
that it was, somehow, in order to avoid abuse of the 
system, but no abuse was possible before the clause was 
introduced. The date of 17 March 1998 was introduced in 
the Budget. If a contract was in place not finished, but 
commenced before the Budget was announced, how 
could there be any abuse? How could anyone deliberately 
draw up a contract with a payment to be made after
17 March if the contract was in place before the Budget?
<P>
The Financial Secretary did not deal with the issue that 
that is unfair for people who have worked abroad, in the 
knowledge that they will receive a bonus at the end of 
their contract which may be after 17 March and now 
find that the Inland Revenue has, retrospective, removed 
the tax relief to which they were legally entitled.
<P>
I now come to her attempt to answer my questions 
about the numbers of people who have benefited from 
FEDs. She said that the majority of people who have 
benefited from FEDs are those on "large salaries". I 
should like to know what she means by large salaries. She 
attacked me for using the phrase "high rollers" because 
the Taxes Act contains no definition of a high roller, but 
neither does it contain a definition of earners with very 
high incomes, referred to in the notes on clauses and 
Inland Revenue press release. We need some definitions, 
both of very high income earners and of large salaries. 
We need to know how many of the 20,000 to whom she 
referred are very high income earners according to the 
definition implied by the Inland Revenue when the notes 
on clauses were drafted for clause 63. Alternatively, we 
need to know what the Financial Secretary meant when 
she said "large salaries". Does she mean salaries 
commanded by overseas aid workers? Does she mean 
salaries commanded by teachers and nurses who work 
abroad? Let us have a definition and then let us see to 
how many of those 20,000 the definition applies.
<P>
Again, she gave no response to my question about how 
much of the £250 million that the Government hope to 
raise by this measure will be paid by entertainers on very 
high incomes and how much will be paid by ordinary 
people, such as teachers, engineers, nurses and aid 
workers working abroad.
<P>
The Financial Secretary also derided teachers very 
badly, I thought. In responding to the hon. Member for 
Kirkcaldy, she said that teachers do not qualify for the 
foreign earnings deduction because an academic year is 
not a full 12 months, and that teachers just swan about 
abroad solely in order to take advantage of this tax 
loophole. I am sure that teachers at the British Council 
who have benefited from the provision will write to the 
Financial Secretary expressing their anger at another slur 
on the British people who work abroad for average wages 
and who seek to claim tax reliefs to which they are 
entitled.
<P>
Finally, the Financial Secretary said that the 
Government would work closely with the Charities Tax 
Reform Group to come up with an agreed definition of 
what constitutes working abroad, in the hope of ensuring 
that no charity workers suffered under the clause. If that 
is the Government's intention, why cannot she simply 
accept the amendment? Its drafting is similar to that used 
to provide relief to seafarers.
<P>
The Financial Secretary's response was inadequate. I 
hope that she will give further consideration to the points 
that Opposition Members have made and that she will 
accept some or all of the amendments. She should at least 
respond to our points and return on Report with further 
thoughts.

<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey (Kingston and Surbiton):</B> Liberal 
Democrat Members are not satisfied with the Financial 
Secretary's answers. As the hon. Member for Bognor 
Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) said, many people 
who are on modest incomes will be hit by the clause, but 
the Financial Secretary failed to respond to that point. 
Many consultants may earn more than £100,000, but I 
certainly did not when I worked abroad. Many junior 
consultants spend a long time working abroad under tough 
conditions sometimes they help developing countries to 
build up their infrastructure and they earn significantly 
less than £100,000, but they will be severely hit by the 
proposal.



<P>
Administrative support staff who work in the UK, and 
who will lose their jobs as a result of the Government's 
proposal, certainly do not earn significant sums of money. 
As the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton 
said, charity workers, nurses and teachers will be hit. In 
her response, the Financial Secretary seemed to be trying 
to convince herself. She seemed to be convinced that 
many people working overseas in developing countries 
would not be affected by the proposal.
<P>
The Financial Secretary made a rather bizarre remark in 
her response to our amendment. She said that the Liberal 
Democrats intended to allow people to earn up to 
£200,000 a year tax free. That is certainly not our 
intention, and it is not, according to the advice that we 
have received, the likely effect of our amendment. If it 
would have that effect, I hope that she appreciates the 
spirit that lies behind it.
<P>
I assure the Financial Secretary that we are against 
creating an unfair tax system. At the last election, we 
advocated a higher tax rate of 50p in the pound on those 
earning more than £100,000. We want greater fairness in 
the tax system, but we do not think that the Government's 
proposal takes the tax system in that direction.
<P>
The Financial Secretary failed to respond to the 
concerns that I raised about the proposal's likely impact 
on the UK public purse. I cannot believe the Treasury's 
estimate that the proposal will yield more than £200 
million. Many of the businesses that will be affected will 
relocate elsewhere, which will undermine the Exchequer's 
revenues and the clause's intentions.
<P>
Listening to the Financial Secretary's response, I began 
to suspect that what lay behind the proposal was a 
Treasury orthodoxy to get rid of all export subsidies. The 
right hon. member for Wells said that many other 
countries chose to support their businesses in that way. A 
level playing field seems to be involved. However, as the 
right hon. Gentleman said, those subsidies if one wants 
to give them that title are not generous. If the 
Government's intention is to get rid of all remaining 
subsidies, what action will they take to convince other 
Governments to do likewise? If the Financial Secretary is 
really convinced that the subsidies are bad for business, 
is she discussing that matter with Ministers in other 
European Union countries?



<P>
We are extremely disappointed with the Financial 
Secretary's reply. It seems that the Treasury looked 
around to find as many loopholes as it could close. I 
believe that it wanted to hit the super rich by reforming 
the tax rules on residency but found that, because of 
international law, it could not. The Treasury had to turn 
to the next best thing. The problem is, however, that the 
next best thing will hit not the super rich but people in 
middle England who are on modest incomes. It does not 
seem like new Labour. My advice to the Financial 
Secretary is, "Don't tell Tony."
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This might be the appropriate 
moment to point out that this debate has gone on for some 
time. I understand that my co-Chairman explained that 
there would be no clause stand part debate. Hon. Members 
might want to bear that in mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaun Woodward (Witney):</B> Today is the second 
day of June. I fear that it will go down as the day when 
charity workers, nurses and teachers who work abroad 
were seen as second-class citizens in the eyes of this 
Government. I should like to be generous to the Financial 
Secretary. She has a considerable and proper interest in 
the charitable sector. I think that she will not agree to 
further consultation because she is simply doing the 
bidding of the civil servants in her Department. I hope 
that she is not expressing her own wishes.
<P>
We heard the Financial Secretary say that seafarers 
were an exception to the rule because they had strategic 
value and importance. She confirmed, however, that that 
could not be justified for or extended to those who worked 
abroad for charities or as teachers or nurses. Why not? 
We are told that it is matter of fairness; that we need to 
ensure that charity workers, nurses and teachers who work 
abroad are treated on the same level playing field as 
everyone else. But we must acknowledge that many of 
those people who go abroad, such as aid workers in the 
Sudan and Mozambique, live in appalling conditions. 
They go abroad not to earn a great deal of money but to 
fulfil their commitment to humanitarian projects. They 
often have to live in discomfort and sometimes in 
countries where the cost of living is different from our 
own. Although it is clear that those people are not doing 
the same job as everyone else who goes to those countries, 
it is, apparently, fair to treat them in the same way. But we 
rely on those people to be our humanitarian ambassadors 
around the world.
<P>
This is a sad day because the Financial Secretary will 
not give serious consideration to what is being said. She 
went to great lengths to outline the Government's 
position, but she has not explained it with fair 
justification. We had some hope this afternoon. We were 
led to believe that there would be scope for discussion or 
consultation between now and Report stage. Sadly, 
however, in response to my hon. Friend the Member for 
Cotswold, the Financial Secretary said that the Inland 
Revenue would have discussions with those charities to 
explain their position but she was not prepared to see a 
delegation to re-examine the appropriateness of the 
clause. I understand why the hon. Lady said that it might 
have been inappropriate to consult before publication of 
the Bill, but the Bill has now been published and we are 
debating the clause. There is time before Report to invite 
the charities to meaningful discussions. It may be that 
everything that the hon. Lady's officials have told her was 
right and that everything that every Opposition Member 
has been told by the charities is untrue and misleading. 
But if the hon. Lady were to discover from that meeting 
that there was a shred of truth in any of the humanitarian 
arguments that we have made, would not that meeting 
have been worthwhile?



<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The Government and the Minister believe profoundly 
in the importance of public consultation and that there is 
true merit in focus groups and trying to find out what the 
public want, so is there not true merit in exploring with 
those charities whether they have a case? If they have a 
case, this is a tax on human life because, as a result of the 
clause, charities will have to find money to fund their 
work abroad.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sure that hon. Members 
know the Standing Orders applying to the Committee and 
the arguments about repetition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am grateful to be reminded of that, 
Mrs. Dunwoody, but given the answers from the Financial 
Secretary, who has not been prepared to offer further 
consultation, we wish to press her to think again and to 
offer those charities the opportunity of explaining their 
position so that they may continue the work that all 
members of the House rightly value.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett (Torridge and West Devon):</B> The 
Financial Secretary, in response to points made by me and 
many others in the Committee today, suggested that there 
was no justification for providing a more favourable tax 
regime to those who work overseas and would, but for the 
clause, retain the foreign earnings deduction. She does not 
seem to grasp that a considerable sacrifice will be made 
by those who take overseas employment, not just people 
in business or commerce, but those who work for 
charitable organisations and so on. The clause has no 
impact on the wealthy, who can so order their affairs that 
they will continue to enjoy tax benefits. The clause will 
not affect them.
<P>
Do the Government want to encourage our export 
industries, our consultants and service industries? We are 
in an international marketplace with vigorous competition 
and our competitor countries offer similar tax advantages 
to those that are being brushed aside by the Government. 
Many who take up overseas employment do so in arduous 
and difficult conditions. They often work in unfamiliar 
countries, separated from their families. They pay a heavy 
price, which is one justification for providing them with 
a more favourable tax regime, which is enjoyed by almost 
all our competitor countries.
<P>
Individuals and companies on existing contracts will be 
affected and there is a retrospective element in the 
legislation. A post-Budget bonus paid in respect of 
pre-Budget services will be caught by taxation. That is 
retrospective taxation. I hope that the Financial Secretary 
will reconsider the clause in the light of the opinions 
expressed in Committee today.



<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn (Guildford):</B> What we have seen 
from the Government Front Bench this afternoon is a case 
of guilt by association. The Financial Secretary's thinking 
has been so infected by the activities of her senior 
colleague, the Paymaster General, that she has reached 
the conclusion that anyone who is active abroad must be 
involved in tax avoidance.
<P>
This is something of a slur on the efforts of those who 
go to work abroad. [Interruption.] I see that there is also 
a guilty conscience among the Financial Secretary's colleagues on the Government Benches. For many people, 
tax is the last reason why they go abroad; they go for 
the best of reasons in order to support charitable work or 
education projects.
<P>
It seems that the Government object to tax avoidance, 
apart from for the really, really rich, because we have 
heard how those people who are very rich will avoid the 
provisions. I want to ask another question, which deserves 
an answer although I fear that I will not get one. The 
Financial Secretary says that 30,000 people currently 
enjoy the benefits of FEDs and 20,000 people will lose 
the benefit as a result of withdrawing FEDs. What will 
happen to the other 10,000? Are they the 10,000 richest 
people, or has she worked out that they are the 10,000 
poorest? I believe that it is probably the richest people 
who will evade the provisions and the cost of £250 million 
will hit hard those who earn the least overseas.
<P>
My particular concern is for those who are in a gap 
year, either before or after university. Indeed, tomorrow, 
a Labour Member and I will attend the annual meeting of 
an organisation with which we are both involved, and I 
know that when we reach its headquarters in the 
Hebridean islands, we shall be asked what is happening 
about overseas volunteers. [Interruption.] We go far to 
support charitable endeavour overseas, and a short trip to 
the Hebridean islands is well justified in the case of 
people who will travel halfway across the globe.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not think that the Hebrides 
usually counts as overseas.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Some of them think it is overseas, but 
that is another story. Certainly, if one crosses the Tamar 
to Cornwall, plenty of people think of that as overseas.
<P>
The Financial Secretary must answer this point. From 
the experience of her child, she may know about gap year 
programmes where no money is paid in remuneration. 
Typically, such programmes are for a shorter period, 
perhaps three or six months, but it is generally recognised 
that, as valuable as that experience might be, a full 
12-month period in another country gives individuals a 
far greater appreciation of that country, and, of equal 
importance, enables them to make a much more 
meaningful contribution. It is precisely that group of 
people who will be especially hard hit by the clause 
without the benefit of our amendments because they will 
be abroad from one academic year to the next and will 
not be able to take advantage of the provisions that apply 
to residence abroad for a full tax year.



<P>
The Financial Secretary told us that she did not wish to 
consider charities because the subject was under review. 
May I remind her of the words of her colleague, the 
Economic Secretary to the Treasury, in our previous 
session on 21 May in relation to millennium aid.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We cannot go backwards, and 
we cannot keep going over the same ground. I hope that 
the hon. Gentleman will bear that in mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> This is a new point, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Oh good.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> We were discussing whether the 
problems of charities should wait for the Government's 
much heralded review. The Economic Secretary, who I 
am glad to see is sitting on the right of the Financial 
Secretary, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"it would be inappropriate...to delay the introduction of such a 
provision until that review was completed." [Official Report, 
Standing Committee E, 21 May 1998; c. 366.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If it was inappropriate to delay the millennium aid project, 
which we debated recently, why is it now appropriate to 
delay addressing the problems of these charities until the 
review has been undertaken? To do so would be complete 
hypocrisy, and it is time that the Financial Secretary 
recognised that she should be eating humble pie.
<P>
Those projects were based on the very educational 
objectives to increase literacy and the provision of 
education in the world's poorest countries that, in the 
Economic Secretary's own words, were "the Chancellor's 
main concern". If it is the Chancellor's main concern to 
increase the provision of education in such countries, why 
will the Financial Secretary not listen to our arguments 
and make some attempt to answer our questions about 
individuals who have had a one-year stay overseas? It is 
disappointing that those individuals I believe that there 
are many, which we would be able to confirm if the 
Revenue would be more forthcoming with its figures 
who pay small individual amounts of tax, which add up 
to a total of £250 million 



<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I wonder whether my hon. Friend 
has put this in context. The Government withdrew
£400 million from the charitable sector by abolishing 
ACT credits. I estimate, however, that the acceptance of 
the amendment would probably cost only £1 million or
£2 million, which is a totally different order of money.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. 
The limit of about £80,000 could perhaps be reduced to a 
much lower figure to target charity workers. The 
provision for charities in the amendment is technically 
difficult for the Treasury to administer, but the principle 
and the opportunity are clear. If the Government turn their 
back on the amendment, it will be a disgrace.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I shall not repeat the answers that I 
have already given to these questions. Opposition 
Members cannot answer this question: why should people 
who are UK residents not pay tax? They refer continually 
to the issue of charities, especially with regard to overseas 
workers. Many people on low incomes work for UK 
charities in this country and pay tax. They do not receive 
an exemption. Why do Opposition Members consider that 
domestic charities are less important? They have been told 
repeatedly that foreign earnings deduction has been 
exploited and that it was not introduced to assist charities. 
It has been necessary to ensure and we are doing so 
that charities are fully appraised of the relief to which 
they are entitled within the tax system, especially that 
applying to their overseas workers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Will the Financial Secretary give 
way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> No, I will not. The issue is not the 
undervaluing of charity; it is whether charities should be 
funded by loopholes. This Government do not believe that 
they should. We do not believe that there is a problem in 
relation to FEDs and overseas workers on the scale that 
the hon. Gentleman claims.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Will the Financial Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> No. This has been a long debate. 
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton 
asked one further question. I can write his speeches for 
him. They always start with the fact that as I do not agree 
with him, everything I say is absolute rubbish. He asked 
about documentary evidence and what the Inland Revenue 
would require where foreign tax was paid. If the employer 
is required to deduct foreign tax, it is sufficient for the 
employer to inform the Inland Revenue that he is doing 
that. The relief will immediately be given. That is quite 
explicit.
<P>
Finally, it is not the Government's fault that the Liberal 
Democrats do not understand what their amendment does. 
They do not understand that their 12-month period could 
extend across two tax years and therefore give a double 
relief, as would the Conservatives' amendment with their 
£87,600. The Liberal Democrats then said that they did 
not really mean that and asked us to help them out some 
other way. They must answer the question why people 
should no pay tax when they are UK residents but have 
not done so. I ask the Committee to reject the 
amendments.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon: I sense that the Committee wants to come </B><P>
to a decision on the debate. I want to sum up our response 
in respect of amendment No. 174.
<P>
There are a number of possible explanations for the 
stand that the Financial Secretary has taken. First, she 
possibly believes that there has been systematic 
exploitation by charities of the foreign earnings deduction. 
Those are the words in the notes on clauses and she has 
now extremely offensively confirmed that. She said that 
charities should not longer be "funded by loopholes". I 
am beginning to think that she believes that charities have 
been systematically exploiting the foreign earnings 
deduction. If she does not, perhaps she would indicate 
that.
<P>
Secondly, it is entirely possible that the Financial 
Secretary did not understand the implications of the clause 
for the charities themselves, that she was sold the clause 
by her officials and did not check it with the Department 
for International Development, just as she did not check 
the damage to exporters with the Department of Trade 
and Industry. I am beginning to think too that she did not 
understand the implications of the clause for the charity 
world.
<P>
Thirdly, it is possible that she simply does not care 
about the effect of the clause on British charities. We had 
a glimpse of that. Seafarers are to be exempt from the 
clause for ever because they are of strategic value and importance. In other words, a reasonably well-paid officer 
in the Merchant Marine will continue to be exempt 
because he is of strategic value and importance, whereas 
a low-paid charity worker going out on a contract to help 
with famine relief is not of strategic value and importance. 
If those are the values of the Financial Secretary and this 
Government, I certainly urge the Committee to reject 
them.

<B>Hon. Members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is very nice that the hon. 
Gentleman has brought his fan club with him.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Whittingdale (Maldon and East Chelmsford):</b> I assure you, Mrs. Dunwoody, that it was 
not prearranged.
<P>
The clause is not quite as pernicious and harmful as 
clause 63, so I do not intend to spend as much time 
debating it. However, I am worried about some aspects, 
which I hope that the Financial Secretary will tackle.
<P>
Clauses 64 to 69 seek to tighten the provisions for the 
payment of non-cash benefits to employees to ensure that 
they are not used to avoid PAYE. We are happy to accept 
that principle because it was originally enshrined in the 
Finance Act 1994. Bonus and salary enhancements in the 
form of gold bars or cases of vintage claret, which were 
reported in 1994, are unacceptable as a means of 
avoiding tax.
<P>
The Government claim that clause 65 seeks to close a 
loophole that is created by confusion about whether an 
asset is tradeable, and whether trading arrangements exist, 
or are likely to exist in future. It provides a comprehensive 
definition of "readily convertible asset". I am intrigued 
by the examples in the explanatory notes of assets that 
employers provide as a form of income. They include 
reversionary interests in offshore trusts the Paymaster 
General must be involved in giving advice about them 
oriental carpets and platinum sponge. Will the Financial 
Secretary tell me what a platinum sponge is? I am willing 
to continue, provided that she receives some in-flight 
refuelling.
<P>
I would be grateful if the Financial Secretary would 
address legitimate concerns raised by the clause. The 
Institute of Directors points out that the definition of 
trading arrangements is extremely broad and may include 
almost any item which might be sold second-hand at a 
future date at a car-boot sale or through an advertisement 
in a local newspaper.
<P>
There is no requirement to show that the existence of 
trading arrangements influenced the chosen method of 
remuneration. As a result, the transfer of almost any asset 
of any kind may be deemed by the Revenue to be for the 
purposes of tax avoidance. That may be extremely useful 
for the Revenue, but it goes beyond the clause's avowed 
purpose of countering tax avoidance.
<P>
The Institute of Chartered Accountants highlighted an 
additional problem. By extending PAYE to new classes 
of benefit in kind, the tax due may easily exceed an 
employee's monthly earnings. If that happens, it is not 
clear whether the employer has a right to recover the tax 
from the employee. Clause 65 states that employers are 
obliged to levy PAYE.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"on the basis of the best estimate that can reasonably be made".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clearly, that requires an extremely subjective view, and it 
may well be challenged by the Revenue in any 
subsequent audit.
<P>
Our anxiety about that is especially great in relation to 
the valuation of shares in private companies. It may well 
be the intention of a private company to become a 
publicly quoted company over the course of the following 
years. That will be set out in the company's business plan, 
but it is not clear what point preparations for a flotation 
must have reached for employee share benefits to be 
viewed as what is described in the clause as assets
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"for which trading arrangements are likely to come into existence".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That must be clarified. A procedure is needed under which 
employees can obtain rapid rulings from the Inland 
Revenue.
<P>
Many unquoted companies make provision for a 
flotation, even when one is not planned. Shares can then 
be sold to a person who purchases shares by arrangement 
or to a unit trust. It is not clear whether those procedures 
could be viewed as trading arrangements which exist or 
are likely to come into existence. Will the Financial 
Secretary clarify that point and assure the Committee that 
those procedures will not be subject to taxation under 
the clause?
<P>
We do not intend to vote against the clause, as its 
underlying principles seem to be sensible. However, I 
have expressed legitimate anxieties, and I hope that the 
Financial Secretary can provide me with reassurance on 
the points that I have raised.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I welcome the hon. Gentleman's 
first speech in his new role as shadow Treasury 
spokesman. I too was intrigued by the question of the 
platinum sponge. It is odd that people might be paid in 
such material, but I am told that platinum in suspension 
is a liquid which is used in catalytic converters. It is 
costly, much sought after and is convertible into cash. 
That point is covered by all the clauses, although the hon. 
Gentleman settled on clause 65. He realised that I would 
point out that in 1994 when the Conservatives were in 
power, they introduced legislation in the Finance Bill to 
deal with the specific problem of people being paid in an 
asset that was easily convertible into cash, thus avoiding 
the requirements for PAYE.
<P>
In December 1996, the former Shadow Chancellor,
the right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden
(Mr. Lilley) then Secretary of State for Social Security 
now the deputy leader of the Conservative party took 
the matter further. His press release warned that shares 
were not a dodge option. He pointed out that paying staff 
in company shares to avoid in that case national 
insurance was the latest dodge on which the then 
Conservative Government wanted to clamp down.
<P>
The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford has 
rightly pointed out that clause 65 and its sister clauses 
require an employer to operate PAYE when taxable 
income is provided to an employee in the form of an asset 
that can be readily converted to cash. We could avoid 
having to provide the clauses if employers paid employees 
in cash. We might ask why employees were paid in gold 
bars, or hay, or platinum sponge in the past. We must 
ensure that there is no avoidance of PAYE.
<P>
The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford 
asked about the best estimate that could reasonably be 
made about the levying of PAYE. The employer will 
decide. The employer will have a view about the value of 
the asset that will be given to employees as a substitute 
for cash as will the employees, when they fill out their 
self-assessment forms.
<P>
The employer will be expected to decide on the value 
of assets that are readily convertible to cash. The Revenue 
will oversee such matters, but the employer will know the 
value of what he or she gives the employee. That is part 
of the deal and it is reasonable that employers should 
inform us of that estimate and that we should take their 
word.
<P>
If it was shown subsequently that an asset was worth 
£10 million and had been valued at only £10,000, the 
Revenue would speak to the employer about this or her 
lack of directness and about the accuracy of the 
information that had been declared.
<P>
The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford 
referred to the definition of trading arrangements and the 
understanding of what would lead to a trading 
arrangement. He observed that the definition was 
imprecise and could apply to all assets. That is not the 
case. The measures have been carefully crafted. PAYE 
will apply only when there is an arrangement or an 
understanding that will enable the employee to turn the 
asset readily into cash. That is crucial. It is the point of 
the clauses.
<P>
If an employer is in doubt about the provisions, he or 
she will be able to consult the inland Revenue. The 
Revenue is always prepared to give employers advice 
about the interpretation of regulations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> What will be the form of the advice? 
Will it take the form of a pre-transaction ruling?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> No, the employer will ask the Inland 
Revenue for advice on the particular interpretation that 
the Revenue would put on the legislation. There will be 
no ruling, but general advice will be offered.
<P>
We should not make a mountain out of a molehill. We 
are dealing with cases in which employers provide an 
asset that is readily convertible into cash to avoid 
obligations under PAYE. These clauses, with which the 
Opposition agree in principle, will ensure that when an 
asset is readily convertible into cash, a PAYE obligation 
will have to be met. The employer will know full well 
what the value of the asset is because it will be provided 
instead of cash as payment for a contract, a service or 
employment.
<P>
There is no reason to interfere in the relationship 
between an employer and an employee. The hon. Member 
for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale) 
asked about the tax consequences of a particular 
transaction and it is up to the employer and the employee 
to agree on what they want to do. If they want to avoid 
the problem, the employer can pay the employee in cash, 
in which case the requirements in the clauses would not 
be necessary.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman said that the new measure of the 
amount on which PAYE is operated is unworkable and 
will create problems. I disagree. The provision will be 
straightforward, not least because employers know what 
they want to put into their employees' hands. They will 
have a good idea of what an asset is worth. Therefore, 
they will consider what it costs and any contribution made 
by the employee to that cost.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also asked a specific question 
about shares awarded in advance of flotation. PAYE is 
due on shares in a company that plans to float and has 
taken meaningful steps towards flotation. For example, it 
may have instructed brokers, merchants and others about 
its intentions. When a company has done less than that, a 
desire to float will not be enough to trigger the PAYE 
obligations.
<P>
When there is clear evidence that an asset is being 
given that is readily convertible to cash and the employer 
and employee know that, such a transaction will be caught 
by the clause. If they want to avoid the provisions in the 
clauses and not have the obligation to make an 
assessment, my advice is, "Pay your employee in cash." 
Normal PAYE obligations will then apply.
<P>
Unfortunately, these clauses are necessary because 
some people seek to avoid their PAYE obligations. Like 
the previous Government, this Government consider that 
unacceptable. I therefore urge the Committee to support 
the clause.

<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> The Financial Secretary said that it 
would always be open to a company to pay its employees 
in cash if it wished to avoid such problems. That is 
certainly true when it is obvious that the gift of non-cash 
benefits is being made simply to avoid the payment of 
tax. In those circumstances, we have no difficulty with 
the clause.
<P>
My concerns relate to cases in which gifts are 
interpreted by the Revenue as a means of avoiding tax 
when they are not given with that aim in mind. The 
Financial Secretary has gone some way to dealing with 
my concerns. I am grateful for her remarks which will be 
studied by those organisations that have expressed those 
concerns. Given that I do not intend to press them any 
further we are willing to accept the clause.

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I have one quick question for the Economic 
Secretary. Subsection (2) states that section 298(4) of the 
Taxes Act 1988 shall be amended and that the Treasury 
may by order amend section 293. Why do the Government 
wish to give the Treasury a new power by statutory 
instrument to amend section 293 as well as section 297?
<P>
<B></B><P>
The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Helen 
Liddell): I am not clear what point the hon. Gentleman is 
making as to why one clause is chosen rather than another. 
I will get back to the hon. Gentleman about that.

<H4><center>EIS and VCTs: meaning of qualifying trade</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton (East Worthing and Shoreham):</B>
I beg to move amendment No. 123, in page 208, line 34, 
at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`unless the property on which that activity takes place is not owned 
by the qualifying company'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not need to detain the Committee for long on this. It 
is a probing amendment concerning property not owned 
for enterprise investment schemes. I appreciate that the 
Government's intention, as with the business expansion 
scheme which preceded the EIS, is that relief should be 
concentrated on higher risk situations. The previous 
changes to the forerunner of the scheme were largely 
down to potential abuses of the scheme by property-based 
companies such as hotel companies and property trading 
companies. If those companies got into difficulties, they 
could use those property assets as collateral for backing 
the company which gave a great deal of investor 
protection and did not lead to higher risks for investors.
<P>
There are problems with the exclusions which the 
Government have added to the schedule. For example, 
there is an anomaly that hotel companies cannot occupy 
the property which they may be managing with their own 
workers. Also there are wild fluctuations in agricultural 
product prices which lead one to categorise them as 
high-risk situations. One would also take issue yet again 
with the powers contained in the schedules to amend 
primary legislation by order in clauses 72 and 73.
<P>
Of the five excluded activities, one can make a case for 
property companies, hotels, nursing homes and forestry as 
having a connection with collateral assets which are of a 
low risk. But that is not necessarily the case for market 
gardening. That is why I have tabled the amendment. I 
specifically want to flag up the plight of the mushroom 
farmer. [Laughter.] That causes some mirth on the 
Government Benches but they are used to being kept in a 
dark place and having dirt shovelled on them so it is a 
dilemma to which they can relate.
<P>
Members of the Mushroom Growers Association would 
take issue with their classification as market gardeners. 
They view themselves as horticultural businesses. I should 
be interested to hear from the Economic Secretary 
whether mushroom farmers will be covered by the term 
"market gardener". I think that they, too, will be interested 
to know that.
<P>
Many market gardeners and mushroom farmers do not 
own the property on which they carry out their activity. 
Mushroom farmers do not own the land or buildings used 
to produce mushrooms. They rent that land or, in the case 
of mushrooms, a dark, climate-controlled building. 
Mushroom farmers produce pasteurised compost from 
organic sources on rented land. It is an environmentally 
friendly activity which we do not want the Government to 
discriminate against. The mature mushrooms produce 
amazingly, I think 2 billion spores in just four days. The 
spores are then planted. It takes nine to 12 weeks from 
the preparation of the compost to the mushrooms hitting 
the road ready for shipping and market.
<P>
The practice has been going on for many years and I 
shall not detain the Committee with the history of it. 
[Hon. Members: "Shame."] Well, it goes back to the stone 
age. On a commercial basis, mushroom farming started in 
France in the 17th century and it became big in the United 
States, which this year celebrates the 102nd anniversary 
of mushroom cultivation there. Mushroom farming is
also important in this country, where it accounts for
£160 million of business.
<P>
The amendment would also affect fruit growers and 
tomato growers, who grow their crops under glass houses. 
They face great competition from the continent and 
Mediterranean countries, where it is climatically more 
economical and easier to grow market garden produce. 
Will the Government consider making an exclusion for 
those market gardening operations, including mushroom 
farmers, who do not own the land on which their business 
takes place? As that land cannot be considered an asset or 
used as collateral to back up a business if it hits hard 
times, will the Government remove them from the list of 
exclusions in the schedule?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I cannot resist drawing the Committee's 
attention to the fact that the soup of the day in the 
Members Tea Room is cream of mushroom.
<P>
There is a fundamental difference of understanding 
between myself and the hon. Gentleman. I acknowledge 
that he has tabled his amendment in good faith, but we 
must go back a stage and consider the purpose of the 
enterprise investment scheme. It was established to 
encourage high-risk, often high-technology, investment. 
The difficulty that this Government and the previous 
Administration faced was how to target the enterprise 
investment scheme sufficiently and pointedly to ensure 
that it had an impact on specific businesses.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman may be surprised to know that 
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Will the Economic Secretary give 
way?
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mrs. Liddell: If I may expand this point, I shall happily 
give way to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
I have some knowledge of the difficulties that 
mushroom growers experience. [Interruption.] My 
apologies, Mrs. Dunwoody. My instinct, I am afraid, is to 
turn towards the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Prior to become a Member of this House, I was 
involved in a company that assisted small businesses to 
start up. One attractive small business in areas of high 
unemployment, especially in the north of Ireland, was 
mushroom growing. I have to say, however, that 
mushroom growing is not high tech, and that limits how 
the EIS operates.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> If the hon. Lady is not going to 
exclude mushroom growers from the provisions of 
paragraph 1(1), why will the restrictions and limits in 
paragraph 1(3), which apply to hotels, nursing homes and 
residential homes, not apply to mushroom growers and to 
other market gardeners?



<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman is obviously 
anxious to speed the committee along. We shall come to 
that matter in a couple of minutes.
<P>
It is useful to begin by examining the purpose of the 
enterprise investment scheme. The amendment would 
preserve access to the EIS for some farming and market 
gardening companies, and it contains a real danger it 
would put the EIS totally out of kilter with venture capital 
trusts, because the amendment relates exclusively to the 
EIS. No doubt the hon. Gentleman has his reasons for 
taking that course.
<P>
Similarly, the hon. Gentleman's amendment contains 
no definition of ownership and no distinction is drawn 
between freehold and leasehold. The Government and the 
courts might agree that a company owns its land, but it 
would be easy for those owners to sidestep the rules by 
transferring ownership to someone else. That is a 
well-known practice. There is no point in trying to apply 
a rule that fails to stand up even to that cursory scrutiny.
<P>
The hon. Members for East Worthing and Shoreham 
and for Guildford discussed the exclusion of hotels and 
nursing homes. Those exclusions apply only to the 
company that owns or occupies the property. The hon. 
Member for Guildford understandably asked why the 
rules should not also apply to other excluded activities. 
We are concerned that without the rule it might be 
possible for hotel or nursing home companies to split off 
their management and operational functions to get around 
the exclusion. We want to ensure that the companies that 
provide contributory services, including specialist 
services, are not caught by the rule. Those services could 
play a substantial role in the running of an hotel or nursing 
home without amounting to occupation.
<P>
I cannot say too strongly that the schedule's provisions 
are precisely focused to ensure that the EIS, venture 
capital trusts and the trading companies that they invest in 
carry on high risk activities. It is broadly acknowledged, 
especially in relation to small and medium-sized 
enterprises, that risk aversion is high. Those companies 
that are at the cutting edge or that are start-ups have 
difficulties raising cash. that is why successive 
Governments have acknowledged that special schemes are 
needed to assist them. The purpose of the EIS and of 
VCT and of the schedule is therefore clear. However, 
any tax incentive costs the Exchequer, and we must ensure 
that we get value for that money by properly targeting the 
neediest companies, namely those that cannot generally 
gain access to funding.
<P>
I am afraid that I cannot accept that farming and 
mushroom growing and the other activities that the hon. 
Member for Guildford mentioned fall into that category. 
When the Conservative party was in government, it took 
exactly the same view in relation to the business 
expansion scheme. In 1984, the Conservative government 
made similar exclusions to the scheme. The hon. 
Gentleman will not therefore be surprised to discover that 
I cannot accept the amendment, and I urge the Committee 
to reject it.

<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful for the Economic

point. However, I remain unconvinced that exceptions 
cannot be made for such specific cases. I was unaware 
that the qualification applied primarily to high-tech 
companies. When we discuss schedule 13 we might go 
into the matter in a little more detail. She might confirm 
that mushroom farming comes under the heading of 
market gardening. That would not be good news for the

<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I have a small point of clarification 
with which I would like the Economic Secretary to deal. 
We are told that clause 71 is a targeting measure for the 
enterprise investment scheme that will exclude from the 
scheme the disposal of shares at a future date, and which 
will be set in place at the time that shares are issued. She 
may be aware of the Institute of Chartered Accountants' 
observation that private companies often make general 
statements of intent about the future seeking of public 
listing on the stock exchange. The institute has requested 
that she confirm that such a statement of general intent 
will not amount to an arrangement under the terms of 
the clause.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Did you wish to speak, Mr. Ruffley?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I was going to make exactly the same 
point.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Such self-discipline. I call Mrs. Liddell.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The definition of arrangements is the 
same as that used for the relevant investment rules. I am 
not aware that that has caused any difficulties in the past. 
Investors may want to know how directors envisage the 
ultimate realisation of their investments. Nothing in the 
Bill will prevent the indication of possible routes. I hope 
that that answers the hon. Gentleman's point.
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 66, in 
page 212, line 39, leave out "seven" and insert
"three".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the 
following amendments:
<P>
No. 67, in page 213, line 5, leave out `seven' and 
insert `three'.
<P>
No. 68, in page 213, line 6, leave out `two' and insert 
`one'.
<P>
No 69, in page 213, line 7, leave out `five' and insert 
`two'.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The purpose of the amendments is 
straightforward. They seek to ensure that those who have 
a clear knowledge and understanding of a business, but 
who are not directly involved in its current running, have 
the opportunity to make an investment in it. We fully 
accept the principle behind the schedule, which aims to 
ensure that those who run a business cannot pay 
themselves higher fees or dividends, and recycle that 
money through the EIS scheme into the company in which 
they work. That arrangement would be open to abuse, 
which none of us wants to see.
<P>
However, those who have recently been involved with 
a small company may have valuable knowledge to impart 
to it. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody, for the 
firm hand that you are showing this afternoon.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. In case there should be any 
doubt, my hand has been of the same power throughout 
my career.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Schedule 13 would be improved if 
directors with knowledge of the business could take a 
financial interest in it once they had stepped down and 
were no longer in a position to abuse the system. It is 
difficult for many small businesses to obtain good advice. 
Often, the reason why they do not succeed is because they 
do not have access to such advice.
<P>
The schedule is too restrictive. Given the broad way in 
which it will be interpreted and the aspect of connected 
parties, a seven-year barrier around the company may 
prevent investment in small firms by those who have a 
tangential relationship with the company but not one that 
enables them to exploit the rules unfairly. That is why we 
suggest that a much shorter break, both before and after 
investment, is appropriate.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> It is interesting to hear Opposition 
Members arguing for fundamental change to a rule that 
was introduced by the Conservative Government in 1981 
in connection with the business start-up scheme. The rule 
was retained when the business expansion scheme was 
introduced two years later, and it was further retained 
when the enterprise investment scheme was introduced in 
1994. Obviously, we recognise a winner when we see 
one the rule has a very important purpose.
<P>
Although I am mocking the hon. Member for Guildford 
in a light-hearted way, I know where he is coming from. 
However, he must bear in mind the scheme's purpose 
which is to make sure that income tax relief for venture 
capital investment is available only to those investors who 
are not connected with the company, other than to 
someone who is a business angel director for a reasonably 
long period. The issue is the attraction of new money into 
companies to ensure that they do not just recycle money.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman should also bear it in mind that 
the outside investor carries a much heavier risk because 
the outside investor cannot exercise any control over the 
company's affairs. That may put his money at a higher 
risk. The relief is intended to act as an incentive. I know 
many business angels, especially in the west of Scotland, 
who provide an invaluable service to companies but, in 
some cases, take an extraordinary high risk. This 
provision is aimed at helping them to cope with that risk.
<P>
The current rules deny EIS income tax relief to an 
individual who is connected with the company or has been 
connected with the company in the two years before the 
investment or five years after the investment was made. 
If the company is not incorporated, the three-year rule 
comes into account at the date of incorporation.
<P>
In schedule 13, we are seeking to standardise that rule. 
It is a comparatively minor amendment, which would start 
the clock running two years before the share issue in every 
case. It is an attempt to correct a minor defect in the 
current rule, which would enable an individual to qualify 
for relief if, before the EIS company's incorporation, he 
or she controlled the company which later became a 
subsidiary of the EIS, to give an opportunity for someone 
to receive benefits in that way.
<P>
The seven-year rule has served its purpose for some
17 years and I cannot see any reason for jettisoning it in 
favour of a three-year period that would enable people to 
obtain valuable tax relief in return for putting their money 
at risk for as little as two years. Those who take a 
considerable risk must have some incentive for doing so.
<P>
There are serious defects in the amendments. 
Amendment No. 67 is inconsistent with the other three 
amendments in this group because it would provide for a 
three-year period to be called a five-year period and 
would leave references to a seven-year period in the 
clause. We would have an unholy fankle in the middle of 
the clause.
<P>
I return to the point that I made earlier. The purpose of 
the provision is to ensure that relief is available for those 
who take a higher risk because they do not have a direct 
connection with the company and cannot have the degree 
of protection for their money that they might have if they 
were involved in the day-to-day running of the company.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am disappointed with the comments 
of the Economic Secretary. It is a long time since 1981 
and we all know that when the original incentives for 
investing in small companies were introduced they were 
hemmed in in all sorts of ways by the worries of the 
Inland Revenue and it took a long time for such schemes 
to take root. They are very much to the credit of the 
previous Conservative Government because they have 
been so successful and filled a gap in the market that 
sorely needed to be filled. None the less, it is precisely 
because the rule has existed for so long that it is worth 
reconsidering. If the period cannot be seven years, whey 
can it not be 10 years or 15 years? It is logical to have a 
time limit and the Government should consider whether 
the present limit is too long, particularly as they are 
making it even less attractive in other ways for those 
outside businesses to invest in them. They are increasing 
the risks and removing the incentives for those with some 
knowledge of the business. As the Economic Secretary 
said, there is in some ways a reduction of the risk 
involved, but it is always very considerable. It is 
regrettable that she has shied away from the opportunity 
of moving forward on the definition. I beg to ask leave to 
withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 137, 
in page 213, line 45, leave out `£10 million' and insert 
`£20 million'.
<P>
I should declare a possible interest in that I am a 
director of a merchant bank which has dealings in 
alternative investment market stocks. I am personally the 
holder of a still-going business expansion scheme and 
director of a small, very high tech internet company which 
has sought venture capital to promote it. I am taking 
precautions in declaring those additional interests at this 
stage.
<P>
The enterprise investment scheme was designed, as the 
notes on clauses state,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to help higher-risk, unlisted trading companies raise start-up and 
expansion finance by the issue of ordinary shares to individual 
investors".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I question whether the targeting which is the intention 
of this part of the schedule will in fact be achieved. I 
contend that the schedule will achieve the reverse, hence 
my amendment. I am particularly concerned with the 
effects on the alternative investment market of the 
changes being made by the Economic Secretary.
<P>
We are discussing the size of qualifying companies. 
The schedule also refers to the issue of qualifying only 
for new shares. That is an equally important issue, which 
will be dealt with elsewhere.
<P>
The alternative investment market for hon. Members 
who are not fully cognisant of its uses was launched in 
June 1995. It currently consists of over 300 companies 
covering 28 different sectors, and has a market 
capitalisation of more than £6 billion. It is not a small, 
casino-type operation; it is an important part of the 
London stock market.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
More than 140 companies have raised capital on 
admission to the alternative investment market, and 66 
have subsequently returned to raise further capital in 
excess of £1 million. The alternative investment market 
plays an important role as a stamp of approval for the 
commercial credibility of many of the companies quoted 
on it. Sixty per cent. of currently quoted AIM companies 
are profitable and, on average, their pre-tax profit growth 
has been in excess of 15 per cent. over the last few years. 
They are highly successful, high-grade companies.
<P>
The AIM market is fairly simple to join and has fairly 
reasonable floating costs. It offers a good way for 
companies to grow, recruit new staff and retain existing 
staff by offering them shares when they became quoted 
AIM companies. Many AIM companies have many staff 
shareholders among their ranks.
<P>
The whole AIM and the EIS schemes are linked to the 
venture capital industry, which is uniquely devoted in this 
country to the creation, development and revitalisation of 
unquoted small and medium-sized enterprises. The AIM 
is an important after-market for venture capita. One 
million people in the UK are employed by companies 
using venture capital, which constitutes 5 per cent. of 
private sector employment, a figure that has increased 
greatly over the past 10 years.
<P>
Almost 90 per cent. of those companies would not have 
existed or grown or would have grown more slowly 
without the use of venture capital. That growth has been 
promoted on entry to the AIM. The Economic Secretary 
will be interested to know if she did not know already 
that information technology is one of the largest sectors 
in the AIM. In the information technology sector in 
general including quoted companies 32 of the 99 
quoted stocks are AIM stocks. Almost a third of those 
have joined the AIM in the past six months. Other big 
sectors in the AIM including publishing, oil exploration 
and pharmaceuticals. They include the great companies 
of the future that will provide employment for people in 
this country.
<P>
The AIM is therefore working well. This schedule, 
however, threatens to wreck the AIM. That threat is in 
relation to the value of companies' criteria and the 
limitation to new share issues.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not want to stop the flow 
of the hon. Gentleman's speech, but he will be aware that 
the reading of speeches is not permitted in Committees. I 
am sure that he is just using his notes to refresh his 
memory.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful, Mrs. Dunwoody. I am 
glancing occasionally at some figures that I have noted 
down at a few moments' notice. Under this schedule, 
reinvestment relief will in future be restricted to new share 
issues with a gross balance sheet asset qualification of less 
than £10 million. The point behind my amendment is that 
£10 million is woefully low and out of touch with the 
nature of the companies that will be affected.
<P>
The schedule also lays something of a trap. To have a 
full listing on the London stock market, companies will 
need a market capitalisation of £75 million. A trap 
therefore lies between the companies that fall below the 
£10 million qualification investors in those companies 
will qualify for tax relief and those companies that will 
be able to appeal to a much broader church of investors 
through a full listing on the London stock market.
<P>
I may be pitching my aim rather low no pun intended 
but the sum could be larger than the £20 million suggested 
in the amendment. I shall be interested in what the 
Economic Secretary has to say about that, in the light of the 
recent talks that her officials have had with the stock 
market.
<P>
I know that market capitalisation is not the strict 
criterion used in this regard, but it offers a better gauge 
of the gross asset test with which we are faced. Is gross 
valuation to involve the valuation of all assets, including 
those, such as good will and trademarks, that do not 
appear on the balance sheet? What about those companies 
whose very large mortgages bump up their market 
capitalisation?
<P>
About half of the companies quoted in AIM have a 
market capitalisation of more than the £10 million 
specified in the Bill, and many have substantially more. 
The alternative investment market places no restriction on 
the size of companies that may join it. The very healthy 
aftermarket that has existed in the past is essential for the 
future of the alternative investment market and for new 
companies joining it.
<P>
The stock exchange has warned that a third of 
AIM-listed companies could face liquidity problems as a 
result of this Bill and that the demand for such higher-risk, 
smaller companies would fall as a result. Already, the 
stock exchange has claimed and I have no reason to 
disbelieve it that, since the provisions were announced 
in the Budget, shares that previously qualified for tax 
breaks have underperformed by as much as half those that 
previously did not qualify. So it is clear that the provisions 
have the potential to create a two-tier system in the 
alternative investment market, and we know how neurotic 
the Government are about such systems in public services. 
Any restriction on new shares will make AIM very 
irregular for investors, as those new shares will be 
available only for short periods. I hope that you, Mrs. 
Dunwoody, will allow me to name some success stories 
among companies that would have been hit if the 
proposals had been introduced earlier.
<P>
One such success story involves a company called 
Tracker Network. It has done so well that it has moved 
up to a full listing on the London stock market, with a 
market capitalisation in excess of £52 million. It is not a 
fly-by-night, casino operation run by some Arthur Daley 
figure. Tracker Network helps in this country's fight 
against crime.
<P>
Briefly, the company spent many millions of pounds 
and many years on research into a device that can be 
placed in cars and tracked electronically if the vehicle is 
stolen. So successful has it been that it has managed to 
sign up all 52 of the country's police forces for the next 
five years. The success rate of the device is phenomenal, 
and the company has progressed enormously. Its shares 
have become very attractive, but it has started to make a 
profit only in the past year or two. That is because of the 
enormous capital spend involved in setting up the 
necessary infrastructure, in the research required by a very 
high-tech product, and in the necessary marketing.
<P>
If the restrictions proposed in the Bill had been placed 
on a company such as Tracker Network a few years ago, 
its ability to attract venture capitalist entrepreneurs would 
have been highly questionable. Such entrepreneurs require 
tax incentives before they are willing to give a boost to 
companies with capital-intensive development 
programmes. In addition, it is ironic that many of the 
companies prejudiced most by the Bill are involved in 
manufacturing. They are capital intensive, so their gross 
asset level is that much higher. I am sure that the 
Government do not want to discriminate against 
manufacturing businesses.
<P>
Another company whose story is worth telling is called 
Alyzime. It is a pharmaceutical company, quoted on AIM, 
and it deals with the problem of obesity. It is developing 
a new drug to tackle the fat that produces obesity; it is a 
subject in which many members of the Committee will 
take a close interest. Alizyme is another capital intensive 
business. often, it is a long time after the pharmaceutical 
company starts research before the product, if it is 
successful, can gain a licence, become marketable and be 
sold to potential patients. Its share price has been very 
volatile; it is still making losses because the product has 
not yet come on to the market. The capitalisation has 
fallen back to £5 million. However, it is highly likely that 
if it is successful, the company will need to raise more 
capital and go above the £10 million mark. It will 
therefore be denied a host of potential investors in what 
is a high risk, but potentially high reward, company.
<P>
Another company that I could mention it is germane 
to the point, Mrs. Dunwoody is Stanford Rook, a 
pharmaceutical company that has been conducting 
research into the causes of tuberculosis. I was surprised to 
learn that that is still a major killer throughout the world. 
Arthritis research has been a spin-off of that project. The 
company, understandably, is still making large losses 
because of the amount of capital required for research into 
the disease. There have been wild gyrations in the 
company's share price, which often happens with new 
drug development companies. The shares currently stand 
at about 91p; they have been as high as £5.80 and as low 
as 79p. The market capitalisation of the company is
£17.5 million, well above the £10 million qualification. it 
is a highly volatile, high-tech, research-based company, 
but investors would need a real incentive to put their 
money into it.
<P>
Another company may interest the Committee. Desire 
Petroleum is involved in the important business of drilling 
for oil around the Falkland Islands. Sadly, to date it has 
found more squid than hydrocarbons, but there is an 
important untapped oil reservoir in the southern 
hemisphere and we wish the company well. It is well 
above the market capitalisation on gross assets of
£10 million.
<P>
I will mention one other company 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman has made 
his case with such clarity that we may proceed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful for your praise on the 
points that I have raised, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
The point of the Bill, as the Economic Secretary said 
earlier, is that the Government want to exclude lower-risk 
activities. The examples that I gave are certainly not 
lower-risk activities. They are all high risk; they need 
premium tax incentives to gain the initial investors in 
order to start their research, drilling or whatever it may 
be, so that they can expand in later years.
<P>
We are faced with competition in a different way from 
our European Union partners. It is ironic that the 
Government are trying to clamp down on 
entrepreneurialism and innovation, of which the 
companies that I cited are fine examples. For example, in 
the nouveau marche, the French are introducing 
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Leslie (Shipley):</B> What does that 
mean?
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I can tell Labour Members who are yet 
to grasp the basic realities of the onslaught of the euro 
and the foreign terminology that may go with it, that I 
think it means new market. Tax relief is being introduced 
and extended for these companies in France, not 
restrained and limited as the schedule proposes.
<P>
In conclusion, we should encourage enterprise and risk 
investment, as AIM has done successfully in the past. We 
need to encourage the great companies of tomorrow, 
especially in the technology and niche manufacturing 
sectors that we have mentioned. We need special tax for 
high-risk companies, as many of them are far too risky 
for normal private investors. Even the Paymaster General 
has advocated excluding AIM stocks from individual 
savings accounts, which appear otherwise to be the 
receptacle for absolutely anybody with a bob or two.
<P>
The gross assets figure of £10 million is highly 
arbitrary and puts a cap on the growth of stocks. The gross 
assets rule is a crude tool with which to determine a 
company's suitability because it takes no account of that 
company's liabilities. In any case, that method of 
valuation is not easy to define. It distorts the market.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I was pleased to see in yesterday's Financial Times that 
when the AIM team met Treasury officials at the stock 
market, they made such an impression that the officials 
were minded to say that Ministers were considering 
possible changes to the Bill. Indeed, the possibility of 
upping the £10 million level to £30 million or £40 million 
was quoted. I would certainly welcome that, and I would 
not want to be restrained by the £20 million in my 
amendment. Under the new charm offensive which was so 
encouraged by the Financial Secretary before the recess, 
Opposition Members would be delighted and bowled 
over we might even praise her if the Economic 
Secretary said that she had been persuaded by her 
officials, who had heard a good case from the stock 
market, and that she would not only accept the 
amendment but would up the ante and make the 
qualifying figure nearer £40 million.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> In rising to support my hon. Friend's 
amendment, it is worth pointing out that those on the other 
side of the political divide also believe that AIM is an 
important market for smaller companies in this country. 
My hon. Friend gave a lucid description of the good work 
that AIM has done, and the Minister for Small Firms has 
also applauded it. The AIM newsletter carries a nice 
picture of the hon. Lady under the heading "Labour 
vision". The headline reads, "New Government applauds 
AIM". I would not want to try your patience,
Mrs. Dunwoody, but perhaps I may quote the article 
briefly. The hon. Lady writes:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is a measure of AIM's success that in its first two years
283 businesses raised £1.2 billion. This is a considerable 
achievement and one of which AIM can be proud."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
She goes on to talk, in typically Labour ritualistic tones, 
of small business as the backbone of the British economy, 
an important generator of jobs and being at the cutting 
edge of British economic endeavour.
<P>
Unfortunately, clause 137 and the provisions that we 
will discuss with the next group of amendments do not 
support AIM and a healthy liquidity in the shares of AIM 
companies; they do the reverse. My hon. Friend the 
Member for East Worthing and Shoreham touched on two 
objections. First, the £10 million figure is an arbitrary 
limit for small and growing companies, which tend to 
grow rapidly. Much bigger companies grow more slowly.
<P>
Secondly, my hon. Friend pointed out that the gross 
assets test will certainly discriminate against 
manufacturing companies. There can be little doubt about 
that; it is certainly the view of AIM and many 
commentators. A number of companies will be excluded 
by this lower threshold from bottom-end relief and they 
will also be excluded from the benefits associated with 
the full list £75 million market capital was mentioned. 
A huge funding gap opens up before our eyes as a result 
of the introduction of the £10 million gross assets test.
<P>
I ask the Economic Secretary to respond fully and 
frankly to a report in the AIM newsletter for April because 
it raises a crucial concern. The newsletter reports a 
conversation that AIM members had with an unnamed 
official who admitted that the proposals' effect had not 
been thought through and that a detailed study had not 
been made. The official was quoted as saying that the 
Government intended
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to target the available finance in the most effective way to those 
companies that had trouble raising equity capital. However, he 
admitted that the Revenue had no set figure of `available finance' 
in mind, and that the desire to target was based on `various studies' 
claiming that companies in most need of equity finance are those 
with gross assets of less than £10 million."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What are those studies? Will the Economic Secretary take 
us through some of them? Will she validate the official's 
statement that some studies showed that the companies 
most in need were those with gross assets of less than 
£10 million? That is what the proposal's intellectual and 
practical credibility rests on. In the light of that, the 
Committee deserves an explanation.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I will try not to repeat the points that 
my colleagues have so ably made. they have touched on 
a weakness in the schedule. There is another weakness, 
although the Government amendment goes some way 
towards dealing with it. The weakness is that we are never 
told what is meant by the value of the assets. Does that 
mean the book value that the accountants have 
determined? A company that is involved in a lot of 
research and development may choose to have intangible 
assets that represent its expectations. It might have, 
however, write them down to a low value. Does the value 
of the assets mean the market value as derived from the 
price at which shares are subscribed for? Those who 
advise the company might recommend a subscription 
price at which the shares were immediately 
over-subscribed. The moment they became available on 
the alternative investment market, they would shoot to a 
premium. That phenomenon is well known not only 
among companies in the AIM market. Even though only 
£1 million had been subscribed for, the requirement on 
line 1 of page 214 that the value
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"must not exceed £11 million"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
after subscription would immediately have been breached. 
The company's investors would inadvertently find that 
they were not entitled to the relief that was promised to 
them.
<P>
That is yet another example of how the Government's 
over-restrictive attempt to hack away at a valuable relief 
that was developed by the previous Government will 
backfire because some investors' fingers will be burnt and 
they will not feel inclined to go down the same route 
again. Even companies with a value of less than
£10 million will suffer.
<P>
It is also worth saying that book value is subject to 
interpretation by accountants, although it follows 
generally accepted principles. To get under the
£10 million level, accountants write the value of the assets 
down as much as possible. It is conceivable that a 
company with a book value of less than £10 million may 
have a market value of £20 million. That would be 
preferable from the perspective of Conservative Members. 
On balance, we should like the Economic Secretary, even 
by interpreting the words in the Bill, to go some way 
towards meeting the criticisms of her and her colleagues 
by people in the alternative investment market. I look 
forward to hearing what she has to say about that point.
<P>
We go beyond that, and we are saying that the value 
should be £20 million what effect would that have? We 
are not considering market values, but book values. The 
Committee can gauge some idea of how much we are 
widening the market by referring to figures that I have 
received from Cisco, which is the voice of smaller quoted 
companies. It has done a great deal to highlight the 
deficiencies of the Bill, and has made some suggestion as 
to how it might be improved. According to Cisco,
800 smaller quoted companies capitalise at £25 million or 
less, and 1,175 capitalise at £50 million or less. That is 
not an exact approximation of the relevant group, but I 
think that we can take it that the market available for 
investors would be widened by companies with a 
capitalisation of several billion pounds.
<P>
It is undeniable that the amendment would encourage 
many people to participate in the market because it has a 
spread of investments. Those people might otherwise not 
participate at all because they are simply not interested in 
the minnows in the sea. They want at least to see a fish 
that they can catch on the end of a line. The problem is 
that they would be prepare dot put some of their money 
into the minnows if they were also putting some into other 
fish. [Interruption.] But if only minnows are available, 
they will shun the market altogether. Some of us were 
earlier accused of fishing for compliments. I am trying 
simply to make a point with my analogy.
<P>
The amendment would significantly affect the 
numbers of participants. Would it cost the Government 
any money? If it meant that more investors would put 
in more money, of course the cost of the tax relief 
would be considerable. The on-consequence would then 
have to be considered. Companies are currently telling 
hon Members, through many representative bodies, that 
they are having to cut their growth and employment 
plans, and that their future profits will be cut. Such 
companies would be able to carry on with their 
investment plans and with creating jobs, success and 
Government dividends from higher tax revenues.
<P>
The Government are adopting a short-sighted approach, 
to turn down an amendment that many people in the 
industry and in businesses that wil be affected are telling 
them will have a pay back. Just as people who are 
investing hope to make many times their money, so the 
Government should put their faith in the amendment, and 
realise that they too will make many times their money if 
the companies are successful down the road.
<P>
The Opposition will later criticise another aspect of the 
new scheme, regarding capital gains 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Yes, we will come on later to 
discuss that.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> We will, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
If the system is a complete write-down system, when 
the shares are eventually disposed of, much more tax 
come back in future. The Opposition will argue later that 
we are not in favour of that. If the Committee considers 
the amendment in isolation, that again mitigates against 
the up-front cost of increasing the cap because the extra 
revenue will in future be as beneficial for the Government 
as the investment proceeds will be for people who took 
their chance on the companies.
<P>
There is no commonsense reason for a limit of
£10 million. I do not believe that there is any precedent 
for the Government snatching the figure out of thin air. 
Perhaps a Committee member would like to suggest why 
£10 million should be a magic figure, but it is surely better 
to listen to those in the industry, who know exactly how 
their investors will react, than to derive something from 
the Government's cogitations that has no substance 
whatsoever.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> They have done no work.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> As my hon. Friend says, they have 
done no work whatever prior to dreaming up these new 
rules.
