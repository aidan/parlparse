hope that the Minister will be a little more forthcoming with
information today. We think that we have been asking pretty succinct
and relevant questions, but the right hon. Gentleman is now becoming
known as someone who gives only name, rank and serial number;
occasionally, if he is feeling generous, he might talk about his
football team, but knowing who that is, I have decided that it is
probably best not to raise the subject. However, we hope that he will
give us more information today, because the Bill makes the most
profound change in the national health service since it was set up and
we must have more detail. He keeps saying that the detail is being
worked up or that someone else is dealing with the detail, but because
of that profound change, it is important that we have a chance to
scrutinise the Bill with the facts before us, and that is not the case

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
insolvency clauses fit with the present Government’s approach to
the health service of putting competition first and of having the
private sector much more involved and undermining NHS services. That is
embodied in the drafting of the clauses. Under the National Health
Service Act 2006, the application of insolvency law was voluntary; in
the Bill, we have a whole new way of 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1010<a class="bkMark" name="Column1010">&#160;</a>
                           </div>dealing with the law on insolvency, which becomes mandatory. The
Minister might want to give us more information about
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000017">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under
clause 113, failing foundation trusts that go bust will become subject
to commercial insolvency law. The aim of our amendment is twofold:
first, we want to voice strongly our opposition to a measure that is
dangerous to the national health service; and secondly, we want the
Minister to provide some clarification about the regulations that the
Secretary of State will impose with regard to foundation trusts
entering
insolvency.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000018">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause has been written to serve the needs of profit making, the market
and the private sector. It represents a reversal of the governing
principle of the NHS—the principle that puts patient care first
and profit margins second. Today, we will return regularly to the theme
of the profit margin, rather than the patient, being put first as a
result of the Government’s changes. The change between the
existing policy and the future one is clear. At present, foundation
trusts can voluntarily be placed in insolvency by the NHS through
Monitor in its current guise—I stress, in its current
guise—but that is a last resort measure that, to date, it has
never been necessary to implement. Changing that is the point of the
additional powers given in the Bill for competition and for greater
involvement of the private sector.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000019">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Important to
us—I shall come back to this again and again—are early
intervention in and support for hospital trusts or other services that
get into trouble. The Minister keeps talking about inefficient trusts
and services that are not up to the job, but there is a difference
between that and wanting a better failure regime. Trusts may get into
financial difficulties, but that does not necessarily mean that they
are providing poor clinical services. That is a big difference, but
under the Bill if a trust becomes insolvent, it goes. Basically, that
is what the Bill is saying.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000020">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The 2006 Act
contains a thorough procedure for early intervention when trusts are
struggling financially. It was Labour’s policy when in
government that insolvency should be the very last resort, taken only
after multiple attempts have been made to reform trusts and return them
to financial stability. We are interested to see how the Government
want to prevent it from happening in the first place. We see hospitals
as part of the wider NHS family, but the Government seem to see them as
independent business entities, almost celebrating the fact they are
putting a failure regime in place.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000021">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We want to
ensure that the provisions we put in place in 2006 remain to support
hospitals that might get into trouble financially, but still provide
good clinical services—indeed, that will be true in most cases.
Under our system, even if financial failure ensued it would be dealt
with in a planned and careful way to ensure the best solution for the
local population. I am not sure how many people in the constituencies
of Committee members are aware of how insolvency law applies and how
the rules regarding the finances of foundation trusts will impact on
the local hospital.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000022">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under the
clause, that will no longer be the case; it is no longer Government
policy. Had an FT failed under Labour, it would of course have been
regrettable and upsetting, but it seems that this Government will
celebrate it as a success of market function. That is a big change. On
Tuesday, the Minister kept speaking about the failure 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1011<a class="bkMark" name="Column1011">&#160;</a>
                           </div>regime as though it would bring about massive improvements to the health
service. I repeat that the present Government will celebrate failure as
a successful market function.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000023">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Where we had
early interventions, this Government have nothing. The Minister has
said before that that is not the case, but I wait for his reply to this
debate. Where we had a careful strategy to help FTs away from financial
difficulties, the Government will leave them to fail. Where we had a
careful plan for last resort insolvency, the Government have the
driving belief that FTs should be allowed go bust, like commercial
organisations. That is a big change. Hospitals are seen as commercial
organisations, but we see them primarily as health providers that put
the patients’ interests
first.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000024">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
I said earlier, foundations trusts are part of the NHS family: they are
NHS organisations whose job is to improve people’s health for
the greater good of the community. Will the community have a say in the
future of foundation trusts? I say again that FTs were created and
financed almost exclusively with public money. They should be treated
as such and not as commercial entities that exist purely for the
pursuit of profit. The more people I speak to in the national health
service who know about commissioning, the more I hear that the changes
brought about by the Bill and the pressures it will put upon
commissioners will force them to look at the profit line rather than
what might be in the best interests of patients.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000025">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To avoid the
unacceptable prospect of seeing foundation trusts enter insolvency
proceedings, with publicly financed assets being sold off at a much
reduced price in an insolvency fire sale, our amendment seeks to ensure
that the final decision on whether a trust enters insolvency remains
with Monitor. As it stands, the clause operates in the interests of
creditors. With our amendment, it would operate in the interests of
patients.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000026">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Throughout,
the clause talks about creditors. That is the difference: we talk about
patients, the Government talk about creditors. If that is the reality,
it is not surprising that more and more people are becoming worried
about the privatisation of the NHS, and particularly about the future
of local hospitals. Many hon. Members on both sides of the House have
spoken about their local hospitals. We believe that people do not yet
understand the detail of what the Bill entails or that the future of
local hospitals is under threat because of the changes.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000027">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Secretary
of State will have responsibility for setting out the as yet undefined
regulations under the clause. Is that yet another example of our being
asked to vote on a clause and to trust that the Secretary of State is
competent enough to deal with our concerns? Can the Minister provide
evidence showing that we should simply trust the Secretary of State to
come up with regulations sufficient to address our concerns? That goes
back to the fact that the Minister has not been forthcoming with
details, which are important if the Committee is to make the decisions
it must make. Alternatively, will he once again duck the question
because he does not know what the Bill’s consequences will be
or, worse, because he is afraid of exposing
them?<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000028">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
return to what Monitor’s chairman said about people’s
emotional attachment to their local services. People do have an
emotional attachment to their local hospitals. That is not based on a
lack of logic; rather, they see the services their hospital provides
and they 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>support the hospital. Under the plans in the Bill, however, that does
not matter, because hospitals are now much more vulnerable to closure
and to having their assets transferred. We will explore that further as
we go through the coming clauses this morning and this afternoon. For
the avoidance of doubt, Mr Hancock, let me add
that, depending on what the Minister says, we may want a short clause
stand part debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000029">&#160;</a>

provide as much as information as we can to answer the points made by
Opposition Members. The fact is, however, that sometimes they do not
like the answers they get, so they take that as not having had an
answer. In other cases, it is a fact of life in Committee that a number
of the issues that flow from the Bill will be dealt with through
regulation and guidance. Much of that guidance will be open to
consultation before its implementation, and it would be premature at
this stage to give the information the hon. Gentleman seeks.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000032">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman spoke as if that were unprecedented or surprising, but it is
not, as I have said on numerous occasions. The previous
Government’s practice was completely different from that
demonstrated in the Bill. The primary legislation they produced was a
skeleton; all the powers in terms of what was to be done flowed from
that primary legislation and through secondary legislation, which, for
valid reasons relating to the cycle, we did not have at the time in
Committee. We have sought to redress that problem by putting far more
in the Bill, where appropriate. However, secondary legislation,
regulations and guidance will still flow from our Bills, just as they
did from the Labour Government’s. There is at least the
reassurance that there will be consultations before many of the
regulations and pieces of guidance are drawn up. I hope that that
clarifies the point without stimulating an intervention from the hon.

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let me
broadly explain what clause 113 does before moving on to some of the
specific points the hon. Gentleman raised in moving the amendment. The
clause provides for the Secretary of State to make regulations to apply
relevant parts of insolvency and company legislation to foundation
trusts for the purposes of rescuing an insolvent foundation trust as a
going concern or ensuring an orderly winding-up of its affairs in the
best interests of creditors as a whole.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000034">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Such
proceedings would used only ever as the last resort, and it is
important to bear that in mind. The hon. Gentleman asked what will be
done to prevent us from getting to the last resort. As is my habit, I
will give him great detail in answer to that

                           </strong> I will, but will the hon. Gentleman let me make a
little more progress, because the answer will be part and parcel of my
explanation of how we will ensure that action is taken to avoid the
last resort of insolvency?<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000039">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We think that
such powers are vital to ensure that patients should no longer be
forced to use, or taxpayers to subsidise, poor-quality, inefficient
services or providers. Instead of propping up failing providers, as
under the current system, there will be transparent mechanisms for
managing provider failure to protect essential services, and to allow
commissioners to replace services with high-quality or better-quality
options.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000040">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause binds the Secretary of State to making regulations. We believe
that that is the right approach, particularly as long-standing powers
to apply insolvency procedures to foundation trusts, which the previous
Government introduced, have never been exercised. It would be wrong for
the Secretary of State to be required to secure Monitor’s
permission to introduce secondary legislation, as the amendment
suggests. Indeed, that would undermine Parliament’s role.
Moreover, we are not aware of any precedent that would require the
Secretary of State to need permission from an arm’s-length body
such as Monitor before making secondary legislation in the health care
sector. It will therefore not surprise the hon. Gentleman that I do not
think the amendment would add anything relevant to the
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000041">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
will flesh out my argument. The hon. Gentleman referred to insolvency
being the last resort, and I totally agree with him: it must be the
point of last resort. We expect commissioners to work constructively
with providers to try to resolve problems to avoid failure. Monitor
will also provide support and intervene before failure, as discussed
during our debate on designated services, which I am sure the hon.

                        <p class="tabbed">I
shall give some examples of providers’ actions to prevent
failure. A provider will always have a range of actions, including:
improving management capability and expertise, appointing directors
with experience of turning round health organisations, benchmarking its
services and costs against comparable providers, reducing costs and
increasing efficiency through targeted cost improvement programmes, and
working in partnership with other organisations to share back office

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman has asked specific questions
about Monitor. He also asked what will be done to try to prevent a
situation of last resort arising. It is for the benefit and interest of
the Committee and those who are following our proceedings to hear the
whole package. I am concentrating on actions that can be taken within
organisations to try to prevent them from getting to the last resort.
When I have finished that section I will move on to Monitor’s
regulatory powers, which I think will address the hon.
Gentleman’s second point. I have chosen to do it that way
around, rather than the other way around, which I get the impression is
the way that the hon. Gentleman would like it, but we will get there in
the end, so whichever way around it is does not matter. It is
important, however, to give the Committee some idea of what we expect
will happen to help to ensure that that is a position of last
resort.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000047">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As I said, we
expect providers to work in partnership with organisations and share
back-office functions and services. We expect them to improve service
quality to attract more referrals. We expect them to apply to Monitor
for a local subsidy to the tariff to cover excess costs of delivery in
designated services when, despite being demonstrably efficient, they
cannot recover their costs—for example, where a provider is
serving a very rural community where it is unable to generate
sufficient economies of scale. The regulator may also encourage the
provider to reduce its costs in designated services where that is
practical and possible.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000048">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That is the
generality of what one would expect providers to be working on if they
were beginning to detect problems. The hon. Gentleman asked: what will
Monitor do? Monitor, as he knows, has a role in pre-failure with regard
to designated services. Monitor will be responsible for supporting
commissioners in meeting their duty to preserve access to essential
health care services for patients. It will do that through a range of
activities, some of which will happen in advance of a failure, some of
which will happen as an organisation enters the pre-failure phase, and
some as an organisation reaches the point of failure. The provider
licence will contain a number of continuity of service conditions that
will seek to restrict risky behaviour among designated service
providers. The provider risk pool will place financial incentives on
providers through the provider levy to reduce their financial exposure
by taking steps to reduce their risk of failure. Looking at the
operation of other comparable schemes, such as the Pension Protection
Fund, those mechanisms have proved to be effective in reducing the
overall risk of failure of organisations.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000049">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
designated service licence conditions will require providers of
designated services to provide information that will allow Monitor to
develop a distress regime that tracks providers’ financial
well-being and compliance against licence conditions. Should a provider

rating, Monitor will be able to trigger a higher level of regulatory
scrutiny and intervention by taking enforcement action, through the
licensing regime, as set out in clause 90. That could include advice to
providers on how to rectify their situation and the ability to require
action from providers to address specific issues. It is important to
know that such enforcement action is unlikely to include fines, as that
would only heighten the financial failure.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000050">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman went on to ask what role the community has in insolvency
proceedings The regulations that will be published will spell out the
details of the regimes. However, without wanting to pre-empt the
regulation, I can confirm that there will be a consultation stage in
special administration where significant changes to designated services
are planned. Parliament will have the chance for scrutiny and debate
through the affirmative procedure.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000051">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman said that a trust could be providing high-quality care
but still face financial difficulties and go bust. Trusts providing
high-quality services would be much less likely to fail, as funds
follow the patients. We expect commissioners and Monitor to work with
them to control and reduce costs to avoid
failure.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000054">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
point that the hon. Gentleman made more than once—it was
obviously the buzzword message that he wanted to get across—was
that the clause puts profit first, which is ludicrous. He does not
really mean that, but I understand that he has to go through the
motions. However, it is palpable nonsense to suggest that. The previous
Government proposed to apply insolvency law to foundation trusts. Our
Bill recognises that pure insolvency law would not be appropriate for
the NHS, which is why we are proposing a tailor-made special
administration regime to protect the interests of patients. Despite the
prejudices of some Opposition Members, we are talking about the
interests of patients and not of
profits.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000055">&#160;</a>

failure because no one can predict what will happen in the future. We
see failure as the last resort and, for the reasons that I have
outlined and through the actions of providers and the functions of
Monitor, there will be help, assistance and guidance given to providers
long, long, long before they might get anywhere near the situation of
last resort. Every assistance will be given to avoid the last resort
regime. What I would say to the hon. Lady is that if a provider is
providing high-quality care, there is less likelihood of
failure.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000057">&#160;</a>

record that we are seeking to give as much information and answers to
questions as possible. The hon. Member for Leicester West asked about
Monitor—its role and what we expect it to do. The role of
Monitor—this might anticipate her next intervention—as
she knows from our earlier discussions is in ensuring continuity of
services, and that applies to all providers and not just foundation
trusts. On that basis, I ask my hon. Friends to reject the amendment if

                        <p class="tabbed">The Bill will
replace the failure regime provisions for NHS FTs set out in sections
53 to 55 of the 2006 Act, introduced under the previous Government.
Those provisions, which deal with voluntary arrangements, winding up
and dissolution, are unworkable, as the necessary secondary legislation
has never been made. Those earlier provisions are also largely
outdated, given that the provisions were repealed in part by the Health
Act 2009. The effect of the repeal is that the provisions apply only to
FTs that were not formerly NHS trusts. In practice, no such bodies
exist, as all existing FTs were formerly NHS trusts. In their place,
the Bill would create an obligation for the Secretary of State to make
regulations to apply relevant parts of insolvency and company
legislation to FTs, for the purposes of either rescuing an insolvent
foundation trust as a going concern, or ensuring an orderly winding up
of its affairs, in the best interests of creditors as a
whole.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000073">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We think it
right to set out a broad range of mechanisms that may enable the rescue
of a troubled provider, since they may be applied, where appropriate in
particular circumstances, to protect the interests of patients,
creditors and, importantly, British taxpayers. Applying normal
insolvency procedures would not only provide a range of mechanisms for
dealing with failure but provide incentives for management to avoid

some light on the problem that we keep raising, which is that we cannot
find out the details. Not only did we find that the explanatory notes
on price competition—I will not go into that—actually
clarified that the Government were in favour of price competition, even
though they said that they were not, but we now find that the
explanatory notes on the important area of insolvency do not actually
explain it. It is bizarre that we have had a succession of explanatory
notes that are supposed to inform the Committee, to make possible the
tabling of amendments, debate and scrutiny of the Bill, but the
Minister has had to step up to explain what areas of the Bill mean,
because the explanatory notes do not. I do not know whether a concern
has been raised with you, Mr Hancock, but it is important to do so. In
fact, perhaps the hon. Gentleman and I think alike on that. We have
highlighted the same areas as those that were raised in the
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000079">&#160;</a>

we do not actually know what the details will be. The Minister has made
a big thing, particularly during the early stages of the Bill, about
how the Government have improved scrutiny and consultation, but that is
no good if it does not change the decision. The Government can go on
all they like about what they have done. If the Minister’s
constituents were clearly overwhelmingly opposed to a local hospital or
service going into insolvency, what weight would that have on
Monitor’s decision? People care about their local hospitals, so
they need to know what that means. Whatever local patients might think,
what would the key factor be in Monitor making its decision on
insolvency?<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000082">&#160;</a>

in whatever shape or form they take, would be
listened to, I am tempted to answer in a flip way and say that they
will be listened to as much as the previous Government listened to
consultations, but I will refrain from that. Of course, responses to
any consultation, on any issue, are always listened to carefully. Where
they are relevant and make a positive contribution, they are taken on
board. We saw that with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and
the consultation responses that we received to the White Paper, where
we subsequently found that we could strengthen and enhance the
legislation that flowed from it. The hon. Gentleman has been in the
House long enough to know that I cannot prejudge any consultation and
give a blanket commitment now that whatever response comes in from a
consultation process will affect the
decision.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000083">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am not sure it was advisable to go down that
road. Let me return to what I was saying, which is crucial, because the
Government made a big thing about how they are having greater scrutiny
and consultation. The chairman of Monitor let the cat out of the bag
when he used the words “emotional attachment” to local
services. I might be misinterpreting, but he may mean an emotional
“irrational” attachment, so we know that Monitor will
ignore the wishes of local people because their views are made on an
emotional not a rational basis. If the Minister wants to put on record
that there will be no closure of hospitals under this Government, I am
happy for him to do so, but I suspect that he will not. What the
Government are doing will make the closure of local hospitals much
easier. Monitor made its position clear—there is an emotional
attachment to local services. That is
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000084">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
gave the Minister two examples: the burns unit in the north-west and my
local hospital trust, and the Secretary of State or Ministers got
involved. They listened to the public view, and, certainly in one case,
the public were in favour of what happened and we managed to get a
compromise in the other case. The fact is that the Secretary of State
will not be involved. Ministers will say, “Sorry, it’s
not my problem any more; go and see Monitor.” The
Minister said that he would listen to MPs’ concerns, and we are
grateful for that.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000085">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
mentioned the help given to foundation trusts by Monitor, and made a
point about subsidies. I have read the Bill, but again, we are not
clear about the details. Can he say more about the criteria for the
subsidy, or is it down to Monitor to draw up the criteria? The
difficulty is that we are, again, being asked to decide a crucial part
of the element to help avoid insolvency on the basis that part of that
help might be a subsidy, but we have no idea what the criteria will be.
There may be more information elsewhere in the Bill, but I suspect that
it will probably be up to Monitor, and we need to know
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000086">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">A
letter from the Minister putting in black and white the difference
between the system under the 2006 Act and now would be useful, so that
there is no mistake. Given the pro-competition position and the fact
that providers can bring challenges if they think that competition has
been interfered with in any way, will the help that Monitor will give
to foundation trusts in difficulty that the Minister
outlined—subsidy is one example—be challengeable by a
provider? Will they be able to challenge the subsidy as being
anti-competitive? Is that the case?<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000087">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The difference
is that this regime is more pro-competition and pro-market. The
Government have introduced lots of clauses that, frankly, are a
lawyer’s paradise in terms of challenge. Can the Minister
explain? He may be able to give some reassurance that Monitor’s
help, including the subsidy, will not be open to legal challenge. I
suspect that I know the answer, but it will be useful to hear what he
says.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000088">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister says that Monitor will develop a distress regime. We are not
sure what a “distress regime” will be exactly. Again, it
is the lack of detail that concerns us. If he goes away and gets
further information about what it will be and will entail, it would be
useful if he would write to us about it. He talked about credit rating;
here we go again—the market, credit rating, failure and
creditors. That is what the Bill is about, not patient interest, local
health services and what the public want. My hon. Friend the Member for
Leicester West made an important point on market failure. The Minister
may correct me, but I think he said that judgments will be based on
whether it is less likely to be a market failure in terms of a
foundation trust getting into difficulty. It may be useful for him to
confirm
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000089">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
will finish this part with the point that a poor trust will not
necessarily get into financial difficulty. To go back to the
Government’s view of the world, it might have a greater monopoly
in its area. Members who represent urban constituencies may wish to
explore this matter further, but the Minister mentioned that rural
areas may receive additional support because they do not have as many
services around, and as a result there may well be a monopoly, or there
will become one. The fact that a hospital trust is financially sound
does not necessarily mean that it is a good provider of services. It is
a little simplistic to argue that that is the case, and the Minister
may want to respond to that point, too.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000090">&#160;</a>

Gentleman’s question quickly. The straightforward answer is no.
First, there is nothing in the Bill that changes existing UK or EU
competition legislation. Secondly, common causes of financial distress
among health care providers relate to such factors as poor management,
and/or poor control of costs, and/or poor quality services resulting in
fewer patients choosing to use them, and/or inefficient provision. The
application of competition law is not a factor. Our proposals create
much stronger incentives to address such problems and, in the event of
failure, they provide robust safeguards for patients.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000093">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The lead amendment is a probing amendment, because
it may only be about tidying up language. “Before”
implies an arbitrary cut-off point for consultation, which could lead
to bureaucratic delay in making decisions about regulations for
insolvency applications. It is a matter of opinion, but replacing
“Before” with “Whilst” makes provision more
realistic by ensuring that the consultation and decision-making process
go hand in hand—in other words, so consultation happens not only
before, but during the process. We would like more information about
what the provision means. Again, it is obviously about prevention, but
in terms of ongoing consultation, there should not be an arbitrary
cut-off point, and nothing
more.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000123">&#160;</a>

There is genuine concern about having a cut-off point for consultation.
If someone followed the letter of the law, that could be the end of
discussion.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000125">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As we have
said before, we do not believe that a hospital should be allowed to go
bust without a serious pre-failure regime being gone through to try to
turn it around. We have a difference of opinion about the 2006 Act and
what the Minister has said. As the Bill stands, hospitals without
designated services could just fall over. The first we will hear about
them going wrong is when they enter insolvency. The Minister talks
about a procedure that could take place, although the detail has not
been drawn up by Monitor, but at what point will local people get to
know that the hospital is in trouble?

                        <p class="tabbed">We believe
that the Bill will result in too little protection for services.
Successful providers will be able to expand as they attract new
patients to their services or win new contracts, but some providers
will struggle to attract patients to their services or win contracts.
That will not necessarily be because they are poor clinical providers;
there may be other factors involved. The Minister already used the
example of a hospital or services in a rural area, and demographics
could play a particularly important part. Such providers will need to
restructure their services, and those that are unable to improve on the
quality and efficiency may fail. We want to explore the contrast
between financial failure and the quality of services.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000127">&#160;</a>

may have to travel further to access services. If there is a problem
with the delivery of services because of insolvency, we do not know
whether there will be a nearby provider that would be able to take over
those services or take over the premises of the current provider. We do
not have the detail. We believe that the clause reveals the ruthless,
sink-or-swim, survival-of-the-fittest competitive economics that is
being thrust into the NHS. That was confirmed in Tuesday’s
sitting, when the Minister said that the taxpayer will no longer prop
up failing or inefficient providers. We explored the thinking behind
that under the previous clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000128">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
has said that the Labour Government did not deal with inefficient and
poor providers. We have repeatedly asked him for examples, but he has
not been able to provide any, so perhaps he might like to think again.
Perhaps Chase Farm hospital might be an example, but lots of hospitals
have issues. If we do not have examples, we cannot draw any conclusions
about whether what he says stands up to scrutiny.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000129">&#160;</a>

                        <p>It
would be legitimate to ask for whom it is orderly. For the managers?
For hospital staff? For patients’ interests? What does the

another example of the market-oriented language that runs through the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000131">&#160;</a>

of the clause is to facilitate provider exit, by which the Government
mean hospitals, departments or other NHS services going bust and
closing and private companies coming in instead. That would all happen
according to the rule of the market rather than being democratically
decided by local people or patients or their elected representatives.
People do not like the idea of their local hospital being treated in
that way. Although an exit might be orderly for economic purposes, it
might not be for clinical purposes. That goes back to the question of
the point at which local people will be involved.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000132">&#160;</a>

with the problem and helping the choice. There may be others in the
local community with a great deal of health experience, including the
health and well-being board and the council scrutiny committee, both of
which should be involved. That fits in with the Government’s
oft-stated position that the Bill extends scrutiny and consultation
procedures. It is important to explore what that

am involved with a foundation trust hospital, and we have always had a
great deal of involvement with the local authority. The chief executive
attends the scrutiny board meetings and there is quite a lot of
openness about issues in the hospital itself. I have mentioned the
reconfiguration issues in my local hospital before it was a foundation
trust, but it would be useful if the Minister were to address that. For
those of us with concerns about the Bill, it is important that the best
talent is involved when a hospital is at risk of
failure.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000134">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
risk of indefinite expensive provision funded from the risk pool needs
to be mitigated by obliging the administrator to find an efficient
solution quickly, such as working with commissioners to invite tenders
from possible substitute providers to find the most cost-effective
alternative. Does the Minister have any idea of the time scales? How
long will such administrations take? I do not know whether the
administrators will have any health background or knowledge, or any
knowledge of the health market. It would be useful if the Minister gave
us some information on
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000135">&#160;</a>

                        <p>The
hon. Member for Southport raised that important point, too. The
Government’s logic is similar to the alleged problems and
solutions related to fair playing fields and market distortions in the
pricing clauses. To allow private competitors into the market, existing
NHS providers have to be downgraded. That is to treat NHS foundation
trusts like private companies that can just go bust if they cannot
compete in the market. NHS foundation trusts are not private companies.
They are NHS bodies and people do not want their local hospital to go
bust and be flogged off to satisfy the creditors. We see a lot about
creditors in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000137">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Private
hospitals will be allowed to undercut NHS services, taking the most
profitable patients and, therefore, putting NHS hospitals at risk. The
stability of foundation trust hospitals is important because
cherry-picking undermines foundation trusts. It would be useful if the
Minister set out which provisions in the Bill stop cherry-picking in
the health service. We introduced a safety net to prevent FTs from
failing and, if necessary, there was a deauthorisation regime to return
an FT to being an NHS
trust.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000138">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
strategic approach is the big issue. Now, strategic health authorities
and primary care trusts take a leading role in planning what health
care is needed in a community, which services to close and which to
maintain. In last night’s debate in the House, we heard one of
the Minister’s colleagues talking about a centre being
downgraded, I think, to a minor injuries centre. Obviously the PCT

                           </div>was involved in that decision, which I think was taken yesterday. It is
important that such changes are planned and co-ordinated, but instead
the market will bankrupt failing hospitals. Under the
Government’s proposals, the market will replace a planned and
strategic
approach.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000139">&#160;</a>

providers that get into financial trouble, including by building up
debts, will not be subject to the proper level of scrutiny or provided
with any support. I do not believe that there will be
scrutiny—the Minister tried to explain the situation to us
earlier, but we are not convinced. The risk of financial failure is no
longer a widely shared responsibility within the NHS, which is another
big change. There will be no PCTs and no SHAs, and it is accepted that
hospitals will go bust and that a court-appointed official will then
act as a commercial administrator. GP consortia will also be allowed to
collapse financially. It is important that the Minister gives us some
information on

Government will let hospitals go bust and services shut down before
intervening to keep the hospital going in some form or before breaking
it up. Ministers will not intervene in the process; it will be down to
Monitor and the market. The Minister might say that Monitor had a role
in the previous Government’s system, but the difference is that
this Government’s proposed system is market oriented and there
is much more risk. A competitive market means more risk, so the
Minister needs to address
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000141">&#160;</a>

action to stop disruption to services is essential, and we have
discussed that to some extent under the previous clause. Services that
are not designated could be shut down by a court-appointed
administrator, who will not be required to consult. I am not a
competition or insolvency lawyer, so will the Minister tell me what
administration of the health service a court-appointed administrator
might do? Court-appointed administrators will make decisions on
financial grounds, but what will they know about the health service and
how it and other health service providers are

reduction in activity. Part of the problem with foundation trusts and
hospitals is that the fixed costs in hospitals are great; they
represent a large part of the hospital costs, so it is more difficult,
particularly in response to short-term problems, to reduce them. I am
not sure what consideration will be given to the financial stability of
foundation trusts and the difficulties involved in reducing their fixed
costs. Will the Minister give us some more information about that?

                        <p class="tabbed">Although
I understand some of the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for
Halton about the provisions and I am sympathetic to some of them, the
amendments are unnecessary. As I explained in relation to amendment 615
in the previous debate, clause 113 provides for the Secretary of State
to make regulations to apply relevant parts of insolvency and companies
legislation to FTs. That is for the purposes either of rescuing an
insolvent FT as a going concern or of an orderly winding up of its
affairs in the best interests of creditors as a
whole.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000152">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
I understand it, the amendments are designed to ensure that the
Secretary of State would not make regulations without having had regard
to the need for the other options available—for example, the
need for early intervention procedures. I can reassure the hon. Member
for Halton that of course the Secretary of State would consider all
other options. As I have mentioned on other occasions, such proceedings
would only ever be used as the last resort where pre-insolvency
interventions had not succeeded, and only after continued provision of
designated services had been secured through special administration. We
will come to that point in greater detail in relation to a later
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000153">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A
range of other mechanisms are available that could be used to try to
ensure that foundation trusts would not reach a state in which the
proceedings would be necessary. For example, as we discussed in earlier
debates, under chapter 4 of part 3 of the Bill, Monitor will operate a
licensing regime for all providers of NHS services. One of the core
functions of the licence would be to provide a vehicle for additional
regulation to secure continued access to designated services. We expect

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1026<a class="bkMark" name="Column1026">&#160;</a>
                           </div>that to include requirements to minimise financial risk and controls on
key assets. Monitor would have the power to intervene in response to
risk and to require a provider to take remedial action to address risk
and prevent failure, as I said in relation to amendment
615.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000154">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Before
making regulations under the clause, the Secretary of State would be
obliged to consult Monitor and other persons. That would include the
health care sector and such other persons as he considered appropriate.
At this point, I would like to make it clear that it is our intention
that this important secondary legislation will be subject to full
public consultation, as I have said before. As a further safeguard and
as I have also said before, the regulations will be subject to a
parliamentary resolution by way of the affirmative
procedure.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000155">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">When
the hon. Gentleman was discussing amendment 616, he said that the word
“before” applies an arbitrary cut-off. I hope that I can
reassure him on that by saying that no, it does not. What the word
“before” means and what it means in parliamentary
drafting terms is that it is a standard procedure that consultation
happens before regulations are made. I hope that that helps
him.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000156">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
think that to ensure that the final regulations are robust and
appropriate for the health care sector, it is very important for the
legislation to be subject to extensive consultation before it is made,
rather than during the course of laying and making the regulations as
suggested by the amendment. Given the requirements to consult before
making regulations, and as ordinary insolvency procedures would only
ever be called on as the last resort and once continued access to
designated services had been secured, I consider the proposed changes
to the clause
unnecessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000157">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman raised a number of valid points, which I will address.
He asked at what point local people would know that a hospital was in
trouble. It is my belief that that will be at an early stage. Through
the reports and the meetings of the board of the provider, its
governors and commissioners, the new system will be more transparent,
so there will be more opportunities than there are under the current
regimes for people to be aware at an earlier
stage.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000158">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman also asked what local communities could do in such a
situation. Local commissioners can apply to designate services. That
might, for example, be likely in rural hospitals where there is no
alternative provision. In applying, commissioners will have to consult,
as we have discussed at length. The decision about what services are
protected by Monitor is locally led, as we have also
discussed.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000159">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman was concerned about whether the process would be orderly, and
asked what “orderly” meant. It means that the process
must be orderly for patients. It means protecting essential services,
delivering realistic available alternatives and making sure that the
process is orderly for staff. To recap, it must be orderly for
patients, so that we protect essential services, and it must be orderly
for staff, so that it is managed well.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000160">&#160;</a>

Gentleman asked what the time scale for administration will be. It is
always difficult to give definitive time scales, because they can, by
their very nature, be nebulous. However, I hope I can reassure him by
saying that there is an obligation on insolvency practitioners to act
quickly and efficiently. They will consult on whether special
administration should be

                           </div>time-limited and whether the period may be extended by Monitor or the
court. As I say, however, it is difficult accurately to anticipate such
events.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000161">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman asked whether GP consortia will be covered, even though the
provisions specifically deal with FTs. The answer is no, simply because
this regime applies only to providers, and, as the hon. Gentleman
knows, GP consortia are commissioners. He might have gone on to ask how
a failing GP consortium would be dealt with. In anticipation of that
question—and to save time, because we are making relatively slow
progress this morning—let me tell him that the NHS commissioning
board would be responsible for assessing the performance of GP
consortia. The Bill includes clear powers to enable the board to
intervene where a consortium is failing to discharge its functions or
where there is a risk that it will do so.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000162">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman might also ask what powers the NHS commissioning board will
have in relation to failing GP consortia. To forestall a further
intervention from him, let me say that its powers will include the
ability to request information, explanations and documents relating to
the discharge of consortia’s duties or the appropriateness of
the areas consortia cover; to direct a consortium as to how it should
carry out its functions; to arrange for the board or another consortium
to carry out some functions on behalf of a failing consortium for a set
period; to appoint a new accountable officer; to vary the constitution;
and to dissolve the consortium. I will stop talking about consortia,
because you, Mr Hancock, might feel that I am beginning to
stray.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000163">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Let me now
answer the hon. Gentleman’s questions on one final issue, so
that he has a full range of answers. He raised a number of issues
relating to the role of an insolvency practitioner and he asked who
would be an insolvency practitioner, and I think I can be helpful here,
too. An insolvency practitioner is a person who is qualified to act as
such under insolvency legislation. They are authorised by a range of
recognised professional bodies, including some that are authorised
directly by the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills.
In general, practitioners are accountants or solicitors who are
qualified in examinations, practice requirements and specialised
insolvency matters.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000164">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman could claim, as I think he did, that an insolvency
practitioner will not have appropriate knowledge of the health care
sector. Insolvency practitioners are used to dealing with failure in a
broad range of industry sectors. If a provider fails and pre-insolvency
interventions have not succeeded, the insolvency practitioner will take
on overall control of the provider. The insolvency practitioner will be
able to retain existing management and clinical expertise where
necessary, and to employ additional health care experts if needed. The
practitioner will be required to fulfil its obligations and duties
under the legislation, and more generally will be obliged to adhere to
ethical and professional
guidance.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000165">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman also asked, in effect, why we need an insolvency
practitioner to run a hospital. It is important that insolvency
proceedings should be under the overall supervision of an insolvency
practitioner who is experienced in dealing with failure and turnaround,
but as I have said, the insolvency practitioner will be able to retain
existing management and clinical expertise, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 1028<a class="bkMark" name="Column1028">&#160;</a>
                           </div>where needed, and to take on additional experts if necessary. To answer
his question in the spirit in which he asked it, the insolvency
practitioner will not run the hospital; as I have
said, he will have clinical and administrative health staff to help
him. Given that this is a probing amendment, I hope that the hon.
Gentleman will consider withdrawing it, as he has had such full and
wholesome answers to his questions.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000166">&#160;</a>

read the Bill carefully and understand what it is likely to do. The
application of competition will make it far easier for hospitals and
the services that they provide to be competed out of existence, and the
clause will allow those hospitals to be closed far more efficiently,
shielding the closure

problem arises, they will be taken over, but there is no specific

me to believe that the clause heads for the closure of a hospital. We

I must say that I have a different interpretation,

assessment produced by the Government to explain the Bill’s
impact to the public. Paragraph B112 relates specifically to the issue
of insolvency, and the application of insolvency law to the NHS. It
explains the problem with the way the current regime deals with
failure. It
says:<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000178">&#160;</a>

Gentleman’s colourful interpretation with great interest, but
may I offer him a little advice? There is great danger in taking one
clause in isolation and from that extrapolating a rather vast
interpretation of what may or may not happen. At one point, as
beautifully and eloquently as he was reading, the way his argument was
growing was like listening to “Jackanory”. The point that
must be seriously considered is that there is nothing wrong with having
the clauses on insolvency, because the process of reaching any such
situation has more provisions and safeguards than any business would
have. All the processes are designed to protect; there is not the
emphasis on failure that he talks
about.<a class="bkMark" name="11032456000180">&#160;</a>

reach the point of failure. I fully concede that there are provisions
in the Bill to try to stop things reaching that point, but the risk is
clear in both the notes and the Bill that the possibility of services
failing because of competition will increase. The application of
insolvency law and involvement of insolvency practitioners—or
asset strippers as they are known in other contexts—coming in to
take over a hospital’s exit from the market are very clear

of the impact assessment that we hear the Government say that, to work
efficiently, competition must allow market exit—meaning closure,
because we are talking about hospitals. They go on to explain why
applying an insolvency regime addresses the issue we have with
inefficient exits from the market, under the terms of the Bill. The
