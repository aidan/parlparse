                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendments would establish pilots. One of the premises behind the Bill
is that crime and policing are in crisis. However, figures released
just last week continue to show significant falls in crime. The figures
to September 2010 show that recorded crime is down by 7%, and that is
on top of—the Association of Police Authorities briefing tells
us this—a 30% fall in crime year on year over the past decade.
According to the most recent British crime survey, crime is at its
lowest level for three decades. It dipped below 10 million offences
with a 9% fall last year to the lowest level since
comparable records began. We also learn from the APA that figures
showing confidence in the police are rising, although they are still
not high enough—none of us would say that they were. The
Government’s Bill says that change is needed, and although hon.
Members will see from our amendments that we accept that the status quo
needs to be examined and changed, we do not accept that the measure is
made necessary because of a dramatic crime problem or a major problem
with confidence in the police.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000024">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Although some
of the witnesses from whom we heard last week said that they did not
believe in pilots, it is important to note that hardly any of them
supported what the Government are doing. When the Minister responds to
the debate, it will be interesting if he will tell us who supports
their actions—apart from himself, the whipped Government Members
sitting behind him and a couple of people around No. 10 Downing street.
In other words, why is a pilot not
necessary?<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000025">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">So
many people support a pilot that it is a given that we ought to conduct
one. When hon. Members talk to their local councillors, police
authorities and everyone else, I do not think that they will find that
their constituencies are full of people demanding the introduction of
police and crime commissioners. In fact, I have not heard one person
demanding that—I do not know whether anyone else has. Perhaps
the Government’s deliberate ploy is to sneak this through
without anyone realising what is happening. No one has come to my
surgery to say that there is a problem, so let us hold the pilots and
see whether people want these
measures.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000026">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I agree with that. The Minister for Policing and
Criminal Justice is responsible for policing in England and Wales, so I
want him to tell us who in Wales supports what he is doing. According
to the submissions that we have received from Police Authorities of
Wales, it is totally opposed to what the Government are doing, yet the
Minister ploughs on because he thinks that he knows better. This is an
important point, because if there was huge pent-up demand and people
were saying, “We would have better policing on our streets and
we would improve how we tackle crime if only we had police and crime
commissioners,” there would be no need for
pilots.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000028">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
would have thought that those who have opposed the scheme in their
written submissions to us would welcome pilots so that they could find
out whether they were completely wrong. Authorities either oppose what
the Government are doing or have real concerns about it. I would
suggest that Surrey police authority does not support the
Government—it has real concerns about or opposes the scheme.
Staffordshire police authority’s submission will be of interest
to the hon. Member for Cannock Chase, who will have read it and will,
no doubt, have received correspondence from the authority. That
excellent document expresses opposition to what the Government are
doing. The police authorities of Lancashire, West Yorkshire, Greater
Manchester, Chester, Dorset, Devon and Cornwall, and Avon and Somerset,
as well as Police Authorities of Wales, have all written to say to the
Government, “You’ve got this wrong.” They say one
of three things: that the model is wrong; that they have real concerns;
or that the Government should not be doing
this.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000029">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">A
pilot would give the Government an opportunity. It would allow the hon.
Member for Cannock Chase to say to Staffordshire police authority,
“Don’t worry. I think you’re wrong, but
I’m not determined or arrogant enough to say that I’m
right and you’re wrong. We’ll have a pilot and then
let’s see who’s right.” That would be a good thing
for him to say to the police authority, given that it is totally
opposed to what the Government are doing. Every member of the Committee
needs to understand this

are doing is wrong, how is it possible that they are all wrong and he
is right? Amendment 102 would give us an opportunity to test his
argument. Let us see whether all the people who have written to us have
got it wrong and whether the Government have seen the light because the

                        <p class="tabbed">Members of
the Committee might not have noticed this, but pilots are now even more
necessary, following the withdrawal of amendment 7. That Liberal
Democrat amendment was originally going to be the lead amendment of the
third group on the selection list. We would have supported the
interesting proposal that it put forward, so it is regrettable that it
has been withdrawn. If Liberal Democrat Members do not wish to return
to it, we will. Liberal Democrat members of the Committee are
part of the Government, yet the fact that they tabled an amendment
stating that a referendum should take place in every area means that
they have similar concerns to those that lead me to say that there
should be pilots. In a sense, that amendment was an attempt to
determine who was in favour of police and crime commissioners. It would
have let local people have their say, because there is no groundswell
of opinion.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000034">&#160;</a>

interested to hear why the hon. Member for Cambridge has withdrawn
amendment 7, although I know the real reason—the hon. Member for
Cannock Chase, to whom he is talking, has done a good job. However, I
do not believe that the hon. Member for Cambridge woke up yesterday and
thought, “My God, I have made a terrible mistake. That amendment
I put down simply did not make sense and I will
withdraw it.”<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000035">&#160;</a>

it is directly relevant to amendment 102 and pilots. Where is the
groundswell of opinion? The hon. Members for Cambridge and for
Edinburgh West clearly wished to test where there is support for police
and crime commissioners, which is my point. That support could be
determined through a referendum in which local people could vote to
say, “Absolutely. We want police and crime commissioners in our
area. Goodness me, Cambridgeshire would be so much better with a police
and crime commissioner.” Alternatively, it should be determined
by holding pilots in the areas that are demanding

withdrawal of amendment 7 makes amendment 102 even more
important, because the pilot would test the operation of the clause
with respect to PCCs. We have suggested that the pilots should take
place in two or four police areas, but the Government could have three
or six. No doubt—this is why a pilot could take place rather
than a referendum—queues of authorities will demand to be part
of the pilot schemes, although it would be interesting to know how
many.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000039">&#160;</a>

it, Northumbria announced that it was willing to make changes and to
improves, but in the way that it wanted to, rather than according to
the model that has been set out. One of the important things about a
pilot—Northumbria is a good example, and others may want to come
forward—is that local people and the local authority would
decide that they wanted to participate. I would have thought that the
Government’s localism agenda would support pilots, because local
authorities would be demanding to be part of the change, testing the
system for the Government, and being at the forefront of the radical
change that everybody wants, even if they do not realise how good it
is. The localism agenda fits well with the amendment that we have
tabled.

for transition, because of the lack of clarity about the changeover

consequence of moving from one system straight into another, with no
shadowing or transition arrangements and no real clarity in the Bill

up and down the country are really worried about the management and
structural changes that are going to take place without any evidence
about the consequences or any certainty. My hon. Friend makes the point
that the Government know there is a problem in that respect, which is
why they have shadow arrangements in place for mayors, to iron out

the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children oppose
it—the list goes on. Last week, the police officers who gave
good evidence to us were very professional and said they would do their
duty, and of course they will do whatever the Government put in place.
However, the response to the Bill from the police service in terms of
support is deafening. I do not meet many police officers in private who
think this is a good idea. I am speaking not only about all the police
authorities but about police officers themselves.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000048">&#160;</a>

That is good to know. Some of us have suggested pilots or have tabled
amendments looking at different models of accountability. It is wrong
to frame the debate, as is sometimes done, as if those who oppose the
measure are dinosaurs or are not progressive, or simply want to defend
the status quo. There are good reasons why people oppose it. They think
that it lacks clarity or could have unforeseen and unintended
consequences. It is wrong to say that those people believe that
everything about the current system is perfect and works as well as it
should, or that we could not do better. Where there is virtual
unanimity in opposing what the Government propose, a Committee of the
House and Members of Parliament ought to recognise that. The Government
should not just plough on regardless. That is the point of the
amendment. I will come to some of the other problems that must be
addressed, as I am interested to hear what the Minister has to say, but

those who support the Minister on the issue of direct elections say
that his proposed model is wrong and that he needs to think again and
change his mind. Why does he not use a pilot to see which model works
best? I have heard him expound the virtues of localism on many
occasions and talk at great length and with eloquence about how
important it is that local people make decisions. Why is he imposing
structures from the centre on the local level irrespective of what
local people tell him? Because what they say to him does not fit his
point of view. That is not localism; it is central diktat.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000051">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">When I was a
Minister, and the Minister and the Under-Secretary were in opposition,
they used to accuse me of knowing better than local people. It is
amazing how things change. I distinctly remember being asked,
“Why does the Minister think he knows best? Why does the
Minister ride roughshod over local opinion? Why doesn’t the
Minister test some of what he’s saying and see whether it
actually works?” The amendment provides an opportunity for them
to put into practice what they said just a few months ago when they
were in opposition.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000052">&#160;</a>

the case that a few months into a new Government, all the rhetoric that
we heard about localism and central diktat has now been put in the
dustbin, and that they are determined in power to impose

shakes his head. Let local people decide what they want for their own
area. The Bill will not do so. It will impose on them a model of police
governance that the Government think is best, irrespective of what
local people, local authorities and local councils
say.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000053">&#160;</a>

time. One of the supposed reasons why the Con-Dems are proposing the
measures is to get power closer to the people in the name of localism.
Could there be more sinister reasons? We have seen in many Departments
that the Con-Dems are changing what measurements and figures are
collected and collated. Within policing, they have already downgraded
the figures for antisocial behaviour and told police forces that they
do not need to collect those figures any more. They are manipulating
the figures and saying that they are passing them down.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000054">&#160;</a>

measure takes off and police commissioners are put in place, I can see
a time when we as national elected representatives will table questions
on antisocial behaviour and crime and Ministers—perhaps the
Ministers here today—will answer that those figures are not
collected centrally any more. This power is being devolved to the
regions. Ministers will do a Pontius Pilate and try to wash their hands
of national control of crime in this country, because they know that
the economic agenda that they are putting forward will increase
crime.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000055">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">To be fair,
there is a real issue about central versus local. When we provide
things locally, the Government always say, “Oh my God,
we’ve given away all our power and everybody is asking us what
we will do, when we have no responsibility for it”. There is
therefore a real dilemma, and my hon. Friend is right: if we give
something away locally, sooner or later, when we ask questions, the
Government will get it back because they will not know what the answer
is. It is a real problem.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000058">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We are
suggesting that there should be pilots; I have set out the context for
them and why we need them. However, there are a number of important
points that the Minister needs to answer. First, we could see through
the pilots whether politicisation of the police, which some people say
is something to be concerned about, is just a myth or a handy argument,
or whether there is real truth in that claim. I say that because people
really are worried about the politicisation of the police.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000059">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let me make a
serious point to the Minister. Operational independence, or
“operational responsibility” as Patten called it, is
crucial. I know that the Minister accepts that, but he needs to ensure
that a draft code of practice, or memorandum of understanding, is made
available to the Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000060">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We have
tabled new clause 2, which we will come on to discuss. However, if we
are talking about a pilot to test politicisation, there should be a
code of practice, as the Select Committee on Home Affairs discussed.
I believe that the Minister himself has said that a code of
practice needs to be considered. If the Government are considering
establishing a code of practice or a memorandum of understanding that
sets out the responsibilities of the chief constable vis-à-vis
the police and crime commissioner, a draft of that code should be made
available to the Committee so that we can look at it and see what we
think of it. Although it would not have the force of legislation, it
would give us an idea of what might actually come to pass.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000061">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As I have
said to the Minister, politicisation is a big issue with respect to the
Bill. The code of practice would help, but so would a pilot. In fact,
the code of practice could be tested in the pilot. Members of this
Committee, some of whom serve on the Home Affairs Committee will know
from the evidence that they have received about the debate that is
taking place about the need for operational responsibility. The hon.
Member for Edinburgh West was a police officer and he knows the
fundamental importance of operational responsibility. That is why a
code of practice was suggested by the Select Committee. Should such a
code not be made available to the Committee? Should a draft not be
produced, or suggestions about what might be included in it? If there
is no time to do that now, the pilots would be a way of developing that
code. Where is the code of practice and what is the Minister’s
answer to the claim about politicisation?<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000062">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The pilots
will also give us an opportunity to test the issue of local
accountability. Many of us are concerned about the fact that the Bill
creates a force-wide commissioner. For example, there would be a
force-wide commissioner for the whole of Devon and Cornwall, an area
which, according to the APA, is 180 miles wide—good luck to the
commissioner there. Dyfed-Powys police cover an area of 10,000 sq km.
There are 2.5 million residents in Greater Manchester and there are
25 parliamentary constituencies in the west midlands.

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister has made a fundamental error with respect to democratic
accountability. If he piloted different models as, according to my hon.
Friend the Member for Houghton and Sunderland South, Northumbria has
suggested, he would be able to test them. The Minister has got it
fundamentally wrong. I challenge any member of this Committee to stand
up and say that any of their constituents have come to them and said,
“As my MP, I want you to tell my police force in
Staffordshire”—or their police force in
Derbyshire—“that its fraud policy is completely wrong,
its collaboration arrangements are completely wrong.” They do
not come to us about that; they come to us about youths at the end of
their street, noisy neighbours, drug dealing in the local car park and
other such issues. The model proposed by the Minister is flawed, as it
represents the wrong level of democratic accountability. He could pilot
different models and see whether I am wrong and he is
right.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000064">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister may say, “The shadow Minister has got this completely
wrong, because he does not understand that in the Bill there are all
those local accountability arrangements. All those things that will
happen and all those things will establish local democratic
accountability. If the shadow Minister understood that, he would
realise that there will be the PCC at the top and all of those other
people underneath. Those people would tell the PCC about things
locally, and the PCC would be able to sort it out and things would be
fine.” I would not believe him, and I do not think that most
people would do so either. I think most people, and many Government
Members, too, think that there is a problem with the size of the areas
that PCCs will cover.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000065">&#160;</a>

Nottinghamshire—again, we could test this with a
pilot—somebody living close to Leicester will not see a PCC as
relevant to the policing of issues local to them or to issues local to
somebody living in the north of the county, which is virtually in
Sheffield. It is just not tenable or feasible, yet the Minister says
that we do not need pilots and that we do not need to test this; we can
do it because he is right and everybody else is
wrong.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000066">&#160;</a>

authorities in England and Wales are grouped into families, which are
likeminded, of equal size, and with equal socio-demographic profiles.
Does my hon. Friend think that there should be at least one pilot in
each of those families? The PCCs might be right for police authorities
of a certain size, but not for others. We need a pilot in each family
to get a picture before we have a national
roll-out.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000067">&#160;</a>

accountability arrangements. If that is the case, where is the
clarity—as the president of the Association of Chief Police
Officers has said—in what is supposed to happen? There is none.
All the Minister does is make pronouncements. He does not explain to
the Committee, “This is what the PCC will do; this is the
relationship with local authorities; this is the relationship with
local people.” He says, “The PCC will be responsible for
the strategic direction of policing in the area.” Frankly, most
people will throw their hands up and ask what on earth he is talking
about. That is why pilots are important, as my hon. Friend the Member
for Birmingham, Selly Oak suggested, with big rural forces or an urban
force. If the proposal were piloted in areas with a huge force, it
would be possible to test it and see whether it was right or
wrong.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000071">&#160;</a>

Second Reading, the Home Secretary spoke about the PCC and criminal
justice. The PCC is responsible for the strategic direction of
policing, but what about criminal justice? What is the relationship? Do
we need to say anything about what influence the PCC would have? In my
experience, some of the dissatisfaction is not because of the police;
it is because of the criminal justice system. People have or have not
gone to court, something has not happened in court, or something has
broken down—and the police get frustrated about that, too. In
response, the Home Secretary seemed to say that it was necessary to
look at what the relationship would be between the PCC and criminal
justice. What are we saying, actually? Again, if the proposal were
piloted, we would know whether the establishment of a PCC made a real
difference to confidence, with respect to the police, or whether the
problem was not with the police, but with the criminal justice system
and how that operated.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000072">&#160;</a>

clarity that proves there is no need for pilots. We need pilots

I asked witnesses about the purpose. The Bill says that the purpose is
to have a bit of review, a bit of overview, a bit of
something—what actually is it? Is it to hold the PCC to account?
I cannot answer the question; it is for the Minister to answer. Surely,
in a pilot, we could tease that out and see whether there is something

without clarity. It is perfectly reasonable for me to say,

                           </strong> That is absolutely right, which is why there is a
lack of clarity about the role of police and crime panels. The
provision looks as if it was bolted on to the Bill, because the
Government decided to establish police and crime commissioners and,
exactly as my hon. Friend has pointed out, then thought:
“Goodness me, we will really be attacked over one person looking
after a whole area—we need a police and crime panel.”
However, the relationship between the commissioners and the panels is
unclear.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000078">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">No
doubt, the Minister will tell us that we do not need a pilot, because
of what the role of the police and crime panels is vis-à-vis
that of the police and crime commissioners. He can say that he is
perfectly satisfied that a pilot is not needed, because the way in
which the police and crime panel will be able to veto the precept, with
the requisite three-quarters majority, is fine. What is the quorum, by
the way? It would be interesting to know that, or whether there is no
quorum.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000079">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
the appointment of the chief constable, the police and crime panel has
a veto, with the requisite majority, although we do not know how that
will work. Supposing that the police and crime commissioners are
established, how will it work if one decides to sack the chief
constable? We have no idea of the consequences of that, but we are
giving police and crime commissioners the absolute power to do that,
and police and crime panels will not have any power of veto. If a
police and crime commissioner does not like the chief constable, he
will have to go through the various procedures, but in the end that
will be his decision. Unless I have read the Bill incorrectly, the
police and crime commissioner is omnipotent. I would like
the Minister to tell us exactly what the police and crime
commissioner’s powers are and, again, whether we need a pilot to
test whether there is any danger in the prospect of the police and
crime commissioner exercising such
powers.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000080">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
have spoken at length on those points, but they are real issues
relating to why a pilot is needed. It might seem unclear to the
Committee what the answers are. 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 148<a class="bkMark" name="Column148">&#160;</a>
                           </div>It is unclear to me, which is why I am asking such questions.
The Minister must give us real clarity in answering many of my points.
Another concern is that, as the Bill is drafted, police and crime
commissioners may be focused purely on local issues, as we heard in
evidence.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000081">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
may have misled the Minister. So that he does not correct me for saying
something wrong in Committee—I have read the Bill again and I
own up if I get something wrong—I think that I said that the
police and crime commissioners do not have to have regard to clause 79.
After re-reading the Bill, I think that they
do.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000082">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Will
the Minister explain, on the provisions in the Bill on police and crime
commissioners and strategic matters, why he thinks that a proper
balance will be struck between the local policing requirements and the
strategic national policing requirements? Is it not better to test in a
pilot whether that is the right way forward? There is a real danger,
and we need to see how the system will operate. If somebody is elected
on a mandate to pile more police on the street, or to do this or that,
we need to see how that will work vis-à-vis a chief constable,
who may understand the need for such policies and give them the
priorities that they deserve, but who will also want to give priority
to sexual violence, counter-terrorism, domestic violence, fraud,
economic crime and collaboration with other forces. Do we not need to
see how that works, before we allocate all such powers for every single
police force in the country? As I have said, we need a pilot to test
the local versus the
strategic.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000083">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On
an earlier point about elections, there is a need for pilots to see how
they will work. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak
talked about the importance of transition. Surely the Minister
understands the real nervousness and worry that exist on that matter.
Will a pilot not help us to see how the transition from our current
arrangements to an elected police and crime commissioner would
work?<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000084">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Everyone
can think of their own area. We have a police authority, which exists
up until March or April of next year. Perhaps the Minister will tell us
when he expects the police authorities to finish. We know that we have
the elections in May 2012. What does he expect to happen? The police
authority currently sets the budget and the precept, so we need a pilot
to see how this will work.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000085">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">When will the
police authority exists until? Perhaps the Minister will tell us when
the police authority will end. The election takes place in May 2012.
When does the police commissioner take over? What happens to all the
staff and resources? Are the staff sacked or do they move on? What
happens to all the property, the debt and the various arrangements that
the police authority has taken on board? When it comes to the
changeover point, will the police authority have to have an account of
what the police and crime commissioner wants to do? Again, there is no
clarity in this. The Minister can say that he will lay out what should
happen in regulation, but surely if we had a pilot we could see whether
the system worked or whether it led to
confusion.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000086">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">A
pilot would also help us to see how the elections would work. We would
see who was prepared to stand, how much interest there was, how many
people rushed

extremism may come from the direct elections for police and crime
commissioners. The Minister says that we need to trust the people.

extremism carries any
weight.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000087">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Would a pilot not allow us to test out the
costings of the measure? As far as I am aware, no information has been
produced on that. The figure of £50 million appears to have been
agreed for the comprehensive spending review. A pilot would enable us
to test out whether the costings for the election are accurate, given
the variety of areas and sizes of force covered. It would also enable
us to find out whether or not people understood the Government’s
decision to have a first-past-the-post or an alternative vote system
depending on the number of candidates. I personally think that that
could be a recipe for
confusion.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000088">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My hon. Friend makes a good point as to why there
is a need for a pilot. First, we would see how the Minister’s
proposed electoral system would work. Secondly, we could test out some
of the costings, over which there has been some dispute. We could see
whether or not the Minister’s costings are accurate. For
example, we know that figures of £50 million and
£100 million have been bandied about. Just as an
aside, at a time when police officers are being cut, it is amazing that
the Government can find money for this. When the Minister responds, he
may want to say that there is no need for a pilot, because the costings
are absolutely secure. He may lay the figures on the record, so that
they can be analysed and scrutinised by
everyone.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000089">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let
me conclude by saying that at the end of the day, what we all
want—I know that the Minister wants this as well—is to
see crime reduced even further. We want people to feel safer on the
streets and for them to have appropriate and proper influence over
policing in their area. On the need for pilots, the Minister is almost
messianic in his belief that if we have police and crime commissioners,
all those things will be achieved. What the Minister has failed to
properly demonstrate in a way that convinces all—or
many—of the professionals and interest groups is that he is
right and that they are wrong. In saying why he disagrees and
disapproves of the pilots, the Minister needs to tell the Committee why
he believes that we do not need to test this and why we do not need the
pilots.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000090">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In arguing
against the amendments, the Minister should tell the Committee that
having police and crime commissioners will reduce crime, make people
feel that they can influence their policing and tackle some of the
problems that he says exist. However, the Minister has not made the
case. He has asserted the case, but that is a totally different point.
I have said this before, and he has heard me say it: he needs to argue
the case and not assert it. He is asserting the case for police and
crime commissioners against all those people whom I listed at the
beginning of my contribution who are against it. He is not arguing the
case. All those people have lined up and said that the Minister has got
all this wrong. I am saying that he should pilot it and prove it one
way or the other, or win the argument. When he responds, I want him to
argue the case and not assert it, because all we are getting at the
moment is Government assertion, not
argument.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000091">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I want to make a couple of brief comments in
support of the amendment. My hon. Friend the Member for Gedling is
absolutely right. The difficulty with these proposals is the speed with
which the Government have approached them. If they are a good idea, it
would be perfectly possible for the Minister to take people with him
and demonstrate the merits of the proposals. The difficulty that we
have in dealing with the legislation is the speed with which it has
been introduced, because there is virtually no evidence to support some
of the main elements of the proposals. The witness sessions that we had
did not do much to support the Government’s case. The difficulty
is fundamentally that this has been done too
quickly.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000092">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
proposals look like change for the sake of change, which is hardly a
Conservative philosophy. In fact, one would have thought that that was
almost what the Conservative party existed to avoid. However, here
the Conservatives are rushing into a radical set of
changes—the provision is quite liberal in that
respect—without bothering to think through the consequences. I
do not know whether the difficulty is that the Bill is an example of
coalition thinking, but we would certainly do a greater service to the
police and the public if the provision were to proceed at a more
rational pace.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000093">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I do
not—I have not heard a single Minister explain
this—understand what the hurry is. So many issues are
confronting the police at the moment in terms of funding problems. For
example, as part of major changes to the West Midlands police, it has
had to undergo an exercise called Project Paragon, which has involved
rearranging the basic command units into much larger local policing
units in anticipation of some of the funding issues that will arise.
The force is currently locked into that cycle of change. On top of
that, it has discovered that the funding problems that it will have to
contend with are much greater than it had originally been led to
believe. The force is now looking at whether there will have to be a
Paragon 2, as it tries to accommodate further
problems.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000094">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
is what the police have to deal with at the moment, and they are doing
so in a situation in which, because of the freeze in recruitment, there
is already some evidence of rising crime. On Saturday night, we had a
major piece in the local Birmingham paper about a police officer
reporting a rise in burglary to a local tasking group. He was
struggling to deal with it, because of the number of officers lost to
the recruitment freeze. Given that, the issue of the Olympics and the
continuing problems of terrorism, it seems a funny time to embark on a
massive structural change for the police without explaining in more
detail how it will work and what it is designed to
achieve.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000095">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Another
thing in the Bill that surprised me is that the London model looks a
lot better, at first glance, than the model proposed for the rest of
the country. However, the more I read it, the more I cannot understand
why such different conclusions are reached for London and for the west
midlands. Other than the London Mayor already existing and having
certain responsibilities, I am not entirely clear how that decision was
arrived at. It seems strange that everyone is required to pay taxes and
council tax, and that the Government insist that their interest is
accountability—the public having a greater say in policing and
accountability for policing—and yet London is being offered a
much more democratic model than the rest of the country.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000096">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
London, the Mayor is able to influence policing in accordance with all
the other concerns of the electorate. He can take such matters into
account and give advice. In Birmingham, for example, we could have a
powerful directly elected mayor, but he would not be able to influence
the police agenda at all, because he would be faced with an equally
powerful police and crime commissioner who had all the cards in his
hand. That is another example of the Bill not being thought through.

pilots—<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000097">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My point is that, had we had a pilot, we would
have been able to test the London model against a different model for
different parts of the country. As it is, we will move full steam ahead
into the arrangements and, if there are problems and inconsistencies,
they will emerge only once the scheme is up and running, by which time
will be either engaged in firefighting or having to live with the
consequences of an ill-thought-out
proposal.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000099">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Similarly,
we are not clear what police and crime panels are designed to do. They
look like an extra grafted on to the proposals when the Government
realised that selling their ideas would be increasingly difficult. It
is astonishing how a Government who talk about efficiency, reducing
bureaucracy and regulation, and promoting localism have ended up with a
situation in which we have an extremely costly police and crime
commissioner and, in addition, police and crime panels. Originally, we
had a police authority. Now we have an extra layer in the bureaucracy,
without any idea what it will cost or what benefit it will bring. Once
again, piloting would have allowed us to look at the possible
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000100">&#160;</a>

final part that we are being asked to support that should have been
tested out, and which the Government might come to regret more than
anything else, is the introduction of an incredibly complex change in
the structure and management of our policing without any idea of the
cost. The Government spend every day of the week telling us that they
are obsessed by the deficit and with saving money, but we have no idea
what the salary of police commissioners will be, whether it will be the
same throughout the country and whether it will be based on the number
of people whom the commissioners purport to represent. There are no
costings.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000101">&#160;</a>

could make the reorganisation of the national health service look like

wholly about. My fear is that it could become a consultant’s

before we get into the full-scale introduction of the plan because no
one knows who the people will be, how they will be appointed, what
duties they will be appointed to do and, above all, what they will
cost. To introduce a radical change to our model of policing without
identifying its financial implications and without giving people a
chance to understand what the change will mean suggests that the
Government do not have much confidence in their own proposals. They do
not want pilots, because they do not want people testing out the ideas
and looking objectively at what is
happening.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000104">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
is the fundamental flaw in the Bill, and it is why we should at this
stage ask the Minister to think again. If the ideas are good, it should
be possible to defend them. If the measure is not a case of simply
taking a gamble with the policing of our country, it should be possible
for the Minister to justify it. At least he should have no fear of a
phased introduction, which will answer some questions as the plans
unfold.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000105">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful, Mr Howarth, for the opportunity
to serve under your chairmanship. I wish to make a few
points, following on from the compelling case put forward by my hon.
Friend the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak, in support of piloting
such a fundamental change to policing in England and setting out the
dangers.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000106">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
genuinely do not understand why the Government are putting forward such
an idea. The evidence does not back it up. We have not received
evidence to support what they are planning to do. Again, I can only
agree with my hon. Friend. It seems to be change for change’s
sake. I am not convinced of the benefits of such a provision for local
people. Why do we not try pilots first? If local people are so
convinced that the measure will improve accountability and the service
that they receive from the local police force, let us try it. Let us
hear what they say, and we can come back and look at it
again.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000107">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
wish to refer briefly to the local differences and variations that are
important for us to consider. We have not received sufficient clarity
about them and I do not consider that the Government have really
addressed them. Northumbria force has nearly 1.5 million people in the
area, with 16 MPs and 400 councillors. My constituency shares a border
with Durham, which has an entirely different police force. It covers a
population of about 600,000, seven MPs and 179 councillors. It is not
clear that we will see an increase in accountability. What might work
in Northumbria, if piloted, might not work in Durham or vice versa.
Arguably, such a pilot might work better in a smaller force. A force
the size of Northumbria, which stretches from the border with Scotland
to Durham covers a huge, geographic area with very different
communities—urban, rural and with different
needs.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000108">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What
local people want when policing is being dealt with in their area are
solutions to the very local problems that they face, whether it is
antisocial behaviour, vandalism or dog fouling I am not convinced that
someone who lives in Berwick, Alnwick or Morpeth could sufficiently 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 153<a class="bkMark" name="Column153">&#160;</a>
                           </div>address the needs of my constituents in Sunderland, and I do not see how
that could be arguably an improvement on the system that we have. We
have police authorities, imperfect though they are, and local people at
least have one representative sitting on those bodies. I would
appreciate some clarity regarding the policing and crime panels because
I am not convinced that the diversity and geographic breadth will be
dealt with by the new
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000109">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
we had a pilot, we could also look at how existing partnership
arrangements work. I certainly do not have a clamour of local people
saying to me, “I’m desperate for a directly elected
commissioner.” They say that they absolutely want solutions to
local policing problems, but many of the steps that we have taken in my
area address that, with a multi-agency approach. For example, when
someone has a problem with an antisocial tenant or a family on an
estate that continually causes huge problems, that is dealt with in a
co-ordinated way by housing, the local provider, the council and the
police. I am concerned that the new arrangements will
jeopardise the effective local partnership working that we have in
Sunderland.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000110">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
need to see the case for the new arrangements. If they work, fantastic,
but can we not try them to see if they work, to see whether local
people believe that there is an improvement or whether they have less
to say than before? At the moment, local people in my area can directly
approach their local councillor, and he or she can take the matter,
whether it is a particular family or a particular
issue—fly-tipping, for example—to a local multi-agency
problem-solving group. The groups do not deal exclusively with crime,
but with the whole range of problems that an area faces, including
crime, the criminal justice system and some issues that people regard
as a blight on their lives but are not necessarily crime per se. The
councillor who takes the issue forward can ultimately raise it with the
police authority; the method is effective. Why, therefore, rush to this
hasty, ill-considered approach, which has no support, without
considering the damage that it could do to existing local partnership
arrangements, particularly on issues that perhaps are less prominent
but that really affect people’s lives, for example child
protection and domestic and sexual violence? Will the police and crime
commissioner be desperate to get votes off the back of fouling and
litter, to the detriment of the less visible but incredibly important
aspects of policing that sometimes are little understood but make a
real difference and, in some families, save
lives?<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000111">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Visibility
has been put forward as a reason to move to police and crime
commissioners. In its submission to the Home Affairs Committee,
Northumbria police authority stated that it carries out surveys of how
local people view its work, and that between 2005 and 2010 there was an
increase in visibility, in local people being aware of the police
authority’s role and of what it could do, and in their feeling
that the authority met their needs. If that is the case, why not look
at improving the democratic accountability of police authorities,
pushing to increase both accountability and visibility, without
suddenly moving towards a completely different system? Why not pilot
the alternative model of an independent police board that Northumbria
police authority put forward in its submission, to see whether that
works and whether it is the role that we see for police
authorities?<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000112">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        <p class="tabbed">My final point
is on cost, and my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak has
covered the matter well. The cost is not clear, but if,
through the pilots, we decide that the benefits outweigh
the cost, let us proceed. If local people feel that it makes a
difference to their lives and the cost is worth it, let us proceed.
However, at a time when my constituents are facing huge cuts to
policing budgets and damage could be done to front-line policing, I am
not convinced that the change would be a priority for them. We talk
about democratic accountability, so why can my constituents not have a
say as to whether they would rather the money be wasted on pointless
commissioner elections, or be spent on bobbies on the beat, which face
being cut? I can tell hon. Members which they would prefer, and it
would not be pointless
elections.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000113">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Through
the pilots, we could establish whether the new approach offers value
for money, and we cannot establish that now because we do not have
accurate costings. The briefing from the House of Commons Library
suggests that it could be an additional cost, estimated at
£136.5 million over 10 years. In our straitened financial
circumstances, I can think of a far better way to spend more than
£130 million, and that would be in maintaining front-line
policing and the often unseen but very valuable work that police forces
do. Before we press ahead, I ask the Government to reconsider and look
at the evidence to see whether the new approach offers value for money
or whether the solution simply does not fit what they are trying to
achieve.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000114">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I am a great
believer in “if it isn’t broken, don’t fix
it”. I am at a loss to understand why the Con-Dem Government
chose to push forward—or ram forward—this Bill at such an
early stage in this Parliament. Consider all the problems that have
accrued from the biggest international recession the world has seen
since the 1930s, and the economic and social impact that that has had
on this and other societies. The Government have chosen to focus on a
massive change—the biggest we have seen in policing organisation
for decades—and to push it through at speed as a top priority. I
am not saying everything in the garden is perfect—there need to
be changes at the edges—but if things are not broken, why change
them in such a drastic
way?<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000116">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
changes are to be implemented, we should have pilots to monitor the
changes. I mentioned the 43 police forces in England and Wales in my
earlier intervention. In my constituency in the Vale of Clwyd, we have
the North Wales police authority. It is one of the best functioning
police authorities in the country. Out of the 376 crime and disorder
partnerships in England and Wales, we were the third best in my county
of Denbighshire. I fear that the system that we have in north Wales
will be upset if a police and crime commissioner is thrust on us. His
or her priorities may not be the priorities of my community. I
mentioned that the 43 policing authorities are grouped into families.
We need pilots on geographical areas. We also need to pilot different
models. We should pilot a model that includes a list of things that the
commissioner should do. A commissioner should visit other
areas—I think we are going to visit that later. The commissioner
should ensure that the articulate middle

			Column number: 155<a class="bkMark" name="Column155">&#160;</a>
                           </div>classes, who can read and write sufficiently, will not dominate the time
and the agenda of a police and crime commissioner, because those are
the people most likely to
vote.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000117">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
need a pilot in which it is specified that the commissioner must visit
every community and listen to them, especially the communities that may
not articulate their concerns. In such a pilot, the commissioner would
go to the most crime-ridden communities at least two or three times a
year and attend to the people verbally and orally rather than in
writing. They would go out at grass-roots level to see what those
people’s concerns were and address them. If that is not
specified, there will be a logical willingness on the part of the
police and crime commissioner to go to the communities that elect
him.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000118">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I fear the
implementation of the legislation now—without piloting—at
a time of massive economic and possibly social unrest. We have seen the
figures today—gross domestic product has fallen by 0.5%. I think
we are heading for a second recession, and we all know the consequences
of recession—an increase in crime levels, especially among the
young. The Government have made other changes—abolishing
education maintenance allowances and the future jobs
fund—affecting the very cohort that tends towards criminality.
Those young people could be tempted to go back to a negative way of
life instead of a positive one.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000119">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We must
consider the timing of the introduction of the legislation and not
rush. We need pilots in different geographical areas, using different
models so that we can learn which is best. We might have different
types of police commissioner and different rules in different areas of
the
country.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000120">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Again,
the pace, temper and tone of the measures, which are being rammed down
people’s throats without any pilots, will lead to poor
legislation. The No. 1 concern of people in my constituency is not the
structure or who is at the top; it is who is at the bottom dealing with
them and their problems. As Rick Muir of the IPPR articulated in his
evidence:<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000121">&#160;</a>

most concerned about…whether the police are responsive to their
concerns. If they ring up, do the police respond quickly? Do the police
deal with their problems adequately? The commissioner model does not
tackle the whole set of issues around responsiveness, which is key to
improving public confidence in the
police.”<em>––</em>[<em>Official Report, Police

Muir was one of our key witnesses last week. Those are his concerns,
and I echo them. If the police do not address issues on the ground,
they will not win public confidence. According to Rick Muir, who is an
expert on the subject, they do not do so at the moment, so let us
tinker around with the system. Let us have pilots—hopefully in
my area, if the Committee accepts our amendments—that deal with
ensuring that police commissioners go to the communities that need
them. The measures are totally rushed and flawed. We might learn from
past rushed legislation: legislate in haste and repent at
leisure.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000122">&#160;</a>

ago, I was sitting in the Public Gallery watching a young,
up-and-coming rising star on the Labour Benches debating with the then
Secretary of State for the Environment, Michael Howard, who is now Lord
Howard of Lympne. The up-and-coming rising star on the Opposition
Benches was Tony Blair. I am sure that he was fired by the
same passion as the hon. Member for

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman’s case for pilots, which is really a case against
police and crime commissioners in general, rested first on the
suggestion that there is no crisis. He and other hon. Members asked
what problem we are trying to fix. I do not think that hon. Members
have understood the importance of our agenda to decentralise power in
this country and release the grip of the centre and the Home Office
over policing matters that should be local. To do so, we must enhance
local accountability. Otherwise, we would effectively be allowing the
use of capture.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000125">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Although the
hon. Gentleman points to falling crime figures as evidence that the
system is not broken, he did not attend to the figures showing that in
spite of the fact that confidence in the police is rising, which I
welcome, it is still too low. Roughly half the public—less than
half—do not have confidence in the police. In particular, a
recent opinion poll conducted by a reputable consumer research
organisation found that one third of those members of the public who
come into contact with the police are dissatisfied with their
performance. No organisation can be satisfied or complacent with such a
level of consumer dissatisfaction. Our contention is that there is an
important need to rebuild the bridge between the police and the local
public, and having direct accountability for the police, to give the
public a greater say, is the right way in which to do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000126">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">So
we do not accept that there is nothing broken in the system. The hon.
Gentleman did not seem able to make up his mind about whether he
supports the status quo—he seems to be having it both ways. At
times he seemed to be arguing—and certainly Labour Members
argued—that there was nothing wrong with the system. The hon.
Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak has said, “If it ain’t
broke, don’t fix it.” That has been his repeated
line.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000127">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We know,
however, that when the right hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull West
and Hessle (Alan Johnson) was Home Secretary for that brief and
glorious tenure, he said that police authorities were sub-optimal. He
conceded that they were not fit for purpose—he failed entirely,
of course, to set out how they should be reformed.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000128">&#160;</a>

authorities should be reformed? If he is saying that they should, we
are entitled to know how. The force of his criticism of our proposals

not like the way in which we are doing

police authorities. It is hardly surprising that police authorities,
which the Bill will abolish, are not jumping with joy about the
measures. Suggesting that they oppose the measures does not present a
strong
case.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000132">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">By
the way, that has not stopped a large number of the police authority
chairs, who are publicly expressing opposition to the provisions,
preparing their run for office as elected police and crime
commissioners. Such chairs include two prominent Labour party
representatives who chair major Metropolitan police force areas. We
look forward to their having the courage publicly to declare that they
intend to

response to the point made by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly
Oak, the problem is that, contrary to what he has said, police
authorities are not performing properly. First, they are invisible to
the public, so no one knows who the members are. I defy anyone to go to
a public police authority meeting and ask people who the chair of their
police authority is. I have done so on a number of occasions, and I
have never found that people knew who they were. Cabinet Office
research in 2008 found that only 7% of the public even know what a
police authority does.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000134">&#160;</a>

want to answer the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak on the
performance of police authorities, because here is a serious point. In
Her Majesty’s inspectorate of constabulary and the Audit
Commission’s recent survey and study of police authorities, only
four out of 22 authorities inspected were performing well in setting
strategic direction and ensuring value for money. A careful reading of
that report will not lend confidence on either side of the
Committee—perhaps underlying the fact that the Opposition do not
think that police authorities are fit for purpose—that police
authorities,

about visibility. He has told us his second reason. His first reason
for abolishing police authorities and instituting this paraphernalia is
that most people do not know the members of their police authority. I
asked a group of constituents on Friday night to name the Conservative
home affairs team, but they were unable to do so. I am terribly sorry
to report that they were unable to identify the right hon. Member for
Arundel and South Downs, although in fairness they recognised the Home
Secretary. Two of them were able to mention another member of the team.
On that basis, would it be reasonable to conclude that we need to
change the home affairs team, because it clearly has a visibility
problem?<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000139">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am wounded by the hon. Gentleman’s
intervention. Were I to be allowed to remain in office for years, that
position could be improved. If the public were asked to name their
local MP, particularly long-standing and distinguished MPs, as we see
facing us—I cannot count myself among that number—I think
that the recognition would be much greater. Survey evidence backs that
up. People know their local MP; they know how to get hold of them; and
ultimately they have a choice whether to keep them in
office.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000140">&#160;</a>

takes me to my next point. The Opposition’s case seems to be
that the public did not want these positions. According to the
Opposition, there was no demand for police and crime commissioners.
However, in the survey evidence we know that there is a demand for
greater democratic accountability for policing. The public are quite
clear about that. It would be surprising if there were not demand for a
greater

the greater development of community and neighbourhood policing, which

                           </div>an important development under the previous Government, as I have always
said, and one we must seek to protect. It can be achieved through the
beat meetings that we have committed to in our coalition agreement, to
ensure that the police have regular meetings with the public. All the
forces which I talk to understand the importance of that. In the end,
we have to answer the questions of who is going to hold forces to
account and what say the public should directly have in
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000146">&#160;</a>

somebody whose backing for the policy of direct accountability for

                        <p class="tabbed">It
was a different form of direct accountability, but it was direct
accountability, which, of course, the hon. Gentleman did not mention in
his speech. The previous Government twice proposed a form of direct
accountability for policing, and they dropped it twice. They did not
even pilot it. They simply encountered opposition and ran out of nerve.
That is the wrong
approach.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000150">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government share the view that police authority governance needs to be
changed and that this democratic form of accountability is important.
The difference is that we are determined to see it through. That is why
we will not be derailed by the suggestion that there should be a pilot,
because the real reason for that is not that Opposition Members think
that it is a good idea. They did not really make a good case for it.
Their entire case rested on opposition to this form of accountability,
yet we know that, just a couple of years ago, they were standing up and
proposing it. How convenient it is for them to have changed their minds

need, therefore, to reflect on the fact that the public have already
had their say to this extent. It is an established principle in this
country that, when political parties stand for office and place policy
proposals in their manifestos, they are entitled to implement their
programme. That is what the public expect. Indeed, there is a great row
if parties do not implement their manifesto policies.

perfectly straightforward point, and I am amazed that hon. Members are
so astonished, as though this is news to them. It is important that
they understand it. There is a dual mandate, from both parties, to have
greater accountability in policing. We have two parties saying in their
manifestos that there should be democratic accountability in policing,
and another party, which twice proposed it before giving up when it ran

say that that was about as tenuous as one can get. First, will he
accept that the parties stood on different manifestos? The Conservative

that, if one voted Conservative, that is what one was voting for. If
one voted Lib Dem, one was voting for a different form of election

is it not also the case that, if the responsibility of parties is to
implement their manifestos, the proposal is flawed, because it was not
in either manifesto in the form that the coalition now proposes? The
problem is that the coalition has come up with a new plan that was not
subject to any electoral

course, we have a coalition Government and, therefore, an agreed

the police and crime panels policy was
developed.<p class="tabbed">I
notice, by the way, that Opposition Members were not opposing the idea
of police and crime panels outright. They were merely sniping at the

Nevertheless, we have taken great care to seek to protect the Welsh
devolution arrangements in relation to wider community safety matters,
which are devolved. I have therefore had several meetings, as have
officials in my Department, with the Welsh Assembly Government and

Wales—I wanted to reassure the hon. Member for Vale of Clwyd

representative is appointed to the police and crime panel. I hope that,

want to remind the hon. Member for Gedling of what two of the people
who gave evidence to the Committee said last week, since he mentioned
their contribution. First, I do not agree that it was overwhelmingly
the view of those who gave evidence that police and crime commissioners
were a bad idea. I heard the two academics speak broadly in support of
the idea of greater local accountability, albeit with reservations
about this particular model. I heard a powerful intervention from the
victims’ commissioner on the importance of building that bridge
between the police and the public and representing the views of
victims. I also note that the chairman of the Police Federation, who
wisely kept out of the debate on how governance of policing might be
changed, said that in his experience pilots were only precursors to the
actuality of the reform and that they were a cause for delay—I
agree with that. I also strongly agree with the victims’
commissioner, Louise Casey, who said that rather than running pilot
schemes,<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000169">&#160;</a>

fully addressing the transition. I am chairing a transition board, on
which there are representatives from police authorities and chief
constables. The Bill provides for transitions, and we shall deal with
those when we reach the relevant debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000172">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I do not think
that the transition argument is one that merits our having pilots, but
I want to make this broad point. In a sense, we have already had a
pilot, which took place in London. It seems to me that the introduction
of the Mayor in London, with responsibility for the governance of
policing, was a good policy, and it was one that, I remind Labour
Members, they proposed when in government and hon. Members on this
side, or at least Conservative Members, opposed. I think that we were
wrong to do so. The policy has been a success. Londoners like it. They
like the greater say that they have over policing, and I am sure that
they would not want to reverse it. In addition, we have learned lots of
lessons from the way in which policing governance has changed in
London. I would argue, in response to the concern expressed by the hon.
Member for Gedling that we are discussing an untried model, that to an
extent it has been tried in London and therefore we can safely roll it
out across the
country.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000173">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to respond to the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak, who said
that it would not be possible for a single individual to represent the
electors in the west midlands, because the West Midlands force would
cover 2 million electors—he did not say that, but I am telling
him that that is the number. I do not think that he would support the
break-up of the West Midlands force into smaller units, so we have the
situation in which the force is that big, and the chief constable has
to work across that number of
electors.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000174">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
the Mayor of London has responsibility for policing with a far bigger
electorate than any of the other force areas, even the big mets in the
rest of England. He has responsibility for 5.6 million electors.
I do not think that those electors feel disconnected from
the Mayor and unable to express their point of view. We know that the
volume of complaints to the Mayor increased. Therefore, simply citing
the number and suggesting that it means that the individual cannot get
around all those people completely misses the point. The direct line of
accountability gives the public the knowledge that they have someone to
whom they can go, who will answer to them. The reason why that person
will answer to them is that they are elected and responsive. We should
not be quite so disparaging of the idea that they will be elected. I
rather disagreed, if I may say so, with the tone of the hon. Member for
Houghton and Sunderland South, who talked about pointless elections and
a waste. We need to be careful not to show contempt for the electorate
in this
respect.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000175">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
believe that the public can be trusted, that they do know
best—that point was made—and we can trust them by giving
them the say in these elections. Were we not to proceed on a national
basis, we would potentially create an uneven pattern across the
country. That would prejudice a very important component of the reform,
which I want hon. Members to understand. This is an exchange. We are
seeking to reduce the burden of direction on police forces from the
centre—from the Home Office and from others—and to do
that, we have to exchange it for stronger local accountability. My
concern is that if we reduced that burden without stronger
local accountability, we would allow an element of producer capture. It
would make the police more remote from the people, not less; it would
give the people less of a say, not more, and it would therefore be a
great mistake.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000176">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">For all the
reasons that I have given, I believe that it would be a mistake to
accept the Opposition amendments. Hon. Members made many particular
points that we shall come to later, because they relate to the detail
of the Bill. We can certainly talk about the potential future role for
police and crime commissioners and the criminal justice system, but
that would not be picked up in a pilot because it will evolve over time
anyway.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000177">&#160;</a>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">I absolutely
disagree that the relationship between police and crime commissioners
and police and crime panels is unclear. These are important checks and
balances. The functions are set out in clause 28 and we can debate
those properly at the relevant time. The provision is all about giving
local authorities a voice. Individual local authorities in an area such
as Northumbria will have a stake in the governance of policing because
the unitaries that are, for example, in Northumberland will each have a
representative on the police and crime panel. That answers the point
about the extent to which we can ensure that those who are responsible
for the governance of policing have a connection with the local area.
That is one of the reasons why the developments on police and crime
panels are important.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000178">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I disagree that police and
crime commissioners will solely focus on local issues, although it will
be a good thing if they do so and respond to local concerns. We are
proposing that there will be strategic policing plans, for which the
police and crime commissioner must hold the chief constables to
account. That will reflect national and strategic policing priorities.
I strongly disagree that there is a problem with the idea that
extremists will stand. That is a complete red herring and I am happy to
debate that any time. The idea was shot down in terms by Opposition
Members when they were in government and made their own proposals for
these elections. If we consider the performance of the British National
party at the last general election or in local elections, it shows that
it could not possibly poll sufficient votes to gain a constituency of
the size that police and crime commissioners would be standing for,
which would have a minimum of 400,000 electors. That is simply not a
good argument and we should be wary about even airing it and giving it
publicity because it does not deserve
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000179">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Vale of Clwyd said that he feared that the articulate
middle classes would dominate the agenda of police and crime
commissioners. Let me say this to him in response. It is true that
crime affects the poorest in our society disproportionately. Hon.
Members on my side and I are motivated to introduce this reform by a
real concern about levels of crime and a desire to ensure that they are
reduced because they particularly impact on the poorest. My driving
ambition is to secure a better performance for the poorest in society.
I do not accept that police and crime commissioners would behave in a
way that ignores their constituents, any more than hon. Members ignore
constituents in parts of their constituency just because they think
that they did not vote for them. We can disagree about the
effectiveness of the provisions and the merits of
pilots.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000180">&#160;</a>

hon. Friend’s point was that he believes that the opposite will
be the case. It is a bit unfair—and uncharacteristic—of
the Minister to suggest that my hon. Friend was saying that the

shall make a couple of points. First, in defence of myself on the
mandate point, interestingly, I did what I am accusing the right hon.
Gentleman of not doing. When I met with universal disapproval not just
from self-interested parties but from a range of different bodies, I
listened to what they said and was convinced by their arguments. The
right hon. Gentleman does not believe in pilots, because he believes
that he knows better and that the reform will make a difference. I was
convinced by people that, notwithstanding the point that I had made, I
did not know better. People change their minds.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000187">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am slightly
concerned that sometimes in politics we do not listen and change our
minds when the evidence is put before us—we all do it and then
we all get criticised for it. Then, when we change our minds, that is
described as a weakness. All of us should reflect on that, because if
that is the case nobody will ever change their mind or speak their
mind, because all they will be worried about is what is said in the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000188">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If I ever get
back into the position that the right hon. Gentleman is in, there are
two things that I would not do. The first would be not to use things
that people have said in different circumstances against them, because
I realise now how things change and how people take different points of
view. The second thing relates to pilots. The right hon. Gentleman was
in opposition as we are now in opposition. Now that we are in
opposition it is clear to me, having drafted the amendments on pilots,
that any Opposition of any type or party need more resources to do
their job than they get at the present time. I just want to put that on
the record, because it is quite an important point.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000189">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I am
absolutely astonished by the right hon. Gentleman. To be fair to him,
he is usually intellectually rigorous, but the idea that the Government
got a mandate from the British people at the last election to introduce
commissioners—one individual who is directly elected—is
complete and utter nonsense. <em>[</em>
                           <em>Interruption.</em>
                           <em>]</em> We
lost the election; someone just said, “You lost”.
Absolutely, we did lose. However, the Conservative party did not win
and neither did the Liberal Democrat party. It is all very well for the
right hon. Gentleman to say that they cobbled together a
deal after the election to come to an agreement about directly elected
commissioners being a single individual, but to use the argument that
he used—that the British people voted for what he is
proposing—is simply and utterly not the case at all.
So to pray in aid the British people for this reform
is frankly absolutely astonishing and I am amazed 
by it.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000190">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We want
pilots and the right hon. Gentleman responded to the issue of pilots,
but again it was all high-level stuff, saying, “We are looking
at what the transition will mean, we will look at what the
accountability arrangements will be, we are looking at and trying to
understand”—it is all about having high-powered
arrangements in place to look at what the arrangements should be. They
are not actually answers. The clarity that each and every one of the
stakeholders is demanding was not there at all in the Minister’s
answers. It was the stock-in-trade answer, “Yeah, that’s
a fair point to make and we’re working on
it”.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000191">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well what I
said. I said that he was raising specific points that relate to later
clauses in the Bill and we will come to them and debate them, whether
they are about the police and crime panels or transition arrangements.
I was simply avoiding going outside what I think are the terms of the
debate on these amendments, which are about pilots, and being drawn
into a discussion that—assuming we ever get there—we will
have later in the Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000192">&#160;</a>

are his proposals to improve it?<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000193">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Mr Howarth, you would rule me out of order if I
went on to the next group of amendments. I am sure that the right hon.
Gentleman has prepared at great length for the next group of
amendments. In that group, we have put forward an alternative model of
police authority governance for consideration by the Committee. We
actually laid amendments that produced another model. My hon. Friend
the Member for Houghton and Sunderland South also talked about
Northumbria being willing to host another pilot. All I am saying is
that we have proposed an alternative. I am astonished that the hon.
Gentleman has accused me of not laying an alternative, because we laid
an alternative specifically so that he could not say that we have not
laid an alternative; yet he now accuses me of not laying an
alternative. We have tabled a shed-load of amendments that detail a
different model, and we will consider those in the next
group.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000194">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I am, again,
astonished that the hon. Gentleman has frankly trashed the
police authorities by saying, “Well, they’re
police authorities. What do you expect them to say?” With his
own police authority, and with the police authority of every hon.
Member, one could argue, putting one’s views to one side, that,
because the police authority has a vested interest and argues against
this reform, pilots are not necessary. Why would turkeys vote for
Christmas? My police authority is made up of dedicated people who have
spent years working in policing, and they are sincere and genuine in
their belief that this is a bad
reform.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000195">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
asked the hon. Gentleman to reflect when he argued against pilots. It
is fair enough to say that he does not agree with police authorities,
but it is not fair to go on to say, as he did, “Well, they would
disagree with the Government’s proposals.” On reflection
he might concede that they are more sincere and genuine in their
opposition than
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000196">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">With
these amendments on pilots we are seeking to address some of the issues
with PCCs and some of the issues that will come up later in the Bill.
The Minister is quite right to say that we will be listening very
carefully, because he has now said that he will not answer the points
here about transition, cost, elections, collaboration, and other such
things, because they will come up as we go through the Bill. We will
look very carefully at that. With the reassurance that the Minister has
given us that we will deal with some of those issues and address some
of the specific points that I have made, I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000197">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> For the convenience of the Committee, many of the
amendments in this huge pile are consequential amendments. At its
heart, this group seeks to replace the model of a single person being
responsible for the role that the Minister envisages for the
PCC. The fundamental point is to make the PCC the chair of the
PCP. The PCC would still be directly elected, but the PCC would
be encapsulated with the PCP. In other words, those two bodies would be
merged. The Minister could, of course, keep the two separate and
enhance the role of the PCP, but through this set of amendments we seek
to address the concerns that people have with one person being
responsible for the police commissioner role for the whole of an area.
The model is a positive
one.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000384">&#160;</a>

response, 32% expressed support for that version of the statement, 37%
were opposed and 32% were either neutral or answered

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
Devon and Cornwall police authority—I do not want my examples of
police authorities to be dominated by big, northern
conurbations—has said that it will be the responsibility of the
PCC to both collect and represent the views of all those people living
within the force area, but how can that possibly be done by one person?
How can one person sitting in, for example, Exeter, represent the views
of a community in west
Cornwall?<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000394">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment addresses that particular problem. Such areas are too big for
one individual to act as the police and crime commissioner. However, if
we made them a chair of the police and crime panel, that would start to
address the problem. They would chair a panel of representatives that,
according to the Government’s proposals, will be composed of at
least one person from each of the local authorities in the police force
area. Every single authority at every single level would therefore have
one person on the panel. It will have a minimum of 10, or more if there
are more local authorities within the area, plus two independent
members who will be co-opted on to
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000395">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One
of the criticisms of the Minister’s proposals is that one person
cannot cover the whole area, but linking the directly elected
individual to the police and crime panel—I am trying to help the
Minister—would maintain direct election and that person would
still be responsible to the whole of the area through the ballot box.
They are linked in to each of the areas—across, say, Devon and
Cornwall, Wales, West Yorkshire, Merseyside and so on—much more
tightly through the police and crime panel and the representative on
that panel.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000396">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
has asked me for an alternative and I am offering him one. It goes some
way towards the direct election that the Minister wants, but
also—particularly in amendment 107—helps to ensure that
there is the local linkage that is so important, which my hon. Friends
have mentioned. That proposal merits consideration, because it
overcomes a number of problems, in particular how the services of local
authorities, which are so important to the reduction and prevention of
crime, will relate to the work of the police and crime commissioner.
That is totally unclear to me in the Bill. If, instead of being a
stand-alone figure, the PCC is part of the police and crime panel they
will be able to talk to each of those local authority individuals who
are part of the PCP. They will be able to discuss what is happening in
their area and what needs to be done with respect to the services that
are being provided, and they will be able to make a real difference

talked earlier about people in Nottinghamshire who live very close to
Leicester at one end of the county and very close to Sheffield at the
other end. In a police and crime panel where all the
functions of the police and crime commissioner and the police and crime
panel are married together, they will be able both to work out the
strategic plan for the whole of the police force area and to ensure
that there is the local input, which is so important for the policing
of an
area.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000398">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
democratic accountability problem that the Minister says will be
addressed as a result of direct election is still there. I continually
point out to the Minister that it is the wrong level of accountability;
in other words, having somebody at only a force-wide level does not
address the local democratic problem in the sense that our constituents
see it as a problem. In their particular village, town or area, they
would know that through the police and crime panel representative for
their area their views would be fed directly in to the police and crime
commissioner.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000399">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That is
nearer to what the hon. Member for Edinburgh West and the Liberal
Democrats put forward at the most recent election. I know that that
proposal concerned direct elections to the police authority en masse,
but it is a closer model to the one on which he fought the election. He
knows full well, although he will not say so in the Committee, that my
arguments about the need for such decisions to be made by a group of
people rather than an individual are dealt with in some ways by
amendment 107. It addresses many of people’s real concerns about
the one-person model, particularly regarding problems such as
politicisation. It is much more difficult to believe that
politicisation of the police will occur if control is exercised on the
police and crime commissioner through the police and crime panel. It is
much more difficult to believe that people will be so
concerned about operational independence or operational
responsibility vis-à-vis the PCC and the chief constable if the
operation of that directly elected individual is through chairmanship
of a police and crime panel rather than as a stand-alone
figure.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000400">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For such
reasons, the amendment is a genuine attempt to provide an alternative,
and to give the Minister a different model so that he can at least
start to address—as he will have to, specifically—the
very real issues of linkage between one person and local communities.
Why is having a directly elected chair of the police and crime panel to
work with to deliver the greater accountability the Minister wants not
a better model than what he is
proposing?<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000401">&#160;</a>

Friend’s proposal for directly elected chairs of the panel. For
a PCC to succeed, he needs local government buy-in. I mentioned in my
previous contribution that Denbighshire, of the 376 crime and disorder
partnerships, was third, and it was able to obtain that position
because of co-operation with the local
authority.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000403">&#160;</a>

and education authorities and social services. Only by sitting round a
table together can they face such problems in the round, drawing up

                        <p class="tabbed">If
a PCC—especially if newly elected, on a party political
ticket—tries to force his philosophy down the throats of local
government authorities, which might not be of the same political
persuasion as him, that is a recipe for disaster. Working in
partnership, getting the balance right and increasing co-operation will
enable the PCC to fulfil his or her functions. The Conservatives and
Liberal Democrats are not offering a policy for co-operation, but for
confrontation. We definitely need local government buy-in, which the
model proposed by my hon. Friend will allow us to achieve. I hope that
the Government will
listen.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000405">&#160;</a>

Liberal Democrats, oppose to such a model. The fundamental problem with
what the hon. Member for Gedling said is that the Bill’s
proposal is not a one-person model, but one person with significant
checks and balances. The model in the amendment poses significant
questions about legitimacy and accountability. On a police and crime
panel, an elected police and crime commissioner, with a significant
mandate in a police area with possibly millions of votes, would have
only equal prominence with a representative appointed by a local
authority. How would that equalise the legitimacy of all the members of
the police and crime panel? How could police and crime commissioners,
elected in such a way and with a potentially huge mandate,
realistically be held accountable for being unable to push through the
priorities on which they were elected? It leaves them in the situation
four years down the line of saying, “I tried my best,
but ultimately I simply did not have the power to push through the
priorities that you wanted.” Where does that leave the
electorate? Having identified priorities and having elected someone to
push those priorities though, the system will effectively rob the
elected representative of the ability to deal with those
priorities.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000406">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am trying to understand whether the support for
the model is now the policy of the Labour party. It was certainly
offered by the hon. Member for Gedling in the spirit of a genuine
attempt to arrive at some new form of governance that he thought would
work. Perhaps this is a probing amendment. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman
will explain it to me one way or another. He certainly told the
Committee earlier that the reason why he was tabling the amendments was
to avoid the charge that he had no alternative model of policing
governance. We must therefore take his attempt at face
value.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000407">&#160;</a>

are discussing the model of governance that the Labour party now
proposes. My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh West briefly but
effectively explained the absolutely key flaw in the proposal. An
individual would still stand for office in an area such as the west
midlands or Northumbria. They would stand on a mandate, but possibly be
wholly unable to deliver it because in office they would only be the
chair of a committee. The other members of the committee would not be
elected, but nominated by local authorities, yet they would have an

                           </div>equal say, which would mean that the individual
could simply find himself frustrated by the committee. Such a process
would result in slower decision making and bureaucracy. It would not
address any of the problems of police authorities in their current
form, which we debated under the previous group of
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000408">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
drew attention to the weaknesses that HMIC has identified in relation
to the key role of exercising governance in relation to ensuring value
for money. The proposal would have none of the advantages of creating
the office of a directly elected individual such as we have seen in the
Mayor of London, who can then set up an executive office to give him
the necessary support and focus. It would also confuse the clarity of
the governance arrangements that we have introduced under the Bill,
which are to separate the police and crime commissioner from
responsibility for holding the force to account and assuming all the
responsibilities of the police authority. The police and crime panel
will be a scrutiny body, which will hold the police and crime
commissioner to
account.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000409">&#160;</a>

amendment would undo the separation that is so important for the
purposes of transparency and proper accountability. It would be a step
in precisely the wrong direction for governance. It would undo the real
advance under the Bill, which is that district councils will have a
voice in the governance of policing for the first time. They will have
a say on police and crime panels, which they do not have under existing
police
authorities.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000410">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Gedling has proposed the worst of all worlds. It is not
surprising that such a model was rejected by the previous Government.
He was at great pains to explain why it was so important to learn from
mistakes and how he had learned from the mistakes of the previous
Government. I accept that, of course, yet he does not seem to have
noticed that the model was rejected by the previous Government because
it had all the flaws that I have set
out.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000411">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Furthermore,
over the past few weeks, and again today, we have heard a lot from
Labour Members who have outlined their objections on the grounds of
cost, for instance, to the democratic reforms that we have introduced.
The hon. Gentleman is now proposing a model with a directly elected
chair of the police authority, so the election costs will be precisely
the same. Although he is complaining about the costs of this
legislation, Labour proposes a model that introduces exactly the same
cost. Let there be not one further word of criticism from the Labour
party about the cost of our reforms because it has now proposed reforms
that have exactly the same election cost, which is the first key
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000412">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly, the
costs of the Labour model will actually be greater than ours. We have
said that PCCs and panels together must cost no more—other than
the election costs—than existing models of police authority
governance. By keeping authorities in their current form with all the
paraphernalia of allowances that police authority members claim, the
hon. Gentleman’s model will cost more than the existing model of
police authority governance. He has proposed a more expensive model of
policing reform than the one that we have proposed.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000413">&#160;</a>

and no doubt will advance again, against our reforms have been
comprehensively shot down by the hon. Gentleman, who has made a great
mistake in tabling this amendment. He has shot his own arguments down
and he has shot himself in the foot with this amendment. It shows, I am
afraid, that the Opposition are completely at sea when it comes to
having a view about the proper form of policing governance. They do not
know whether to keep the current system or to propose an alternative
model. The hon. Gentleman, I think, has just proposed an alternative
model; it is the wrong one and all the flaws that he claims to have
identified in our measures would apply to his model, but a great deal
more so on

                           </strong> Well, that was an astonishing statement by the
right hon. Gentleman. Let me give one example. Speaking of a directly
elected individual, he says that the extremism argument is complete
nonsense when applied to his model. When I get up and say that we can
have one directly elected individual for the force area, he says that
extremism is a real risk. It is exactly the same. It is one individual
being elected for a force area. The right hon. Gentleman says that the
extremism argument does not apply to his own model, yet it applies to
my model, which is exactly the same as his—one individual for
the whole force
area.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000415">&#160;</a>

about extremism, cost of elections and the individual not being able to
represent an area of a certain size. The hon. Gentleman was the one who
was advancing those arguments. I am now making the point that he is
proposing a model in which all of his own arguments apply. I want to
understand why he has proposed a model of policing governance that

that he is at the moment. What I am proposing is a model that tries to
address some of the real concerns that individual associations and
groups have with the idea of one person being totally responsible for a
whole area. What our proposed model seeks to do is overcome some of
those problems. The right hon. Gentleman puts forward the notion that
he is right and they are wrong. If we have a situation in which one
individual is the chair of the police and crime panel, it is the one
model that can be used to overcome some of the points that individual
associations and groups have made to us. That individual, working with
the police and crime panel, has, for example, the local linkage to
local authorities and local communities that the right hon.

does not have.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000417">&#160;</a>

fundamentally disagree with what the Government are doing, and with the
concept of PCCs. We do not think that that is an appropriate way
forward, and we recognise that to be a real Opposition we have to try
to improve the legislation, raise issues that outside people and bodies
are raising, and propose alternatives. We are proposing some
alternatives and suggestions that people have made, to try to improve

Minister can totally disregard everything that the Opposition say, but
I know that he will not. He will not vote for our proposals, but he
will reflect on them, and when he goes back to his Department he will
say, “This wasn’t a very good point, but that was a
reasonable one. What are we going to do about it?” He will
reflect on what the outside bodies have said. However, if I did not
come up with any alternative to what the Minister was proposing, he
would say, “You’re clueless. You’ve got no idea.
You present no alternative. All you’re doing is defending the
status quo.” So either I face the attack that the Minister has
just made on me, or I face the attack that I am
clueless.<a class="bkMark" name="11012557000421">&#160;</a>
