<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000358"></a>The
Minister of State, Department of Health (Dawn Primarolo):</b>
Before we broke this morning I was responding to the amendment tabled
by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon about offences under
the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 and the Bill.</div>
<a name="08061124000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 1990 Act
makes it clear, as I said this morning, that it is an offence to store
gametes, or to create, use or store an embryo, without a licence. The
Bill introduces further offences relating to the creation without a
licence of human admixed embryos, to come alongside the provisions that
already exist. Those offences apply whether or not a person intended to
create an embryo or human admixed embryo. In addition, it is expected
that any person working in the field will know the rules under the Act
when they apply, and when a licence is needed. The point that the hon.
Gentleman has raised in relation to his amendment is about things that
happen accidentally or without being planned, because of the nature of
division before fertilisation. I shall answer his specific
points.</div><a name="08061124000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is my view, and that of the Government, that the clear set of rules
that has been set out is appropriate. That is because we are dealing
with one of the most sensitive areas, which Parliament has deemed it
appropriate to regulate. I appreciate&#151;the hon. Gentleman quoted
from the letter that I circulated to the Committee&#151;that there
are occasions when an embryo could be created when that was not the
intention. An example would be the accidental creation that the hon.
Gentleman referred to this morning.</div>
<a name="08061124000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
173 would add a new defence to the 1990 Act for a person charged with
an offence of creating, storing or using an embryo or admixed embryo, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column200" />Column number: 200</div>or storing gametes, without a licence. It would allow a defendant to
raise the defence that at the material time they believed that what
they were doing was not something to which the Act applied. As I said
this morning, it is not acceptable in this complex area for the law to
include a caveat to the effect that, despite the fact that incredibly
knowledgeable people are engaged in highly complex activities, the test
should be what was or was not in the mind of the researcher as to
whether the creation was accidental.</div>
<a name="08061124000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">I reiterate
what I said this morning: there is no defence in the 1990 Act, and for
a prosecution to be brought under that Act some safeguards or
additional points need to be borne in mind. The Crown Prosecution
Service must first obtain the consent of the Director of Public
Prosecutions to proceed. That is not a common proceeding for criminal
offences. It is reserved for offences in relation to which weighing the
discretionary factors relevant to the decision whether to prosecute is
likely to be a sensitive and difficult task. That makes it desirable
for the CPS to obtain prior approval for a prosecution. If an offence
were committed under the 1990 Act, the facts of the case would be
looked at carefully and in detail before any proceedings were brought.
That is necessary in such a complex area.</div>
<a name="08061124000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon quoted from the letter that I
circulated to members of the Committee last week. Where there is any
doubt about particular research projects, it would always be wise to
talk to the HFEA about whether a licence was required. Indeed, there is
currently a licensed project in connection with the research that we
are discussing, which indicates that such projects are covered by the
current definitions, so no further clarity is required.</div>
<a name="08061124000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would,
however, go further. The amendment says that, although the individual
creates an embryo, they do not think that the Act applies to them.
However, we have talked about the responsible person and the
circumstances under which a licence would be granted or revoked, and
the obligations are quite clear: the emphasis is on the researcher to
understand and comply with the law.</div>
<a name="08061124000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, a
researcher storing eggs will know that they could divide and thus
create an embryo. Such people are at the forefront of their science and
need to be aware not only that such things can happen, but of the
consequences. Equally, they should know that the 1990 Act regulates
their activities. It is therefore incredibly difficult to see how the
defence in the amendment could work, given that it is based on what
each researcher will know, instead of taking a clear line from the
Bill, with the caveats that I have outlined regarding when a
prosecution might proceed. This is not a new issue, and there is no
indication that we should move away from the current
arrangements.</div><a name="08061124000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08061124000359"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Evan Harris</b> (Oxford, West and Abingdon) (LD): Even despite
the caveats, it is clear from what the Minister is saying and from her
letter&#151;at least she is being clear&#151;that anyone who
cultures eggs in vitro will have to get a licence because the eggs
might divide. I wanted to confirm that there is no escape from that and
that things that did not previously require a licence will now require
one for safety.</div>
<a name="08061124000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
further problem, because storing gametes is a licensable activity.
Where, in terms of the development of the germ line cell, does the
gamete start? If work is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column201" />Column number: 201</div>being done to generate IV-derived gametes, researchers will require a
licence because an early-stage IV-derived gamete, even if it is just a
germ cell at an early stage&#151;a stem cell&#151;will be covered.
If the Minister can make that clear, there will at least be
clarity.</div><a name="08061124000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000360"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> No, I am not making that clear. The hon.
Gentleman seeks to get me to make a general rule in a highly complex
area of science. I have made myself quite clear. I am not taking
responsibility for the scientific judgments and the understanding of
those involved in such research. The clear indication that I am giving
is that an embryo developing spontaneously from an egg is a rare
occurrence&#151;that is what I said in my letter, and it is true.
Whether a researcher working on eggs would require a licence would
depend on the specific project. For example, if a project used donated
frozen eggs to analyse their components at a molecular level, the eggs
would not necessarily be cultured, so there would be no chance of the
parthenote developing. It is therefore not the case that every
researcher working on eggs would need a licence from the HFEA. However,
it is the researcher&#146;s responsibility to be fully acquainted
with the arrangements in the Act and to ensure that he or she complies
with them.</div>
<a name="08061124000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a
highly complex area. The steps to prosecution do not follow the normal
criminal prosecution route&#151;if I can put it that way&#151;as
there must be consent from the Director of Public Prosecutions, which
is not common. The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon argues
that there should be a general rule, licensed or not. The Government
are trying to travel a narrow line by regulating where appropriate, but
not allowing a caveat whereby some research might deem itself not to be
covered by the Act and the offence. The responsibility goes squarely
back to the researchers, the purpose of their research and the
circumstances under which a licence should be acquired. If they have
any doubts, they should refer them to the HFEA. That is the right place
to put it.</div>
<a name="08061124000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">To have a
general rule means that we are in great danger of opening up areas of
research that we intended to be regulated, but which are not regulated
as we cannot get the legislation in line with all the objectives. This
is a good, balanced and fair position to be in. It is not a new issue.
It has worked over the period since the 1990 Act, and I see no reason
why it should not work further. I do not suppose that I have convinced
the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon with those comments, as
he may hold very strong views on the matter, but I hope that at least
he can clearly see the Government&#146;s reasoning behind remaining
at this position.</div>
<a name="08061124000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000361"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I can see clearly what the Minister is saying. I
said that this was a probing amendment and I was not wedded to it. I do
not have strong views about the amendment, and a defence is not the
ideal way to deal with this. However, it is necessary for the Committee
to be certain about what is going to happen. I never spoke about
&#147;every researcher working with eggs&#148;&#151;which is what
the Minister said&#151;because obviously, if eggs are frozen, they
are not in culture and they are not going to divide. I spoke about
&#147;every researcher who is dealing with eggs in culture&#148;.
Considering the situation, including this debate and what has been said
in the Minister&#146;s letter, it appears that those researchers will

<div class="Column"><a name="Column202" />Column number: 202</div>have to get a licence. I do not believe that that was the previous
position&#151;I know that it was not. There will be more licences,
and regulation will extend. If regulation must extend as a by-product
of a wider definition for other reasons then so be it, but it is
important that researchers understand that.</div>
<a name="08061124000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
researchers have a view on the matter. Those at Newcastle told me that
it would be a disappointment to researchers that the spectre&#151;as
they put it&#151;of the need to get a licence was going to hang over
anyone working with eggs where the purpose did not involve
fertilisation and so forth. At least now there is clarity about the
Government&#146;s position on that. The HFEA will have to work
quickly before and after enactment, to ensure that everyone is
clear.</div>
<a name="08061124000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">One other
area is not absolutely clear. The Minister has finished her
contribution so I am not necessarily expecting a reply, but I would
like her, and those reading the proceedings, to reflect on this. An egg
is defined as a cell of
the</div><a name="08061124000312"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;female
germ line at any stage of
maturity&#148;.</div><a name="08061124000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
one has an embryonic stem cell that is pluripotent, at what point does
that become an early stage bone marrow or germ line stem cell? It is
pluripotent; in theory, from that embryonic stem cell, a cell from that
line could be differentiated into a germ line cell&#151;that is the
point of them. There is therefore another question about at what stage
people who are researching solely on stem cell lines&#151;separate
from the embryo work that another group may be doing&#151;may
themselves need a licence. The entity that they are working with may be
heading with differentiation towards a germ line cell, and it may be
considered to be captured. The storage of such cells is a licensable
activity.</div>
<a name="08061124000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point
that I was making in tabling the amendment was that the breadth of
regulation might well have increased, but it is not a question of
scientists not knowing either the law or what they are doing. I was a
little surprised by the Minister and do not think that she was serious
when she said that I was arguing that senior scientists did not know
what they were doing. The way science works means that it sometimes
surprises people, and many discoveries are made through surprising and
serendipitous findings, so no scientist is able to say in a protocol
that something definitely will or will not happen. That is the nature
and excitement of research. Clearly, any scientist working in this
field has a responsibility to know and accept the law. When it is
likely that an embryo, or something that could possibly be defined as
an embryo, will be created, they will have to get a
licence.</div>
<a name="08061124000326"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div><a name="08061124000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not want it to be left in anyone&#146;s mind that scientists do
not understand the law or are seeking to avoid it. It is just that
there will now be extra regulation. If the Minister could reflect on
the question about embryonic stem cells and when they become germ line
cells at any stage of development, it might be useful to clarify that,
because the HFEA will certainly have
to.</div><a name="08061124000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000362"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that
discretionary factors are already in place that can be considered
before a decision is taken on whether to prosecute, and that those
discretionary factors are intended 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column203" />Column number: 203</div>to deal precisely with some of the issues that he has identified? He has
not made a case for why that is not enough; he simply reasserted that a
licence is needed for everything. I clearly stated the conditions under
which we would expect them to consider whether a licence was
necessary.</div><a name="08061124000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000363"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I apologise to the Minister for not dealing with
that, although it was my intention to. They clearly have a choice: they
can get a licence or rely on the fact that there would be discretion in
prosecution. I am sure that that discretion would be used wisely, but
many people do not like the idea that, although there can be an
investigation, there could be a decision later in that process not to
prosecute. We saw that during the debates in the House on religious
hatred.</div><a name="08061124000055"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000364"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The hon. Gentleman started his contribution on
the amendment wanting to cover scientists who inadvertently went
outside the licences. It was not that they set about going outside the
licence. He referred to that just a minute ago as the wonder of
science, and I have told him that that is covered. Is he now saying
that he wants them to have the absolute right to do certain research
outside the licence? That is a slightly different
proposition.</div><a name="08061124000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000365"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I do not think that it is a different proposition.
If it is likely that an embryo will be created, either as the intention
of research or as a foreseeable consequence, clearly they should get a
licence, and I think that that now applies to eggs in culture. An
alternative, to avoid the need to get a licence, would be for there to
be a clear defence to cover those circumstances in which, in full
knowledge of the law, research artefacts that are not the purpose of
the study, are not being described and will not last long, might
emerge. That would make the whole question of investigation and
prosecution much less likely. That would actually add an extra
safeguard with regard to the decision to prosecute, because prosecutors
will not prosecute if there is a defence that could be prevailed upon.
So that would give researchers more confidence that they are not going
outside their licence. It would be wrong for them to go outside their
licence, and that is not what I am saying. It would be something that
is not obviously licensable and could be done without a licence because
it has nothing to do with embryos, but if something that could be
described as an embryo in this wide definition is produced as a
research artefact, they will be reassured and not scared off the idea
of doing the research.</div>
<a name="08061124000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
think that it is satisfactory to rely on the DPP discretion, although I
understand what the Minister says about that, just as it is not
satisfactory to rely on an Attorney-General&#146;s discretion,
although it is better than nothing. Researchers will have to get a
licence. I do not think that scientists will run the risk of not having
one and having complaints made against them. However, that is for them
to judge.</div>
<a name="08061124000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have made their position clear on the question of eggs in
culture. I repeat that there is a further issue about stem cells, but
that probably needs greater reflection. I was not planning to put the

does not predominate. The amendment was tabled following extensive
discussions on definitions during the passage of the Bill through
another place. The amendment also removed the power to extend the
definitions of human admixed embryos through secondary legislation, as
it was no longer required following the introduction of the new
catch-all definition. Those amendments were accepted by the
House.</div>
<a name="08061124000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition,
an amendment was passed to insert a new regulation-making power to
specify circumstances in which the keeping or use of human admixed
embryos would be prohibited. The amendments tabled in this group are
consequential to those tabled during the Committee of the whole House.
They take out references to the regulation-making power to extend the
list of human admixed embryos from clauses 30 and 31, which deal with
the exercise of regulation-making powers under the Bill and the power
to make consequential provisions in certain cases
respectively.</div>
<a name="08061124000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments also insert a reference to the new power into clause 30 to
ensure that any regulations under the provision would be subject to
debate in both Houses&#151;the affirmative procedure. In that sense,
they follow directly on from the decisions made in Committee of the
whole House. The amendments extend no further principles in the Bill,
but they tidy up the legislation and remove powers that are no longer
required.</div><a name="08061124000070"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08061124000370"></a><b class="B">Mark
Simmonds</b> (Boston and Skegness) (Con): I shall ask a couple
of brief questions to make sure that I understand the changes that the
Minister is proposing in the Government amendments. Do the
consequential amendments mean that the exercise of every
regulation-making power in the Bill has to be ratified by an
affirmative resolution of Parliament, or are there different categories
of regulation? It is not necessary to provide the information
now&#151;the Minister can give it in writing&#151;but it would be
helpful for the Committee to understand 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column205" />Column number: 205</div>which regulation-making powers in the Bill have to be resolved by
Parliament through affirmative powers and which do not.</div>
<a name="08061124000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a
specific question about amendment No. 57. As the Minister has just
explained, I understand that the removal of the term human admixed
embryo&#151;leaving out lines 34 and 35&#151;removes the
regulation-making power to change the definition of human admixed
embryos, but how does that relate to the regulation-making power under
section 4A(10) and amend section 4A(5) of the 1990 Act, which relate to
human admixed embryos? I understood that that meant that the Government
could change the definition of a human admixed embryo. Or does the
regulation-making power in new section 45A(2)(b), inserted by clause
31, override sections 4A(10) and section
4A(5)?</div><a name="08061124000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000371"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> A list of the categories are subject to
affirmative resolution under the Bill and, rather than list them all
into the record, I am happy to point them out in correspondence with
the hon. Gentleman and other members of the Committee, for ease of
reference in future debates. As for the changes that are being made,
the decision taken on the Floor of the House to have a catch-all
provision removed the necessity for regulations on definitions of
admix, so we are removing it from the Bill. The Government have the
power to amend the existing definitions, but they will no longer have
the power to add new categories to those definitions. The amendments
would remove the power from the Bill because it is not required any
more. Changing the existing definitions, if that proved necessary,
would be subject to affirmative
procedure.</div><a name="08061124000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
cross-referencing is different because we made the changes in Committee
of the whole House, and we are now tidying up the Bill. It is as though
we have been in Committee all the time and are simply amending the Bill
in two locations. I hope that I have made matters clear. As I said, the
list is long and, rather than delay our proceedings by reading it into
the record, I shall circulate it to all members of the Committee. It
will not take a
moment.</div><a name="08061124000074"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

Thursday, we debated clause 21, which inserted new sections 20A and 20B
in the 1990 Act. It resulted in agreement that those regulation-making
powers should be subject to the affirmative procedure, and I asked
whether they were. The Minister agreed that they should be, but it
turned out that they were not. To assist the Committee, I have tabled
an amendment that would make them subject to the affirmative procedure.
I am not sure that it does the job, but it would be one less thing to
cover when we discuss the Bill on Report. That is why I tabled the
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000373"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The hon. Gentleman spoke to me during the break
and said that, in the light of events, he would not speak to his
amendment. However, I suggested that he move it formally, because he
should be given acknowledgement for trying to catch up with the
Government&#146;s position. It is true that we debated the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column206" />Column number: 206</div>appeals procedure and whether or not the regulations would be subject to
the affirmative or the negative procedure. I clearly said to the
Committee that they should be subject to the affirmative
procedure.</div><a name="08061124000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thought that I made a joke, but the hon. Gentleman did not think so.
However, I hope that he will allow me to make it once more. The hon.
Gentleman is improving his skills as a parliamentary draftsman. He is
nearly there&#151;he is doing fantastically well. I have never been
able to do as well in my time in Parliament. However, he has not quite
made it on this occasion. I would have been willing to accept the
amendment if it had been drafted correctly, but I will need to table
another on Report to put matters right. However, I will be more than
happy for the hon. Gentleman to add his name to it. The amendment will
be tabled. The regulations are currently subject to the negative
procedure, but we will take steps to make them subject to the
affirmative procedure. I know that the hon. Gentleman will not press
his amendment to a vote because he knows that it does not quite work,
but it establishes the
principle.</div><a name="08061124000329"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000375"></a>Mark

difference between regulation, as set out in clause 30, consequential

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000376"></a>Dawn

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000377"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> Of course. Clause 32 refers to the
Government&#146;s ability to make orders, yet clause 30 refers to
regulations, clause 31 to consequential provision, and clause 32 to
orders. Is there a difference between 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column207" />Column number: 207</div>regulation, consequential provision and orders? If there is, what is it?
If they are the same, why has different terminology been used in three
consecutive
clauses?</div><a name="08061124000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000378"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> Clause 30 deals with the regulations made under
powers introduced by the Bill that are exercised by the
authority&#151;codes and so on. Clause 32 refers to the procedures of
this House&#151;whether matters are subject to the affirmative or the
negative procedure. There is not a huge difference in practice, but
there tends to be a consequential relationship between regulations and
orders and the procedures under which they go through the House. One
may ask why that is the case, and the answer is that the House has
always done it in that way, and there is parliamentary
precedent.</div><a name="08061124000090"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000379"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> Clause 33 defines the meaning of
&#147;mother&#148;. It
states:</div><a name="08061124000313"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
woman who is carrying...a child as a result of the placing in her
of an embryo or of sperm and eggs, and no other woman, is to be treated
as the mother of the
child.&#148;</div><a name="08061124000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
definition dates back to the 1990 Act. I want to raise at this point,
under a stand part debate on this clause, surrogacy arrangements
affecting the mother and the definition of a mother. There are some
complex and difficult issues that relate to the mother in surrogacy
arrangements, which I do not think will be discussed in relation to any
other part of the Bill.</div>
<a name="08061124000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Surrogacy
arrangements are recognised in British law as long as no payment is
made and only reasonable expenses are reimbursed. In the UK, surrogacy
arrangements are not a binding agreement on either party; there is very
little that the intended parents can do to secure their position prior
to birth, even in gestational surrogacy&#151;where the baby is
genetically related to both intended parents and not to the
surrogate.</div><a name="08061124000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
the 1990 Act, if a child is being carried by a woman as a result of
being artificially inseminated or has had an embryo introduced into
her, she is to be treated as the mother for all purposes even if she is
not genetically related to the child, and her husband will be treated
as the father unless it is shown that he did not consent to the
treatment. That parental consent and status can be lost only through a
parental order or an adoption, and, I understand, that that is retained
in clause 35, to which the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon
has tabled an amendment. In the United Kingdom, parents who wish to use
surrogate mothers then have to adopt the child or apply for a parental
order, which involves a great deal of state intervention. Parents can
be refused adoption orders even though the child is their genetic
offspring. That is not the case if the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column208" />Column number: 208</div>surrogate is not married, as the genetic father can treat the child as
his legitimate offspring and apply for a parental order much
faster.</div><a name="08061124000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
these issues were debated in another place the Minister there promised
that the Government would give those anomalies further consideration.
Can the Minister state for the record today where those considerations
have got
to?</div><a name="08061124000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall put on the record two or three further complexities in this
already very difficult area. There is an argument that a single
commissioning genetic parent&#151;the women who has had a child
conceived from her egg and the single father&#151;are discriminated
against under the new provision. The law elsewhere in the world is not
the same as it is in the UK, which adds complexity. For example, in the
United States of America the legal parents of the offspring are the
commissioning parents, not the parent who bore the child. Therefore, a
child born by commissioning parents in the United States could be
parentless and stateless. That may be considered under other pieces of
legislation. The British Nationality (Proof of Paternity) Regulations
2006 may be
illegal.</div><a name="08061124000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
will be helpful if the Minister could put the Government&#146;s
position on the record, especially in the light of the significant
immigration into the UK from the European Union since the EU accession
countries joined in 2004. Indeed, under EU law there
is&#151;correctly&#151;more leeway for individual states to make
their own appropriate legislation and regulations in this area of law,
because it is so sensitive. There is therefore no consistency across
the European Union.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000380"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Surrogacy is a big issue. I am in some difficulty
as I have amendments tabled to clauses 35 and 54, which touch on
surrogacy issues, albeit not necessarily those mentioned by the hon.
Gentleman. I am not suggesting that you should consider him out of
order, Mr. Hood, but we have to be cautious because we are
going to deal with some of these issues
later.</div><a name="08061124000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000381"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Member for Boston and Skegness
was not out of order.</div>
<a name="08061124000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000382"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> That was the point that I was making. I was not
rising to make a point of order, Mr. Hood. If I had wanted
to say that the hon. Gentleman was out of order, I would have said
that, but I did not think that he was. However, I am concerned about
how far we can go in the discussion and I am seeking your advice,
Mr. Hood, as there are amendments to clause 35 that deal
with UK citizens seeking surrogacy arrangements
abroad.</div>
<a name="08061124000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000383"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> My understanding is that the amendments to
clause 35 relate to the husband of the surrogate being considered the
father. The points that I made under clause 33 related specifically to
the meaning of &#147;mother&#148; as detailed in the provisions of
clause
33.</div><a name="08061124000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000384"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> That is helpful. I wanted to raise another issue
about surrogacy that I hope that the Minister will reflect on. It
builds on the point made by the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness.
The law in this country provides for surrogacy, but not for equality
for surrogate parents in respect of maternity leave and employment
protection. We cannot go too far down 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column209" />Column number: 209</div>that path during debate on a health Bill, but as the Bill makes
provision for surrogates, and as I know the Government are keen to
ensure that there is no discrimination in legislation and that the
welfare of the child is paramount, have the Government given any
thought to whether it is appropriate to ensure maternity leave rights
and employment protection for surrogate parents?</div>
<a name="08061124000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part of the
problem is that, as we have discussed, until a parental order is
obtained, one is not the legal parent. By the time one is entitled to
take some of the leave available, it is rather after the fact, as one
wants to take such leave as early as possible. As I am attempting to
stay in order, what I am asking is whether the Government are sure that
nothing more can be done through conversations with other Departments,
particularly the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory
Reform, to ensure a system that supports children and allows the
creation of new families with children who are loved and wanted. The
mothers and fathers involved in such arrangements&#151;they are
few&#151;should have the opportunity to benefit from the arrangements
available for other parents, arrangements that the Government
introduced. I certainly support those arrangements and I think that
there is full support for them across the country and the
House.</div>
<a name="08061124000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I had better
leave my remarks there. I was just probing that particular
matter.</div><a name="08061124000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000385"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> Mr. Hood, I am sure that you will
stop me if I move beyond the remit of the clause. Clause 33 deals with
the meaning of &#147;mother&#148;, replacing section 27 of the
Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. It provides that a woman
who carries a child as a result of assisted conception, wherever and
however it took place, is the mother of the child. It also provides
that if the child is then adopted, the woman who carried the child will
no longer be the
mother.</div><a name="08061124000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentlemen have touched on the specific considerations around
surrogacy, and we will do so again at various points in the next few
clauses. The hon. Member for Boston and Skegness asked me about our
considerations&#151;what we reflected on and what our conclusions
were. I had intended during debate on amendments Nos. 171 and 172 to
say what our view is and why we have taken it with regard to who is
considered to be the father of the child and situations where the
couple is married. It may be more appropriate to respond to his point
then, when I will be happy to pick up any further points.</div>
<a name="08061124000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">Surrogacy is
an option of last resort for couples who cannot have a child by other
means. The Bill extends the categories of couples who can apply for a
parental order. The new provisions also make changes in terms of
assisting organisations, but there is no international agreement
governing or setting minimum standards for surrogacy arrangements. In
the United Kingdom, the law applies to anyone who is resident, whether
or not they are British citizens and whether or not their residency
here is permanent.</div>
<a name="08061124000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">Complicated
arrangements are necessary, especially when surrogacy arrangements have
been made outside the UK. Immigration law covers that. In exceptional
circumstances, that goes to the heart of recognising the woman who
carries the child as the mother and, if she is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column210" />Column number: 210</div>married, her legal husband as the father, unless he did not give
consent, on the basis that a mother in surrogacy could decide not to
give up the child. How immigration and employment law, the birth
certificate, parental responsibilities and adoption rights interact is
incredibly complex, but we attempt to cover such interaction through
various clauses in the
Bill.</div>
<a name="08061124000330"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div><a name="08061124000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps
with a little latitude I could respond to the question that the hon.
Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon asked about the rationales for
maternity and paternity leave and what the Department for Business,
Enterprise and Regulatory Reform could do. Maternity leave and pay was
introduced primarily to protect the health and safety of the mother
following the birth of the child and to help women to take time off in
the weeks around birth. It is clearly predicated on such
events&#151;women are required by law to take a period of maternity
leave after the birth of the
child.</div><a name="08061124000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rights
to adoption leave and pay enable the adoptive parent to take leave from
work. The idea that we would duplicate and give different parents
access to the same leave, payments and rights when transferring legal
rights is complicated. It is not wholly appropriate to discuss it under
the Bill, and I feel that I would be straying if I did so. I merely
wish to indicate to members of the Committee that, as we discuss these
clauses, but not now, certain things will need to be said about the
legal recognition of surrogacy, its interaction with international law,
and the rights of the mother who carried the
child.</div><a name="08061124000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government do not consider that there is unlawful discrimination
against single people in such situations, which was mentioned, because
being single has not been recognised as a protected status for the
purpose of the European convention on human rights. I shall say more
about that when we consider other amendments to clauses that we have
not yet discussed. However, the measure is not about the quality of
parenting or the ability of a single parent to be an excellent parent,
but the complex interaction of the courts&#146; decisions on
surrogacy and the current law in this
country.</div><a name="08061124000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have been careful to indicate sensitivity to the Committee, without
going beyond the scope of the clause. I feel that the hon. Gentlemen
will want to comment when we discuss subsequent clauses and amendments,
because their principal points will come up in more detail. I hope that
that is in order and helpful to the
Committee.</div>

have been discussing, and are intended to deal with what I consider to
be an anomaly in the parenthood provisions. I believe that it is
rectifiable, and that not sorting it out will cause avoidable problems.
I shall argue that those problems can be solved by way of the
amendments or something similar. There does not appear to be a problem
in so doing, and significant benefits would result. To support my
argument, I shall read from a briefing that I have been sent by Natalie
Gamble, a solicitor in family law, who has raised this issue on a
number of occasions with me and in public.</div>
<a name="08061124000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
surrogate is married, neither commissioning parent will be a legal
parent at birth. That can cause particular difficulties in respect of
cross-border arrangements, which were touched upon earlier, and in
respect of the standard UK arrangements. For example, if the intended
parents use a married surrogate, they will have to wait until they have
a parental order to acquire parental responsibility&#151;a process
that can take up to nine months or even a year&#151;and in the
interim, they will have no authority to make decisions for their child.
That is in cases in which there is no dispute about who is looking
after the child, the surrogate mother provided surrogacy within the
law, and the child is living with the intended or commissioning
parents. In turn, that can cause problems over issues such as child
immunisation, because the legal parents need to sign the consent
forms.</div>
<a name="08061124000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The solution
that was proposed to me, which I now put to the Committee, is to
exclude the rule that a married surrogate&#146;s husband is the legal
father in surrogacy cases. Although that rule is critical for donor
insemination parents, it is not problematic for the law to distinguish
between donor insemination and surrogacy cases. The intended father in
the vast majority of surrogacy cases could therefore be the legal
father at birth. That would give him the general entitlement to act as
a parent and enable the intended mother to acquire parental
responsibilities before getting the parental order, using the
step-parent parental responsibility rules.</div>
<a name="08061124000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments provide a quick way of ensuring that the intended
parents&#151;the social parents looking after the child&#151;are
able to make those decisions rather than having to track a surrogate
and her husband who have ended their relationship with that child and
may live many miles away, or even abroad.</div>
<a name="08061124000125"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08061124000390"></a><b class="B">Robert
Key</b> (Salisbury) (Con): On a point of order, Mr.
Hood. The hon. Gentleman has been reading a long quote from a document
of which the Committee does not have sight. He has based an amendment
on that document, a briefing that he received from I know not
where&#151;I did not catch where it came from, although he mentioned
someone&#146;s name. We cannot be expected seriously to consider the
amendment on that basis. It simply is not
on.</div>
<a name="08061124000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000391"></a>The
Chairman:</b> It is in order for an hon. Member to receive a
briefing from any source. If they think it appropriate to refer to it
in Committee, that is perfectly in order.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column212" />Column number: 212</div><a name="08061124000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000392"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I was not quoting from any
document&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>No, I said that I had received a
briefing. The Minister receives briefings from
officials.</div><a name="08061124000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000393"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I have given my response to the point of
order. I invite the hon. Gentleman to carry on discussing his
amendments.</div><a name="08061124000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000394"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I am keen to do so. I think that I have been in
order, and I have not in my time ever had problems receiving
advice.</div>
<a name="08061124000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
actually finished my point: the amendment would enable decisions to be
made in the best interests of children
quicker.</div><a name="08061124000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000395"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> If the husband of the surrogate simply did not
consent to the treatment, would that not avoid his being the father and
thereby negate the necessity of the
amendment?</div><a name="08061124000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000396"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Clause 35, which relates to a woman married at the
time of treatment,
states:</div><a name="08061124000314"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If...at
the time of the placing in her of the embryo or of the sperm and
eggs...W was a party to a marriage, and...the creation of the
embryo carried by her was not brought about with the sperm of the other
party to the marriage...the other party to the marriage is to be
treated as the father of the child unless it is shown that he did not
consent to the placing in her of the embryo or the sperm and
eggs&#148;.</div><a name="08061124000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is the type of case that the hon. Gentleman raises, but I am talking
about a case in which the husband of the surrogate is happy for the
woman to act as a surrogate. He is clearly consenting to the surrogacy
arrangements taking place and wants to give the child to the intended
parents.</div>
<a name="08061124000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Surrogates
provide a wonderful service in such cases, and we have clear laws about
the non-transmission of money in that situation. Unless we are to break
down surrogacy arrangements in their entirety, which has never been
done under Conservative or Labour Governments since 1985, when the
provisions were formalised in so far as they have been formalised, it
seems reasonable to make the provision that I have
described.</div><a name="08061124000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that I have dealt with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. If the
man did not consent, a surrogacy situation would be being created
against the wishes of the husband. That would create at best an
artificial situation in which he would have to indicate that he was not
consenting. That would not be appropriate. The same point applies to
amendment No. 172, which relates to a woman in a civil partnership at
the time of
treatment.</div><a name="08061124000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have case studies, to which I would have liked to refer, but given that
the hon. Member for Salisbury objects to the reading into the record of
evidence or the giving of examples, I will not do that. However, there
is clearly a problem for people in the situation that I have described.
I think that the amendment would solve the problem and would not create
any new problems. I hope that the Minister will look kindly on
it.</div><a name="08061124000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000397"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The subject of surrogacy is complex and fraught
with difficult ethical considerations. The Human Fertilisation and
Embryology Act 1990 and the Bill recognise that by providing elements
of certainty, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column213" />Column number: 213</div>although it is not possible to provide complete certainty, because of
the complexity. One of those elements is that if the surrogate mother
is married, her husband is treated as the father of the child unless it
is shown that he did not consent to the treatment&#151;a point that
has been made. That provision reflects the common law presumption that
a child born to a woman in a marriage is also the child of her husband.
I shall return to that principle in a moment because it is a very
important principle that the legislation is designed not to breach. The
Bill extends the provision to civil partners, so that the
mother&#146;s civil partner is the parent of a child born through
assisted conception unless it is shown that she did not consent to the
treatment. That reflects the fact that the civil partnership is given
the same status as marriage, in recognition of the parental
responsibilities.</div><a name="08061124000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon has tabled amendments that
would introduce an exception to that principle by explicitly removing
the provision for surrogacy cases. If a surrogate was married or in a
civil partnership, parenthood would be removed from her husband or
civil partner, thereby making it possible for the man in the
commissioning couple to be registered as the father from birth if he
was the genetic
father.</div>
<a name="08061124000331"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div><a name="08061124000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that the intention behind the amendments is to make it
easier for commissioning parents to obtain parental responsibility
where the surrogate is married and to ensure that a commissioning
couple who have a child using a surrogate abroad do not face
immigration problems on returning to the UK with the child. Surrogacy
is, however, a fairly sensitive and complex issue, and I suspect that
members of the Committee will hold differing views on it.</div>
<a name="08061124000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
surrogacy arrangements are not illegal, they are not enforceable by the
courts. That is to avoid a surrogate being forced to hand a child to
whom she has given birth over to someone else. The clear principle,
which the Bill maintains, is that the woman who gives birth to the
child is the mother. Having given birth, she may change her mind about
handing the baby over to the commissioning couple, and the law
recognises that she is entitled to do so. That may be a fraught issue
for commissioning couples, but the law is there for specific reasons,
and those principles have underpinned surrogacy thus far.</div>
<a name="08061124000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">I recognise
that the situation that we are discussing would be upsetting,
particularly for the commissioning couple, but we must look to the
child&#146;s welfare. Removing a baby from a mother against her
wishes is not something that the 1990 Act or the Bill encourages, but
the amendments would undermine that position. In the unusual
circumstance of a surrogate choosing to keep the baby, taking
fatherhood or parenthood away from her partner and giving it to the
commissioning father&#151;if he is the genetic parent&#151;would
open the way for the commissioning couple to claim custody of the
child. That would open up untold difficulties and problems.</div>
<a name="08061124000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
said, this is a highly sensitive and complex issue, which is fraught
with difficulties. In those circumstances, the Committee should not add
further difficulties to what is already a difficult situation. That
would complicate matters in a way that was not in the child&#146;s
best interests, and it is the child&#146;s best interests which
continue to anchor our considerations. I recognise 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column214" />Column number: 214</div>that the amendments seek to address a sensitive situation by removing
parenthood from the married man in particular situations. However, we
cannot breach the other principles that I have outlined, with the
consequences that that would have for the child.</div>
<a name="08061124000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman touched on some of the other difficult issues relating to
surrogacy, such as immigration, parenting orders and adoption. After a
lot of consideration by the Government following the debate in another
place, I cannot see that it makes sense to move away from the key
principles that I have identified. I hope that that puts on the record
why the Government remain of that view, and that the hon. Gentleman
will reflect and withdraw his amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000398"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I understand the Minister&#146;s point. In the
circumstances&#151;which I think are very rare, but could
happen&#151;where the surrogate mother does not wish to pass
responsibility for the care of the child over to  the intended
or commissioning parents, giving the commissioning father legal status
would give them grounds for custody-type hearings. I doubt that such
hearings would be successful, but they could occur and I accept that
that is a drawback to the amendment.</div>
<a name="08061124000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the vast
majority of cases, the advantages in assuring quicker parental rights
for the commissioning parents&#151;those who look after the child,
make decisions for the welfare of that child and should not have to
wait as long as they do under current procedures&#151;outweigh those
drawbacks. However, I see the Government&#146;s point. A balance must
be found, and the Government feel that even in a very small number of
cases, a potential legal tug of war between an intended father with
parental rights and the surrogate mother would not be edifying. Nothing
in this area is edifying when it goes to law, and perhaps the
Government recognise that the path of least resistance in respect of
creating situations where that might occur, is not to accept the
amendments.</div>
<a name="08061124000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, I
am disappointed. One would have thought it possible for the law to be
changed to ensure that there was no hope of a successful application in
such a case. It would mean that, even where the commissioning father
had parental rights, he would not be able to exercise them successfully
in a legal case in which the surrogate mother was very clear that she
did not want to give up the baby. The situation would be the same as it
is now, except that in the vast majority of cases, transition would be
smoother.</div>
<a name="08061124000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly,
those provisions are not in my amendments and the Government have not
had a chance to consider that point. I will reflect on what the
Government have said and see whether there is a way of dealing with the
problem that the Minister has raised. In the meantime, I beg to ask
leave of the Committee&#151;including the hon. Member for Salisbury,
for whom I have a great deal of respect&#151;to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000399"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> Briefly, one of the issues that has come out of
the interesting debate that we have had about surrogacy&#151;both in
clauses 33 and 35, and on the amendments just withdrawn by the hon.
Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon&#151;is that there is concern in

<div class="Column"><a name="Column215" />Column number: 215</div>legal circles about the current working of the legislation in the Bill,
the 1990 Act, and the Surrogacy Arrangements Act 1985. The 1985 Act was
nearly 25 years ago, and it may be appropriate both regarding mothers
and surrogacy, and in relation to the point made by the hon. Member for
Oxford, West and Abingdon about fathers and consent and
surrogacy&#151;</div><a name="08061124000151"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08061124000400"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Ian Gibson</b> (Norwich, North) (Lab): Does the hon. Gentleman
agree that there is doubt in some of our minds about the commercial
interests of the lawyers in this business? Some of their views, as much
as they may be pure, may also be pure for the money that is involved.
How do we discern who is in it for the money and who is in it for the
principle?</div>
<a name="08061124000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000401"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a reasonable point,
although certainly, those lawyers with whom I have discussed the matter
and from whom I have received briefing did not give the impression that
they were in it for the money. They are in it to clarify exactly what
the law and its intentions are and how that interrelates with other
Acts of Parliament, so that they can advise their clients officially
and properly on the law and where they stand. However, I accept that it
is a complex matter. I also accept that we should not go down the route
of commercialising surrogacy, but there are clear inconsistencies. It
would give the Committee some comfort if the Minister were prepared to
say that she would get people in her Department to consider it and, at
some appropriate point, to bring it back to the House for
discussion.</div><a name="08061124000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000402"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I draw the hon. Gentleman&#146;s attention to
the fact that the Government gave a commitment to the scrutiny
Committee on the Bill that we would review the regulations dealing with
surrogacy. It is a delicate and difficult issue, precisely because the
Committee raised a number of issues that we were unable to deal with at
that point. I believe that the Committee accepted that that was a
sensible way forward. That is intended to happen after the Bill has
completed its progress and received Royal Assent. It is necessary to
connect with other policy areas and to reflect on some of the points
made. I am not saying that our minds are made up as to the conclusion.
It is worthy of reflection and consultation. I am happy to confirm
that, in answer to both hon. Gentlemen&#146;s concerns.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000403"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> The clause deals with the conditions that must
be met for a man to be treated as the father of a child, irrespective
of whether his sperm was used. The man does not have to give written
consent under the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column216" />Column number: 216</div>conditions if he is married to the woman being provided with the
treatment, as the agreed fatherhood conditions apply only if a couple
are unmarried. If a couple are married, the husband does not need to
give written consent, yet in clause 35, a married man must show that he
did not consent. Must the fact that he did not consent be put in
writing, or can it be verbal? If there is no procedure requiring
married couples to give written consent, how can it be confirmed that a
father did not consent to the
treatment?</div><a name="08061124000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000404"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The hon. Gentleman asks about the opt-out, when
it can occur and what form is necessary. The consent to fatherhood
agreement can be withdrawn only up to the point at which the embryo is
transferred into the woman. As elsewhere in the Bill, a lack of consent
does not have to be put in writing, but in practice, evidence will be
needed that consent has been withdrawn.</div>
<a name="08061124000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
writing is not specified, it will probably need to be in writing, or at
least absolutely clear, that consent has been withdrawn. That is a
feature of different parts of the Bill. The hon. Gentleman will
remember that we discussed the fact that although it does not actually
say that it must be put in writing, that is the best way to ensure that
it has been agreed. However, other clear recorded indications that
consent has been withdrawn are not
disallowed.</div><a name="08061124000161"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Mark
Simmonds:</b> I have one question about clause 38 and how it will
operate in practice. If a donor-conceived child is implanted in a woman
and both the parents consent but are unmarried, and if during gestation
the mother marries a different man, the husband under common law
becomes the father. That is right. What happens if the woman who has
had the embryo implanted enters a civil partnership? Does the new civil
partner become the parent post-embryo
transfer?</div><a name="08061124000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Dr.
John Pugh</b> (Southport) (LD): I was hoping that the Minister could
enlighten me along similar lines. I need to clear my head about this.
As I understand it, if the father is the genuine, biological father
through the normal route, he retains parental rights even if the
relationship breaks up after pregnancy. If, on the other hand, IVF is
the procedure through which the child is generated, it appears that if
the relationship breaks up mid-process, all rights are forfeited. I
think that they are forfeited regardless of whether the broken-up-with
partner is the donor or not&#151;it does not matter if the donor is
someone else or the partner concerned. If the person then remarries,
the newly married partner legally assumes the responsibilities&#151;I
think that I am correct in saying
that.</div><a name="08061124000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
seem to have a degree of legal asymmetry, if I can put it like that. It
would seem to be that in the case of civil partnerships it is, in a
sense, a choice, whether the new civil partner does or does not take on
the role and responsibilities of the parent. Does the Minister
recognise 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column217" />Column number: 217</div>that legal asymmetry? Is that legal asymmetry just the result of a
read-across from civil partnership on one side and marriage law on the
other side? Is it simply the consequence of other bits of legislation?
Or are those differing responsibilities and rights created by the Bill
itself?</div><a name="08061124000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Dawn
Primarolo:</b> In the circumstances in which the hon. Member for Boston
and Skegness described, it would be presumed that the new husband was
the father of the child. If it was a civil partnership, the new partner
would become the recognised parent, because the relationship was there
before the child was
born.</div><a name="08061124000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Dr.
Pugh:</b> I hate to correct the Minister, but the explanatory note says
that there
is</div><a name="08061124000315"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;no
parallel presumption at common law for people who enter a civil
partnership.&#148;</div><a name="08061124000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Dawn
Primarolo:</b> If the marriage is dissolved and the person enters into
a civil partnership, there is no common law presumption of legality to
the original donor, which would therefore be the legal father. The hon.
Gentleman is quite right. That is to do with the point at which it goes
back to the previous clause, at which point the consent was active and
the embryo was implanted into the
woman.</div><a name="08061124000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is much too complicated, Mr. Hood. The hon. Gentlemen should
write to me so that I can understand the unusual circumstances that
might arise. The hon. Member for Boston and Skegness has put on record
a case that I understand, but I am not so clear about the case detailed
by the hon. Member for Southport. I will then send them a
letter.</div><a name="08061124000171"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08061124000405"></a><b class="B">Mike
Penning</b> (Hemel Hempstead) (Con): Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="08061124000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000406"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> Just a moment. Please let me deal with one
complex point at a time. I will then give to the Committee the legal
route that the case would follow and the
consequences.</div>
<a name="08061124000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"></b><b class="B"><a name="08061124000407"></a>Mike
Penning:</b> Surely it would be more logical and helpful to
the Committee&#151;some of us did not follow what the hon. Gentleman
was saying either&#151;if the Minister could send to the Committee a
copy of the transcript when it appears tomorrow, so that we know where
we are, rather than having correspondence flying between one Front
Bencher and
another.</div><a name="08061124000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000408"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> That is a helpful intervention, and it corrects
my position. The hon. Member for Boston and Skegness outlined a
scenario in which one legal relationship has broken up and another has
been formed. He wishes to see the interaction between the consent given
originally and the new circumstances. The point at which consent could
be withdrawn has passed because it is during the pregnancy. At that
later moment, what is the difference between being a married couple as
opposed to a civil partnership, and what rights are transferred to each
person in those circumstances? That is the mess that I have managed to
get myself into. That is what I understand the question is and that is
what I will seek to answer by way of &#147;if this happens, that
happens&#148; to the Committee so that it can see where the legal
responsibility finally ends up in either relationship. Would that be
helpful?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000409"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for her response.
I am also pleased that she understands the question that I am asking,
and the reason behind it. It would be helpful for the Committee to
understand the response to that particular situation. I suspect, and I
think that this was the point that the hon. Member for Southport was
making, that it is not a simple matter of reading across from marriage
to civil partnerships. Disparities will be exposed, and that was the
point of asking this particular question. If the Minister can confirm
that in writing after she has read <i class="I">Hansard </i>tomorrow, that would
be very helpful. That will have a knock-on impact for subsequent
clauses that we will be discussing later
on.</div><a name="08061124000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000410"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b><b class="B"> </b>Absolutely, and it is about the common
law presumption to which we have referred before. We need to focus
clearly on that before we enter discussions on some of the other
clauses dealing with surrogacy later in the week. I accept that
point.</div><a name="08061124000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000411"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I have kept out of this one because I am not
clever enough to follow the strange family arrangements that the hon.
Member for Boston and Skegness and my hon. Friend the Member for
Southport feel so uncomfortable about discussing. This is probably an
obvious point, but if there is not a read-across between marriage and
civil partnership, does that lead to problems of discrimination? It is
my understanding that it was the intention of the law, and policy, to
ensure that as far as possible&#151;even if it means converting from
common law to statute law to provide that equality&#151;there should
be equality between civil partnership and marriage because someone
could claim that they were not being given a presumption that other
people were and that that was a significant infringement of their
rights to equal treatment. There is a presumption in one case but not
in the other and civil partners have to strive to overcome that extra
barrier. I have raised that as a question for the Minister to
consider.</div><a name="08061124000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000412"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I will reflect on that point. However, the
Government have signed to say that the Bill complies with equality
legislation so our lawyers will have checked it.</div>

<a name="08061124000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Clause 38
ordered to stand part of the
Bill.</i></div><a name="08061124000028"></a>




<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
39</h4><a name="08061124000013"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Use
of sperm, or transfer of embryo, after death of man providing
sperm</div><a name="08061124000180"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
proposed, </i>That the clause stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="08061124000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000413"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> Clause 39 is quite important because it relates
to the use of the man&#146;s sperm after his death, irrespective of
whether the embryo was implanted before or after his death. Subsection
(1)(c)(i) refers to the circumstance where a man has consented to the
use of his sperm after his death. Will the Minister confirm whether it
would be standard practice on the consent form relating to clause 37
for a man to also give consent regarding use of his gametes after his
death, or whether that is completely separate? Also, how does it work
in  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column219" />Column number: 219</div>relation to married couples, where a consent form is not required
because consent is presumed? Can it be proved otherwise? Is specific
post-death consent required?</div>
<a name="08061124000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">The further
point I want to make about clause 39 is that subsection (1)(d), which I
do not understand, gives the woman the right to choose whether the man
is considered the father of the child. Presumably, if the original
father, prior to his death, consented for his genetic material to be
used for the treatment for the purposes of creating a child after his
death then he is the genetic father. Unless the woman has remarried,
and therefore under common law the new husband is the father, why does
the woman have the right to be able to choose whether the man is
considered the father? He is the father; he is not an anonymous donor.
Perhaps the Minister could also explain&#151;I know that the right
hon. Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill will be interested
in this&#151;why there is a difference between England and Scotland
on the 42 days and the 21 days
requirements.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000414"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I just want a simple clarification, but a more basic
one. The clause states that if the man has agreed in advance and the
woman chooses this within 42 days of the birth of the child, the man
can be identified as the father of the child, provided, as the hon.
Gentleman has said, that the woman is agreeable. If, as in that case,
the sperm of a deceased person is being used, is there any limitation,
whether biological, physical or legal, on how long that sperm could
have been around? Theoretically, in legal terms we could be talking
about a 10 or 15-year period and I wonder whether the law allows any
possible period to be used. That could have significance for all sorts
of inheritance
issues.</div><a name="08061124000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000415"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> There are no inheritance issues here.</div>
<a name="08061124000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 39
replaces, for future cases, provisions of the Human Fertilisation and
Embryology (Deceased Fathers) Act 2003. Those provisions relate to the
use of a man&#146;s sperm to create a child with his consent after he
has died. The clause provides that, where a woman conceives a child
using the sperm of a man who has died, or where an embryo was created
with his sperm before he died, but was transferred to the woman after
his death, and the man had consented to the use of his sperm in this
way after his death and the woman who carried the child gives notice in
writing within 42 days&#151;or in Scotland, within 21
days&#151;after the birth of the child that the man is to be the
father, then the man is to be treated as the father of the child, for
the purpose of birth registration alone. That applies whether the
assisted conception treatment of the woman was in the UK or elsewhere.
Clause 39(1)(d) encompasses the right of the woman to choose to record
the man on the birth certificate, which is symbolic. The man will be
deceased, and that is why the woman has the right to choose.</div>
<a name="08061124000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
difference between Scotland and England and Wales is connected to birth
registration, which is a devolved matter. The provision in the Bill
reflects the fact that the standard time period in each country for
birth registration is different&#151;before the hon. Gentleman asks
me, I do not know why, but it is&#151;and it reflects the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column220" />Column number: 220</div>difference on devolved matters. That is what we are seeking to ensure.
It is a standard part of the HFEA&#146;s consent forms to ensure that
such consent has been given when embryos and gametes are stored. The
measure builds on the Act to which I referred, which I hope
clarifies&#151;</div><a name="08061124000333"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000416"></a>Dr.

way?</div><a name="08061124000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000417"></a>Dawn

give way at the end of my sentence but I have forgotten what I was
going to say.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000418"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I think that the Minister answered my question. I
heard her say that the measure is for birth registration purposes only
and that it will not affect inheritable rights
whatever.</div>
<a name="08061124000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000419"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I can confirm that that is the case&#151;the
measure is for birth registration. It allows parenthood only to be
recorded symbolically on the birth certificate and confirms no other
legal status to the father&#151;nor could it&#151;and therefore no
inheritance rights for the child. If a father wished to leave some of
his estate to his unborn child, he could make that clear in his will.
That is how such a situation would be dealt
with.</div>
<a name="08061124000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000420"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for her response
but, unusually, she did not answer one of my points&#151;I may have
misunderstood or misheard what she said&#151;on paragraph (d). It
appears that a biological father who donated sperm prior to his death
could, by the choice of the woman who has the child, never be placed on
the birth certificate in the first place. He would therefore not be the
father even if he consented for his sperm to be used for the purposes
of creating the child. I do not understand what the defence for
paragraph (d) is. The Minister explained what it does, but not why, nor
why it is in the Bill. If the woman does not choose the biological
father to be named as the father, and the mother has not remarried and,
therefore, under common law, found a new father, who will be the father
of the
child?</div><a name="08061124000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000421"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I remember the debates on the 2003 Act, which
began life as Tony Clarke&#146;s private Member&#146;s
Bill&#151;many of us remember him. It was predicated on the fact that
Diane Blood, in that famous case, was keen to ensure that her late
husband&#146;s name could be on the birth certificate, prospectively
at least, even if she were to receive treatment abroad. It was the view
of the Committee that considered that Bill that the woman should be
able to reflect on that issue after the birth of the child. The
legislation was designed to provide maximum flexibility to a woman in a
difficult situation, who was recently bereaved or who only recently
became a mother, so that she could decide whether she wanted to put her
late husband&#146;s name on the birth
certificate.</div><a name="08061124000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000422"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that
helpful intervention&#151;it shines some light on the measure. I was
in the House in 2003, but the private Member&#146;s Bill to which he
referred passed me by. Will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column221" />Column number: 221</div>the Minister confirm what the hon. Gentleman said, because I did not get
the impression that she put forward a defence of paragraph
(d)?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000423"></a>Dawn

<a name="08061124000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon asked what needs to happen. Both
the man and woman would need to consent to the former&#146;s name

<a name="08061124000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000425"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> We are getting into the nitty-gritty of the
Bill, as the clause relates to the transfer of an embryo after the
death of a man who was treated as a father in cases where donor sperm
was used. There is a great deal of concern among the public about that,
and certainly a large number of people have written to me about the
clauses that we are about to discuss. I want to understand two things
about the workings of the clause. I will not repeat the arguments that
were made on the Floor of the House and in this Committee about the
importance of the male in bringing up children, because members of the
Committee have different views about that, but perhaps the Minister
will explain how subsection (2)(b) relates to clauses 42 and 43 and
whether there is an exact mirror and read-over from different-sex
relationships to same-sex relationships and from marriages in
heterosexual relationships to civil partnerships in same-sex
relationships.</div>
<a name="08061124000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems to
me that clause 40 will enable someone who is not married, has not
provided the sperm and so has no genetic relationship with the child
and who is not alive to be the parent of that child on its birth
certificate. It might be that no intimate relationship at all took
place between the two people who would potentially be the parents of
that child, whether they are a heterosexual or a same-sex
couple.</div>
<a name="08061124000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">The context
of this and the prism through which we must look at all the debates on
these clauses is that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column222" />Column number: 222</div>welfare of the child must be paramount. I just question at this stage
whether a couple that did not even have an intimate relationship,
certainly were not married, might not even have been in a civil
partnership, had no genetic contribution to the child&#146;s make-up
and are not alive would be appropriate people to have as an official
parent of a child, and that is in the context of the importance of the
child&#146;s
welfare.</div><a name="08061124000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000426"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> My concern is about what birth certificates are now
intended to do. Normally, they are indicative of someone&#146;s
assumption of legal responsibilities or biological connection with the
individual named on the certificate, or both. In this case there
appears to be a suggestion that the person named on the birth
certificate should fulfil one criterion: a previous willingness to take
part in an IVF programme with the person whom they pre-deceased. That
is a big extension, therefore, in our view, of the role of birth
certificates. The Minister said that birth certificates can do
something symbolic. I certainly did not realise that. Perhaps there is
scope for birth certificates in respect of all sorts of strange, exotic
things, but we ought to stick to a more rigid view of what they should
do.</div><a name="08061124000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
is the Government&#146;s reason for such an obvious and quite
definite extension of the use of a birth certificate? What is the
thinking behind it? Is it to provide an explanation to the child about
their origin? If so, and if the child does not look any further, it
would clearly give an inaccurate explanation of the child&#146;s
origin. It is obviously preferable to talk about storks and gooseberry
bushes, but is putting the child off the scent by not letting them
think any further than that they were conceived with the person named
on the birth certificate as an agent in some way in the interests of
the child? If so, is that obvious?</div>
<a name="08061124000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept what
the clause does and I am not necessary agin it. However, I see it as
extending what birth certificates do and I want to know the
Government&#146;s rationale for doing precisely
that.</div>
<a name="08061124000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000427"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I heard what my hon. Friend said and the fair way
in which he put it. Obviously, I could come up with an example that was
far removed from the intention of the clause and a direct consequence
of the 2003 Act. When that was made law, and if it was to apply to a
married couple who may have been married for a year, it would have been
wrong not to apply it to a couple who may well have been receiving IVF
because the man was infertile, but who had been in a non-married
relationship for 20 years and, indeed, had had other children before
infertility intervened on the man. There would therefore have had to be
a parallel provision for unmarried men in the case of deceased
fathers.</div><a name="08061124000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must remember that such a provision was sought by Diane Blood, who
campaigned hard for it. She was supported by the newspapers that often
worry about fatherhood, but they were very clear that it was
appropriate in those circumstances. We can always say that that means
that such provisions could apply to someone who was not in an intimate
relationship, who had known the woman for only a short time, but
who  had been treated together with her and then died. I do not
know whether there would ever be such a case. In the end, we cannot
design legislation to fit the most extreme
cases.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column223" />Column number: 223</div><a name="08061124000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000428"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I do not regard the introduction of the Diane Blood
case as at all helpful in our discussions. In that case, the name of
the father was on the birth certificate and thus would have shown the
biological origin. That is what birth certificates have traditionally
done in part, although not exclusively.</div>
<a name="08061124000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000429"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Birth certificates do not reflect the genetic
origin. They reflect the legal father, who is often the social father.
Now is not the time to go into the issue of non-paternity, but lots of
milkmen, even in Southport, would be very afraid of the implications of
genetic fatherhood&#151;if I can use that term in its general sense,
even if it is a bit &#147;Carry On&#148;. Birth certificates are
not a reflection of genetic parenthood. I am not claiming that he does,
but if my hon. Friend wants that to be the case, there would be a lot
of paternity tests and a lot of frightened
milkmen.</div><a name="08061124000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000430"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I referred to an either/or situation. I am sure that
my hon. Friend would accept the proposition that, in the past, a birth
certificate traditionally showed people who should take legal
responsibility for the child or someone who had a biological connection
with the child. We have a proposition where neither of those things
happen.</div><a name="08061124000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000431"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> My hon. Friend is correct. It is a consequence of
the 2003 Act. The explanatory notes
state:</div><a name="08061124000316"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Clause
40 makes similar provision to clause 39 for the case when donated sperm
has been
used.&#148;</div><a name="08061124000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
is right to identify the fact that it is the coming together of two
slightly incompatible things: first, the wish to ensure that men who
are infertile, but treated together with a woman, are treated fairly
and equivalently to men who are using their sperm when that is
required, which is the general, uncontentious theme of the
clause.</div>
<a name="08061124000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, in
significant circumstances, the deceased father should be recognised.
Those circumstances have to be met in order to satisfy the need for
bereaved women in such situations to recognise the relationship that
they had and that had brought about directly or indirectly the birth of
the child. However, I accept my hon. Friend&#146;s point. It is a
slightly uncomfortable marriage of the two issues, and he is right to
draw out the difference. I am keen to say that I support the clause,
for the reasons that I have given, although it is a difficult
translation of two different
provisions.</div><a name="08061124000334"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000432"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> Clause 40 relates to the registration of a
father when a child is born to a woman as a result of the transfer of
an embryo created with donor sperm when her husband or unmarried male
partner died before the embryo was transferred. It contains two
measures, relating respectively to married women and to women who were
not married, but had a fatherhood agreement with a man. It enables the
child to have official recognition of the father. The clause replaces
the existing measure in the 1990 Act and recognises the new provision
in the Bill for unmarried couples to have a fatherhood agreement when
donor sperm is
used.</div><a name="08061124000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(1) provides that if an embryo was created with donor sperm while the
woman was married, but her husband died before the embryo could be
transferred 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column224" />Column number: 224</div>to her, the man can be registered as the father of the child in certain
circumstances: the husband must have consented in writing, and must not
have withdrawn that consent, to the embryo&#146;s transfer to the
woman and his registration as the father; the woman must have decided
within 42 days of the birth of the child, or 21 days in Scotland, that
the man will be registered; and there must be no other
parent&#151;for example, the child must not have been
adopted.</div><a name="08061124000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(2) provides that if an embryo was created with donor sperm through
assisted conception in a UK-licensed clinic at a time when the woman
was not married or in a civil partnership, but her male partner died
before the embryo could be transferred to her, the man can be
registered as the father of the child in the following circumstances:
the man must have consented in writing, and must not have withdrawn
that consent, to the embryo&#146;s transfer to the woman and his
registration as the father of the child born as a result. Additionally,
immediately before his death, the agreed fatherhood conditions set out
in clause 37 must have been in place, the woman have decided within 42
days from the birth of the child, or 21 days in Scotland, and there
must be no other father&#151;for example, the child must not have
been adopted.</div>
<a name="08061124000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provisions will ensure equivalence between heterosexual and same-sex
couples. The intention is to achieve equality, but the hon. Member for
Boston and Skegness is absolutely right to pick up the point that
underpinning it is the additional key requirement that under section
13(5) of the 1990 Act, clinics must consider the welfare of any child
born before providing the treatment.</div>
<a name="08061124000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon is right that the 2003 Act
established that a deceased person could, in certain limited
circumstances that I have described, be the parent of a child for the
purposes of the birth certificate only. The Bill updates that principle
only to reflect equality for same-sex couples. Yes, there is a
read-across. The provisions address cases in which a couple has created
an embryo using a woman&#146;s egg and a man&#146;s sperm. They
provide for the woman to proceed with treatment using an embryo that
was created by the woman and her partner as a couple. It does not
introduce any new requirements; it brings the equality requirements

<a name="08061124000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000433"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I have a couple of examples that the Minister
might like to consider overnight so that she can include them in her
correspondence tomorrow. However, my first question does not relate to
that matter. It is not clear what happens if a civil partner 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column225" />Column number: 225</div>does not consent. Am I to assume that the same applies in civil
partnership as with marriage&#151;that, as we discussed earlier,
consent is assumed?</div>
<a name="08061124000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall give
examples of two complexities. First, what happens in a civil
partnership in which both partners consent&#151;by implication or
otherwise&#151;and the civil partnership is legally separated
post-implantation of the embryo and one member of the original same-sex
couple marries a man during the gestation period? Is that man the
father? Does common law apply in that situation? Is that man therefore
the parent?</div>
<a name="08061124000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
example has the same initial set of circumstances. If there is a legal
separation of a civil partnership, but a new and different civil
partnership is then put in place, who is the parent? Is it the initial
civil partner, when consent was assumed for the implantation to take
place, or is it the new civil partner with whom the pregnant woman has
entered into a civil partnership? Alternatively, is it up to the
pregnant woman to make a choice between the
two?</div><a name="08061124000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000434"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> It is probably my lack of attention to detail that
prompts me to ask this question. The explanatory notes give the idea
that there could be two sorts of arrangements: one in which civil
partners happily consent to the arrangement, and the other in which
only one partner does so. Similar provisions seem to apply to married
couples, so the arrangements are equivalent. I understand that, and I
know where everyone is coming from on that question. However, that
might create problems further down the line for couples and civil
partners.</div>
<a name="08061124000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a child
enters into the marriage or civil partnership but is not wanted, one
would suppose that duties in relation to the child&#151;whether
imposed by the Home Office or others&#151;were shared
collectively.</div>
<a name="08061124000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000435"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> It is not a question of whether a child is
wanted; it is about who is mentioned on the birth
certificate&#151;that is all. The route that the hon. Gentleman is
going down is about a child not being wanted. If there is a separation
in a relationship and there are existing children, the question of how
the family unit bonds is a matter for the couple. The Bill does not
enter into that in any shape or form. Indeed, no legislation enters
into the situation when there are
stepchildren.</div><a name="08061124000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000436"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that
clarification. What I think she is saying&#151;I shall tell the
Committee and she can say whether I have the gist of it&#151;is that
the clause does not alter any other piece of domestic legislation,
family law or otherwise, but that it simply relates to the very
technical, specific and precise matter of whether someone wants to go
on the
certificate.</div><a name="08061124000232"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08061124000437"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Gary Streeter</b> (South-West Devon) (Con): The clause is the
first in a series of measures giving legal effect to same-sex
couples&#151;in this case lesbian couples&#151;having IVF, in some
cases on the NHS. I hope that the Committee will forgive me if I make a
few comments to suggest why the clause should not stand part of the
Bill. In doing so, I am speaking for myself&#151;not for my party or
as a Front-Bench spokesperson.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column226" />Column number: 226</div><a name="08061124000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
should not be allowed to pass without making some comment to reflect a
considerable amount of opinion in the country. As we legislate on
behalf of the whole country, it is important that certain opinions are
voiced, and I hope to do so in a reasonable
manner.</div><a name="08061124000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wish to express concern about the clause and subsequent clauses. Some
people argue that because gay adoption is legal, it is only natural
that same-sex couples should have the right to equal access to IVF
treatment. The clause deals particularly with the birth certificate
arrangements in that instance. I certainly understand the argument in
terms of equality, but I believe that permitting IVF for lesbian
couples is wholly different from lesbian adoption. I say that because
when a child is conceived who is later adopted by a lesbian couple,
they at least had the chance of having a father and might well have had
a father for a certain period of time. That child already exists. We
are talking about the state facilitating the process of a child being
created who will have no chance whatsoever of ever having a father
during the duration of his or her childhood, and the Bill has precisely
that effect. Do you want to slap me down, Mr.
Hood?</div><a name="08061124000235"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000439"></a>Mr.
Streeter:</b> I am
grateful.</div><a name="08061124000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not intend to repeat this speech during our proceedings on the
remaining clauses in the cluster. That is why I hope that I can have my
say on this clause, which leads us into the other
clauses.</div><a name="08061124000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
clause 45, we have the chilling
words</div><a name="08061124000239"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;no
man is to be treated as the father of the child.&#148;</div>
<a name="08061124000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suggest that those
words raise huge questions about child rights that have so far been
given no attention in our deliberations. We are talking about two women
creating a child who will never have a father. What is wrong with that?
All my instincts are against that notion as it flies in the face of
common sense and nature. I also believe that many of our constituents
do not know that this is taking place through the single-woman route,
or that it will be going on once the Bill becomes law. I think that
many of our constituents would be puzzled by same-sex couples having
IVF on the NHS, given the pressure that the NHS is under.</div>
<a name="08061124000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">None of that
may be enough to persuade the Committee that the clause should not
stand part of the Bill, so let us consider some research on why the
matter is so important. Of course, it is our responsibility as
legislators to look at evidence and not to rely simply on our own
instincts. Surely we must not do anything today that would prejudice
the paramount interests of the child in light of the current balance of
research. What, therefore, does the research say about how we should
approach the subject? An extensive research base unequivocally
demonstrates that fathers are important and bring something distinctive
to the parenting process that is different from what mothers bring. The
Minister might remember that after a few refusals, she allowed me to
intervene on Second Reading to ask whether the Government thought there
was any difference in the process of a loving same-sex
couple&#151;two mothers bringing up a child&#151;and a loving
mother and father bringing up a child? Is there no advantage at all in
having a father? The Minister was good enough to say that that was not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column227" />Column number: 227</div>the Government&#146;s position. She must therefore accept that having
a father can be important in the circumstances that I have just
described&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i></div>

Hood.</div><a name="08061124000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">Fathers
bring something distinctive to the party. One can only handle research
in relation to children responsibly by concluding that we must assume
that the best interests of the child are, on average&#151;although we
know of wonderful examples that buck the trend&#151;less likely to be
met in the absence of a father. In the light of the very extensive body
of research, we have to conclude that it would be wrong of the state to
facilitate the deliberate creation of children with the intention that
they should be denied the chance of ever having a father for the
duration of their childhood, yet that is what the clause does. The body
of research is so extensive that I cannot refer to all of it, but I
want to cite a few texts. They have not come to me from lobby groups,
so I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury will be happy
for me to mention
them.</div><a name="08061124000335"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15

titles&#151;states:</div>

support here for the relative importance of fathers&#146; (as
compared to mothers&#146;) support of both sons and daughters. Youth

be linked to lower levels of later depression for early adolescent

is from a report called &#147;The Uniqueness of the Child-Father

smaller body of research focuses narrowly on studying same-sex
parenting, about which we heard quite a lot on Second Reading. I think
that the BMA sent all hon. Members a briefing on the subject, which
refers to some findings. The BMA report
states:</div><a name="08061124000320"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
substantial amount of research has been carried out on the parenting
skills of lesbian couples. In the early days, research focused upon
women who had started a family in a heterosexual relationship but
continued to raise their children in a lesbian relationship. More
recently, research has concentrated upon lesbian couples who seek to
have a child through donor insemination at a licensed fertility
clinic&#148;&#151;</div><a name="08061124000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">as
would be permitted by clause 42. It continues:</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column228" />Column number: 228</div><a name="08061124000321"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Social
research on children born to these families has given similar findings
to those children born to solo mothers. Their emotional and
psychological development is comparable to children born of donor
insemination to two heterosexual parents. In fact, the second female
parent often has greater parent-child interaction than do the fathers
in the heterosexual
couples.&#148;</div><a name="08061124000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
seems to be very supportive of the parenting skills of two mums, as
opposed to a mother and a father. On the basis of that briefing, one
might have presumed a supporting reference to a selection of key texts
to define that &#147;substantial amount of research&#148;. In
reality, however, the statement in question is backed by just one
footnote, which cites just one 11-year-old journal
article&#151;hardly an extensive research
base.</div><a name="08061124000253"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08061124000442"></a><b class="B">Jeremy
Wright</b> (Rugby and Kenilworth) (Con): My hon. Friend will
tell me straight away if he intends to come on to this issue in his
speech. Does he share my concern that as the child of such a practice
grows up, he or she will instinctively understand that it cannot be
right that both of his or her mothers were the only people involved in
his or her conception? Is he therefore concerned about the effect on
the child of that realisation and where it may
lead?</div><a name="08061124000254"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000443"></a>Mr.

this speech; I made it on Second Reading. However, my hon. Friend is
right. I think that I said on Second Reading that that realisation
could only add to the turbulence of the teenage years&#151;the
self-discovery, the identity crisis that many hon. Members in this Room
have clearly gone through and possibly one or two still are. That
realisation certainly cannot help, and I am concerned about
that.</div><a name="08061124000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is other research on the subject, most of which is linked to somebody
called Professor Susan Golombok, whom we heard quite a lot about on
Second Reading. She has written extensively and almost
exclusively&#151;hardly anyone else seems to write on the subject
with the same authority as her. A paper that she co-authored called
&#147;Children with Lesbian Parents&#148;, published in the journal

that</div><a name="08061124000322"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it

Brian Iddon</b> (Bolton, South-East) (Lab): On a point of
order, Mr. Hood. My understanding was that the House had
been given a chance to debate the need for a father, admittedly not on
this clause. As Chairman of the Committee, are you now allowing a

finished. I apologise for detaining the Committee for so long, but I
think that the voice needs to be
heard.</div><a name="08061124000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am talking about the further research of Professor Golombok, who says
that perhaps it is just the loss of a parent through relationship
breakdown, whether heterosexual or homosexual, that is the real engine
for prejudicing the best interests of the child. That is interesting
and makes sense, but fails to take account of the fact that the only
study of relationship stability within the context of civil partnership
arrangements was done in Sweden, where such relationships have been
legal since the early 1990s. That study showed that male gay couples
are 50 per cent. more likely to break up than married heterosexual
couples and that the rate of partnership break-up for lesbian couples
is about double that for gay couples. It does not help the argument to
postulate that the problem is discordant relationships, because that is
much more likely to face the children who, sadly, might be coming into
existence as a result of clause
42.</div><a name="08061124000262"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000447"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that what counts
in every circumstance is the quality of the parenting? For instance,
where children are sent away to boarding school at an early age, they
are removed from their parents, but the quality of their relationship
continues, even though they are separated for long periods. The
constant presence of a particular family mix is not the guiding point
in the development of children, but rather the fact they are loved and
valued and the quality of their relationships, regardless of the
structure of the
family.</div><a name="08061124000263"></a>

to be separated from our children, but I take her point. That is why I
would rather a child was placed for adoption with a gay or lesbian

nurturing parents for that child has to be better than local authority
care.</div><a name="08061124000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000452"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> The hon. Gentleman argued in part that because
certain relationships were more likely to break down than others,
people in such relationships should not be allowed to be
parents&#151;at least through NHS provision. Perhaps he is arguing
against the clause standing part. Yet that is the only area that he is
choosing. Let us say that one part of the country was found to have, on
average, a greater rate of relationship breakdown&#151;say, Devon.
Would he argue against IVF being provided by the NHS in Devon? If poor
people had a higher rate of relationship breakdown, would he use the
same argument? How can he say, because there is a general issue in
Sweden, that that is translatable into policy applying to everyone in
that situation?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column230" />Column number: 230</div><a name="08061124000268"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000453"></a>Mr.
Streeter:</b> I am not saying that of course. I am asking
whether the state should be facilitating the creation of a child, from
a same-sex couple, who will never have a father. Is that what we should
be doing? Is that what we should be doing without consulting our
constituents widely? The reference to Sweden was simply to make the
point that the studies that Professor Golombok produces are open to
challenge. However, I shall not go into further detail, because we have
only a few moments left before we are required
elsewhere.</div><a name="08061124000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
the Minister replies, she may talk about human rights. I understand the
human rights position, but I believe that the balance of human rights
between two adults who want a child and the human rights of the child
yet to be born can be broadly weighed equally. Having looked at the
matter fairly carefully, I do not think that a successful challenge
could be brought under human rights legislation. As the Minister will
know, IVF for same-sex couples, or even single people, is prohibited in
France, Italy, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Norway, the Czech
Republic and Portugal, all of which have signed up to the European
convention on human rights. That we have incorporated the convention
into UK law is not important&#151;it is the same set of values and
rights as those countries also embrace, and they do not have a problem
with human rights. There are members of the Committee who think that
perhaps I am on a flight of fancy. I am saying that on this, the UK is
out of step with most of our European colleagues.</div>
<a name="08061124000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have two
more points to make. The first is that fathers are important and clause
42 takes us in the wrong direction. Over the last week or so, a very
nice White Paper has been produced by the Secretary of State for Work
and Pensions and the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and
Families. It
says:</div><a name="08061124000323"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Fathers&#146;
involvement in their child&#146;s life can lead to positive
educational achievement, a good, open and trusting parent-child
relationship during the teenage years and reduce the risk of mental
health issues for children in separated families. Engaging fathers
around the time of their child&#146;s birth, including through being
registered as father, is important in establishing that close
involvement.&#148;</div><a name="08061124000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government are promoting fathers on the one hand, but through this
legislation they are, in my opinion, condemning some children in the
future to never having had a father. The Committee should consider that
extremely carefully. On that point I will sit
down.</div>
<a name="08061124000272"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08061124000454"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Desmond Turner</b> (Brighton, Kemptown) (Lab): I hope that the
Committee will resist the hon. Gentleman. For one thing, if he was
successful and the Committee did not agree that clause 42 should stand
part, it would not prevent the provision of IVF to a lesbian couple.
The clause deals with how the other member of the couple is to be
referred to and that is all. As to the principle that he has been
expounding, the House dealt with that at length, and it was very
heavily carried on a free vote. The amendment demanding the need for a
father in those circumstances was soundly defeated. It is not
reasonable to try and circumvent that decision in this way on this
clause and in any event, it would not have the effect that he desires
of preventing IVF treatment for lesbian
couples.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000455"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> We had this debate to some extent on Second
Reading and in the Committee of the whole House, and I am not going to
repeat the points that I made there. However, I want to make three
brief rebuttals 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column231" />Column number: 231</div>in support of clause stand part. First, what the Government seek to do
is absolutely right and it does not need to be done on the basis of
human rights. I have never argued that it is anything to do with human
rights. It is about allowing families to get on with their lives
without the state intervening to block them from doing so.</div>
<a name="08061124000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are in an
interesting political situation. I do not mean to be party political,
but there is an issue of the state not interfering too much with
consenting adults, and then some people in Parliament argue that the
state should specifically deny and interfere with certain family
arrangements. If we are going to do that, there must be good evidence
for doing so. The other side does not need the evidence; the burden of
evidence falls on those who wish to discriminate and in this case,
there is no good evidence that can be adduced. However, the evidence
that the hon. Member for South-West Devon has attacked&#151;in
moderate terms, I accept&#151;from Professor Golombok and others, is
good evidence. The evidence that the hon. Gentleman cites does not
relate to the sorts of families we talk about. Indeed, in his quotes
from a book and a report there was no read-across between lesbian
couples and other families. The arguments against the measure fail at
the first hurdle. They fail to demonstrate that there is any basis on
which to discriminate in a positive way. There is no evidence that
children do better with heterosexual couples than with same-sex
couples.</div>
<a name="08061124000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the
comparisons that are made in the work of Professor Golombok, formerly
of London university, now of Cambridge university, are correct. They
compare heterosexual couples and their children with same-sex couples
and their children and show that there does not appear to be any
problem. These people are academics; they do not say that there are
definitely no problems and therefore the policy is this. It is right to
point out that they use the word &#147;may&#148;, but in so far as
they draw conclusions, they do not find that these children have any
particular problems, and they have now looked at them, albeit in small
numbers, for quite some time.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000456"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I was saying that, first, the onus should be on
the discriminators and the interferers to show that there is a problem
with families of same-sex couples, but there is no evidence showing
that there is, and, secondly, the evidence that the children do well is
good, but I will not go into
that.</div><a name="08061124000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wanted to take issue with the argument made by the hon. Member for
Rugby and Kenilworth, who is not in his place, that somehow having
lesbian parents is not going to help with the turbulence of teenage
years&#151;a view that the hon. Member for South-West Devon agreed
with, but I think is wrong. The only problem that can be specific to
those children is that they might be bullied. The best approach to that
is to stop the bullying, not to deny those who would be bullied the
chance to live. That is an argument for saying that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column232" />Column number: 232</div>mixed-race children should not be allowed to be born because they might
be bullied. It is an argument&#151;I am not saying that the hon.
Member for Rugby and Kenilworth was saying that.</div>
<a name="08061124000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Golombok
research shows that, despite any bullying that might take
place&#151;I hope that there is little of it now&#151;and despite
any feelings that the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth in an
intervention attributed to them, those children do very well and are
psychologically well adjusted. It cannot be argued that having lesbian
parents cannot help with the turbulence of teenage years. I respect the
way in which the hon. Gentleman made his case, which he is entitled to
do. I am not implying that he is motivated by prejudice, for example,
but I think that his arguments are wrong.</div>
<a name="08061124000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, even
if it could be shown&#151;I do not think that it can be&#151;that,
on average, children in these families do worse, that is not an
argument for not allowing the families to exist and for the children
not to be born. That is not simply for the reason that it must be
better to be born, but if one argued that people had such a hard time
that it would be best not to be born, where would it
end?</div><a name="08061124000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
know that, sadly, on average children from poor backgrounds do not do
as well as children from wealthy backgrounds. There is evidence for
that. Yet, through the NHS, the state provides IVF for such families,
despite that average outcome. I am not for one moment suggesting, and I
do not think that the hon. Gentleman would suggest, that clinics should
have to consider the need for two incomes or that the birth certificate
arrangements in clause 42 should apply only to better-off families,
because children from poor backgrounds do worse on
average&#151;although some do very well&#151;than children from
better-off backgrounds. Even if he could make the case that he is
seeking to make, which he cannot, it is not an argument against the
measures, and that is even before we deal with the human rights and
discrimination issues. Therefore, I urge the Committee to support the
clause as it stands.</div>
<a name="08061124000283"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000457"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I shall start by referring to the provisions in
the clause and then respond to the hon. Gentlemen&#146;s
contributions. Clause 42 makes provision for bringing the arrangements
for female civil partners in line with those for married couples. Where
a female civil partner gives birth to a child conceived as a result of
donor insemination, she is the mother of the child and her civil
partner will automatically be the other parent, unless she did not
consent to the mother&#146;s treatment. The terminology of the clause
is different, as it seeks to bring civil partnerships within the sphere
of the legislation, but otherwise the legal provisions are the same as
for married couples.</div>
<a name="08061124000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
return to this point, but the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness would
seek within a short period of time&#151;nine months maximum&#151;to
conflate a range of relationships that may change who is the parent
with legal responsibility. We have accepted provision for married
couples and we are making the same provision for same-sex couples in
line with the civil partnership legislation. There cannot be any points
of principle on that, because civil partnership legislation has been
passed by the House. It is not about whether we had a discussion on the
Floor of the House on the need for a father, but a recognition that the
House has accepted partnerships and civil partnerships in
legislation.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column233" />Column number: 233</div><a name="08061124000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for South-West Devon advances an argument that is not supported
by the majority of the House, in discussions on not only the Bill but
civil partnerships and other legal status, and the Finance Bill, which
recognises civil partnerships as equivalent to marriage for tax
responsibilities. Therefore, as he acknowledged, he holds a minority
view. He put it powerfully, but I absolutely disagree with him on every
point. He advances the argument that there is a diminution of the
quality of parenting if the parents are not of a particular family
type, namely heterosexual, married and constantly there. Regrettably,
not just now in modern Britain, but throughout many centuries, family
structures have not followed the model that the hon. Gentleman believes
is best. Legislation reflects what the House has decided that the
make-up of modern Britain is.</div>
<a name="08061124000286"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000458"></a>Mr.
Streeter:</b> I may be wrong, but I do not believe that I
mentioned the word &#147;married&#148; even once in my speech. If I
did, it was not the main thrust of my argument, which was about the
state facilitating a situation in which a child is denied the prospect
of having a father, as a matter of state policy. That is what I am
challenging.</div>
<a name="08061124000287"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000459"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely wrong in his
assertion that the clause, in recognising civil partnerships, seeks to
do that. I regret to tell him that the presence of a father within a
family structure does not necessarily mean that he is actively engaged
in the upbringing of his children. The Government position is that, in
recognition of the legislation, all parents have responsibilities to
their children, and that the quality of parenting is crucial. The
clause adds a second legal parent; it does not take away status or say
that there is not another individual in the child&#146;s genetic
make-up. That is why the right for a child aged 18 to know who are the
donors is crucial.</div>
<a name="08061124000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not wish
to rehearse it. The hon. Gentleman has made his case twice. He bases
his argument on a preferred model without evidence that quality of
parenting is crucial. He and other Conservative Members have described
families in crisis or experiencing breakdowns and sought to say that
that applies to
all.</div><a name="08061124000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth commented in an intervention on
what is recorded on the child&#146;s birth certificate. I was taught,
and I am sure that every Committee member would concur, that honesty is
always the best policy. The best relationships between children and
their parents are built around honesty. It is important that children
should be told by their parents at an early age that they were donor
conceived; that is recognised to be beneficial to the children. That is
why the Government support and promote the Donor Conception
Network&#146;s &#147;Telling and Talking&#148; project. Hon.
Gentlemen may continue to advance their case if they want, but a
majority of the House substantially disagree with their view. Having
passed legislation on the matter, it is necessary that we ensure that
future legislation complies with the House&#146;s
views.</div><a name="08061124000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for South-West Devon quoted the White Paper, saying that it
showed that the Government were doing two different things. I do not
agree. It comes back to the point, which is made in the White Paper,
that fathers&#151;and, the provisions ensure, parents&#151;take
responsibility for their role through participation in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column234" />Column number: 234</div>their children&#146;s upbringing, in this case by registering the
birth with the mother. That is exactly where we should
be.</div><a name="08061124000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Boston and Skegness asked a couple of questions and
gave examples. Is he seriously suggesting that between conception and
birth, several legal partnerships will be entered into, dissolved and
re-entered? The first point that must be made is that counselling is
given before IVF treatment, during which it is crucial that the welfare
of the child is considered. That includes parents with a stable
relationship who are committed to the child&#146;s upbringing. As I
said in my opening remarks, the clause introduces the same measures
that have operated for married couples so far, and I do not remember
any complaints about them. To answer his scenarios, I hope that he is
not suggesting that we should treat same-sex couples differently, given
their legal status under civil partnership legislation.</div>
<a name="08061124000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman also asked what would happen if assisted conception took
place within a civil partnership and then, within the short period
after all the processes are gone through and before the baby is born,
the civil partnership is dissolved and the mother marries. It will be
presumed that the husband is the father, but that presumption is
rebuttable&#151;this is the same point as in our discussions on
previous clauses&#151;by DNA testing. Because clause 42 would apply,
the original civil partner would be the other legal parent. This comes
back to the fact that in deciding to become parents, the individuals
need to recognise that they have a responsibility as parents that will
endure, but which under certain circumstances could be
rebutted.</div><a name="08061124000338"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7.15
pm</div>
<a name="08061124000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the civil
partners have an assisted conception and then enter into a second civil
partnership, that will not affect the original arrangement. As in the
first example that the hon. Gentleman gave, the original civil partner
will be the other legal parent by virtue of clause 42. This is about
recognising the point at which the decisions are taken and I have
covered the importance of that
issue.</div><a name="08061124000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman also asked about what happens if the civil partner does
not consent. In that case, they would not be the legal parent of the
child because the consent would be presumed unless evidence was shown
to the contrary. Of course, these are complex relationships in terms of
law and reflecting on what is necessary to produce an outcome on who
has the legal responsibility. While I acknowledge the strong feelings
of the hon. Member for South-West Devon, with which I do not agree, I
have given most of my remarks in this debate in relation to what the
clause does, as opposed to the wider
principle.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061124000460"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for responding to
the points that I made. I accept that the examples that I gave in
relation to this clause and the previous clause are unlikely and
complex. Nevertheless, it is the Committee&#146;s job to scrutinise
and to make sure that the law is robust enough to cater for all
potential circumstances. I noticed from the flurry of papers that was
being exchanged while I was asking my questions that this was perhaps
something that had not been considered before, so I do not regret
asking these particular questions. The answers have demonstrated that
differences exist between how the law is structured for same-sex 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column235" />Column number: 235</div>couples and for different-sex couples, and that while the new husband in
the heterosexual couple will be the father of the child, the original
civil partner will be the other partner on the birth certificate. It
was quite right to extract that information from the Minister. I say to
her that I was not trying to demonstrate any prejudice, or whatever
word she might like to use, as regards the differences between
heterosexual and same-sex couples. Indeed, if my hon. Friend the Member
for South-West Devon chooses to vote against the clause, I shall not
vote with him.</div>

Mr. Gale, and therefore I shall be very
brief.</div><a name="08061124000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">Tonight,
in common with other Members, I have had the opportunity to be at other
important House of Commons events: meetings of the Administration
Committee, the all-party group on learning disability and so on. I note
that there are no cameras from the <i class="I">Daily Mail</i> and the BBC
showing a fairly well attended Committee. A photograph was published of
the Chamber on the day on which I last spoke in Committee. It was taken
during the debate on knives, and the media said that only 16 Members
&#147;bothered to turn up&#148; to that debate. I hope that some
day the media will recognise the marvellous work that you chair,
Mr. Hood, and the fact that hon. Members make a contribution
in such Committees.</div>
<a name="08061124000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">I tabled
amendment No. 154 to give the Committee the opportunity to have the
kind of debate that we have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column236" />Column number: 236</div>just had. With the greatest respect to my hon. Friends, it might well be
that the hon. Member for South-West Devon does not have much support in
this Committee, but he has overwhelming support in my constituency. I
think that it is perfectly fair that that view is expressed.</div>
<a name="08061124000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 45(1)
states:</div><a name="08061124000324"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where
a woman is treated by virtue of section 42 or 43 as a parent of the
child, no man is to be treated as the father of the

find that quite chilling. When I served on the Committee that
considered the Bill that became the Children Act 1989, it was accepted
that the rights of the child were paramount. In all honesty, I have not
seen that as a theme in our debates throughout our consideration of the
Bill. As for prejudice, that is an unfortunate word that does not apply
to the views that were expressed in the Committee
today.</div><a name="08061124000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that there is an obligation to the child. We were entitled to ask
today what was in the best interest of the child. We discussed entirely
and exclusively what many regarded as the rights or otherwise of
adults, but not those of the child. The reason why I tabled the
amendment was that I felt&#151;and still do feel&#151;that far more
focus ought to be given to the rights of the child and their future
after they are born. I do not agree with the majority of hon. Members
on this matter, although I accept that a view was taken by the House. I
also acknowledge that the Prime Minister accepted that there would be a
free vote. In that spirit, I have expressed my view. It would have been
less than courageous not to have said to the hon. Member for South-West
Devon that he has support in parts of the House and elsewhere in the
country. I have no desire to move the
