</P>
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I was drawing my remarks to a close. We have debated the schedule for longer than anticipated and we have dealt with all the points raised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I have one final question. The Paymaster General referred several times to paragraph 48, or rather new paragraph 56, which says that in section 67 of the Capital Allowances Act 1990, omit subsections (2), (3) and (3A). Why should those be omitted?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> We have not touched on that. I shall be happy to supply the hon. Gentleman with further information on the new paragraph.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> That is inadequate. I did not pick a paragraph in the schedule at random; I picked one that has been referred to several times. We received two assurances about what it means. I merely asked why subsections (2), (3) and (3A) should be omitted. I could probably tell the Paymaster General why they should be omitted, but I want to hear that from him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> If the hon. Gentleman knows the answer, he is wasting the Committee's time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Question is--
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Mr. Gale--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Is it a point of order?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> No.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am in the middle of putting the Question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I trust that it is relevant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> It is, Mr. Gale. Opposition Members have posed a genuine question. We have not received an answer from the Paymaster General. How can the Question be put if we do not receive answers to our questions?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman has been in the House long enough to know that he has the opportunity to force a Division. I am about to put the Question. If you, as a hon. Member of this House, wish to vote against it, you are entitled to do so.
<P>
Schedule 5, as amended, agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 39</center></H4>
<H4><center>Land managed as one estate and maintenance funds for historic buildings</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaun Woodward </B>(Witney): I beg to move amendment No. 115, in page 23, line 2, after `buildings)', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`except in the case of Grade 1 heritage buildings and those houses with One Estate Election that already open to the public.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is an extremely important clause. The amendment is important because many people have not realised the full significance of the clause which will deprive many millions of people access to some of the most important historic properties in our country. The clause will also hit many people who, in good faith in 1963, made a contract with the Government to elect for one estate election. The clause will break that contract. That breach of faith will cause many people to suffer but tourists, both British and foreign, will suffer the most because they explore our country in the hope of seeing some of the most spectacular architecture and the finest houses and collections of furniture and art treasures in the world.
<P>
The clause attacks the very principle that the Government espoused of giving everyone greater access to our heritage. The clause denies the public the right to see the properties, and the treasures within those properties, of which we are justly very proud.
<P>
This is one of those clauses that occasionally gets slipped into a Finance Bill. It received not much--if any--discussion in the Chancellor's Budget statement, but here it is, nestling in this large Bill. If it were not for the hard work of the Historic Houses Association, most people would be unaware of it. It would be extremely foolish for the Committee to accept the clause without proper consideration.
<P>
Many properties will be affected by the proposal. Many properties provide significant funding for rural communities. The people who visit houses and subsequently spend their money in hotels and cafes and on taxis are crucial to our country's local economies.
<P>
Under current legislation, one estate election was available to those who, in 1963, elected to continue the old basis of schedule A taxation. The proposal affected only several hundred houses, many of which were farmhouses. It continued a practice whereby people could set the cost of maintenance against their schedule A rental income provided--and this is the crucial point--that they were taxed on a notional rent called the annual value, which was based on the rateable value. In other words, in 1963 one could elect to say, ``We wish to go on as we are. We have rental property on our estate and we wish to set that against the cost of the upkeep of our property.''
<P>
Those who so elected were people whose repair costs were higher than the notional value of their rent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman have a personal interest in the clause, given the enormous size of his estates, landholdings and so on?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> This is one of those great moments on a Finance Committee, when Labour Members think that they can pull off a cheap trick.
<P>
I am happy to tell you, Mr. Gale, that I have no personal interests to declare. The hon. Gentleman is of course trying to impugn, in the course of his intervention, that I might in some way benefit from the amendment. I happily confess that I am fortunate enough to live in a grade 2 star property, but neither I nor my family are beneficiaries of one estate election.
<P>
Had the hon. Gentleman listened to what I said, he would have heard me say that the election was in 1963. As is often the case with newer Labour Members, he failed to do his homework. If he had done so, he could have discovered that I did not buy my property in 1963. If he had done a little more homework--although we cannot expect that much; we know that Labour Members often fail to read relevant briefings--he would have discovered that my gardens and house will be made available to the local parish church so that it can raise money for local charitable causes to help children.
<P>
Having made such a lamentable intervention to impugn my reputation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will have the courtesy to come and pay a fee, which will be given to the local church, to visit my property. I look forward to hearing from the hon. Gentleman about whether he will join members of my constituency--
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> I will open my back garden to the local community, although it is not very large.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I note that the hon. Gentleman did not invite me to his back garden. [Laughter.] I should perhaps remind Labour Members that they should take the matter a little more seriously.
<P>
Those who in 1963 elected to continue the old basis of schedule A taxation were people for whom the repair costs were higher than the notional value. In 1963 the notional value was effectively frozen--it was uprated in the 1970s. The effect was that it could be fixed as low as a few hundred pounds, which in 1963 was a fair reflection of the amount for which a house could be rated and rented. Strictly speaking, the notional value was the figure that the owner could reasonably charge as rent.
<P>
Today, the notional value would be a much higher figure. The Historic Houses Association has no problem with the Government introducing a clause that would annually uprate the rental value, which the owners of those very important historic homes would be happy to pay.
<P>
However, as drafted, the clause will wreak havoc on our national heritage. The clause's scope is not exclusively confined to those fortunate enough to live in historic properties. In 1963, many farmers chose to take the one estate election as a way of managing their farms. The Country Landowners Association estimates that between 300 and 900 families elected to take that route. Many such people are owners with in-hand farms who occupy homes that qualify as farmhouses in relation to the land in-hand.
<P>
The clause will constitute a swipe at the future livelihood of those farmers. We must not underestimate their perilously difficult position, caused by the value of sterling and other problems in farming communities. In responding to the amendment the Government must indicate the way in which they have considered the farmers' plight.
<P>
Those farmers who run schedule D case 1 businesses on their estates, which grants public access to their houses or land, will be directly hit. That impact may mean that the costs of administration connected with the withdrawal of one estate election will be greater than the cost of maintaining the current legislation.
<P>
For some farmers, that will be a very heavy hit that will put them out of business completely. In some cases there will be owners who have granted tenancies over parts of their estates in consequence of the one estate election. They will be particularly heavily penalised.
<P>
Hon. Members would do well to consider the impact of a clause that apparently tidies up and sorts out anomalies. Treasury officials may have worked extremely hard to meet the Chancellor's request to look at Government spending. In doing so, they may have overlooked the clause's impact on the farming community and the tourist industry.
<P>
For those people who were granted pre-1995 agricultural tenancies agreements, one estate election provides an incentive to increase schedule A income to absorb allowable expenses. One estate election helped to preserve a relationship between landlord and tenant that was important to the farming community. Many farmers want to farm but cannot afford to buy their farms. As the Country Landowners Association has pointed out, the legislation has until now given farmers the chance to do that.
<P>
It is extremely important that the Government recognise a particular consequence of the clause. The abolition of one estate election will send a powerful signal to some farming estates against letting land in the future. I cannot believe that the Paymaster General wishes that to happen. It is crucial that the Government are confident that the consultation has made them fully abreast of the proposal's impact.
<P>
<H5>8.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The real impact of the clause is that it may lead to the closure of some of the most important historic houses in our country and their removal from public access. On 18 February this year, the Inland Revenue met the Historic Houses Association and the Country Landowners Association to receive their response to a consultative document. That document, which was called ``Schedule A and Companies Chargeable to Corporation Tax'', covered a range of schedule A proposals. It examined how schedule A rules would apply to companies. Many of the Bill's provisions reflect the responses to it. The document also covered those who decided on one estate election for historic homes. The effect of the clause will be devastating. No one should be in any doubt about its effect on those homes.
<P>
The Inland Revenue's defence at those meetings with the Historic Houses Association was that the original provision had been introduced as a transitional measure 35 years ago. The Revenue felt that the measure could not be expected to continue for ever. It was a way of tidying up what it regarded as something purely transitionary. The Historic Houses Association was told that the Revenue had been asked to review every concession and transitional relief. The officials made a good job of that. It was felt that the 1963 measure was badly targeted because it could apply to all houses, not just to those of architectural merit. However, it applied only to those houses that elected for one estate election in 1963. In other words, Mr. Gale, you could have owned a grade 1 property in 1963, which you elected for one estate election. At the same time, you could have owned a house of no architectural merit--for instance, a two-up, two-down farmhouse--that you could also have elected for one estate election. People in 1963 thought that that provision would continue for ever.
<P>
Officials decided that the measure was badly targeted and that it did not help houses of architectural merit. The amendment recognises the problem with the 1963 legislation. The crucial questions are: what will be the impact of the clause and why introduce the amendment? Many of the houses that will be affected are farmhouses, but at least 60 of the houses of the families who elected in 1963 for one estate election will, according to the Historic Houses Association, be directly affected. Of those 60 houses, 54 are open to the public and nearly all of them have received the highest accolade in architectural interest of a grade 1 listing.
<P>
The houses are part of a wide spectrum that includes Hutton-in-the-Forest, a 17th century house in Cumbria; Levens hall, a 13th century house in Cumbria; Hovingham hall, a splendid 18th century Palladian house in Yorkshire; and Elton hall, built in 1666 in Cambridgeshire. It also includes castles such as Rockingham castle in Northamptonshire, Eastnor castle in Herefordshire, Glynde place in Sussex, Bowood house in Wiltshire and Knebworth house, a crucial Tudor manor house, which is not only of great architectural interest, but is where many things have happened that are crucial to our heritage. It is where Dickens performed privately in theatrical events and where Churchill painted; it was the home of the suffragette, Constance Lytton, and, of particular interest to the Paymaster General, Knebworth house has gardens that were modernised and updated at the beginning of the century by Lutyens. It is a house of particular interest, open to the public and crucial for enhancing our interest in historic houses, but it will be affected by the legislation.

<P>

<B>Mr. Barry Gardiner </B>(Brent North): I am sensitive to the argument constructed by the hon. Member for Witney about the need to preserve for the nation the historic architecture--and access to it--of such buildings. However, does he not see some anomaly in arguing to retain a provision that is not based on the merits of the architecture but on the happenstance of whether an election was made within a particular year?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who makes an important point. We have tabled an amendment to ensure that houses that are open to the public and are of grade 1 interest are exempt from the provision, and we have done so precisely for the reasons targeted by the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Of the 60 member houses indentified by the Historic Houses Association as under threat by the removal of this concession, the majority are open to the public. Last year, nearly 3 million people passed through the doors of those houses. They did so because the houses are incredibly interesting, important and undoubtedly central to the identity of Britain's heritage. However, we should not pay attention only to the benefits of heritage; we should look also at some aspects of the economy that benefit from the tourist industry associated with such houses.
<P>
The Historic Houses Association estimates that about 11 million people visit its 300 homes every year, some 75 per cent. of whom are British tourists and 25 per cent. are from abroad. British people value and prize those homes, which present an opportunity to see something special that resonates in the soul of our nation. They visit them to see the art treasures inside. At Eastnor castle, for example, they will see some of the finest pictures by Van Dyck, Romney, Wooton and, of interest to some hon. Members who pay attention to matters of architecture, the drawing room in that house was designed by Pugin.
<P>
These are important moments in the development of our culture. They are moments to savour; they are as much a part of our future as of our past, but they are threatened by the implications and consequences of the legislation. 
<P>
	When I was given the figures by the Historic Houses Association this morning, I was shocked to find that, although those 11 million tourists spend money when they pass through the 300 houses every year, only 2.6 per cent. of the money is spent in the houses. The other 97 per cent. is spent in the local community by the tourists who have been drawn to the houses. They spend it in the cafes, restaurants, hotels, shops and on taxis and buses. They keep the local communities around those houses going. It is crucial to realise that the amendment would benefit not just a small group of elite people who have been lucky enough to inherit those houses--although perhaps unlucky enough to inherit the problems of their upkeep.
<P>
	I am sorry to hear hon. Members sighing, but in doing so, they reveal something that goes way beyond the problems of such houses: their failure to be interested in the problems that the local communities surrounding those historic houses face. Hon. Members who are lucky enough to have such houses in their constituencies will know how important to the rural community they are. They attract tea shops in the high street and second-hand bookshops. Small post offices do extra business because tourists come in to buy stamps. It is easy to underestimate the impact on local communities of the closure of such houses.
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis Moonie </B>(Kirkcaldy): What about amusement arcades?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> The hon. Gentleman asks from a sedentary position about amusement arcades, which we have debated. It is as important to understand the amusement of the future as it is to understand the importance of our heritage. Members of the Committee would do well in their moments of reflecting not only to consider the dome in Greenwich and Terry Farrell architecture but to recognise the importance to our education and history of the meaning of historic houses. We should consider, too, the 11 million people who visit them, 25 per cent. of whom come from abroad to admire what those houses stand for. It would be foolish for the Committee not to acknowledge their importance, so we must ensure that those houses keep their place in our history and heritage.
<P>
Such houses employ many people directly. The Historic Houses Association reckons that 7,000 people are so employed. As a consequence of the clause, all those people face the prospect of unemployment. There is a &#163;65 million wage bill just for those working in such houses. Will the Paymaster General consider whether his officials have fully weighed up the impact on unemployment of the closure of historic houses?
<P>
David Quarmby, the chairman of the British Tourist Authority, points out that it is the historic heritage sites that form one of the principal attractions for visitors to Britain. As he says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Nowhere else in the world will you find as many historic entities, comprising not only the house, but its contents, set in gardens and surrounded by parkland.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Three examples may be worth considering. First, there is Broughton castle, which is not far from my constituency in Oxfordshire, although it is not in it. It was the house in which the family opposed the efforts of Charles I to rule without Parliament. It is crucial to the story of the civil war in the 17th century. In the past 10 years, the owners of Broughton castle have carried out repairs costing just over &#163;1 million. They received a 40 per cent. grant from English Heritage, but the family had to find an additional &#163;600,000 to fund those repairs. One estate election has been crucial to the owners' survival and they have no appreciable assets on which to draw. It has been through the mechanism of one estate election that Broughton castle has remained open to the public.
<P>
A grade 1 house of crucial historic interest to our country, available for every man, woman and child--both domestic and foreign--to visit is open and accessible because of one estate election. The consequence of the clause for the family will probably be that the house will cease to be open to the public. Broughton opens for about six months of the year. During the rest of the year, it provides opportunities for visits from special groups and educational interests. It hosts many overseas visitors. It is one of the attractions that bring people to Oxford and Stratford. For many tourists, it epitomises the English country house and English architecture.
<P>
<H5>9 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Another house, Levens hall, in Cumbria, is an Elizabethan house built around a 13th century tower, with some of the most sensational gardens that any hon. Member who chose to admire our garden and landscape history could find. They include a sensational topiary garden. In 1994, it won the prestigious Historic Houses Association and Christie's award. Hon. Members who choose not to listen might do well to recognise that the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport visited the house last year and especially commended its importance to our history and heritage. It is an important house with an outstanding garden. It sits in the Lake district and attracts 50,000 visitors a year. Yet again, one estate election for that house has allowed the owner, who is totally committed to public service, has a sense of responsibility and wants to open his house to the public, to continue to maintain that very expensive house.
<P>
Yet another house, in Yorkshire--a Palladian house called Hovingham hall--is currently subject to a survey to examine how much must be spent on its annual upkeep. As hon. Members will know, legislation imposes on the owners of grade 1, grade 2 star and grade 2 listed houses a requirement that they maintain their property in good order. The owner's son, William Worsley, has been told that next year he must spend &#163;1.6 million to preserve the fabric of the building. The owners do not have that sort of money. It does not sit, as some Labour Members probably imagine, in a bank account, waiting to be spent. There is no pot to be raided, but only the hope that through one estate election and through offsetting rental income against maintenance costs, they will find a way to pay over several years. Even though three years remain before the clause is implemented, if it is introduced many families will suddenly face a bill of &#163;1.6 million. All members of the Committee must consider the impact of that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gardiner:</B> I do not hear the argument that I seek from the hon. Gentleman his argument is proceeding along the lines that some families cannot afford the upkeep of the houses in which they have chosen to live. It cannot be a good argument to say that taxpayers should subsidise families living in such properties. If an argument were presented that did not retain the arbitrary feature of 1963, the hon. Gentleman's arguments may have some coherence. However, given that the year and the election provision of 1963 are critical to the amendment, his argument must fall.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes an important point: we are discussing targeting and identifying an effective way to keep such houses open. Some people have suggested that if the owners of such houses cannot afford them, they should sell them. Many people, not only in the United Kingdom but throughout the world, have considerable means to buy such houses, but one of the sad developments of the past decade or two is that the houses have been sold because people could not afford their upkeep. Such houses had been open to the public and were on the route that is taken by 11 million tourists.
<P>
What happened to those houses after they were sold? They passed into the hands of the very wealthy who closed them and prevented the public from having access to them. Do the Government want to prevent access to such houses? [Interruption.] I give way to the hon. Member for Warrington, South (Ms Southworth). I thought that she wanted to intervene, but obviously she is unable to say anything useful. That is relevant to our understanding of how lamentable it is that many Labour Members do not realise the impact that such a measure would have on our tourist industry.
<P>
The matter is serious; it is crucial. We have the opportunity to show children buildings such as Broughton castle in which the civil war was engineered, but the Government seem to be saying, ``If the owner cannot afford it, he should sell it. If it is sold to a foreign national, that is fine. If it is closed and no one can visit it, we don't care.'' The hon. Member for Warrington, South--she is talking at present--may wish to note that that was not the view of the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. Last year, when he addressed the Historic Houses Association he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I recognise the essential role that the private owner plays in caring for the nation's built heritage and the significant benefit that the public derives from the privately owned and privately lived in historic houses.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Lady may wish to disagree with the Secretary of State, who went on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``With over half a million listed buildings in the UK, the Government''--<P>

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There is considerable post-prandial discussion at the back of the Room. If hon. Members wish to hold private conversations they may do so in the Corridor.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> The Secretary of State said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``With over half a million listed buildings in the UK, the Government could never hope to pay for the upkeep of them all.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that I am answering the intervention of the hon. Member for Brent, North (Mr. Gardiner). The Secretary of State continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Nor would we want to. The private owner remains the most effective and economic guardian of this sector.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Historic Houses Association represents 300 houses, 60 of which will be directly affected by the clauses; and 54 of those 60 houses are open to the public. The Secretary of State told the members of the association that it was the most effective and economic guardian of the sector. It is extraordinary that, within a few months, a clause in the Finance Bill will wipe out that sector.
<P>
What does that mean? The Government now have an opportunity to say that they recognise that a real problem exists. From my conversation last night with Labour Members, I know that some Ministers in the Department of Culture, Media and Sport had no idea that such a measure was being introduced. The left hand and the right hand have not spoken to each other. I am not making a criticism, because I want the Paymaster General to admit that the issue is really important. It could affect our future heritage.
<P>
In its meetings with the Inland Revenue, the Historic Houses Association was given the impression that only two options were being considered: an increase in notional values, or the scrapping of the concession altogether.
<P>
An alternative approach, involving better targeting, goes some way towards recognising the importance of the intervention made by the hon. Member for Brent, North. We could amend current provisions and specify that heritage property--for example, grade 1 houses--should remain open to the public. I want to ensure that the public continues to enjoy access to such houses and to the art treaures and the furniture that they contain, which are crucial to the fabric of our nation and to the way that it evolved. Is there a way of continuing one estate election for the owners of grade 1 houses?
<P>
Perhaps Ministers will reconsider the clause and say whether they feel that they should talk to the Historic Houses Association. I am well aware that the Financial Secretary received letters about various matters from that organisation. Its letters may not have always been properly focused--it might have been better if there had been a direct request about a single matter. Shortly before the Budget, that organisation wrote to the Financial Secretary and asked for a meeting on this matter but, unfortunately, officials did not grant it. I attach no blame to the Financial Secretary for that--such things happen. However, the clause, which will do historic damage to our culture, is completely contrary to the speech that the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport gave at last year's annual meeting of the HHA.
<P>
Some people will say, ``Surely those houses are eligible for grants.'' Grants are available only for major capital works, including one-off roof repairs. They are not available for routine, recurring expenditure, which the concession in the 1963 legislation assisted.
<P>
Elton hall, for example, covers 44,000 square feet. It would be a nightmare, by most people's standards, to keep up the house and ensure that it was kept open to the public. There has been a house on that site since the Norman conquest. It has one of our finest libraries, which contains 12,000 books including a unique one--the prayer book of Henry VIII, which is signed and annotated by him and by two of his wives. It is a unique book in a unique library in a unique house, and all of it is open to members of the public.
<P>
Next year, the house's owners face a repair bill of &#163;360,000 including &#163;240,000 for the roof. They are extremely grateful for the fact that they will receive a generous grant of &#163;120,000, but they still have to find another &#163;240,000 to keep the house open, not just for the public's benefit but to meet the statutory requirements that we placed on owners of those houses--they are required to upkeep grade 1, grade 2 star and grade 2 listed houses. They have to find that money, but if they do not have it in the bank, where will it come from?
<P>
<H5>9.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The removal of one estate election may mean that a family who has lived in a house for hundreds of years and who opened their home to the public for most months of the year may be forced to sell it, and it might pass into the hands of another family, who may be much wealthier and may have many gold bars in the bank, but who might not open the house to the public. Access would have gone and everything that the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport praised at last year's HHA meeting would go out of the window.
<P>
Another proposal is that other kinds of relief could be made available. For example, a proper commercial business could be established, but the only relief that would be available would involve a business deduction against the house-opening income. That would make house-opening activity uncommercial, thereby risking the loss of all reliefs. In most cases, such houses will never be commercial. People rely on the fact that the owners of a house are its custodians. A National Trust administrator earns somewhere between &#163;11,000 and &#163;15,000 a year, but owners of such houses do not get paid similar sums each year. They have the responsibility of running the house, which costs on average &#163;50,000 a year to open to the public, and such money is not easily found. If the owners open their house to the public, they make it accessible and they can benefit from the 1963 provision of one estate election. In case some Committee members think that lottery money might be available to help those families, I assure them that it is not available for private individuals.
<P>
The situation involves a curious irony. The Government strongly support public access; they talk about the future and they also wish to prize the past. However, the clause runs the risk of closing some of the most important historic properties, which contain furniture and art and which have gardens. It may remove the access that the public currently enjoy because that is a way of tidying up. If tidying up is required, the Government should target special help on those who have taken up that special duty. As the Secretary of State said, the Government should find a way of allowing those most effective and economic guardians to continue as such because there is no way that the Government could afford to run those houses.
<P>
The Government should think carefully about the clause's consequences. It affects but a few families, but there will be very considerable effects on millions of tourists.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> This is a mean and nasty clause, and my hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Woodward) made a powerful and moving case against it. I have three brief comments to add to his speech.
<P>
First, the explanatory notes suggest that the measure was transitional. The measure dates from 1963 so, as my hon. Friend said, it has lasted 35 years. No Government, Labour or Conservative, have so far sought to repeal it, not least because it has been successful in enabling an important amount of restoration to be undertaken.
<P>
The second point is that the clause flatly contradicts clause 140 and schedule 25, which extend access to our heritage. If clause 39 is not amended, we shall restrict access to our heritage because, as my hon. Friend said, many of those houses will pass out of private ownership into foreign ownership or be closed to the public, and millions of people will be denied access to them. The Government seem to have something against heritage and historic houses because they do not seem to fit in with the Government's idea of a young, cool Britain--cool Britannia! That is probably why they have cut the funding to English Heritage and the Heritage Lottery Fund. Pop stars can visit No. 10, but our historic houses will be further damaged. That will also damage the communities in which they are situated because jobs in the area will be hit.
<P>
I suggest that the Government either withdraw the clause for further consultation of the sort that the Financial Secretary was unable to offer, for understandable reasons, in the run-up to the Budget, or consider the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Witney. He has drafted it carefully and moderately and, as the hon. Member for Brent, North will discover, he has confined its eligibility to those homes that insist on public access. That is a moderate and reasonable improvement in the targeting of the relief, and I commend the amendment to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I should like to support what my hon. Friends said. This is a spiteful measure which will have a severe effect on a relatively small number of people.
<P>
I should like to range a little wide, Mr. Gale, as I suspect that you will be minded not to allow a stand part debate following our extensive debate.
<P>
The Paymaster General told the Committee at our previous sitting that wide consultation on the Bill had ensured that we have before us a better Bill. The Budget day press release--Inland Revenue 12--stated that arguments for the retention of one estate election had been put to the Treasury by those interested and went on to state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Government recognises the force of these comments.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Having acknowledged that the pre-Budget submissions made on behalf of the owners of the houses that would be affected had force, the Government have not had the courage to defend the retention of the one estate election. They have merely delayed by three years the implementation of the provisions.
<P>
The amendment relates specifically to grade 1 listed houses that are open to the public, and it is obvious why my hon. Friend the Member for Witney has chosen to focus the amendment in that way. Perhaps he thought that the Paymaster General would respond to the debate--he has a close knowledge of the value of historic houses by famous architects because he is fortunate enough to own one--[Hon. Members: ``Two.'']--or two. He has two such houses, so he, above others, should understand the value of such houses and the cost of maintaining them to the requirements of English Heritage.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Witney outlined very effectively the history of this matter.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> Has it occurred to my hon. Friend that the Paymaster General is in a different position in terms of his historic houses? He has resources that are not available to other historic house owners, not least his offshore trust? In one sense, he is already benefiting from a no estate election.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I shall not be tempted to go down that road, but I must confess that when my hon. Friend suggested earlier that all members of the Committee would have difficulty if faced with a &#163;1.6 million repair bill, it occurred to me that perhaps one member of the Committee might be able to contemplate such a cost with equanimity.
<P>
As my hon. Friend outlined, the rules changed in 1963 in a way that allowed people with one estate election to plan the future management of their estates to allow for the upkeep of a principal house. This is a matter of principle; those who were affected in 1963 believed that they had arrived at a deal with the Government--a deal that has held good for 30-something years. On the back of that understanding, long-term arrangements to let land producing Schedule A income, against which the maintenance costs of the principal property could be offset, will in some cases have been entered into. The Government have a responsibility to consider the bargain struck in 1963, and the possibility that individuals may find themselves trapped in arrangements made for perfectly legitimate reasons within the context of one estate election, but which might prove to be onerous and inappropriate in a changed situation.
<P>
I will not recite all the arguments that my hon. Friend the Member for Witney presented so eloquently to the Committee. But it seems important to focus on the issues of the availability of land for tenant farmers. I do not have an agricultural constituency and I do not pretend to have a great knowledge of the current state of agriculture. It is my understanding, however, that a decreasing amount of land is available to tenant farmers--there is an excess of demand over supply--and that anything tending to reduce the supply of tenanted farmland should be greatly deprecated.
<P>
The properties that would be most affected by the clause are the heritage properties to which my hon. Friend the Member for Witney referred, of which he gave a number of examples. As he has said, there are ready buyers for those properties in the market. Several substantial properties have been bought in my constituency over the past few years by one family who are not resident in the United Kingdom and who do not--by any stretch of the imagination--open their homes to the public; indeed, they have a tendency to build high barbed wire fences around them. I fear that if the clause passes unamended, increasing numbers of such important houses will fall into the hands of non-resident owners who use them occasionally and are not at all inclined to allow the British public access to them.
<P>
The parties that have made representations to the Government on this issue have primarily sought an assurance that the three-year delay proposed in the Bill is to allow the Government to consult with interested parties on a scheme to protect the interests of the heritage property owners to whom my hon. Friend referred. The amendment that he tabled seeks to address that issue. Opposition Members will probably retire satisfied tonight, however, if the Government can assure us that the purpose of the three-year delay is to consult constructively on a scheme to allow owners of historic grade 1 listed houses that are open to the public to continue to offset maintenance costs against the income from let property and land within the same estate.
<P>
I hope that the Financial Secretary can give us that assurance so that Treasury policy is in line with the policy of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and that we do not have the unfortunate impression that the Treasury is anti-culture, anti-history and anti-heritage. I look forward to the Financial Secretary's reassuring us that the Departments of Government are singing from the same song sheet.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member for Witney moved the amendment comprehensively and with great eloquence. I hope that the argument does not now become circular.
<P>
<H5>9.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Here we have it: the Government do not understand the countryside. Time after time we have made the same argument, but the clause is mean-minded and shows that the Government do not understand the impact of their actions in rural areas.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Witney has eloquently and tellingly moved the amendment and he has taken us on a great heritage and cultural tour of the greatest houses in the land. Tourists coming to this country--for example, the Americans--positively drool over what we have to offer. However, the Government are to restrict access to some of the finest houses in the country. Given that tourism will be the world's largest business by the end of the century, that is daft.
<P>
Clause 39 repeals sections 26 and 27 of the Taxes Act 1988, which allowed a once-only collection whereby schedule A expenditure on vacant properties can be claimed against income tax schedule A and corporation tax. My hon. Friend failed to mention one point that has not yet been considered by the Committee. Hitherto, that concession has been able to be passed on from one owner to the next, but that practice will now be stopped.
<P>
I have sat in Committee after Committee and I have heard hon. Members in opposition complaining about a range of schemes. Later we shall discuss clause 140, which allows heritage access in connnection with inheritance tax. Other countryside access schemes, such as set-aside access schemes and environmentally sensitive schemes, are designed to promote greater access to the countryside and to this country's great heritage. This clause, however, will restrict the access that those schemes seek to encourage.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Witney explained why the clause would restrict access. If we withdraw the allowances and concessions, the houses are likely to be bought by extremely wealthy people, many of whom are of a different colour--shall we say--from members of the Committee. Those people have plenty of oil money and would want to live in those houses. The first thing that they want is absolute privacy, and they would remove public access to those houses.
<P>
<B>Ms Helen Southworth </B>(Warrington, South): On a point of order, Mr. Gale.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am assuming that the hon. Gentleman was referring to political colour. I shall not allow racist remarks of any kind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I had no intention of making a racist remark of any sort whatever. It was simply--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I shall take the point of order.
<P>
<B>Ms Southworth:</B> I wish to make the point of order, Mr. Gale. You referred to the matter before I had made my point, but may I ask whether it is in order for racist remarks to be made in the House? All hon. Members should abhor such comments.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have already made the view of the Chair abundantly plain.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I have made it crystal clear that my remark was not intended as a racist comment. It was simply meant to imply that foreigners may not wish to allow as much public access as some of the traditional families in this country have hitherto done. That is the damage that the clause will create.
<P>
<B>Mr. Derek Twigg </B>(Halton): On a point of order, Mr. Gale. Let us clear the matter up. The hon. Gentleman said ``a different colour from members of the Committee''; he did not refer to different political parties.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am paying attention to what the hon. Gentleman is saying.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I have already unreservedly withdrawn the remark once. It is a custom of this House that a remark, once withdrawn, is taken to be withdrawn. Perhaps Labour Members cannot hear a withdrawal when it is first made.
<P>
The provision is likely to result in the withdrawal of public access from some of the finest houses in the country. It applies not only to the principal residence but also to all the environs, the estate cottages and the rest of the estate that goes with the house. The setting of those houses is what tourists, both from this country and abroad, find attractive. Many such houses have been in the same family for centuries. The measure that I am concerned about has been in existence for 35 years and I believe it to cost relatively little. Perhaps the Paymaster General will tell the Committee what amount of money is involved. The notes on clauses, press release and Red Book do not make that clear. It would also be helpful to know how many oneestate elections there are. Presumably in some circumstances the election is not transferred, and the number is reduced each year.
<P>
The Government recognise the force of the response to consultation, as the press release, Inland Revenue 12, makes clear. With what will the Paymaster General replace the relevant provision? The press release states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In the meantime the Inland Revenue will issue guidance material on the type of repairs expenditure which will continue to be available once ESC B4 is withdrawn.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
ESC B4 is the deduction for repairs and improvement to property that is not available to traders. It would be helpful to owners of the relevant properties to know what regulations the Government have in mind. Any suggestion that the Paymaster General could give would be welcome.
<P>
	We have had a long and spicy debate and I do not think that there is any need to prolong it. I hope that the Government will think carefully about how the affected houses can be maintained. While the amendment refers to grade 1 houses, the one estate election covers many much smaller--grade 2 and lesser--houses, that will equally be put at risk. Those are much less eligible for grant.
<P>
	Not only the greatest houses in the land, as mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Witney, but a much larger number of secondary but nevertheless important houses could be placed at risk through being withdrawn from public access and starting to fall into disrepair. I do not have the figures to hand, but I know that a substantial number of houses are in that category. Indeed, many grade 1 houses were demolished in the 1950s and 1960s, simply because the owners faced crippling tax demands. The marginal rate of tax under the Labour Government in the 1960s was 98 per cent. Owners of some houses simply could not afford to repair them. It was cheaper to demolish them.
<P>
	I do not say that that will necessarily result from clause 39, because planning restrictions would probably prevent it. However, several houses in this country have, even in the past decade, fallen into disrepair. The decay of our heritage as a result of withdrawing the relevant provisions would be very unfortunate.
<P>
	The clause is a mean-minded measure by an urban-dominated Government who do not fully understand what they are doing to the great heritage of our country, which has been preserved for centuries. The one estate election has withstood some of the most tax-raising Labour Governments, and if it were abolished new Labour would have to answer to people who wish to have access to the houses in question.

<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I have learnt through bitter experience that for every Bill that comes before the House and its Standing Committees, some sops must be offered to the old Labour left. A few ways must be found to assuage the still vibrant gut instincts of the party that is now in Government. Although the cult of Mandleson towers may have lobotomised most Labour Members, they still get a twinge of satisfaction when, through a clause in the Finance Bill, they can hit the nobs.
<P>
In education we have had attacks on selection, which resulted in increased class sizes. The previous Finance Bill attacked health insurance, which resulted in increased waiting lists. Similarly, by attacking the few the clause before us will have an effect diametrically opposite to that which the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport is trying to achieve.
<P>
Labour Members frequently play the game of asking us what interests we have to declare. I do not have a direct interest in the clause, because my family is in the fortunate position of owning a home that pays its way through the number of visitors it attracts annually. [Laughter.] Apparently, that is a cause of ribaldry among Labour Members, although we are told always to lay our interests on the table.
<P>
A family home such as mine can create a sense of community that is by and large classless. [Laughter.] Labour Members laugh, as I knew they would. If one opens one's home to the world one invites everyone--every creed, race and colour--into one's drawing room. There is nothing more communautaire or more classless. Those who choose to do so are acting in the best, classless traditions of this country.
<P>
Given that one of my grandfathers was a miner, and the other was the son of a policeman, I have never subscribed to the view that an ingrained class system exists in this country. Nevertheless, through their majesty and splendour such buildings put us all in awe of our heritage.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I fully appreciate the fact that provocative remarks invite a response. However, the hon. Gentleman has a right to be heard.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I hope that the pleasant reaction of Labour Members indicates that they are gaining sympathy for the arguments advanced by the Opposition. We ask for sympathy not for those who live day in and night out in such houses, but for those who work in them and wish them, and for all those who treasure the heritage that such homes represent.
<P>
We must not ignore the jobs that such houses create.--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There are many hon. Members present who have not made speeches. It is inappropriate for them to contribute from a sedentary position--especially those who have been here long enough to know better.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Gale.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Witney made clear, people throughout the country are interested in the outcome of this debate, and they feel strongly about the case that we are making. It ill behoves Labour Members to ridicule the matter, because in doing so they display the gut instincts that I mentioned earlier. Their behaviour is a betrayal of the established principle that the House should debate matters rationally and reasonably, and listen to the case of the minority. Such cases are sometimes ignored by the monolith of big government. However, we do so at our own cost.
<P>
<H5>9.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is not only jobs and the sense of community that are at risk. Many generations have lived in the heart of the country with a sense of permanence and security. The Government's attacks on the countryside have stirred an anger throughout the nation that has manifested itself twice in a year in the parks of central London. Such attacks are of a piece with the Government's whole approach.
<P>
Some of my colleagues have rightly noted the contradictory aims of clause 39 and clause 140. However, both clauses propose to tear up long-established agreements between individuals and the state. If the Government tear up such agreements to satisfy their own whims and prejudices, we will all have to pay the price.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gardiner:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I have finished.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gardiner:</B> Has the hon. Gentleman given way to me?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member for Guildford has taken his seat. The hon. Gentleman is at liberty to make a speech.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gardiner:</B> In that case I shall respond.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman described clause 140 as contradictory. He suggested that it enabled the Government to tear up long-standing agreements at their own whim, and against the country's best interests--interests that he sought to advance by supporting the amendment. However, the extent to which clause 140 will expand public access to properties of historic interest is entirely consistent with the hon. Gentleman's position.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> In common with others, I complement the hon. Member for Witney on moving the amendment so ably. I doubt whether he anticipated the hilarity that the contribution of the hon. Member for Guildford provoked. However, I can assure the hon. Member for Witney that it will not influence the seriousness with which I shall approach the debate.
<P>
The relief, which was first introduced in 1963, was always intended to be transitional, just as Pitt's introduction of income tax was a strictly temporary measure intended to help fight the Napoleonic wars. Combined with the three-year transitional period envisaged in the legislation, the measure will have been in force for 38 years.
<P>
The amendment would provide relief for grade 1 houses and for houses with a one estate election that open to the public. Depending on how much research he has done, the hon. Gentleman may be able to help us with the figures. If the amendment were accepted, how many of the 700 houses that benefit from one estate election would be excluded? Would we still exclude the categories that we most want excluded, or which the hon. Gentleman wants excluded?
<P>
The hon. Gentleman said a lot about hill farmers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I will give way in a moment.
<P>
I am sure that the hon. Gentleman does not intend to perpetuate, refine and target an anomaly that discriminates against others. He made much of the farmer issue. We are prepared to receive representations on that, especially in the context of his amendment. It would be helpful if he could enlighten us on the subject.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> As income tax, which was meant to be transitional relief, is still with us, I hope that either the one estate election will continue, or the Government will announce in next year's Budget the end of income tax, and the transitional relief with it.
<P>
We do not know the answer to the Paymaster General's question because the work has not been done. Is it not something when the Government want to introduce legislation but have no idea who will be affected by it or how wide-ranging the implications will be? Would it not be appropriate for the Paymaster General to accept the arguments and agree that there is a case between now and Report stage to solicit representations from the Historic Houses Association? Would it not also be appropriate for his officials to give him the figures? With all due respect to the Paymaster General, it is dangerous for us to proceed down a road when neither he nor his officials are able to furnish the Committee with information about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I will say a few words that may go some way to meeting the hon. Gentleman's concerns. I have consulted my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary, but I am not sure that we can entirely satisfy the hon. Gentleman. I cannot say that we will return to the matter on Report. The numbers are difficult to obtain, but we will make a more determined and in-depth effort to get them. We have a form of relief that is not well targeted. There is general agreement in the Committee on that. It was introduced as transitional relief, and we have granted a further three years to allow those who have to accommodate the new arrangements to do so.
<P>
Although I intend to do justice to the hon. Gentleman's argument by avoiding the side issues, I cannot understand why we would wish to benefit all grade 1 houses. What would be the reason for that? We know that not all grade 1 houses benefit from one estate election. Why would we create that privileged category for just grade 1 houses? Houses often move into grade 2 and can become, like the hon. Gentleman's house, grade 2 star. The periodic reclassification of houses may then allow them to become grade 1. We should remember that architectural taste or judgment changes from year to year.
<P>
There is no coherent principled logic in the hon. Gentleman's choosing to concentrate on grade 1 houses. Many of those are not open to the public although his grade 2 star house will be. I am not saying that the hon. Gentleman's argument is unprincipled, but there is no logic to it. The problems of historic houses are well known to anyone who reads the newspapers. There is a problem, but arrangements in lieu of tax can be made, and the Budget greatly helped museums. There are solutions to the problems of huge houses whose maintenance outruns the means of their traditional owners. Grants are available. The hon. Gentleman was not right to discount the lottery's involvement, because we should discuss such solutions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> With respect, the Paymaster General has shown that he does not understand the effect of the measure. We want to preserve grade 1 listed houses in this country in good repair because they have particular architectural or cultural features of national importance. They deserve and need every bit of help that they can get.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> With great respect, I do understand that. Why should grade 1 listed properties be so provided for, but not grade 2 star properties, which may be categorised as grade 1 listed next year? It does not make much sense, and many grade 1 listed houses are not open to the public anyway. Why should they be given preferential treatment? There is no principled justification for such a distinction.
<P>
I am anxious that the Committee should make as much progress as possible, and I am restraining myself from indulging in following in the footsteps of the hon. Member for Witney on his grand tour of our fine houses. There is a lot more that I could say about such houses.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Will the Paymaster General give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> No, I will not. The hon. Gentleman has already wasted the time of the Committee with his previous intervention. He has nothing to say on the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Will the Paymaster General answer my point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I am addressing you, Mr. Gale.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> About the cost.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I will review the correspondence to which the hon. Member for Witney referred; I have spoken to the Financial Secretary and we will look at it together. If a Meeting is necessary, we would be open to a discussion of the matters raised. Any such discussions would have to cover a wider range of possibilities than the amendment, which raises a limited issue. Many representations were made on that issue during the consultation period, including those from the Historic Houses Association, and they were taken into account. It is correct, however, that no meeting with Ministers has taken place. My hon. Friend the Financial Secretary and I shall report back to the hon. Member for Witney if we feel that such a Meeting is necessary, and I trust that that gesture, without commitment, will be sufficient to enable him to withdraw the amendment. If not, I am afraid that we must resist it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am grateful to the Paymaster General.
<P>
The issue of why grade 1 listed properties, but not grade 2 star properties, should be made a special case--and the consequent conclusion that that would not be fair, so we should kick the whole table over--seems to me to be a rather unfortunate basis on which to proceed.
<P>
The Paymaster General has generously shown that he recognises that historic houses may pose a problem that needs to be revisited. Proper consultation, perhaps not only with the Historic Houses Association but with the other relevant bodies, would bear fruit and--if I may impertinently suggest this--the co-operation of the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport might also be desirable. By legislating in haste for what we know is an imperfect situation, we run the risk of making that situation worse rather than better. Those who would suffer most as a result would not be the few hundred owners of historic houses but the many hundreds of thousands, indeed millions, of tourists, who might suddenly find that the houses and their art and furniture collections were no longer open to them.
<P>
I respect what the Paymaster General has said. I take it in good faith that he will bring together the relevant parties, and on that basis I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
The Chairman, being of the opinion that the principle of the clause and any matters arising thereon had been adequately discussed in the course of debate on the amendment proposed thereto, forthwith put the question, pursuant to Standing Order No. 67, That the clause stand part of the Bill:--

<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I want to draw the Committee's attention to subsection (5), which deals with commencement provisions. There appears to be some confusion in the explanatory memorandum, which I am sure that the Financial Secretary will clear up. The notes on the subsection refer to the cross-over date with corporation tax as being 1 April 1988, which cannot be right. It is not the same as paragraph 64 of the hapless schedule 5. It is clearly either 1998 or 1988. I suggest that the explanatory memorandum on the subsection is wrong.
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury </B>(Dawn Primarolo): The hon. Gentleman is right. It is a typing mistake and it should read 1998. I hesitated because it does not say that on my briefing notes. Again, it is a typographical error and it will be corrected in the reprint.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 129, in page 24, line 39, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`which gives a true and fair view'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`drawn up according to generally accepted accounting principles,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment deals with the phrase ``true and fair'' which has crept into the Bill. Clause 42(1) states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the profits of a trade, profession or vocation must be computed on an accounting basis which gives a true and fair view''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The phrase is familiar to accounting and has to be complied with when a company prepares its accounts. Outside the House, there is concern that the phrase is too wide for use in the clause because it will apply to all traders preparing accounts for schedule D case I purposes. The tax faculty of the Law Society continues to have reservations about the use of that expression. The Institute of Directors is also concerned about the phrase, stating that it is far too wide.
<P>
The institute seeks clarification of such words as ``materiality'' and ``prudence''; it has asked for a ministerial statement that accounts prepared with due regard to prudence and materiality will be accepted by the Revenue. Will the Financial Secretary also confirm that accounts which show a true and fair view, according to the clause, will meet the requirement to submit a correct and complete tax return contained in section 8(2) of the Taxes Management Act 1970?
<P>
However, the institute's key concern is about the wide import of the phrase ``true and fair view''. The press release that accompanied the Budget stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We believe that the use of the accountancy concept of `a true and fair view' does the job in a concise yet flexible way''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is, of determining the earnings basis that traders should use. The press release continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``accounting standards as they currently operate are applied and so the tax treatment can adapt automatically to changes in those standards.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The implication of that statement is that, for the first time, the whole plethora of statements of standard accounting practice will have to apply to the preparation of accounts for tax purposes. I accept the provision in subsection (2) that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``This does not require a person to comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 . . . except as to the basis of computation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No one is saying that the clause requires all the disclosure provisions set out by the Companies Act. However, in preparing accounts for computation purposes, the clause requires the adoption of standard statements of accounting practice. That could have serious implications, because it is not the position at present, even though the notes on clauses suggest that that is the Revenue's view.
<P>
Paragraph 15 of the notes on clause 42 includes the phrase ``true and fair view''. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It is also the basis on which the courts have said income tax traders must return their taxable profits. Save in exceptional circumstances it requires the adoption of published Accounting Standards, so far as they are relevant and material to the computation of profits.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, that is not the case, because the Revenue's interpretation of the well-known case of Threlfall v. Jones--or Gallagher v. Jones, as it is also known--seems to be that the standard statements of accounting practice do not apply to cases that do not involve corporations. Nigel Eastaway, the chairman of the technical committee of one of the professional bodies, has written an interesting article in Accountancy Age, in which he states that that view is wrong. At this point, I must declare an interest, as I write a learned column in that magazine every six weeks, which I mentioned during the proceedings of the previous Finance Bill. Members of the Committee will be pleased to know that the column still exists, and is avidly requested by readers of the magazine.
<P>
The statements of standard accounting practice have not been incorporated into common law by Threlfall v. Jones. The case referred to particular statements, SSAP 2 and SSAP 21, but it did not imply that all standard statements should be applied to non-corporations.
<P>
Nigel Eastaway quoted from Sir Thomas Bingham in Threlfall v. Jones when he stated that Duple Motor Bodies v. Ostim was about which one of two acceptable accounting principles should be preferred to the other. The view is that the clause brings into United Kingdom law, for the first time, the fact that standard statements of accounting practice will have to apply not only to barristers and other professionals, but to all traders.
<P>
The Law Society is worried that the clause is very wide. When the Bill was published, it was not understood that these measures, which are described in an erroneous statement of practice in the press release issued by the Revenue on 22 December, will introduce a different basis for the preparation of accounts, which will affect many traders. There are serious implications for companies. SSAP 9, which relates to the calculation and valuation of stock and work in progress, will apply to the preparation of accounts.
<P>
At present sole traders and businesses are under no obligation to use SSAP 9 when preparing their accounts and valuing their stock and work in progress. One of the requirements of SSAP 9 is that one should include overheads in the calculation of work in progress. A normal small business--there are many in my constituency--will simply calculate its stock on the basis of what it costs to buy the components making up whatever it is selling. It adds up the value of the components that comprise the work in progress. It will not necessarily include overheads such as heating, lighting and administration in the valuation of that stock. If SSAP 9 is applied, such overheads should be included in the valuation of work in progress. If SSAP 9 is applied to stock and work in progress, the value of it will be consequently higher. That means that the first time that SSAP 9 is applied to a trading business, there will be a higher profit in the first year than in any other year.
<P>
It is important that Treasury Ministers understand what the Inland Revenue seeks to do. It is also important that the Inland Revenue understands that, because the view outside the House is that current law is misunderstood. Companies governed outside the Companies Act are not required to comply with the different SSAPs and standards that emerge from the Accounting Standards Board when they prepare their accounts for taxation purposes.

<P>

<B>Mr. Andrew Love </B>(Edmonton): I understand from the explanatory notes that ``true and fair view'' is the normal basis on which accountants calculate profits. Will the hon. Gentleman deal with the issue of consistency as between the normal way that profits are dealt with for taxation purposes and the way sole traders operate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> ``True and fair view'' has a specific meaning. It does not mean that one should do one's accounts on the best basis possible to reflect reality. It is a specific term of art that requires corporations subject to the Companies Act to prepare their accounts on a ``true and fair view''. Once that requirement is applied to all businesses, an audit will be required. Fortunately, subsection (2)(b) removes that requirement, but a plethora of other requirements arise from the phrase ``true and fair view''. One is that the many SSAPs and accounting standards will apply for the first time to unincorporated businesses. That is the concern expressed outside the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Love:</B> I understand that concern. However, will the hon. Gentleman deal with the inconsistency between a trade or profession that benefits from being dealt with on a cash basis and the ordinary way that businesses are dealt with on the ``true and fair view''? Would it not be consistent to deal with both groups in exactly the same way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> It is important not to get confused between moving from a cash basis to an accruals basis and between moving from generally accepted accounting principles to the phrase ``true and fair view''. The phrase ``true and fair view'' has a specific meaning, but ``generally accepted accounting principles'' has a broader meaning. It means, ``Prepare your accounts on the basis that most accountants would accept and in a way that reflects the reality of the business.''
<P>
The phrase ``true and fair view'' has a different meaning. It is not a matter of consistency. We do not want to have consistency as between the way companies prepare their accounts and the way small traders prepare their accounts.
<P>
We want both sets of accounts to reflect the truth, but small businesses do not need to have the detailed methodolgoy for preparing accounts that companies are required to have under the Companies Act. Companies are under those requirements because they have limited liability. That brings advantages and responsibilities, such as the preparation of accounts according to the true and fair view.
<P>
<H5>10.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Until this Bill, small businesses have not been subject to the burdens that apply to companies. The clause should not inadvertently impose such burdens. The professions and others outside the House understand that the phrase ``true and fair view'' brings a requirement for an audit--happily, that requirement is taken out by subsection (2)(b). They believe that the phrase brings a requirement for a plethora of accounting standards and burdens that would be difficult for most small businesses to comply with and which would result in higher profits during the transition to the new method.
<P>
It would therefore be helpful if the Minister would accept the amendment so that there is no ambiguity. Outside bodies would then know that there is no requirement to apply all the standard statements of accounting practice to their own accounts.
<P>
Will the Minister confirm that in the case of Pepper v. Hart the phrase ``true and fair view'' does not mean that SSAPs should apply to non-incorporated businesses? Will he confirm that the phrase ``true and fair view'' in the clause has the same meaning as is conveyed by the wording of our amendment? That wording is slightly different from the Institute of Chartered Accountants' briefing document. It says that it would prefer the phrase ``generally accepted rules of commercial accountancy''.
<P>
Will the Minister adopt the ICA's phrase or our phrase in our debate? That would be helpful in reducing the scope that the phrase ``true and fair meaning'' has in the Bill.
<P>
Will the Minister confirm what the clause means when it states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Subject to any adjustment required or authorised by law in computing profits for those purposes''?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does the ``law'' refer to the codification of current law? If so, is that current law based on the Threlfall v. Jones case or is it based on the earlier case law on the cash basis?
<P>
I look forward to the Minister giving assertions that the Institute of Directors requires on ``prudence'' and ``materiality''. Does the measure incorporate and codify current law? If so, on which cases does it base the law?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon. Friend has given a good introduction to the amendment, so I will not make many additional observations. However, I wish to stress the important and valid distinction between accountancy profits and profit for tax purpose. The hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love) perhaps does not appreciate that distinction.
<P>
As my hon. Friend mentioned, the phrase ``true and fair'' originates in the accounting of company transactions. Indeed, the phrase is of some antiquity in the history of British accountancy. The accountancy profession is one of our national strengths and grew out of a belief that business owners and shareholders should be told what is going on. Accountancy in other countries, especially on the continent, grew out of a culture with a stronger basis in the law. In some cases, overseas accountancy was built on tax authorities' need to know what was going on.
<P>
It is not automatically valid or appropriate to apply accountancy principles to taxation. For example, the treatment of assets that are depreciated in company accounts is not taken by the Inland Revenue as a definition of taxable profit. When a tax computation is made, the depreciation charge is taken out and replaced by a capital allowance, which may allow a 100 per cent. write-off of the expenditure on the capital asset. Some would say that that is an incentive for investment. Indeed, it has featured in recent Budgets, including the one that we are considering. For that obvious reason, the profit reported to the shareholders is not the same as the profit on which the tax charge will be assessed. It is unwise to apply the same principles indiscriminately.
<P>
Several standard accounting principles govern matters such as work in progress or the treatment of good will or capital assets. The implication of the provision is that if those were to change--accounting theory does evolve--the tax treatment of the company should automatically change as well. I expect that all hon. Members would agree that that would be unwise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that the amendment is erroneous? The clause's effect would be to require professional businesses to include debtors, creditors and work in progress in the relevant information. That accords with accepted accounting practices, which is what the amendment is intended to achieve. There is no further requirement for disclosure or further pressure on unincorporated businesses with respect to preparing accounts in any particular form. The amendment's requirements are already implicit in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> There is a flaw in what the hon. Gentleman suggests. He suggested that the tax charge should be based on work in progress, drawn up according to principles. That might entail an assessment of overheads to be included in work in progress. That is not the case at present. A professional person would be required to estimate, with respect to work in progress, all the overheads of his business--which would increase his work in progress and hence his tax charge.
<P>
I understand that the Inland Revenue has assured the professions that that is not the intention of the clause--though that fact is not clear from the text of the Bill. The principle that I am establishing is that it is unwise, and, indeed, an error, to transfer all accounting principles automatically into tax law so that change will take place as accounting principles change. I hope that the Paymaster General will deal with that point.
<P>
The clause refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``profits of a trade, profession or vocation'':<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Under that tax law are those profits to be assessed? Would corporation tax be included, as well as case 1 profits? Answers to those two questions would enable us to make considerable progress with the amendment.
