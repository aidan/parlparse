<B>Dr. Vincent Cable </B>(Twickenham): I beg to move amendment No. 48, in page 2, line 38, at end insert--

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(c) promoting education to develop the skills people need to interpret and use information about financial products and the financial system; and

<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(d) promoting awareness of the Authority, the compensation scheme and the ombudsman scheme.'.

<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 49, in page 2, line 38, at end insert--

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(2A) In pursuing its public awareness objective, the Authority shall submit annually to the Secretary of State for Education and Employment a report on its progress.'.

<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> The amendments relate to the requirement on the Financial Services Authority to promote public awareness, and would specify more precisely the FSA's educational role and how that should be monitored.

<P>
It may be objected that the amendments are worthy but unnecessary. I shall therefore spell out why they are necessary in relation to the functions of financial services markets. It is generally understood by consumer groups and others that major gaps in information and knowledge prevent retail markets for financial services products from working well. The Office of Fair Trading recently produced a report entitled "Consumer Detriment", which characterised the market selling financial products in terms of imperfect information.

<P>
The financial markets do not work well, as information is deficient in a number of ways. Much product information is complex. Transactions are often undertaken once in a lifetime; they are not like a weekly shopping expedition to the supermarket, and require particular knowledge--which is often lacking--at a particular stage in life.

<P>
Perhaps most importantly, the commission-driven nature of the retail business frequently creates misleading and distorting information. I am sure that many of us have experience of buying a personal pension policy. I bought such a policy about 10 years ago and was confronted by a salesman who told me that the first two years of contributions would be used to make up his fee. When I queried that, he told me, "Well, this happens whatever policy is bought. Our competitors hide the commissions; nevertheless, they are present." Millions of people have bought complex products in that opaque market.
<P>
That is why more is needed to meet the FSA's public-awareness objective than merely stating that it is a general aim and loading more information onto customers. A key problem in the market is that information is complex and so, in itself, is not helpful. The amendments would make that process more specific and would guide the FSA, ensuring that successive generations of FSA officials understood the concrete implications of the objective.
<P>
Amendment No. 48 would require the FSA to be concerned with developing consumers' skills, not merely pushing information at them. Those of us who follow the FSA's activities know that is already consulting quite extensively with the Department for Education and Employment, the university for industry and various consumer bodies. That is all very worthwhile and much appreciated.
<P>
Amendment No. 48 would explicitly oblige the FSA to help develop skills and would ensure that that obligation was embedded for future generations. We have built into the amendment a specific requirement that the FSA should make people aware of its complaints procedures and the ombudsman. Last week, we had an extended debate on the difficulties and limitations of the complaints procedure. The FSA should, at the very least, make its consumers aware of the existence of that procedure. There are deficiencies in the structure. It is a captured organisation to some extent.
<P>
Amendment No. 49 spells out the educational requirements more specifically. As I have said, the FSA is already making a considerable effort to raise schoolchildren's awareness of financial products and the difficulties that they may have later when they transact financial services. Survey data suggests that a large number of people leaving school acknowledge both the importance of the subject and the great deficiency in the education that is currently provided. We suggest a small amendment which requires the FSA not merely to report its education activities in its annual report, but to submit that report to the DFEE. That provides a cross check with the work of the curriculum council.
<P>
We share a common belief here. There is no enormous controversy about the importance of public awareness. We all acknowledge that the FSA is performing a useful role at present in building up its public awareness activities. The amendments aim to make those obligations more specific and to ensure that when the FSA comes under different management in future there is no backsliding in its commitment to those ends.
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ms Patricia Hewitt):</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) for tabling the amendments and explaining his concerns. All members of the Committee, and certainly the Government, are committed to promoting greater public awareness and the education of consumers. The public awareness objective is perhaps one of the most radical innovations among the Bill's objectives. In drafting the clause we have made the objective quite general so as not to tie the FSA down to any particular course of action.
<P>
When we consulted on the draft Bill last summer, a large proportion of respondents commented, both on the regulatory objectives as a whole and on this one in particular. Some who came to the issue from the consumer perspective were worried that it did not go far enough. They could envisage all kinds of useful ways in which the FSA might be able to improve public awareness. Those who were concerned about the implications of the objective for the industry thought that it might require the FSA to do more than was appropriate for a regulator. They were also concerned--in my view, reasonably--about whether a body founded by fees levied on the regulated community should add to those costs in pursuing this general objective.
<P>
I mention that because it underlines the fact that a balance has to be struck. I do not believe that the consumer bodies were seeking to suggest that the FSA's main focus should be on education rather than regulation. Nor did the industry argue that the FSA was not well placed to give helpful advice and information to members of the public. Indeed, some well known institutions have educational initiatives themselves.
<P>
What we have tried to do in Clause 4--I think we have achieved it--is to strike that balance between the enormous number of things that the FSA could do and the reasonable concerns of the industry. We have given the FSA considerable flexibility about how to meet its objectives. It might, for instance, want to issue publications or publish advertisements on its own initiative. It might want to work with other bodies, such as the Office of Fair Trading and consumer bodies, to produce information that consumers would find helpful. It might want to work with citizens advice bureaux and it certainly might want to prepare information that could be used as teaching resources in schools, or to direct people to other useful sources of information and guidance. What will be appropriate will depend on the circumstances.
<P>
The FSA does not have a free hand and it will be constrained in meeting its objectives by the principles in clause 2. That is right, because the regulated community should not be viewed as a bottomless pit for funding general awareness and educational activities. There is a clear consensus, however, that the FSA has a valuable role to play and that a better educated public will have wider benefits for the effectiveness and the effective working of competition. 
<P>
In our debate on competition and competitiveness, the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton) said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The most effective form of regulation and the most effective way of bringing about competition is by the education of the consumer. There must be an educating function so that the consumer--for whom we are here, after all--can make appropriate and informed choices".--[Official Report, Standing Committee A, 8 July 1999; c.48.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I agree entirely and that objective is spelt out in clause 4.
<P>
The objectives are expressed in general terms because they relate to a wide spectrum of activities and people. The danger with the amendments is that trying to make the objectives more specific runs the risk that they will apply only in limited circumstances. Other elements would then have to be added to deal with other circumstances. Instead of having a broad objective that could be interpreted by the FSA--and, if necessary, by the courts--we would end up requiring a much longer Bill and a much longer clause in which everything that the FSA could do is spelt out. We would all agree that the Bill is long enough, without going down that road.
<P>
Amendment No. 48 relates to what the FSA might do. Clause 4(2) defines the FSA's public awareness objective as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"promoting public understanding of the financial system"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and amplifies that definition by making it clear that that general objective includes
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"promoting awareness of the benefits and risks associated with different kinds of investment or other financial dealing"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the provision of appropriate information and advice".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The fact that certain elements are not listed does not mean that they are not covered: clause 4(2) is simply illustrative. We believe that the clause as a whole, with its illustrative paragraphs, certainly cover, in the words of the hon. Member for Twickenham's amendment,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"promoting education to develop the skills people need to interpret and use information about financial products and the financial system"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am not persuaded of the value of repeating something that is already inherent in the clause.
<P>
It is worth noting that the FSA has also agreed about the benefits of using the education system to promote awareness. Some hon. Members may be aware that the FSA is already working with the Department for Education and Employment--for example, in considering the effectiveness of the national curriculum in England and how financial education might be incorporated in it. Ideas being considered include financial examples--learning about interest rates when teaching mathematics and including financial services in proposals for personal, social and health education. The FSA would not, of course, be involved with teaching those subjects, but it would be able to help with the development of teaching resources and the curriculum. The FSA is already applying the objective in precisely the flexible way that we want.
<P>
The proposed new paragraph (d) would bring promotion of the FSA and the compensation and ombudsman schemes more clearly within the scope of the awareness objective. Again, those are already covered by the generality of the clause. It is worth referring briefly to clause 127, which gives the FSA a clear function of giving advice and information about several matters, including its functions under the Bill and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"any other matters about which it appears to the Authority to be desirable to give information or advice."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those matters undoubtedly include both the compensation and the ombudsman schemes. Amendment No. 48 is not necessary because the Bill already provides what it seeks, in clauses 4 and 157. 
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 49 requires the FSA to report on its performance to the Secretary of State for Education and Employment. Hon. Members may recall from recent debates that schedule 1(10) (1) requires the FSA to include in its annual report a report on how the authority considers that its statutory duties, including all the objectives, have been met. That will be laid before Parliament and available to all Government departments. It would not be appropiate to require the FSA to produce separate reports for my right hon. Friend the secretary of State for Education and Employment, as that would be an unnecessary addition to its work load. As I said, the FSA is already in discussion with the Department for Education and Employment, and with the Departments of Trade and Industry and of Social Security, so that they can work together on public awareness matters. the FSA's annual report will include the objective; it will be a published document, available to anyone who is interested in it and should a Select Committee, including the Select Committee on Education and Employment, want to pursue the issue of clause 4 and its application within education, it will be able to do so.
<P>
Amendment No 49 is unnecessary and I hope that in the light of my remarks the hon. Gentleman will ask leave to withdraw it. If he does not do so, I shall ask my hon. Friends to vote against it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Andrew Tyrie </B>(Chichester): I have only one brief question, as I agree with almost everything that the Economic Secretary said. It might be possible for the FSA eventually to decide to put enormous resources into achieving the objective. The primary source of information about a product is usually the person using it; people want to market their product and get it known. In this case, the product is complicated and, understandably, the FSA and the Government feel that a special effort should be made to inform the public about it. I am anxious that the FSA might end up spending industry money beyond what most people would consider reasonable. What kind of mechanism is there to establish a balance or to curb excessive expenditure?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> That is an important question. Such concerns were raised by some members of the industry in response to the objective. I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the principle set out in clause 2(3)(a) which states that in discharging its general functions the authority must have regard to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the need to use its resources in the most efficient and economic way".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That principle and the broader mechanisms for accountability--the need to consult the practitioners' panel, the publication of the annual report, and the role of the non-executive directors in ensuring that money is spent properly--will prevent the authority running off in the direction that the hon. Gentleman suggests and spending too much money on the objective. The mechanisms for accountability will ensure that the FSA does not waste the money contributed to it by the regulated industry.
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> One of the Economic Secretary's central concerns is that we should not do anything that adds to regulatory costs and I am sensitive to that anxiety. We do not want to create a cumbersome, expensive process that adds unnecessarily to the costs of business. That is a legitimate concern.
<P>
However, there is a more general solution to that problem. The pensions mis-selling scandal means that compensation of £10 billion will eventually have to be paid, mainly by financial advisers, many of whom are now being driven out of business. There is a simple answer to the problem: prevention is better than cure and also cheaper. We suggest a relatively small commitment that could save billions of pounds if it prevented bad decisions from being made in the marketplace. The argument about customer risk must be placed in that context.
<P>
The Economic Secretary is anxious that we do not make the obligations on the FSA more specific than they should be. She made the case for a broad-brush approach, and I have some sympathy with that. Our proposal would not make the FSA's obligations more specific in the sense that it would make them narrower.  We want them to be specific in the sense that they are clear. There is a danger that the FSA will see its obligations in terms of information flows rather than in terms of developing people's skills. The first part of amendment No. 48 is designed to capture that point even though I note what was said about the ombudsman and accept the assurance that the complaints procedure will be publicised.
<P>
The Economic Secretary also said that it was unnecessary to require the FSA to submit an additional report to the Department for Education and Employment. We are not proposing a bureaucratic process or suggesting that a new report should be written. We merely suggest that the point of reference should be the Department for Education and Employment and the curriculum councils. They are the base on which the quality of the FSA's work should be judged. That would not involve a big additional burden; it would merely provide a reference point.
<P>
Although we all acknowledge that this is an extremely long and cumbersome Bill and although we do not want to add to the work of the Committee or to the weight of the document, the clauses in it that refer to consumers are rather limited. Amendment No. 48 is one of a series to which the main consumer organisations attach importance. I will not press it to a vote, but I hope that the Government will reflect on the points that I have made. When we return to the matter, additional polish might be given to the Bill. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): I shall again declare my interest: I am a member of the Securities Institute, I have sat on a trading confidence working party set up by the Securities and Futures Authority and, for what it is worth, I have other experience in this area.
<P>
I wholeheartedly welcome the Economic Secretaries concurrence to my earlier comments that well informed consumers are a source of competitiveness and that education is one of the best contributors to regulation that we have. I hope that the hon. Lady will show that she further agrees with me by quoting many of my other comments back at me. She may even be able to endorse some of our later amendments.
<P>
We all recognise that there is a problem with financial education in this country. The 40 per cent. of adults with poor numeracy skills face difficulties, and there is also an enormous lack of awareness in schools of anything to do with long-term financial planning or pensions. I congratulate the FSA on its research which it carried out through a MORI survey. It found that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>" a clear demand amongst secondary school children for lessons in money management to help them prepare for adult life"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
was top of the list of priorities for the education programme.
<P>
The FSA's proposals are to be applauded. They do not constitute a mass production line of yet more leaflets. It has identified the need for meetings, and FSA consumer website, league tables, consumer education forums, education for financial literacy and consumer information and advice. Generic advice is a term that crops up time and again. It is important, and I shall return to it shortly.
<P>
Those suggestions are predicated on Howard Davies's words that another scandal like pensions mis-selling should never happen again. However, education is not just about avoiding another so-called pensions mis-selling scandal, but about enabling people to make choices. The problem with the pensions mis-selling debacle was not, in most cases, that the product was at fault. The problem was that it was not appropriate for the people who were encouraged, by whatever means, to take it up. We often go to great lengths to develop quality products, and the vast majority of products on offer in the financial services market in this country are of high quality. However, the problem is horses for courses and many of the products are entirely unsuitable for the consumers who express an interest in them.
<P>
I endorse the view that the FSA should have a role in promoting awareness of financial markets and products. When one buys a pound of apples, one knows their quality when one picks them up and consumes them shortly afterwards. However, one does not know the quality of a pension product for many years when, lo and behold, it fails to fulfil one's expectations. Therefore, it is important to be able to make good judgments and assessments at the outset.
<P>
I should be grateful for assurances from the Economic Secretary on the appropriateness and suitability requirements. The Chancellor made great play--it is endorsed in the FSA literature--of the league tables that will deal mainly with the costs of the services and products provided by financial services companies. What use will be made of those league tables? If the FSA produces them, it must have a view that one firm is cheaper than another. How do we avoid the FSA using the tables--or them being interpreted--in a way that would endorse the firms at the top of the table for the cheapness of their charges? How will the information be used? 
<P>
The phrase "generic products" has been mentioned. Will the Economic Secretary tell us how the education process will avoid specific product endorsement by the FSA? During the debates on the Finance Bill, we heard about CAT marking and individual savings accounts, which are a case in point. An ISA may or may not be a good product, and many of us would contend that it is not as good as its predecessor. It is wholly inappropriate for the many people who do not pay income tax or capital gains tax. How will the FSA be able to say that ISAs are a good product, as no doubt it and the Treasury will want to do, while making it clear that it is not an appropriate or suitable product for many people?
<P>
A tribe of 6 million new investors were supposedly hammering on the Treasury's door for their ISA application forms, but they have disappeared into the ether, or into cyberspace, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) would say. Why is that? Has it been deemed that ISAs are not a suitable product for the 6 million people for whom we were promised that it would be? Will the Economic Secretary tell us how the FSA will be able to deal with the question of suitability and appropriateness without endorsing specific products?
<P>
What will be the FSA's view of CAT marking? Will it produce a separate list of the firms that have CAT marks attached to the products that they sell and will those firms be given priority over the others? That is all part of the education process. Consumers need to have a full range of choices and guidelines on how to make appropriate ones. 
<P>
Although the FSA's role in education has, up to now, been one of signposting, that is different from its role to promote education. The FSA told us that it will have about 31,000 inquiries this year, up from 13,000 last year. For most inquiries, it signposts the appropriate place to go for information on certain issues. A different issue is involved if the FSA is to take on the education of inquirers.
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, the consumer panel supports financial literacy skills as part of the education programme. My own group, the Securities Institute, has suggested that the FSA should report to the Secretary of State for Education and Employment on progress towards its objective on financial education--I had nothing to do with the imput on consultation. I would be grateful for the Minister's comments on that proposal, which seems fraught with problems. If the FSA is adopting a quasi-educational role in teaching part of the curriculum, what will happen if, in five years' time, we find that pupils are no  more financially literate than they were at the outset. Will Chris Woodhead be dispatched to Canary wharf to sort out the FSA's education department? Will the FSA's education panel be taken over by one promoted by the Department for Education and Employment?
<P>
There are serious issues--the FSA is assuming a weighty educational role. I support that move, but it is fraught with practical problems. We do not want to end up with the FSA appearing to endorse firms and products for all the wrong reasons simply because of the way in which it produces information and the availability of that information. That would dilute the role of the FSA as an impartial arbiter over the financial system, ensuring maximum choice and a level playing field.
<P>
I have asked several questions, and I would be grateful for the Minister's assurances on the issues that I have raised.

<P>

<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): In my experience, there is a marked contrast between people's awareness of financial products and markets and how suitable they are to individual needs in the United Kingdom and the United States. That is despite a general perception that standards of education in the United States are poorer than those in this country.
<P>
Schools are crucial. There is still a strong culture in the education world that trade is dirty and such matters should not be taught in school. It is important that that attitude is changed: education and knowledge is by far the most powerful tool for protecting investors. On the other side of the coin is a danger that investors might believe that the state can look after them, that compensation schemes exist and that they do not need to bother to learn. That would be a source of trouble.
<P>
I sat on a Committee looking at pensions. Before we started, I asked the members of the Committee whether they knew the details of the House of Commons scheme and what their pension arrangements were; not one knew. It is common that until people reach the age of 50 they do not have a clue about their pension arrangements.
<P>
It is tricky to know what the FSA's role should be. My hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham made the crucial point that the FSA cannot be involved in the promotion of generic products and those of individual companies. If it is to educate, how is it to do that without at least implying that certain generic products are better than others? Education must be through other mediums: the FSA may be a provider of people and possibly of educational materials, but it cannot have an upfront role without becoming an adviser.
<P>
What is the FSA doing, and what is it proposing to do? The organogram of the FSA showed a block of people devoted to education, but I am not aware of what the FSA proposes. It would be helpful to know.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): We all agree that information is essential to the workings of any market. If consumers are to make informed choices between products and assess whether a line of investment activity suits their individual needs, they must be given the facts. The FSA has a role in that regard.
<P>
I am, however, puzzled because there may be a conflict between clauses 4 and 19. We will debate clause 19 in due course, but I will refer to it now. Clause 4 is superior in some respects to other parts of the Bill in that it contains an overriding objective of the FSA. Let me make clear what got me thinking along that line.
<P>
An analogy can be made with other consumer products, such as information technology or electronics. It clear that there is a baffling array of products in those markets. Authoritative guides and magazines such as "Which" give consumers comparative advice to which they can refer. However, realistically speaking, people get most of their advice from suppliers, advertising, people who promote their own products and from discussions with friends, neighbours and others who have bought products. In making an informed decision, a consumer will never in practice rely on one regulator, however well funded or energetic that source of information may be. We should, therefore, encourage a multiplicity of advice sources, provided that the relevant advertising or advice is not misleading or fallacious. In the case of information technology, advertisements are subject to the Advertising Standards Authority.
<P>
I was a little surprised when I read clause 19, which is described as dealing with restrictions on financial promotion. I will be a little selective in quoting from it, but I am not being misleading because these words appear. The clause sets out the following requirement:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A person must not communicate...information which is intended...to lead directly or indirectly to engagement in"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
investment activity
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"unless he is an authorised person".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
From that, it is clear that I would be engaging in a criminal activity if I gave my neighbour advice on whether to take out a pension, because I am not an authorised person.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will forgive me. I am following his remarks quite closely, but clause 19 refers specifically to financial promotion. I understand the right hon. Gentleman's desire to mention it, but it would be helpful if we could avoid making too close an examination of it before we come to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Of course, Mrs. Dunwoody. Clause 19 is an important clause. I wanted to make a point about attempting to catch promotion in the provisions. In the example that I gave, I would not have been promoting a particular product or investment trust; I would simply have been giving my neighbour information and advice. I would have been suggesting that, if he had a reasonable income, he should put some of it into the stock market. I would have been giving him general advice along the lines of the objective set out in clause 4. Under clause 19, I would be committing a criminal act. Does the Minister not see a conflict between her laudable ambition of promoting public awareness and understanding of markets and clause 19, which apparently criminalises it? That would certainly be the case if I undertook the matter in the informal way that I suggested. I raise that point because of the importance of the overriding objectives.
<P>
Clause 4 appears to promote awareness not only of the market in general, but of different kinds of investment. That comes back to a subject that we have touched on in previous sittings--whether it is appropriate for the Government or the FSA to promote or endorse specific products. Whenever the Government do that, they usually end up making fools of themselves because, like everyone else, they are prone to fashions in safe investments. I have already cited the example of the war loan, in which everyone was at one time advised to invest. It turned out to be a catastrophically bad investment. The Government should generally avoid endorsing particular products. Germany has a much greater tradition of the Government and authorities attempting to promote specific savings products, and that has had a dampening effect on innovation. It would therefore be unwise for the FSA to get in to that business. It should concentrate on ensuring that those who sell products do so in a way that is helpful and not misleading, and attains certain standards of process and technique. Will the Minister comment on clause 4(2)(a) in the respect?
<P>
My final point is about costs. One of the inhibitions on people who are seeking high-quality advice is the fees that are charged. If we are to try to encourage people to seek advice from independent financial advisers, the costs must be kept down. That is why I am disappointed that the objects--and even the principles--do not appear to impose a constraint on costs. Other objects, such as promoting public awareness, are open-ended--almost any sum of money could be spent on that. If the FSA is to have a large budget, the money will have to be raised from the regulated community, which must then pass those costs on to its savers and other customers. That will raise the cost of products and advice, generating a spiral whereby one is trying to persuade people to seek advice while making it more and more expensive for them to do so. I hope that the Government can find a way of introducing into the Bill a countervailing force to keep down the cost of advice so as to achieve the laudable object of creating an aware, alert and well-educated investment public.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I have one point to make, which follows on from that of my right hon. Friend the Member of Wells. The industry will be paying for this education, the primary purpose of which is to make consumers aware of what they are buying and thus  engender a form of self-reliance. In that sense, the more successful clause 4 is, the less need there will be for clause 5.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are discussing clause 4. I hope that hon. Members are not going to stray on to clauses 5 and 19, or any others.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I was merely pointing out the trade-off between clauses 4 and 5. The more successful clause 4 is, the less the stringent provisions of clause 5 will be needed.
<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The regulated community is varied. A high proportion of members of that community deal with consumers. Some do not, however, and operate only as institutional investors. Some deal entirely with foreign institutions or with markets that have nothing to do with UK consumers and their actions are therefore of no direct concern to those whom clauses 4 and 5 seek to protect.
<P>
Does the Economic Secretary think it right that institutional investors will be charged or asked to contribute by the FSA in a blanket manner for a function that has no bearing on their activity? I note the evidence of Alistair Ross Goobey in the Joint Committee report. In paragraph 184, he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"What worries me as an institutional investor is actually the question of the cost of informing these consumers which does not give us any benefit at all."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Have the Government considered differentiating between classes of investors for the purpose of finding money to make the clause effective?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> This has been a brief but interesting debate. I hope that the right hon. Member for Wells will forgive me if I do not address clause 19. The Committee will come to that clause in due course, although I assure the right hon. Gentleman that there is no conflict between that clause and the object of clause 4.
<P>
I should stress, as other hon. Members have, the need to raise public awareness and education. When I came to the Treasury as a Minister, officials who work in this area made me aware of a horrifying statistic. It appears from survey research that 50 per cent. of the British public do not know what 50 per cent. means. That shows the difficulty we have in ensuring that consumers can understand the advice and information offered to them and make appropriate choices. When real interest rates or annual percentage rates are published, large numbers of people believe that if a large number is displayed on the credit advertisement it is good and that if the number is even larger then it is even better. Those figures are designed to guide consumers on how much they are paying for their credit. For many people, therefore, APRs have exactly the opposite effect to that which is intended. We face a substantial challenge, and it is important for the FSA to be given the new role under discussion.
<P>
As the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham said, we are not discussing merely pensions mis-selling or doing our best to ensure that that does not happen again. We need to ensure that people have enough understanding of numbers and of the function of financial services to be able to use the information and advice that they are given. If they do not have that basic level of understanding, even if they go to a good independent financial adviser, they may not be able to make much use of the advice that they are given or be able to give full and accurate answers to the adviser's questions. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) referred to the need to create a broader culture in which the purpose of savings and investment is better understood and the value of the industry as a whole is better appreciated. It is because of those broader requirements that we have given the FSA the objective of promoting public awareness and understanding. I am pleased to say that the FSA has already published consultation documents on its work in this area and, following the responses to that consultation, a policy statement on consumer education.
<P>
Let me say a little more about what the FSA is doing about consumer education and raising public awareness, in answer to a specific question from the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs. On financial literacy in schools, the FSA has made recommendations to the Department for Education and Employment and to the qualifications and curriculum authority on financial education. The hon. Gentleman may wish to look at the FSA's response to the Secretary of State's proposals on the review of the national curriculum.
<P>
The FSA is establishing a separate consumer website on the internet so that the growing number of consumers who have electronic access can get information directly. Earlier this year, the FSA held three experimental town hall meetings, in Bristol, Edinburgh and York. That was an interesting departure from the normal way of reaching people. It was attended by more than 700 people, who gave the FSA extremely useful feedback on its role. The FSA found that most people who attended those meetings were already regular users of financial services. The FSA is now considering whether those meetings are the most cost-effective way of proceeding, and whether there are other ways of attracting people who do not currently use financial services, perhaps by piggybacking on to other events.
<P>
The FSA has also started a series of consumer guides. It has published five titles already--on financial advice, pensions, the euro, ISAs and boosting occupational pensions. They have been distributed directly by the authority and through citizens advice bureaux and libraries. I understand that those pilot publications have been very well received, and that there will be more to come.
<P>
The FSA has already established a public inquiry helpline. In the past, that helpline tended to be used by people who had bought a product which later caused problems. Now that the FSA has developed the inquiry service, it is getting far more inquiries from people before they make investment and savings decisions. Indeed, by last spring, there was already 2,500 calls a week, which is a real indication of the value of the FSA's service.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham mentioned, quite correctly, the danger that the FSA might stray into product or provider endorsement. Let me assure members of the Committee that there is no question of the FSA endorsing specific providers or specific products. Nor is there any question of the FSA giving individual advice of the kind which independent financial advisers are authorised to provide. It can, however, signpost people to give general information--for instance, by suggesting to people the kind of considerations that they need to think about before putting their savings into any particular investment. A caller might be asked, "How quickly do you need access to your money? Do you want to take a risk, or do you want to know exactly what rate of interest you will earn?" In other words, the FSA will be doing exactly what we sought to do with CAT standards, an issue that the hon. Gentleman raised. We were concerned, in developing CAT standards for ISAs, that we should not mislead the public about what the standards meant. All that such benchmarks, or league tables, can do is provide information about a specific aspect of a certain class of product. In the case of CAT standards, information is provided that guides consumers on the specific issues of charges, access and terms.
<P>
The CAT standards do not, because they cannot, give any guarantee about investment return. Indeed, it is a condition of compliance with CAT standards that that qualification is spelled out. The same is true of league tables because there is a danger--which the FSA recognises--of information being misrepresented. It is therefore important that the league table makes clear precisely what the criteria are and what information is being given.

<P>

<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for dealing with CAT standards. I agree with her. However, the public perception is that a CAT mark is similar to the ABTA sign carried by a travel agent registered with the Association of British Travel Agents and represents an endorsement underwritten by the Government. That is problematic.
<P>
When the league tables are produced, the financial press will, inevitably, produce headlines stating that the latest FSA news is that NatWest or Morgan Stanley have the cheapest products, and people will latch onto that. How are we to avoid such a scenario?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I would not dream of commenting on specific providers.
<P>
League tables will relate only to specific issues for which objective and verifiable information is available. So, for example, the pension or pension provider topping the table in relation to the important matter of administration charges will not necessarily be best for everyone in other respects.
<P>
Therefore, the league table will not say anything about the suitability of a provider's product for a particular individual or investment performance in terms of costs. The league table must make that clear.
<P>
Doubtless, the FSA will do everything possible to achieve such parity. We all know, to our cost, that headline writers come up with thoroughly misleading statements. However, financial journalists, especially those writing on personal finances, often do a valuable job by helping consumers to understand, generally and specifically, what kind of products may be appropriate for them, which questions they need to ask and which information they need to get.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham raised the issue of ISAs. In the first two months of this financial year, twice as much money went into ISAs and into PEPs and TESSAs in the first two months of last year. That is encouraging, especially as early indications from several providers reveal that the general profile of savers investing in cash ISAs is younger than it has been in the past. Indeed, there is an indication that some of those putting their money into cash ISAs are new investors--at least to those providers
<P>
Of course, we are monitoring the impact and take-up of ISAs and, in particular, the impact and understanding of CAT standards and that will help to inform the work of the Treasury and the FSA.
<P>
I shall deal with the "different kinds of investment" mentioned in clause 4(2)(a). We have in mind the need for the FSA to ensure that more of the public understand the nature of risk attached to different kinds of savings. For example, should one's money go into a cash ISA or a similar product, certain terms are attached to it and one will get one's money back along with some interest. However, at the other end of the spectrum, should one put money into an equity ISA or another form of equity investment, no specific rate of return is guaranteed and there is a risk that one may lose some or all of that money, as the value of such investments can go down as well as up. That may seem like basic information to Committee members. None the less, the FSA need to help members of the public understand such matters through educational work in schools and consumer awareness.
<P>
The hon. Member for Chichester (Mr Tyrie) raised the issue of operators in the wholesale market having to contribute through fees to the achievement of the public awareness objective. I refer him briefly to clause 125(3) which makes it clear that when the FSA imposes fees, it has to provide details of opposed expenditure. That is part of its accountability to ensure that it cannot impose excessive charges on the industry to pursue the public education and awareness objective in clause 4. As consultation clearly showed, that objective is widely viewed as valuable to the industry as a whole by increasing the number of well informed consumers in this country.
<P>

This has been an interesting debate. It confirms the importance of the objective set out in the clause and I commend it to the Committee.

<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> It is clear from earlier references that the clause is eagerly awaited--and with some justification. It introduces the important new principle of caveat emptor into financial services regulation. It is the first time--through clause 5(2)(d)--that that principle has been introduced into law and it requires some care. Those who have been through the scrutiny process now subscribe to that broad philosophy. It is a matter of commonsense that consenting adults have responsibility for their own actions. None of us wants to detract from that broad general principle of caveat emptor: that buyers should beware of what they are doing.
<P>
If taken too crudely and literally, however, the idea has its difficulties and the amendments suggest how to refine it. There are two central problems. First, a clever brief could use the concept to exonerate sellers by cynically appealing to the idea of people being responsible for what they do. If mis-selling is the same as mis-buying, why should a seller be culpable? In some circumstances, the concept could be exploited.
<P>
The Joint Committee well summarised the appropriate response:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We recommend that that principle of caveat emptor should feature in the Bill; but that it should be redrafted in such a way that it could not be used to negate the consumer protection objective and excuse exploitation of sections of the general public."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does the clause meet that concern? The amendments suggest additional qualifications to do so.
<P>
The second issue is that different considerations apply to different parts of the financial services market. The distinction between retail and wholesale is particularly important and we debated the appropriateness of it earlier. Howard Davies suggested that three rather than two distinctions were appropriate, but most of us still operate with the wholesale-retail distinction.
<P>
Many companies, such as brokers, buy financial services and also sell them. That is the nature of their business. In buying, they are well informed and have access to specialist lawyers, which is quite different from people operating in the retail market. We believe that the clause should be drafted in such a way as to make that distinction clear.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to give effect to another recommendation of the Joint Committee: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We recommend that the Bill should require the FSA to recognise the different regulatory needs of the wholesale and retail industries."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Of course it does that in other respects but we are trying to make sure that it does that in this clause.
<P>
Perhaps I can run through our amendments briefly in context and summarise the rationale behind them.  Amendment No. 55 makes the important distinction between decisions that are informed and where there is no misleading information and uninformed decisions. Caveat emptor needs to distinguish cases where customers have not been provided with new information and have not been misled. That specific qualification needs to be built into the clause.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 53 and 54 refer to the points about risk which the Economic Secretary mentioned in relation to the earlier clause. The only characteristic of financial products that is singled out here as requiring a different approach by the regulator is that of risk. Clearly risk is relevant, but it is not altogether clear that it should be the only or necessarily the main consideration here. Products can differ enormously in terms of complexity, sophistication and obscurity. Those factors should be built in alongside risk.
<P>
Many of the difficulties in the consumer market in recent years have centred on the pension market. Private pensions, generally speaking, are fairly low-risk products. Their value can fluctuate but they are ultimately managed by fund managers who have a wide portfolio of securities that is designed to minimise risk in many respects. Private pensions could not be regarded as high-risk products but they are complex and sophisticated and consumers require an extra level of protection with them.
<P>
On the other hand, it is possible to imaging very risky products that do not necessarily require the same degree of consumer protection. Those people who are preparing to queue up to buy the Government's shares in British Nuclear Fuels plc are well aware that they are buying a potentially quite risky investment. It is a fairly simple concept that will be will discussed in the press. People know what has happened to Sids in the past and they can draw their conclusions without an elaborate system of consumer protection.
<P>
The most risky investment of all is to put all one's money on the 3.30 at Newmarket. Those who follow the industry will know of the O'Callaghan case that is going through the courts; people in that sector enjoy no protection at all from the courts. It does not necessarily follow that because something is risky it should enjoy a special level of consumer protection. Amendments Nos. 53 and 54 are designed to refine that idea to suggest that risk is not the only consideration that should be borne in mind in defining the product: it should also include comprehensibility and complexity.
<P>
Amendment No. 50 reiterates the point that I have already made. It tries to find a form of words which distinguishes clearly between the wholesale and the retail sectors. It is implicit in much of the legislation and we are trying to make it explicit. Amendments Nos. 55 and 56 aim to introduce the concept of an informed decision; that is what caveat emptor is all about. Caveat emptor applies when a decision is informed. We tried to make that quite clear in the wording of the clause and to define what an informed decision is.
<P>
Amendment No. 61 tries to widen out, or at least to give some flexibility to the subsections which list the four considerations which are thought appropriate when protection is consedered. We ask why it should be narrowed in quite that way as other considerations may well arise. The consumer contracts regulation, for example, which went through the House in 1994, may well bring within the orbit of the Financial Services Authority the concept of unfairness. It deals with the concept of unfair contracts. It introduces a new principle against which consumer protection has to be judged. We do not know whether that will happen, but we suggest that the clause should be drafted so as to leave open the possibility that such considerations may fall to the FSA in future. The amendments are not technically optimal and I am open to the suggestion that the measure could be improved in other ways. My main concern is that there should be a distinction between wholesale and retail sectors in respect of caveat emptor and that that principle should not be used in a crude way that deprives consumers of protection. We suggest various ways in which that could be achieved, but I am also open to the Government's proposals on the matter.

<P>

<B>Mr. Nigel Beard </B>(Bexleyheath and Crayford): I rise to speak to amendment No. 87. The clause must strike a balance between the caveat emptor principle--buyer beware--and consumer protection. That is made difficult by the wide range of consumers to which the clause applies. It includes what was dubbed in the discussions, the wholesale and retail side of things. In wholesale transactions, the sale is from one practitioner to another and the practitioner could be expected to have a wide knowledge from his day-to day experience. In retail transactions, the practitioner sells to the public, who will not have the same knowledge as the practitioner. That was recognised in paragraph 37 of the Joint Committee report, which stated that, although it endorsed the responsibility of the buyer, the caveat emptor principle, must not
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"be used to negate the consumer protection objective and excuse exploitation".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment tries to strike the appropriate balance. It does not try to introduce product regulation or endorsement as it would be outside the FSA's remit and inimical to innovation in the industry to give that mark of approval.
<P>
Clause 5(2)(b) marks the difference between the so-called wholesaler and retailer and regard must be paid to it. Subsection (2)(c) recognises
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the needs that consumers may have for advice and accurate information",
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
but that advice is not specific; it is general, rather than focused information on the product.
<P>
Subsection (2)(d) makes explicit the caveat emptor principle. Amendment No. 87 would not cancel that out but strike the balance that the Joint Committee originally had in mind by stating that there is also a duty on the 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"authorised person to make full and prominent disclosure"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
of information relevant to the choice that the consumer will make in considering a product. The amendment calls for a full and prominent disclosure because, as we have explained many times before, the information could be in the fine print. The salient facts that are relevant to consumer choice must be printed prominently so that people do not have to turn themselves into biblical scholars and go through reams of paper to be aware of them. We make the distinction between what the amendment proposes and subsection (2)(c), which calls for consumer advice, because of the floods of information that may descend on us under that principle, resulting in our being better informed but none the wiser. The amendment would bring focused information which is relevant to the choices facing the consumer. Its words are exactly those of the Joint Committee's recommendation and the intention is the same.
<P>
The amendment has the support of the National Consumer Council and the consumers association, which are both concerned about some of the issues that I have raised. It also has the support of the consumer panel of the FSA. I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I feel that amendments Nos. 53 and 54 relate more to the previous clause. Complexity and comprehensibility are crucial but there is a difference between educating people to deal with them and protecting people. Protection does not quite fit with those two concepts.
<P>
Amendment No. 55, which limits caveat emptor to "informed" knowledge, is important, but I am not comfortable with it. It is like saying that ignorance of the law is a protection, because consumers could always say that they did not know or understand and were therefore not responsible for their choice. The balance of the Act is a combination of clauses 4 and 5--promoting awareness and education and then what needs to be done to protect the consumer. I am deeply uncomfortable with the concept of "informed" as a limit on caveat emptor.
<P>
Amendment No. 50 would redefine consumer to exclude any form of business, but I am not comfortable with that either. Many small businesses are no better educated or informed than individuals. Large businesses may be more sophisticated, but it is crucial for ICI, for example, to understand available pension fund facilities in detail. The distinction between institutional and retail is not clear-cut. As drafted, the clause means that caveat emptor will not apply to businesses. The clause may be unworkable.
<P>
Amendment No. 87 sounds like common sense, but I know from experience of one limitation. Key feature documents are already required by the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation in relation to collective investment schemes. The problem is that investors see the key features document, not the full collective scheme particulars--or prospectus, as it used to be known.
<P>
Under the amendment, the key features are limited to focusing on perceived areas of risk and general awareness. However, as a result, most investors will not receive the full scheme particulars, even if they want them, and I am very uncomfortable with that. It is better for people to have everything rather than a selection, even though it may be slightly more difficult to digest. We must be careful that selections do not blank out items of information that are important to individuals. It is a tricky balance. If the regulations require both, we will be piling up the paper. I go along with much of amendment No. 87, but that is my one reservation.
<P>
I have two main general points. First,  caveat emptor cannot be qualified: it is a principle as it stands, but if is set against the rest of the clause. Secondly, the fairly moderate way in which the clause deals with the distinction between institutional and retail has the right balance. Excluding any business from the definition of consumer does not make sense. The Bill advances different definitions of consumer, but it would be much simpler if it contained the same definition throughout. I can imagine muddle developing in the future as a result of the different definitions.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> Before we even got into Committee, there had been much debate, in response to the Treasury consultation on last year's draft Bill and in the Joint Committee, about consumer protection. I am grateful to the consumer organisations that made helpful points about the definition of consumer and the so-called caveat emptor provision in subsection 2(d).
<P>
In response to the consultation, we undertook to consider ways in which the drafting of clause 5 might be clarified and improved. I do not think that there is any difference in the Committee, or between us and consumer organisations, about the aims of the clause.
<P>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs raised the point that the definition of consumer changes throughout the Bill. That is because different provisions in the Bill seek to achieve slightly different aims. Therefore, the definition of consumer in clause 5 covers market users of the financial system as well as ordinary consumers. The definition of consumer used in relation to the consumer panel must exclude authorised persons because they are dealt with under the practitioners panel. However, we shall consider whether it is possible to have a more consistent definition throughout the Bill. That might be helpful.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Twickenham said, the Joint Committee made three recommendations on this subject. First, it recommended that the principle of caveat emptor should continue to feature in the Bill and that the Bill should be redrafted so that it could not be used to negate consumer protection objectives and excuse exploitation of sections of the public. Secondly, it recommended that the Bill should require the FSA to have regard to the responsibility of authorised persons to make full and prominent disclosure of the main characteristics of a financial service. My hon. Friend the Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Beard) drew attention to that in his amendment. Thirdly, it recommended that the Bill should require the FSA to recognise the very different regulatory needs of the wholesale and the retail industries.
<P>
In response to the Joint Committee's recommendations and the concerns expressed in consultation, we have inserted a new paragraph (c) in clause 5(2). In that paragraph, we require the FSA, in considering what is the appropriate degree of protection, to take into account
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the needs that consumers may have for advice and accurate information".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That change makes clear what it is reasonable for consumers to expect and puts their responsibility for their own decisions into the context of that expectation. Similarly, paragraph (c) underlines the need for the FSA to recognise the different degrees of protection appropriate to consumers in the wholesale and retail sectors in the sense that that their information and advice needs are likely to vary.
<P>
I should explain in a little more detail the thinking behind our decision to define the objective in the way that we have. In doing so, I hope that I will be able to answer the concerns that have been raised. I stress that the clause must be read as a whole. The way in which the factors are relevant will vary according to the particular case. The clause does not give any one factor priority over the others. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that all members of the Committee will turn off their electronic toys before they come into the Room. Otherwise, I shall ask them to leave the Committee.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I emphasise that the clause must be read as a whole. The reference in subsection 2(d) to the principle of caveat emptor does not override the other factors.
<P>
The Bill sets out several factors that the FSA must take into account when deciding how to give protection to consumers. In response to amendment No. 61, I want to make it clear that those are not the only factors that the authority must take into account. It must also have regard--as always--to the principles in clause 2(3), as well to as any other factors that it considers relevant.
<P>
The term "consumer" has deliberately been given a wide meaning in this clause. That wide definition is important in understanding the various factors in subsection (2). The term covers existing and potential consumers, individuals and firms, experts and non-experts. It also takes into account third parties who may have rights under a contract--for example, third parties who might benefit under a motor insurance policy. Amendment No. 50 would narrow the definition to a much smaller range of individuals--the amendment calls them "natural persons"--while neglecting entirely others who may need some form of protection. I wholly agree with the comments of the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs on that.
<P>
At one end of the spectrum there are individual retail customers dealing with major firms. At the other end are major authorised firms dealing with each other on an equal footing. In between, however, there are a variety of possibilities--an independent financial adviser insuring his own home or business premises, so-called expert private investors and business angels, or a major manufacturing company that needs advice on its proposal to buy a major shareholding in another company, something which would go way outside its core competencies as a manufacturer. That same manufacturer might seek to hedge its foreign exchange rates in the swaps market. FSA rules need to be able to reflect all those diverse relationships, but it would be wrong to exclude from the scope of the consumer protection objective those legal persons or organisations that will have some need for appropriate consumer protection.
<P>
There is a misapprehension among some critics of our definition that there are simply two categories of consumer--the retail and the wholesale. As the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs stressed, that is simply not the case. There is a spectrum of consumers with different knowledge, experience and needs. We therefore need this more sophisticated definition.
<P>
Another factor that the FSA must take into account, to which subsection (2)(a) specifically refers, is the degree of risk that may be involved in a transaction. Regulation should be proportionate to the benefit. Low-risk products may need less intrusive regulation than high-risk products or the selling of them.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 53 and 54, which were tabled by the hon. Member for Twickenham, would, as he explained, also place a duty on the FSA to have regard to the complexity and comprehensibility of different kinds of investment. Of course, the protection that is afforded to consumers needs to take into account the fact that some products are more difficult to understand than others, but I stress that the concepts of risk and complexity are different. 
<P>
Risk is inherent in a product, no matter who buys it. Complexity is a relative concept that depends on the purchaser's knowledge as well as on the characteristics of the product. Thus, a product that is complex to one consumer may be simple and easy to understand for someone with more experience. Geared futures and option funds carry a higher level of risk than savings accounts, but neither are as difficult to grasp as, for example, derivatives, which are both risky and complex--indeed, one might say incomprehensible--for most people.
<P>
The risk inherent in a product is dealt with in subsection (2)(a). In my view, the issue of complexity and comprehensibility is dealt with adequately in subsection (2)(b), which places the FSA under a duty to have regard to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the differing degrees of experience and experties that... consumers may have in relation to different kinds of regulated activity".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (2)(c) also deals with such protection and recognises that some consumers will need more advice and information than others.
<P>
We would expect the FSA and authorised persons to ensure that a complex product is explained clearly and in terms that are easily understood--in exactly the same way that we would expect the risk implications of any product to be explained to consumers. The provisions therefore already deal with the issue.
<P>

<P>
On the question of caveat emptor, there is the general principle that consumers should take responsibility for their decisions. The inclusion of that principle in clause 5 does not change the relationship between consumers and authorised firms; it simply recognises that there is a limit to what regulation can achieve and requires the FSA to take that into account in deciding how to exercise its functions. As I stressed earlier, however, that provision must be read alongside the other provisions in the clause--particularly paragraphs (b) and (c). The way in which they interrelate will depend on the nature of the consumer in a particular case and the nature of the product or service that he buys. The FSA will need to take account of those different circumstances.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 55 and 56 would introduce the need for the FSA to consider whether consumers' decisions were informed when it applied to the principle that consumers must take responsibility for them. That brings us back to the subjective or relative test that applied to amendments Nos. 53 and 54. Firms could safely make a recommendation only where they were clear that the consumer was informed. However, consumers should also have some responsibility to ensure that their decisions are properly informed.
<P>
Clause 5(2)(c) deals with the substance of that issue by providing that the FSA must address itself to the question of what information firms should be required to provide and in what circumstances. At the same time, the FSA must recognise that it cannot and should not try to regulate in a way that frees consumers from any need to take due account of the information that they receive.
<P>
I understand the concern of the Consumers Association and other bodies that it would be wrong to allow the caveat emptor clause to override everything else. I stress again that the relevance of each of the principles that we are discussing varies to a greater or lesser degree, depending on the particular circumstances of the case. The clause must be read as a whole.
<P>
I want to deal briefly with the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford. I am grateful to him for introducing amendment No. 87, which, as he said, closely follows the wording of the Joint Committee's recommendation. The amendment gives me the opportunity to explain in a little more detail why we have opted for a slightly different approach from that taken in the precise wording that the Joint Committee suggested.
<P>
The Joint Committee noted that information is one of the best protections for consumers and that it is essential if they are to be held as having some responsibility for their decisions. We strongly agree with that. In revising the draft Bill, we considered carefully whether to include wording along the lines of the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend. We decided instead to meet the Joint Commitee's concerns in a slightly different way. The reason was that, as I noted a moment ago, the responsibilities of firms will vary considerably in practice, depending on the nature of the relationship with the consumer. There should, for instance, be a clear responsibility to ensure full and careful disclosure where personal pensions are marketed to ordinary members of the public. We would expect the FSA to make rules that required that. Different rules might be appropriate in the case of a much more experienced investor who was instructing his stockbroker to buy shares in a company. Different rules again could apply to inter-professional dealing.
<P>
Clause 5(2) sets out the factors that the FSA must take into account--along with the factors in clause 2(3)--in determining the appropriate degree of protection and, in particular, in drawing up rules.
<P>
Clause 5, in common with the other objectives, does not impose obligations on firms. That is something that the FSA might do when it draws up rules in the light of the objectives of clause 5, the principles of clause 2 and--especially in relation to the protection of consumer objectives--its consideration of the factors in clause 5(2)(c). We responded to the Joint Committee by inserting new paragraph (c) into clause 5(2) so as to require the FSA to take into account, amongst other factors, the needs that consumers may have for advice and information. We are making it clear that it is generally reasonable for consumers to expect advice and accurate information. At the same time, we have put their responsibility for their decisions under paragraph (d) into the context of that expectation. The reference in subsection (5)(c) to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the needs that consumers may have"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
preserves the notion that the exact needs of different kinds of consumers will vary. That is in line with the clause's whole approach to differentiation and proportionality.
<P>
Our insertion of new paragraph (c) addresses the Committee's valid concerns--including those of my hon. Friend the Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford--about the importance of adequate disclosure to consumer choice. It also avoids the risk that the amendments might have the opposite effect to that which was intended by my hon. Friend and the Joint Committee. If the FSA were required to take into account the responsibilities of authorised persons to disclose information, it might then be argued by an ingenious lawyer that it would be inappropriate for the FSA to use its powers to make rules requiring relevant information to be disclosed.
<P>
I hope that my hon. Friend that paragraph (c) deals with his and the Joint Committee's concerns and that he will therefore withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell </B>(North-East Bedfordshire): I hope that it is not unfair to ask the Minister to clarify whether there is any real difference between something that is described as a principle in clause 5--or clause 2--and other matters to which the authority must have regard. Are principles principles only when they are described as such, and do they have some special status in relation to needs, or should one simply take the words according to their natural and ordinary meaning?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The right hon. and learned Gentleman raises an issue that we considered during a previous sitting: the authority's statutory duties, including both objectives and principles. He is wise to suggest that we should simply take the words in the Bill to have their natural and ordinary meaning. Subsection (2) explains the specific practice to which the authority must have regard in seeking to achieve the protection of consumers objective. There are also, of course, aspects of clause 2 that must be taken into account.
<P>
I conclude by expressing the hope that the hon. Member for Twickenham will agree to withdraw his amendment. If he does not do so, I must ask my hon. Friends to vote against it.
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> I thank the Minister for the seriousness of her reply, and for its detail. I should like to respond to a number of points. 
<P>
Amendment No. 56 would insert the concept of an informed decision. The case against our amendments was made trenchantly by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs, and subsequently taken up by the Minister. The fear was that victims of mis-selling would be enabled to plead ignorance before the law. That is true to a degree--there is bound to be a balance of arguments in any dispute about financial selling. Those accused of financial mis-selling are bound to use the new caveat emptor principle as a defence; those counter-accused of mis-buying will, of course, plead ignorance. The purpose of the amendment was to strike a balance between the two to ensure that the law did not tilt powerfully in one direction; I recognise the force of the objection to it.
<P>
I understood the Minister to say that what distinguished risk from what she described as the subjective criteria that we had introduced was that risk was objective and inherent in the products. I would strongly beg to differ: risk is subjective. For rich and sophisticated people, the risks of a risky investment are limited because they have a large portfolio pool for protection.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> It is important that we distinguish between the level of risk inherent in the product and the attitude of individual consumers towards risk. An investment in complex derivatives may be highly risky, but a sophisticated and wealthy investor may be more willing and able to bear that risk than the hon. Gentleman or myself.
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> I take the point, but the distinction is perhaps not as clear cut as the Minister implies. In practice, a relatively secure investor with a large portfolio upon which to draw would discount risk differently. However, I accept that there is a distinction to be drawn.
<P>
The most important point concerns how we treat the distinction between the wholesale and retail sectors. The point has been made that we cannot incorporate such a distinction in the clause because we are dealing with a spectrum of different operators. I fully accept that we do not want to create a legal structure under which a small one-man IFA is treated on the same basis as ICI. That would be perverse and would defeat the objective of consumer protection--small operators also require a seal of protection.
<P>
There is a great danger of our throwing out the baby with the bath water. The thrust of our discussions during the long build-up to the legislation was that there were important distinctions between the wholesale and retail markets, whether they were defined as a dichotomy, a trichotomy or a spectrum. As the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs said, it may be that ICI also needs to be prudent in the way in which it buys financial services. However, unlike the retail consumer, ICI has access to many in-house solicitors and technical advisers. Its position is different from that of the retail consumer, and we must have that distinction.
<P>
Some people argued forcefully in the Treasury Select Committee that the FSA should be split into two because cultures were so different. The danger of our hiding behind the argument that the situation is complicated, that we cannot make distinctions and that there is a spectrum which cannot be divided at any point is that we will finish up with a regime fixed in the middle. Such a regime would provide insufficient protection for retail consumers and would over-regulate wholesale consumers.
<P>
The problem may be difficult, and I recognise the point about the small practitioner who is also a consumer, but if we duck the issue of incorporating a distinction in law, we shall finish up with all the difficulties that we were warned about by many of the people who were originally concerned about the structure of the FSA. I accept that the phrasing of the amendments may be flawed and that it certainly could be improved. However, the issue that they raise will remain with us, and I hope that the Government will continue to reflect on it.
<P>
Like the hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford, I note that our amendments had the support of consumer groups and of the Consumers Association and the National Consumer Council in particular. I hope that the Government will continue to talk with those organisations because their concerns remain, despite the additional help of subsection (2)(c). I recognise that its inclusion was a positive move, but concerns remain. I therefore hope that the dialogue will continue and that a stronger protection of the retail consumer interest will be embedded in the clause by the time the Bill is enacted. In that spirit, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question put, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I do not want to plough over ground that has been covered, and I am sure that you would not let me do so, Mrs. Dunwoody. However, one or two issues deserve further comment.
<P>
The opposition support the concept of caveat emptor. We believe that the principle of people's responsibility for their actions is essential in the field to which the Bill applies and in others. I am not sure on what other basis one can sensibly proceed. If that principle is removed or seriously undermined, the shifting of blame for investment decisions that go wrong could become an epidemic, so it is important that it is adhered to.
<P>
In seeking to ensure provision of appropriate advice and information, might not the Minister be in danger of going against recent Treasury action in respect of CAT standard individual savings accounts, which appears to limit the scope for providing information and advice? The same may be true of stakeholder pensions. The Government are apparently anxious to keep costs down and to limit to 1 per cent. the charges involved. Might not that approach inhibit the provision to consumers of information explaining risks and benefits, which this clause, in other respects, seeks to promote?
<P>
I should like briefly to mention clause 19, without seeking to debate it. By agreeing to the clause before us, we could be encouraging activity that other parts of the Bill make a criminal offence. I remind the Committee that clause 19 does not merely aim to promote products, an aim that goes beyond consumer protection. It seeks to prevent the giving of information that leads to investment activity of any sort. A journalist, company or Member of Parliment could suggest to somebody that he or she buys some shares. The person giving advice as suggested in clause 5, could, however, be committing a criminal offence unless he or she is registered as being able to give that advice. Will the Economic Secretary comment, however briefly, on whether the Bill contains such a conflict?
<P>
The laudable aim of trying to supply consumers with good advice, or even any advice might mean that people tempted to give such advice break the law. That is a serious issue, and we will discuss it in greater detail when we debate clause 19. It would be wrong, however, for us to zip straight through these points and then to come straight up against clause 19, which may even cover the FSA. The FSA is presumably not an authorised person--although that is a question in itself--and, in giving advice and information, it could contravene clause 5.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Perhaps I can give some guidance. It is quite in order for the hon. Gentleman to mention a specific point about clause 19 in relation to the clause before us. However I hope that if the Minister picks up that point, she will not go into the detail of a clause that will be debated later. While I am on my feet, I should say that if 50 per cent. of people do not understand what 50 per cent. means, there are even more who do not understand Latin tags. I speak as someone who used a Latin tag in the chamber on Monday night--it takes one to know one. If we could in future avoid using Latin tags, we might do ourselves a favour. Sir Nicholas--on Latin tags, I suspect.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Mrs. Dunwoody, let the buyer beware.
<P>
[Laughter.]
<P>
This is an important clause. Subsection (2)(c) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the needs that consumers may have for advice and accurate information".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I should like to ask the Minister to test that provision by mentioning a worry that has been raised with me, not so much regarding the technicalities of the Bill but the practicalities of what the Financial Services Authority will have to deal with, in current and coming years, in respect of what is sometimes called a potential future mis-buying scandal.
<P>
We are familiar with the mis-selling scandals, which have, understandably and rightly, been the subject of much concern and criticism. But people are beginning to suggest that, as a result of the trading in pension schemes and savings schemes over the counter, quite a large number of citizens may be mis-buying. They are not really getting any advice; they are offered retail products, which may be suitable for some but not for others, and are buying them, when it may not be to their advantage to do so.
<P>
This is a serious question, to which I do not immediately know the answer, which is why I seek to know how the Minister, as a representative of the Treasury and the Government, approaches it. It is particularly serious in respect of ISAs and stakeholder pensions, when one is considering what is in the best interests of a citizen on a very modest income. What does somebody who earns between 50 per cent. and 100 per cent. of the national average figure have to consider when making an investment? What advice can they be expected to receive from the provider of the product? What will the Financial Services Authority, which must have regard to the needs of consumers, be considering and advising in the context of clause 5(2)(c)? That is quite a difficult question; I should like to focus on it before I sit down.
<P>
Must the FSA consider whether the product in itself is safe, in the sense that it is likely to be well managed, and as likely as any other to have a reasonable rate of return? Or must they consider whether the type of consumer who is likely to buy it ought, in their best interest, to be buying it at all? I illustrate the point with one quite profound question, which represents a real problem for modern society. To what extent is it in the best interests of people who have a modest amount of money to spend it on an investment which may give them a very small income, depriving them of receiving benefits, or reducing their entitlement to benefits? Is the Financial Services Authority expected to take that into account? Are providers expected to take that into account?

<P>

<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> On caveat emptor--
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Simpson </B>(Mid-Norfolk): Translate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Yes, I am sorry--let the buyer beware. Although there is clearly a grey area here, as my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) said, and small business men may be scarcely more familiar than an individual with the detail of a product. There is a massive distinction between major institutions and retail consumers. Sooner or later the FSA will need to develop that distinction in its work. When CSFB does a deal with HSBC, it does not need much FSA protection. It knows what it is about. It can do its job. The FSA would freely acknowledge that.
<P>
I was persuaded by a good number of the points made by the hon. Member for Twickenham about the amendments, even if I did not agree with the wording of the amendments themselves. The FSA will inevitably have to come back to this issue. As the products develop and become more sophisticated, they will have to change and adjust. That is why I agree with the Minister that the FSA must have some flexibility. The problem will not go away entirely. If practitioners complain that they are burdened with piles of paper, generated initially in the interests of protecting consumers rather than institutions, we will be shackling our industry. They will complain noisily and we will have to do something to reduce the burden.
<P>
My second point concerns risk. How far should the FSA consider risk? That is a major issue. I did not initially think that the clause was as important as clause 4(2)(a), but I have now concluded that it may turn out to be an important part of the Bill. If the FSA gets into the business of regulating risk, it is perilously close to substituting for the fundamental job of the industry itself. It is the job of the industry to administer risk. That is what the whole industry is about. It would be damaging if it tried in any way to second guess the industry on what risk really means and how to present it to consumers.
<P>
The allocation of capital, which is the counterpart to risk, must involve the risk of losses. The FSA should not make it so difficult that it prevents consumers from making a high-risk investment if they are determined to do so. That is why a tension is built in between subsection 2(a) and subsection 2(c) which has been introduced by the Government in the light of advice from the Joint Committee.
<P>
Is there a precedent in any existing UK legislation for such direct involvement of a regulator in the examination of risk? Is there anything similar to subsection (2)(a) in the legislation of any other country? Is it, for example, built into United States regulations? My best guess is that the clause could end up as quite problematic. Although I will not prejudge the debate on clause 10, it is a classic example of something that we will want to come back to after a few years when we review the workings of the FSA to see how the clause is affecting the industry.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I agree with you entirely, Mrs. Dunwoody, about the need to avoid Latin. I say that conscious of the fact that on Tuesday we were talking about amicus curiae or friend of the court briefs and I was being pulled up on my Latin pronunciation.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There is a House of Commons rule stating that we should use English and, on rare occasions, Norman French. That rule is perfectly straightforward. However, most people ignore it, as they do so many rules.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The Lord Chancellor has introduced that sensible rule into the courts, which must now speak in English, not Latin. I shall therefore do my best to ensure that Government members in Committee always speak English.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Having reflected on our interesting debate on an extremely important clause, I must remind Committee members of our starting point. No regulator--not even the best one--can prevent all failures: Members on both sides of the Committee endorsed that. A good regulator can stop many failures or reduce their impact when they occur. However, it cannot stop all of them, all of the time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Does the Economic Secretary agree that it is important that the regulator should not try to stop business failures? The process of allocating capital is one in which it is quite right that good decisions are rewarded and bad decisions are punished.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. When a financial services institution makes bad decisions, it is extremely important that it takes responsibility for them. The bankruptcy of a financial institution is, on occasion, the proper consequence of poor decisions. On such occasions, it would be quite wrong for the regulator to step in, pick up the pieces and prevent the people who made mistakes bearing the consequences of their actions.
<P>
Therefore, having given the FSA a clear objective to protect consumers, we must understand what that means. Otherwise, we do a real disservice to the people we seek to protect by giving them unrealistic expectations. The regulator can help to protect consumers from abuse and others' failure within the limits that we have indicated. However, it cannot simply protect all consumers from themselves, as that would be wrong.
<P>
In that context, I shall respond to comments made by the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir N. Lyell). People will decide for themselves how to spend their money. They will decide whether to buy lottery tickets, gamble on the 3.30, or put money into a cash deposit, cash ISA or an equity or insurance-based investment. It would be an absurd form of the nanny state, should the regulator or Government seek to ensure that everyone always made decisions in whatever the regulator or Government regarded as their best interest.
<P>
That is neither possible nor desirable. Were the regulator or Government to seek to behave in that way, the right hon. and learned Gentleman would be one of the first to object. As we discussed in relation to clause 4, it is far more helpful to take steps to ensure consumers are better able to make decisions in their own interest. It is essential that the regulatory system contains provision to ensure that consumers go into transactions with their eyes open.
<P>
The hon. Member for Chichester was anxious that, under the clause, the FSA might become the arbiter of risk or capital allocation. That is neither the intention nor the effect. We are ensuring that the regulator has proper powers and can make the proper rules so that the consumers--especially those individuals who are less experienced--are properly informed when they go into transactions. The regulator must ensure that people who cannot afford to take big risks with modest amounts of capital are not encouraged to do so or are misled about the nature of the transaction that they are entering into.
<P>
The FSA is already consulting about the nature of the differentiation between retail and wholesale consumers and various points in-between. The fears expressed at the end of our last debate by the hon. Member the Twickenham about overregulating wholesale markets and underregulating individual transactions are not well founded in light of existing regulation and what the FSA is already doing.
<P>
Clearly, the FSA would be expected to provide rules requiring financial advisers advising individual clients to inquire into their customers' circumstances and ensure that the products that they recommend are suitable for them. Under such rules, financial advisers would have to take into account the risk inherent in a particular product and the customer's attitude towards risk. Financial advisers already do that through a fact find.
<P>
Rules that would be appropriate and necessary for the protection of the relatively inexperienced individual customer would not apply to transactions between professional counter-parties who, almost by definition, have much greater expertise than retail customers. An example of that is the best execution rule, which requires a firm to obtain the best price available on the market for a particular investment. However, those who are not private customers under the rules of the Security and Futures Authority are knocked out of that because it is believed that fund managers do not need the protection of the best execution rule. Similarly, only private customers are given the protection of rules governing recommendations to switch from one life product to another.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells raised the matter of CAT standards and ISAs and asked whether there was a contradiction between the objectives in clause 5 and the possibility that CAT-standard ISAs might be sold on an execution-only basis. It is true that CAT-standard ISAs will, by definition, be simpler products on which key information is made available about charges, access and terms. They are likely to be suitable for less-experienced investors, and especially in the case of cash ISAs where there is no lock-in and no risk, there is no reason why customers should not buy them on an execution-only basis. Insurance and equity ISAs would be bought and sold on the same basis.
<P>
My colleagues in the Department of Social Security are currently consulting on the benchmark maximum charge for stakeholder pensions and considering how appropriate advice can be provided for people considering taking a stakeholder pension. We await the response to that consultation. I assure Opposition Members that there will be no conflict between the aims of clause 5 and those of clause 19, as I shall explain when we debate the latter clause.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I have been pondering the Economic Secretary's response. I understand her assertion that we do not want a nanny state, but the purpose of the Bill is that guidance should be given, and the clause requires it. I ask the Minister to illustrate her approach by answering the classic question: what advice should be given to someone who is considering whether to take out a repayment mortgage or a mortgage that is repaid by an endowment policy? It is well recognised that advice is needed on that issue but my impression is that that would be a matter for the authority. Will the Minister please clarify the issue?

<P>

<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> We will consult on whether the sale of mortgages as a whole should be bought within the scope of the Bill under the scope order. The sale of endowment products--either on their own or in association with a mortgage--is already covered by financial services regulation and will be covered by the Bill. However, I am not an authorised financial adviser and neither are FSA staff, so I do not intend to pursue the right hon. and learned Gentleman's detailed points.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am not sure that it is possible to duck out as easily as that. It is a perfectly serious question. The FSA must have regard to the protection of consumers objective, must consider the degree of protection that is appropriate and must have regard to the needs of consumers for advice and accurate information. Is it not therefore bound to advise people that their endowment policy may not be sufficient to repay their mortgage? Does not the Minister agree that that is the sort of advice that the FSA should offer?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> As I said, the sale of endowment products falls--under the scope order--within the scope of the Bill and the FSA will make rules about what advice is appropriate on the sale of such products. Bringing the sale of mortgages as a whole within the scope order is a separate issue. The narrower question of dealing with endowments is a matter for the FSA in exercising its rule-making powers.
<P>
We have had an interesting debate and I warmly commend the clause to the Committee.

Clause 5 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 6</center></H4>
<H4><center>The reduction of financial crime.</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 42, in page 3, line 19, leave out 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'carried on by a regulated person'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments:
<P>
No. 43, in page 3, line 27, leave out 'prevent' and insert'reduce the risk of being used for'.
<P>
No. 44, in page 3, line 30, at end insert--
<P>
'(2A) In considering that objective the Authority must maintain procedures for monitoring the financial system to identify possible financial crime and to alert consumers and regulated persons about its suspicions as soon as practicable'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I take the Committee back some 15 years to the Gower report and the coming of regulation. Regulation was about the improvement of professional standards and the reduction of crime and corruption--and of the losses that citizens suffered as a consequence. As regulation proceeded, the main focus was laying down and monitoring rules of conduct, and defining in detail the way in which monitors should conduct themselves in the industry.
<P>
The focus on the equally important subject of stopping crime has been surprisingly small. The Securities and Investments Board had a modest but effective little unit devoted to that, but it was always woefully under-resourced in relation to the bureaucratic functions. City of London figures for financial crime worsened from 1986; there was certainly no great improvement.
<P>
When I first read the clause, I was astonished to find that there was nothing in it about the role of the FSA. It is concerned with hunting down, tracking out and making the industry aware of crime, yet there is no reference whatever to the FSA. Amendment No. 44 deals with that problem; I shall return to it in more detail later.
<P>
Amendment No. 42 would remove the reference to a "regulated person" in clause 6(1). As drafted, it is analogous to saying that the police have a duty to check that motorists do not offend, but only if they have driving licences.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
If the attempt to reduce financial crime and the possibility of businesses being used for that purpose is applied only to offences committed out by a regulated person, it means that the FSA has no responsibility for smelling out crooks who are not regulated and who thus offer products and services improperly. The amendment may not be the best way to tackle that anomaly, but it is crucial that the objective of reducing financial crime should not apply only to the regulated industry.

Amendment No. 43 makes a legalistic point that the clause as drafted requires the impossible. It asks regulated persons to prevent financial crime; it may be possible for them to do so, but the world "prevent" should not be used in that context as it is unrealistic. The amendment would therefore replace it with the worlds
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"reduce the risk of being used for".

<P>
<B>Mr. David Kidney </B>(Stafford): I apologise for my weak voice. Crime prevention is a common means of reducing crime. Surely, therefore,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"measures...to prevent crime"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is an understandable phrase.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Crime prevention as a colloquial phrase is fine; it is used in a variety of contexts. However, in the legal context of the clause it requests something that, strictly speaking, is not possible. The wording should call upon people to do that which is possible. I look forward to the Minister's response; we raise the matter on the advice of lawyers that, as drafted, the clause is legally wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kidney:</B> The British Bankers Association suggests that the Tory amendment is unhelpful; it would prefer the words "designed to prevent" financial crime rather than "prevent".
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> That may be right, but the BBA amendment acknowledges the legal point that we are trying to make.
<P>
Amendment No. 44 is our key amendment, which endeavours to define the responsibilities of the FSA in reducing and discouraging financial crime--it cannot prevent it. We want the FSA to maintain procedures for monitoring the financial system to identify financial crime and to alert regulated persons of its suspicions as soon as is practicable. The drafting of the clause is legally difficult; 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"as soon as practicable"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is there because the FSA cannot go round spreading false rumours and defaming parties. From my experience of the industry, I know that there have been many occasions on which regulated persons have reported to the regulators their concerns about the way that certain businesses conduct themselves. It has taken a long time for the regulators to do anything and, in the meantime, people have lost money because of the corrupt practitioners in the industry.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Louise Ellman </B>(Liverpool, Riverside): Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, unless the clause contained the type of careful drafting and detail that is not practicable, the fears that he and his hon. Friends expressed about the great power of the FSA would be exacerbated? It would be possible for something defined loosely as: "suspicion" to form a reason for the FSA to act in a way that could jeopardise someone's business and life. Is the hon. Gentleman not worried by that prospect?
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the hon. Lady for that question. Because of the problem that she has described, I earlier asked whether the first attempt at drafting the clause was good enough. However, there is a distinction between our general points about over-regulation and huge legislative powers and the specific point that the function of regulation is to prevent crime.
<P>
There are two aspects to the issue. The first is to make the industry operate according to good practice, and we should regulate it so that it does. The second is the smelling out of criminals and ensuring that they are hunted down in an effective fashion and stopped in time.
<P>
The clause completely misses out any reference to the FSA's responsibilities. Regulators receive much information from the industry about practitioners who may be breaching the law, and their job is to investigate those cases quickly and to institute criminal proceedings if they are appropriate. Regulators should act as soon as they can to stop clients suffering. The speed at which regulators get on with their duties is crucial. Experience in the retail industry shows that they have not always acted as quickly as they might have. The FSA has had an important role in smelling out ostrich farm scams and other serious matters, and it has unofficially warned the industry that it must make people aware of unregulated products.
<P>
This is a crucial probing amendment. It would require the Bill to outline the FSA's specific duty in regard to the reduction of financial crime. As currently drafted, the Bill merely says that the FSA must use its best endeavours and have regard to the desirability of regulated persons taking action to discourage crime. That will have only a small impact on the amount of financial crime.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I wish to commend amendment No. 42, to express doubts as to whether amendment No. 43 is necessary and to say a word or two about the importance of amendment No. 44, which relates to procedures for monitoring the financial system, as that is an extremely important part of the FSA's role. Will the Minister satisfy me that that finds expression in the Bill?
<P>
Amendments Nos. 42 and 43 involve rather technical matters. Clause 2(2)(d) deals with the objective of reducing financial crime. Amendment No. 42 states that that should not be confined to businesses 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"carried on by a regulated person".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I commend that to the Economic Secretary, as the FSA's objective is to stop financial crime. If the FSA were to concentrate only on regulated businesses, it would be narrowing its sights a bit too much. Its objective should be to stop financial crime in any business that ought to be regulated, not just those that are regulated. Therefore, even if the wording proposed in the amendment is left out of the Bill, we should at least find a form of words that refers to the reduction of financial crime, regardless of whether the person facilitating that crime has stayed behind the parapet, and is not regulated.
<P>
Amendment No. 43 would replace "prevent" with 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"reduce the risk of being used for".
<P>

<P>
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs that we do not want to ask for the impossible. I have examined the verbal concatenationsÐthat is not a very good word, but at least it is not Latin--that are built up in clause 6(2), which states that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Authority must...have regard to the desirability of"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
taking appropriate measures
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to prevent financial crime".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In quoting that subsection, I have omitted irrelevant words. Once the desirability of taking appropriate measures to prevent crime is dealt with, I do not have too much difficulty with "prevent". That is my opinion as a lawyer; the Economic Secretary will have her own advice and comments.
<P>
Whether subsection (2)(a) should be included in the Bill is important. Amendment No. 44 states that in considering the objective of reducing financial crime 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Authority must maintain procedures for monitoring the financial system to identify possible financial crime and to alert consumers and regulated persons about its suspicions as soon as practicable".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I regard that as a crucial role for the authority, which is critical to the maintenance of discipline in the City. Long before Professor Gower prepared his report in the supposed old days when I was not around, everything was done by the Governor of the Bank of England or the chairman of Lloyd's raising an admonitory finger. If Herbert so-and-so was going off the rails, he would be summoned.
<P>
The idea was that the antennae of the City were alert and that those who played a senior role in the financial system would keep an eye on what was going on. Up to a point, that worked. However, the time came when it did not. We have now moved into a regulatory era. The trouble is, the more legalistic and detailed regulations become, the more people's concentration on ethics and standards is reduced, so that their minds are focused on complying with the letter of the rules and sailing up to the edge of what is permitted.
<P>
It is essential that experienced City people should be on the FSA, and that such people should be in day-to-day contact with it.
<P>
