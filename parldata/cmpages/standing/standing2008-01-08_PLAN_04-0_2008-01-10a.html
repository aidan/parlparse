Jacqui Lait</b> (Beckenham) (Con): Welcome. I hope that you
are pleased about the Government&#146;s announcement earlier today on
nuclear power. That will keep your industry going for some time to
come. I do not know whether you have seen the statement, but it says
that the Government will be inviting energy companies to put forward
proposals for new power stations. This obviously affects your
association. I wonder what you think about the policy statement
process. We will keep the infrastructure planning commission out of it
for the moment, but what, from your point of view, should be in the
national policy
statements?</div>

to build new, but for network reinforcements, and we will need to look
at that.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column110" />Column number: 110</div>
					<a name="08011064000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">The national
policy statement on planning must have some legitimacy through a wide,
deep democratic process, which may take a long time, and we are quite
comfortable with that. However, we must ensure that they are agreed to
the widest legitimacy and that they will go into the right levels of
detail to aid the IPC in its decision-making process. Investment now,
looking at it very carefully, will save time later and prevent the need
for amendment by the Minister at a future
stage.</div>
					<a name="08011064000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">

								Phil
Jones:
							</b>
						</i> From the point of view of a company like my
own&#151;I should stress that it is pretty much exclusively a network
organisation; we move other people&#146;s power around for them to
the good people who want to use it&#151;the acid test of the policy
statement would be to ask if it is able to change the proposal that
people would make. I used to do that kind of work in the organisation,
planning and laying-out of networks.</div>
					<a name="08011064000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">The test at
the drafting and consultation stages is whether it gives guidance on
what are effectively the network planner&#146;s key choices. We are
fairly old technology&#151;there is nothing brand new about the kind
of assets that we put in place&#151;so the straight question about
whether or not we should be there has pretty much already been
answered. Until we find a way to broadcast power without some kind of
physical infrastructure something will have to be there. The questions
are not so much, &#147;Shall we have it or shan&#146;t
we?&#148;&#151;if there is a requirement for power we shall have to
be there in some form&#151;but about overhead or underground. Policy
guidance on where those kind of things are acceptable and where they
are not would substantially aid the process. By way of illustration, we
are running a fairly complicated process at the moment with our
colleagues at National Grid. That is just an example, but it is
probably the best example I can think of.</div>
					<a name="08011064000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">We did
detailed planning on well over 40 different scenarios for a particular
route to a particular site, which is the kind of guidance that we would
expect from a national policy statement, for example. It would help us
say, &#147;Don&#146;t bother with nos. 37 and 42. They are
no-hopers because the policy statement is quite clear.&#148; What we
do not want is something that says, &#147;It needs to be very
carefully considered,&#148; because I like to think that we always do
that. To the extent that it can influence the choices made by the
planners, that will be the acid
test.</div>
					<a name="08011064000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">May
I tell you what I think they should say? As I said, we are quite
neutral as an organisation. Lots of our assets are above ground and
lots are below ground; some of it is a long way from the sub-station
and some is close. As a generality, we are indifferent to those
choices. Guiding the choices in practice would be my observation. I
hope that does not seem as if I am evading the question; I am trying to
answer it effectively.</div>

						</b>
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011064000441"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> I draw from that that you would like to know from
the national policy statement the precise locations of the power
stations so that you would know the points that you are connecting. In
the jargon that we are using, you want a location-specific
policy.</div>
					<a name="08011064000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Phil
Jones:
							</b>
						</i>
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B"> </b>
						</i>Yes, if it was in a policy
statement about power stations it would definitely help. I apologise if
it is stating the obvious, but to companies like ours, the fact that
there has been an announcement today that a certain type of technology
will be encouraged is neither 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column111" />Column number: 111</div>here nor there. It could be any type of technology that requires a
connection; we would still have to put the same kind of assets in
place, it just depends on its capacity.</div>
					<a name="08011064000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Location is
definitely a key issue and so is proximity to other development. For
example, it makes a big difference to us how close is it to where
people live and how close it will be to the users of the network. If
you are talking about a national policy statement for something other
than the stations themselves&#151;perhaps for the kind of assets that
we put in the ground&#151;more specific guidance would be, &#147;We
do not like it in these circumstances, but do under those.&#148;
Basically, changing the decision of the planner would be the acid test,
and I think that is what to look out
for.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011064000442"></a>Mrs.
Lait:
						</b> Have you considered that, if it was a
location-specific statement, it is the equivalent of giving planning
permission in principle without having consulted the local community,
and hence there is the potential for conflict between the development
and the local
community?</div>

								Phil
Jones:
							</b>
						</i> We have considered it from a point of view
that is much more self-interested for the kind of business that we are,
as I guess you would expect. I do not think that a policy statement
would in any way amount to that for us. Leaving aside for a moment
whether it is true that the power stations will go there, with regard
to the infrastructure assets, which is what I am qualified to speak
about, I do not think that it would amount to that.</div>
					<a name="08011064000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a policy
statement said, &#147;We are going to put a power station
there,&#148; we would look for some common sense that said,
&#147;By the way, all that goes with it, subject to it going through
the proper process, also now needs to be tested.&#148; Right now, I
have schemes running in Yorkshire and the north-east for which
permission has already been granted for the site-specific location, as
you would describe it, but the debate about whether there can be a line
to connect it is completely and utterly separate. That is the kind of
scenario we face in reality and do not want, as schemes can be paused
for 10 or 15 years&#151;I have one that has been running longer than
I have been in the industry&#151;because we cannot get permission for
a line to something that is already permitted as the development
itself.</div>
					<a name="08011064000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Imagine the
situation where we can have all of those power stations ready to go
now. That might be excellent, but it carries no weight whatsoever in
whether the local infrastructure company can proceed, and from what I
have gathered about the statements I have read in the papers this week,
I do not think that they will be troubling us to put too many wires to
those nuclear power stations. Imagine if whoever has to do the
application can in absolutely no way whatsoever try to get some wires
to the place. You will end up with some power stations, but they will
be of absolutely no use to
anyone.</div>

							<b class="B">Tom
Brake</b> (Carshalton and Wallington) (LD): I shall come on to
the issue of infrastructure planning permission and accountability. In
your submission you mentioned how, in relation to the IPC, the
legitimate needs and concerns of local communities must be a central
consideration and that they must be effectively consulted before an
application is made. I just wonder 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column112" />Column number: 112</div>whether you have any views about consultation at the stage when the IPC
is actually considering an application, and particularly relating to
cross-examination.</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								David
Smith:
							</b>
						</i> We are of the view that community engagement
will be enhanced under the IPC. The vital role of pre-application
consultation, combined with a more holistic consent process, will
ensure better-informed and, indeed, more empowered stakeholders who can
communicate with each other more effectively than is probably the case
currently.</div>

Brake:
						</b> It was not so much the pre-application stage that I
was worried about. You have identified that it is important that the
needs and concerns of local communities are a central consideration for
the IPC, but if the Bill goes ahead, the IPC will not allow local
communities to cross-examine, for instance. Do you still feel that the
needs and concerns of local communities will be a central consideration
for the
IPC?</div>

								Phil

						</i> My company and I do not feel particularly
strongly about where that comes in the technical process of the IPC. As
far as I am concerned, it can do it when it likes. What we favour very
strongly about the whole concept of the planning commission is that, in
scenarios not dissimilar to that which I described a few moments ago,
it puts us in a situation where we would be engaging with a set of
people who would probably be quite well qualified to have those kind of
discussions. Certainly, after working at it for a while, they would
become increasingly proficient in the difficult trade-offs and dilemmas
that have to be faced when questions are being asked, such as,
&#147;Where shall we put the assets that people do not think are too
pretty?&#148;</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="08011064000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">From
our point of view, I do not think it holds any positive prospects for
us, in the sense that there is more, or less, cross-examination. What
we like about it is the measure of consistency and the opportunity to
go to a place that is proficient, expert, well resourced and set up to
do that kind of thing, and it will debate till the cows come home. Then
we would be told in one place, by people who know what they are talking
about, that we have brought a bad proposal, and to go away and come
back with something different. I do not profess to be an expert in
whether that is appropriate or otherwise, or whether it is feasible and
practical to allow that kind of cross-examination, but I certainly do
not mind it. They can do it whenever is most appropriate.</div>
					<a name="08011064000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would like
to be able to put our hand on our heart and say, &#147;This makes us
more accountable, not less.&#148; We are not trying to move the
debate into a smoke-filled room somewhere, where it is done behind
closed doors and nobody has a say. Just bring the debate on in one
place, so that we do not have to go to six different planning
authorities for different aspects of the same scheme. If somebody wants
a connection, and if it is in the national interest, and it brings with
it a whole host&#151;maybe many miles&#151;of overhead lines,
cables, substations and lots of other works, let us put it all on the
table, and let everybody who is interested in any part of it come and
challenge us. They can cross-examine us, or do it however they wish, in
our view.</div>

fine detail. Certainly, the fine detail of the inquisitorial rather
than the adversarial approach will need to be sorted out. I believe
there are some amendments down to consider allowing a single barrister
within each IPC. It is difficult for us to say. If you can go through
and have people who are professional&#151;and you need a networked
person on the IPC&#151;who understand the issues, and are able to sit
there and have a discussion rather than a legalistic bouncing backwards

						</i> More than single figures. I would not like to
pin myself to a number. I think we would be happy to be more precise of
that outside of here, but I can see what they are driving at. Quite
frankly, we drive in entirely the opposite direction. Our agenda, as
the network&#151;the Cinderella part of the organisation, as we like
to complain to everybody&#151;is that everybody always forgets about
this kind of thing. I can think of an offshore wind farm we are
considering a connection for. It is not our wind farm, but we are
considering the connection for it right now. The sub-station that we
are working on is 15 miles, I think, from where the thing would come on
shore. We would say: what is the point taking, in this case, the
IPC&#146;s time and trouble to look at the development itself, and
maybe the overhead line that connects it? We would want to lump
everything in, as I have said, and all that goes with it. Right now, we
have three or four of those being considered at any one time. We cover,
say, a fifth to a sixth of the UK land mass. There are going to be 20
or 40&#151;not 100, I would have thought, but not single
figures.</div>

						 This is on existing arrangements, by the way.
This is before you start pursing the kind of climate change objectives
that have been kicked around in the past 12 months. &#147;When we say
20 per cent. did we mean electrical energy?&#148; &#147;No, we
meant all energy.&#148; &#147;Oh, better stick to it, then.&#148;
That kind of thing. That is a massive change that is being talked about
now. Against that backdrop, I would not like to hazard a guess or stake
my professional reputation, at this point, on how many nationally
significant developments there would be. I can see the concern that
they would not want people like us trying to flash everything through
as being nationally significant, and therefore, perhaps, you 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column114" />Column number: 114</div>get back into the kind of guidance that is given, whether in the
national policy statements or otherwise, as to what is nationally
significant and what is not. Again, I would sound a real note of
caution: &#147;joined-up&#148; is a phrase that is used often about
government. Our assets are physically joined up. That is the whole
point of them. In this whole scheme of things, essential components of
a piece of infrastructure development are joined up. I do not know of
any developments that get held up because of planning where all of it
is a problem. It is nearly always one piece of the development that is
a problem. I can think of one scheme right now that has been delayed
for well north of 15 years and only 25 per cent. of the line that is
required is under contest. The local authorities and local communities
are happy with the other three quarters. I am not saying that that is
wrong&#151;the individual who is objecting has a right to do
so&#151;but years and years can drag by, not because the whole thing
is being questioned but one piece of it. We would just like the whole
thing settled; we think that the right thing is to get on and build the
infrastructure. The individual is never going to be happy with
it.</div>

per cent. is not agreed, perhaps the whole thing is not appropriate? It
is not simply a numbers game. Theoretically, if only 1 per cent. was
objected to, it is quite possible that the project should not go ahead.
When we look at these things on a more regional basis rather than
looking at them from a local authority perspective, you are moving the
decision-making process further away&#151;literally&#151;from those
who know about the area and know about that 1 per cent.</div>

						</i> Yes. So far as we have been able to tell, one
of the big question marks for us about the Bill as drafted is what
would be attached to any given proposal. Let us say that we are talking
about the scenario that I have described, where the thing at the end is
clearly material. Our question as a network company is whether you will
include all the things that go with it. I do not mean that you should
give us open season on anything in that particular set of postcodes to
do whatever we want, but you should put us through a process that can
be validated externally, which says, &#147;Is this or is this not the
marginal infrastructure that is required to put this in place?&#148;
By the way, the person who is developing the nationally significant
asset has an interest in making sure that we are not doing that,
because generally speaking they will be paying for those connection
assets. The honest truth is that I think that it will be a bigger
number than those people who are lobbying you, for sure, if we want to
hit the type of targets that we are talking about. It is just time for
some hard
choices.</div>

Betts:
						</b> Can I come on to the community
infrastructure levy? With any proposal to collect money, some
organisations will be against it. In this case, most organisations do
not appear to be absolutely against it. One or two, such as yours, are
saying, &#147;Actually, it is quite a good idea, as long as it does
not apply to us&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08011064000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are two
reasons that you advance as to why you should be exempt from the levy.
The first is that you pay through section 106 arrangements anyway, but
that is true of all developers and the interrelationship between
section 106 and the levy is one of the issues that we have explored.
Secondly, it is argued that there will not be any uplift in value on
your sites generally and therefore, because the levy is about capturing
some of that uplift in value for the public purse, you should be exempt
from it.</div>
					<a name="08011064000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, is
it not the case that there will be many types of development, not just
energy developments, where there may not be an uplift in value but they
will still have the levy applied to them? As an industry, why should
you be exempt, given that we will have applications from the transport
industry, the minerals industry and lots of other people who would want
to advance a similar case?</div>

						</i> Our position is as you reflect it; it is that
we look and say, &#147;If everybody was like us, would there be such
a thing?&#148; I take your point that it is not clear-cut; we are not
the minor exception and everybody else over here is making out.
However, I would say that &#147;never&#148; is only just too
strong; we hardly ever, if ever, harvest any of the benefits that you
rightly describe in the levy as seeking to put back into the public
purse. It does not accrue to us.</div>
					<a name="08011064000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Generally
speaking, we reduce the value of land and I facetiously said to
colleagues, &#147;Hey, if this thing is symmetrical and we can have a
pay-out every time of a share of the diminution that we have created, I
guess we would be in favour.&#148; I say that because if you put an
overhead line right across some land, it does not generally increase
the value of property in that area. Generally speaking, we end up
settling claims because of a diminution. The value that is released is
in the hotel, the retail development or whatever industrial site we are
enabling by our network assets. We have a hard time seeing how we would
ever be in pay-out mode for our
assets.</div>

of the word &#147;valuing&#148; in clause 163, which people latch
on to. When we talked to the Local 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column116" />Column number: 116</div>Government Association and to others yesterday, we heard that the
intention for the levy is that it will be developed as part of the
local development framework, which gives the development plan for the
area. That will look at the infrastructure needs that go with the
development and will lead on to how some of that infrastructure will be
funded through a levy. There is then a process of allocating that levy
across the various developments involved. Surely, there is no doubt
that your sort of developments will create infrastructure costs in an
area, so is it not reasonable that you should pay a contribution
towards
them?</div>

people in to deal with it. There are very few occasions on which we

and carry on using the wayleaves; we believe that that would be a more

level to which it is currently standard, you would say that it is not
standard. I could say political things such as that our standard is
that it is always carefully considered, that it always involves the
right people and that we always ask the right questions. However, the
honest answer is, no, we bespoke it to the situation. If we think that
it is a straightforward industrial brownfield development site, we
might not need to engage in any&#151;never mind very
much&#151;consultation. If we are undergrounding overhead lines in
the Yorkshire dales, for example, and are consulting the Association of
National Park Authorities, Friends of the Lake District and all of the
people who have pushed very hard for funding for such things, that will
be a much longer and drawn-out process. We have to consult with them
about where the vans will park when we arrive on site and so
forth.</div>
					<a name="08011064000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Generally
speaking, we bespoke the consultation to the project. Do I think that
this is something about which the industry can learn lessons going
forward? Yes, for sure. It will have to over the next 30 or 40 years.
For example, the electricity industry has probably got something to
learn from the water industry, which makes a bigger impact when it
arrives in a community wanting to do a big piece of work. The answer is
no, we do not have a standard consultation
period.</div>

have to go back to first principles and be asked to engage with an

we had dealt with the local community before it had got to that stage
would be a factor in how our considerations proceeded. Because of the
very ad hoc nature of the planning process now&#151;it depends upon
what the scheme is, where it is, how many people will be cut

						 No we are not, but that is not trying to
be unduly confrontational. We are not as confident as we would wish to
be, until, for a start, we see how that group is resourced, what levels
of expertise sit there and exactly what kind of process it will go
through. I was asking colleagues about that on the way here. I presume
that it would amount to a similar situation to the one that I am used
to in terms of network

					<a name="08011064000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we sufficiently dislike the &#147;body of experts&#148; that Ofgem
decide on, we can take them to the Competition Commission and,
ultimately, we could go to judicial review. But those are very onerous
routes for us to take as a company, so we would have to be very sure of
our ground. We say that generally, because we can scrutinise the
quality of the work of the organisation that we are dealing with. Until
we are able to look at the IPC&#151;if it is one man and a dog, then
I would say that I would be confident that they would get it wrong lots
of times and, whatever is behind it, decent-sized companies like us

it is not well
organised.</div>

have to look at how our public bodies have had their decisions
overturned. It is generally done on process, on the quality with which
they have consulted, on the type of advice that they have been able to
afford, and the quality of people they have on their teams; if the
decision is not good enough, companies like us&#151;or whoever is on
the other side&#151;get it overturned in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column118" />Column number: 118</div>end. If it is well recognised, if it is carefully thought-through, and
there has been open and transparent consultation so you can see the
rationale as it has been built up, it makes life very difficult for
people in my job who might not like the decision. When the choice is
put on your desk that says, &#147;Do you want to go to the commission
about this?&#148;&#151;in this case, the Competition
Commission&#151;you would only go there if you really think that it
would not get a lot worse for you, because obviously it could do. So,

						</i> Yes please, Chairman&#151;briefly, if I
may. I should clarify that CPRE has been campaigning and working
jointly as part of the &#147;Making Planning Better&#148; coalition
on the planning White Paper in the Bill. That coalition consists of
environmental organisations that, together, are supported, we estimate,
by more than 5 million people. CPRE considers itself one of the leading
third-party participants in the planning process at all levels through
our local groups, local volunteers, regional groups and national
office.</div>
					<a name="08011064000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">We firmly
believe that the planning system is a crucial, well-established but
undervalued part of the democratic process. It has a crucial role to
play in delivering sustainable development, and we recognise that
climate change is an important part of that agenda and a huge
challenge. We are deeply concerned, however, that the Bill could lead
to things getting worse in relation climate change, rather than better,
as some may claim. The infrastructure that the Government want to
fast-track through these new procedures includes such things as
airports, major roads, power stations that will run on fossil fuels,
and incinerators. All of those are likely to increase greenhouse gas
emissions. Renewable energy schemes are only one of the kinds of
infrastructure about which the Bill is concerned.</div>
					<a name="08011064000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are also
concerned about the treatment that the Government have given to
responses to the planning White Paper. The vast majority of the
responses that the Government received came from supporters of
coalition 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column121" />Column number: 121</div>organisations, and we are rather alarmed that, in the report on the
consultation, the Government take a dismissive attitude towards those
public concerns. In places, for example, the White Paper response
document says that there was strong support for some of the proposals
from all groups, &#147;except the public&#148;. In using that form
of words, the Government seem to be dismissing the concerns expressed
by members of the public about elements of the reform
package.</div>
					<a name="08011064000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, our
concerns revolve around three key themes. The first is the proposals
for national policy statements. We welcome, in principle, the
recognition of the need for clearer national policies and the
commitment to sustainability appraisal in relation to national policy
statements, but such statements need meaningfully to contribute to
sustainable development and to complement existing planning policy
statements, rather than supersede them. Secondly, we are concerned
about the need for the proposed infrastructure planning commission. A
far better option, we believe, would be to use existing Government
agencies to assist Ministers in making quicker decisions on
infrastructure schemes. Finally, the proposed reforms of public inquiry
procedures do not inspire confidence in ourselves or, we believe, the
public.</div>

							<a name="08011064000472"></a>Mrs.

						</b> Good afternoon, gentlemen. You talked latterly about
the national policy statements. You were very brief on the subject, and
I just wondered whether you had any views about what they should and
should not encompass. As you may have heard, we have had evidence that
the ENA would like to have all the substations included in them and
others wanted all the ancillary roads included. Would you be looking
for NPSs that went into that level of
detail?</div>

							<i class="I">
								<b class="B">Sinden:</b>
							</i>
						
						<b class="B"> </b>First, to come back to
the point that I made in my opening remarks, we need to look at the
national policy statements in the context of the existing suite of
planning policy statements. It is important to recognise that we have
more than 20 PPSs, which already set out national policy considerations
on a wide range of issues&#151;not only infrastructure, but issues of
environmental quality, housing delivery and so on. In terms of the
content of national policy statements, we would like to see the
Government using the framework provided by the existing suite of PPSs
and to develop that. As I say, they should be seen as a complement to
existing PPSs, rather than as a substitute for them.</div>
					<a name="08011064000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of
the specific issues of content, we believe that national policy
statements in general should address very fully and thoroughly the
question of need in relation to certain kinds of infrastructure. They
should look very carefully at alternative ways of meeting the needs
that are identified in relation to energy supply and so on. As part of
that process, they should look at issues to do with demand
reduction&#151;at ways in which needs and demands can be reduced. In
relation to energy, for example, we would have better promotion of
energy efficiency and so
on.</div>
					<a name="08011064000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
believe that in very few cases, if any, should national policy
statements be site-specific. However, we would draw a distinction
between site specificity and locational specificity. In relation to
sites, we have deep concerns that the national policy statements go too
far down the road of identifying particular sites for particular kinds
of infrastructure. We are slightly less exercised 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column122" />Column number: 122</div>about national policy statements setting down locational criteria that
should guide decisions on the siting of specific
schemes.</div>
				
					<a name="08011064000404"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45
pm</div>
					<a name="08011064000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
final point on this question is that the national policy statements
should seek to embrace a wide range of considerations and give guidance
to the decision-making body, whoever that may be, on the kind of weight
to be attached to a wide range of economic and environmental
considerations relating to particular forms of infrastructure, rather
than dictating or determining the weight that should be attached to
specific considerations. Fundamentally, we believe that it is very
difficult, if not impossible, to separate considerations of national
policy need from considerations of the impacts that a particular scheme
will have on a particular site. It is vital that the inquiry process,
whatever that may be, is not constrained to the extent that full and
proper consideration cannot be given to those locational and
site-specific
considerations.</div>

the consultation process to which an NPS should be subject. Do you have
any more extensive thoughts on how that should be accomplished,

						</i> We are very interested to see what Parliament
decides on the remit and the role of Select Committees in examining
draft national policy statements. We believe that Select Committee
investigations into draft statements could very usefully identify no-go
areas in terms of a degree of site-specificity that would be
unjustified for a draft national policy statement. A Select Committee
investigation could highlight areas where the commission, or any
decision-making body that we may see given responsibility for decisions
on these schemes, might test and cross-examine particular pieces of
evidence at the inquiry level. We would also want the Select Committee
to consider very carefully the extent to which the Government have
adequately appraised draft national policy statements from the point of
view of sustainable development. It is important that that process is
transparent and can be tested, probed and judged by Select Committees
looking at draft national policy statements.</div>

have to
consider.</div>

						</i> That is an interesting question. It may be
too much to ask of a Select Committee to be driving that process, and
possibly inappropriate in the light of these statements being
Government documents. But I think it should be seen potentially as a
critical part of that consultation process, a sort of testing of the
robustness of the evidence that is being brought to bear on questions 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column123" />Column number: 123</div>of need, for example, and testing the degree and appropriateness of
locational specificity and so on and so forth and, indeed, testing the
robustness of any sustainability appraisal that accompanies a national
policy statement. So it would be a critical part of the process, but
probably not driving
it.</div>

						</b> Can I take you through one or two of the points you
raised in your evidence? First, you said that you welcome the concept
of the national policy statements, but you do not want them to be
accorded greater weight than existing PPSs and PPGs. In particular, you
drew attention to PPG2 on the green belt and PPS7 on nationally
designated landscapes. In the end, must not one document take
precedence over the others? Otherwise there will be conflict between a
policy statement and PPSs&#151;planning statements&#151;or planning
guidance? If there is that degree of conflict, the commission must know
which is the priority
statement.</div>
					<a name="08011064000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Neil
Sinden:
							</b>
						</i> If I may, I will start on this and then hand
over to my colleague. This is an important question, which comes back
to my original comment about the relationship between national policy
statements and existing PPSs. To some extent, of course, national
policy statements concerning particular kinds of infrastructure will
need to be much more explicit and deterministic about questions of need
and location, and so on. But in so doing, they will need fully to take
account of existing national planning policy principles set out in
PPSs.</div>
					<a name="08011064000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
that the decision-making authority needs, to some extent, to play a
role in balancing the weight of consideration to be given to different
statements of national policy. For example, in relation to green belts
or protected areas such as national parks, weight should still be
accorded to the national policy considerations set out in PPS7 and PPG2
alongside the national policy statement on a particular kind of
infrastructure.</div>
					<a name="08011064000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Paul
Miner:
							</b>
						</i> In the planning process at present there is a
well-established formula that has been around since 1990, that
decisions shall be taken in line with the development plan unless
material considerations dictate otherwise. We think that such a formula
should be used in these cases as well. As you mentioned, in the last
sitting the RTPI gave evidence to that effect, saying that PPSs and
development plans should be relevant considerations. If you start
saying that national policy statements can be primary considerations,
you will have a two-tier planning system, with some levels of policy
having more weight than others, which will be very
confusing.</div>

important national policy principles set out in the current suite of

other environmental organisations.</div>

							<a name="08011064000477"></a>Mr.
Betts:
						</b>. One of the issues you raised&#151;some of us
have a degree of sympathy with you on it&#151;is that the Secretary
of State should be the responsible decision-maker in all cases. When
some of us have put that argument before, we have been told that all
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column124" />Column number: 124</div>Secretary of State does is to act in a quasi-judicial role, not in a
political role, therefore there is no need for a politician to get
involved. Why are you so concerned, therefore, about the removal of the
Secretary of State&#146;s role in these
matters?</div>
					<a name="08011064000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Neil
Sinden:
							</b>
						</i> This is a fundamental issue of principle for
us. You have heard evidence from previous witnesses that suggests that
there is a big gap, or issue, to be addressed in relation to the
opportunities for third parties&#151;or, indeed, first
parties&#151;to appeal against or to probe decisions or
recommendations made by the proposed new commission. At the moment, the
system is that the Planning Inspectorate, in many but not all cases,
prepares reports for Ministers, with a recommended decision. Ministers
then take on those reports and consider the recommendations in the
light of wider factors.</div>
					<a name="08011064000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">That system
contains enough checks and balances for wider considerations concerning
domestic or international law, for example&#151;which the IPC
possibly does not have the expertise to take into account adequately or
to address&#151;to be considered by a Minister. It allows third
parties and other interests better to inform the way in which a
Minister considers a report by the commission or, as is currently the
case, by the Planning Inspectorate.</div>
					<a name="08011064000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">A lot can
hide behind the phrase &#147;quasi-judicial&#148; but fundamentally
we believe that the decisions on some of the big infrastructure schemes
are inevitably hugely controversial and require a degree of political
judgment in weighing up the very wide range of issues that are often
entailed in consideration of these schemes. They are not only
exclusively technical issues or issues of science or the weight of
evidence; in many cases, they are political judgments, which we think
can effectively be made only by elected
politicians.</div>

						</i> May I point you to the example of the
Competition Commission? One of the bodies that it replaced was the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which had a very wide remit to
consider competition policy in relation to wider issues of public
interest. Since the creation of the Competition Commission, its remit
has been narrowed to focus very stringently on competition policy
issues and on making recommendations to Ministers. In the Competition
Commission&#146;s 2006 annual report, the chairman said that it is
far better for issues of public interest to be considered by Ministers
than by bodies such as ours. That is a very relevant comparison because
if you look at how the IPC is to be constituted, its structure with a
panel, commissioners and such like, strongly suggests that it will be
an advisory body like the Competition
Commission.</div>

between PPSs and NPSs. At the moment, we have a number of planning
policy statements that address&#151;perhaps inadequately from the
point of view of the wildlife trusts, the Campaign to Protect Rural
England and other environmental groups&#151;a wide range of
environmental factors. There is one on nature conservation, one on
countryside and protected areas, and so on. If the relationship between
NPSs and PPSs is one of equality or complementarity, there might be no
need for a national policy statement on the natural environment.
However, if there is a clear hierarchical relationship and a sense that
the national policy statements relating to particular kinds of
infrastructure are trumping the national policy considerations set out
in PPSs at the moment, we would support the call of the wildlife trusts
for a national policy statement that gives full and proper weight to
environmental
considerations.</div>

concerned about how they will work in practice, particularly the
relationship between the levy and section 106 agreements, and
specifically in the area of affordable housing provision. I am sure
that Members are aware that, at present, a significant proportion of
such provision comes through section 106 agreements on the ground. They
are a useful complement to Government subsidies for affordable housing

danger with the community infrastructure levy, regardless of where it

geographical disparities in development pressures and the need for
infrastructure and such things as affordable housing. We probably need
to give this further thought, but, basically, we feel that
redistribution of a levy generated through development should be,
first, through 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column127" />Column number: 127</div>the local authority development plan. Policies should be clearly set out
in the plan&#151;the local development framework, as it is currently
termed&#151;which clarify how a local authority would apply funds
generated through a levy across its area and, in so doing, promote a
degree of redistribution of funds so that the needs of under-resourced
areas could be met. A similar level of geographical redistribution
could take place through the establishment of policies at the regional
level through regional spatial strategies. I suppose that we would want
a plan-led approach to the question that you

merit in that proposal. We welcome the Government&#146;s recognition
of the need to increase the institutional capacity for decisions on
major infrastructure. It is just that we do not believe that that
institutional capacity should come from the establishment of a new
body. We believe that the Planning Inspectorate would be well suited to
having a division set up within it to deal with major infrastructure
projects, which could be resourced and staffed by experienced senior
planning inspectors and staff, and would achieve many of the
Government&#146;s aspirations with regard to speeding up decisions in
an appropriate manner. However, on a matter of principle we have a

proposed IPC has a significant range of functions in relation to
producing guidance, giving advice, monitoring the quality of

planning application at the end of it. Again, the way it has been set
up suggests an investigative body like the Competition Commission. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column128" />Column number: 128</div>If the IPC was purely focused on investigation and on making reports and

many of you will be aware, we have been here before. The Town and
Country Planning Act 1990 provides for a planning inquiry commission
procedure, which would be a two-stage procedure with the national
policy issues debated at an inquiry at the first stage and the
site-specific issues debated at the second. That commission procedure
has never been used because in 1986 the Government responded to a
Select Committee inquiry by saying that it is impossible to untangle
general national policy issues from site-specific environmental
impacts. Bob Woolf also said in 1985 that the Minister is entitled to
have a policy, but must always be prepared to derogate from it in

includes a power that enables the Secretary of State to call in a
decision for his own determination if the policies in the national
policy statement have changed materially since they were produced and
that change was not anticipated at the time. We think that the power
needs to be much wider and should cover all matters of controversy at

welcome the chance for this evidence session before we get into

achieve our policy purposes, and in getting the strongest possible
support or assent for our proposals. I know, of course, that not
everyone will agree with everything that we propose in the Bill. That
is inevitable. I will not go into detail, but I hope that the way that

I referred to our policy purpose, I had this in mind: we are facing
far-reaching and long-term challenges in this country at present.
Several of the witnesses who have come before us in the past two days
have mentioned the need to replace about one third of our electricity
generation capacity in the next 25 years or so. That is more
electricity than is needed to power probably at least two thirds of the
homes in this country. Of course, there is also the need to ensure that
we have much more secure energy supplies. Some have also mentioned the
need to see new and renewed infrastructure for transport, waste and
water. Others, not least the environmental groups, have emphasised the
need to transform what is a successful economy in Britain into a
successful low-carbon
economy.</div>
					<a name="08011064000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Big
decisions will be involved as part of those challenges, some of which

that we plan to take. The framework in the Bill gives us the provision
that we require to introduce such a levy. Were any amendments to what

largely be technical or clarifying or to ensure that we have a working

what has been published today&#151;the decision was set out in a
White Paper&#151;would make it clear that there are two essential
steps in relation to national policy statements that will have to be
completed first, as an element of the work that the Government are
proposing today: first, the completion of a strategic siting
assessment, which we do not anticipate being completed until perhaps
autumn next year. The second is a strategic environmental assessment.

are also clear provisions and rights, particularly for those who are

members of organisations who had come together in the early days,

some of the inquiry processes at the moment. What this emphatically
does not do is rule out cross-examination, but it does start with the
predisposition to see a different approach to the probing and
interrogation of evidence and views. That approach is principally led
by the IPC and its members, not by expensive hired hands and third
parties who perhaps have the resources and some interest in stringing
out the proceedings, rather than getting to the heart of the

Cross-examination is a particular form of oral evidence, but the
Secretary of State was of course right: within the Bill there is a
right for those who register the wish to do so to be able to give oral
evidence in an open session, and where the IPC has sessions that look
at specific issues, it will be possible for those with an interest and
a wish to do so also to give evidence orally at that
point.</div>

too many regimes under which schemes are decided. This is the same
question that I asked a previous witness. If we have national policy

have a new body to do that? Why cannot we look at existing means of
deciding on those applications?</div>

						</i> First, it is important not to overlook how
radical and important an innovation national policy statements will be.
They have been described in various terms, but by several of our
witnesses in a way consistent with that argument. Any body that is set
up to hear major applications in the context of national policy
statements, and which would provide a principle primary source of
reference for the matters that need to be taken into account, would
require primary legislation. We have set out the arguments why we
believe that there is a strong case for setting up the IPC and for
doing so on basis that will make it independent and that will make it a
body taking decisions within the framework set principally by national
policy statements, which will have the authority of being developed
through a systematic process of public consultation, having been
scrutinised strongly and systematically in Parliament. The combination
of the national policy statements and the IPC gives us the fundamentals
for the sort of reform of the planning system that I spoke about in my
opening
statement.</div>

						</b> I have heard their argument for national policy
statements, but still do not feel that I have heard an argument for the
IPC, other than it will take decisions so that Ministers will not have
to. What is the real justification for the decision having to rest with
an unelected
body?</div>
				
					<a name="08011064000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								John
Healey:
							</b>
						</i> If your contention is that Ministers and not
members of the IPC on an independent basis should take such decisions,
I have two things to say. First, one of our objectives has been to try
to establish a system in which the roles and accountability for the
discharge of those roles is much clearer. At the heart of the
proposition for the IPC, therefore, is the idea of separating the
responsibility for policy making, which rightly should be with
Ministers and will be captured and set out in national policy
statements, from the process of taking decisions on specific
applications within that framework. At present, it is the case that in
some circumstances for some major projects, Ministers are acting as the
source of the policy&#151;the promoters, in effect&#151;of the
individual applications and the authority that makes the decision on
those applications. That is particularly true in areas of transport
such as highways. In my view, that is an unsatisfactory situation. This
gives us a chance to make that clearer and
stronger.</div>
					<a name="08011064000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second reason is this. I have been struck by the observations of a
number of witnesses whom we have heard over the last couple of
days&#151;and it is largely a misapprehension&#151;about the
accountability of Ministers in acting in the planning capacity. It has
been acknowledged&#151;quite rightly, because this is what
happens&#151;that Ministers who take planning decisions do so in a
quasi-judicial fashion. Essentially, that means that the basis and the
terms on which they do so are tightly prescribed by planning
legislation. Ultimately, when one is concerned about accountability,
that means that were I as a Minister to take a planning decision, I
would not be accountable as a politician to Parliament, and I would not
be accountable to Members of this House or this Committee for that
decision; I would be accountable and challengeable through the courts
to a judge. That is the reality of the decision-taking role of
Ministers within the planning
system.</div>

Networks Association was very interesting, Mr. Rogerson; it
managed to smoke out the fact that the proposals in this system will be
a change and improvement on what is currently the established practice
within such companies. What is interesting is this: there will be a
pre-application process, which is not simply set out in significant
terms within the Bill, but will be overseen by the IPC. In other words,
what a developer must do in preparing an application, even before he
gets to the point of submitting it to the IPC, can be set out not just
as a reflection of the Bill but in guidance from Government and from
the IPC. It will require that developer to consult locally. It will
require him to consult with certain statutory consultees. It will allow
the IPC to set standards and specific things that it will require as
part of the preparation of his application. It will enable the IPC to
send back any proposed application if it does not believe that the
developer has met that, and it will allow the statutory consultees,
including local authorities and others, to make submissions to the IPC
if they do not believe that the developer has undertaken his duties
properly, including on the consultation, before submitting the
application. The IPC will then be obliged to take those into
account.</div>

						</i> There are two elements to your concern: one
specifically about climate change and one about sustainability and the
environment. On climate change generally, I said in my opening remarks
that the Bill is being introduced alongside the energy Bill and the
Climate Change Bill as a set of three pieces of legislation this
Session that try to help us deal with some long-term and far-reaching
challenges. The Climate Change Bill includes the legally specified
target for Government. In other words, it will start to fashion an
overarching 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column137" />Column number: 137</div>concern, in everything that Government do, for the reduction of
emissions by at least 60 per cent. by 2050. The imperative and the
pressure on climate change will be built into the decisions and the
work of Government from that point on. It will therefore be an
important part of the context for the preparation of any national
policy
statement.</div>
					<a name="08011064000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
national policy statements, as several of the witnesses have
mentioned&#151;I think that you, Mr. Brake, would
recognise that we have made it clear in the Bill, and these provisions
have been strengthened since the White Paper&#151;in preparing a
national policy statement of whatever type, Ministers will be under an
obligation to do so with sustainable development in mind. That will
require an assessment of sustainability, including on the environment,
as part and parcel of the preparation of the policy statement. That
assessment will build the concern and the duty to take account of
sustainable development into the national policy statements. I have
described the national policy statement as the framework within which
the IPC will make any decisions. In that way, we can ensure that
concerns about sustainable development are built into the judgments
that the IPC will make on any
application.</div>

required for a national policy statement, under the European directive,
it will have one. It is not entirely clear that that directive will be
applicable to all of the potential national policy statements that the
Government may produce. John Hutton this afternoon confirmed, and I
mentioned earlier, that whether or not a strategic environmental
assessment is required, it will be an element of what we do in relation
to nuclear. Whether or not a strategic environmental assessment is
required, we will ensure that there is a duty on Ministers about
sustainable development in every

spent two days listening to the witnesses, one of the things that I
cannot get my head around, and I would be grateful if the Minister
could give me an indication of this, is roughly how many national
policy statements he expects in total? What does he expect them to
cover, because we have heard representatives from ports and harbours
say that they want ancillary roads and railways, and we have heard the
Energy Networks Association saying that they want all their substations
to be included? What sort of scope should be included? What time scale
does the Minister reckon it could take each policy statement to get
through both the outside consultation process and whatever process he
is planning to invite Parliament to undertake? How will he create
consistency? I have a list of
questions.</div>

						</i> I have lost count of the number of questions
there, Mrs. Lait, but let me try to
reply.</div>
					<a name="08011064000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
regard to scope, the short answer is that we set out much of this
alongside the statement in November, and it is worth referring to that
if you have not got it in front of you. The scope will include things
such as waste, offshore renewables, water infrastructure, transport and
aspects of
energy.</div>
					<a name="08011064000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
regards timing, it will vary from policy area to policy area. It will
be different because the considerations are different for nuclear, for
instance, as they would be for ports infrastructure. In terms of the
process for Parliament, there are four points to make. First, for the
first time there will be wide consultation and debate in the production
of these policy statements, and a requirement on Ministers to ensure
that that
happens.</div>
					<a name="08011064000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
we are proposing to the House&#151;although it will be a matter for
the House to make its decision, of course&#151;that we draw on the
joint expertise of four Select Committees: the Business Enterprise and
Regulatory Reform Committee, the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
Committee, the Transport Committee, and the Communities and Local
Government Committee. I hope shortly, with the Leader of the House, to
meet the Chairs of the Committees. There is, after all, a precedent for
this with the Quadripartite Committee on arms
control.</div>
					<a name="08011064000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly,
that Select Committee, or the arrangements that Parliament puts in
place, will have the scope, as closely as they wish and in the manner
that they wish, to scrutinise and comment on the proposals, and we will
then take them into consideration in the finalisation of our national
policy statement.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column139" />Column number: 139</div>
					<a name="08011064000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, we
have made it very clear, in parliamentary terms, that if the Select
Committee&#151;let us call it that for the moment&#151;believes
that the matters are important enough to require parliamentary debate,
we will make time for that. Of course, there is also the option for
Parliament to decide to move to votes if it wishes to do so. I hope
that that covers the main points of your questions. You obviously have
more.</div>

						</i> I am not sure that it is particularly
relevant or useful to have a fixed number. If you look at the energy
field, which is perhaps one of the most important and multi-faceted, we
have said that in 2009 we would look to be producing an overarching
national policy statement. That would consider things like security of
supply, climate change imperatives, energy markets, and some questions
about demand projections and energy efficiency. This is why I cannot
give you a fixed answer, because in the end it will be a decision not
for now or for me but for down the track in respect of either
separate national policy statements or&#151;although I do not really
like the word&#151;a suite of technical annexes. It is plausible and
reasonable to anticipate policy statements that will look at different
forms of energy generation, from renewables to fossil fuels, to annexes
or to a separate policy statement on electricity networks or gas
infrastructure. That is another reason why it is difficult to give you
a precise
answer.</div>

						</b> So given that Mr. Hutton, in his answer
to me during his statement on the energy policy, said that he was
working on a national policy statement on nuclear power and that you
are saying that you expect an overarching national policy
statement&#151;I assume in draft&#151;in 2009, who is preceding
whom? If the Government are trying to get their first nuclear power
station built by 2020, given the difficulties in so doing, I cannot get
my head around whether we will have the nuclear statement separate and
free-standing or as a subset of the one coming out in 2009, or
subsequent to it. If it is going to be subsequent to it, why are the
Government working on one that is specifically site locational, as
Mr. Hutton told me, on nuclear power? To summarise, we are
already seeing inconsistency in the Government&#146;s
approach.</div>

						</i> Perhaps I am being a little slow. I am not
really grasping your concern about inconsistency or uncertainty about
timing. I was quite clear earlier&#151;as John Hutton was&#151;that
one of the building blocks before a nuclear national policy statement
could be drawn up would be the strategic siting assessment. That is
likely, as things stand at the moment, to be completed in autumn 2009.
As we said, alongside the ministerial statement in November, and as I
said about four minutes ago, in 2009 we anticipate a broad, overarching
national policy statement on energy, encompassing some of the elements
that I have mentioned. In terms of timing, it is reasonable to conclude
that one could expect a broad national approach in a national policy
statement that attempted to deal with that and then, subsequently, when
the other elements essential to nuclear were in a fit state, to follow
up with one on nuclear.</div>

						</i> The Bill provides for a fundamental
requirement to consult on national policy statements. In reality, the
nature and character of the policy statements is going to vary quite a
lot. Some may be relatively technical in nature, and some may be fairly
substantive and raise bigger policy issues. The precise nature of the
consultation process that you would need to ensure the right level of
engagement will vary from national policy statement to national policy
statement. One thing that we have indicated in the Bill is that, where
they are locationally specific, there will also be an absolute
requirement for particular consultation with affected communities. That
is a
given.</div>

to properly engage communities and will need to be extensive to ensure
that it allows the level of debate and scrutiny that is

						 There must be some misunderstanding. We have
not set out a detailed timescale for when consultation will begin on
the national policy statements because the relevant Departments that
will need to produce them are still deciding. Some things have been
indicated&#151;for example, in relation to the strategic site
assessment, which is a building block in relation to the nuclear policy
statement. In practice, the Departments intend to move towards the
consultation on national policy statements sooner, where it is possible
to do so. One area in which it might be possible to begin the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column141" />Column number: 141</div>consultation this year rather than next is that of ports, where
substantial work has already been done on the policy that will inform

development. That will include Welsh local authorities, as we have been
discussing with the Welsh Assembly. As part of clause 164 we have also
included the ability to empower Welsh Ministers also to be a charging
authority, but we are clear that this is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column143" />Column number: 143</div>about local authorities being able to raise revenue. There is a wider
debate about how we deal with sub-regional and regional infrastructure
requirements. We are still talking about that to stakeholders,
including the Local Government Association and to the Welsh Assembly.
We have included it at this stage because, as I said at the beginning,
we want the flexibility to work with stakeholders in some detail on the
provisions that will then be in the regulations. We have not taken
final decisions in this area.</div>

Betts:
						</b> The degree of support that was shown in evidence
for the community infrastructure levy was quite interesting. It is
supported not merely by those who will collect it, the local
authorities, and those who are advising on it, the planning
professionals, but by those who will have to pay it. On Tuesday, it was
quite interesting to listen to the British Property Federation and the
Home Builders Federation enthusiastically endorsing a levy that their
members will have to pay.</div>
					<a name="08011064000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">Recognising
the general support for it, I wonder if you had time to reflect on the
issue that gave them collective cause for concern: the reference in
clause 166 to the increase in value as a way in which the levy might be
calculated. More particularly&#151;this came out almost by default
from the evidence that we heard today from the Energy Networks
Association&#151;clause 163 states that the primary purpose of the
levy is</div>
					<a name="08011064000397"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to ensure that
the costs incurred in providing infrastructure to support the
development of an area can be funded...by owners of land the value
of which increases.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011064000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
argument there is, &#147;Well, our land has not increased in value
and we do not assume that it will from the development, and therefore
we should be exempt from the levy.&#148; There is a possibility that
that basic requirement in clause 163 could lead to judicial review
challenges by some people. Have you had a chance to reflect on those
issues and whether there is a need for a revision of the wording of the
Bill?</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								John
Healey:
							</b>
						</i> I have and I shall also ask Yvette to come in
on this. In our view the reference and the element of value is a useful
part of the provision that we are making. As the Minister for nearly
three years with responsibility for development work on the planning
gain supplement at the Treasury, I was very struck, as you were
Mr. Betts, by the range of support for the community
infrastructure levy among the witnesses here, and encouraged by it
too.</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Yvette
Cooper:
							</b>
						</i> On the issue of value, we hope to make this
clear in the further detail that we will publish about our approach to
the community infrastructure levy. Where this is very different from
the planning gain supplement approach is that the planning gain
supplement was an attempt effectively to have a valuation of each piece
of land and the increase in value of each piece of land according to
the planning permission being granted. The conclusion that we have come
to is that we recognise the concerns that have been raised about the
difficulties in getting that kind of valuation on each piece of land,
and so the community infrastructure levy should not take that
approach.</div>
					<a name="08011064000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">The approach
is therefore not to try to assess the value of every single piece of
land. However, we think that when the community infrastructure levy is
set, it  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column145" />Column number: 145</div>should be able to take account of land value. It also needs to be able
to take account of infrastructure needs. It needs to be based within
the planning process around the appropriate infrastructure needs in
that area over the long term. But it also needs to take account of
viability across the area.</div>
					<a name="08011064000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the community infrastructure levy were set too high, it would prevent a
lot of important development from going ahead. So issues around land
value and broader assessments around increases in planning gain are the
kinds of things that would need to be taken into account by a local
authority when assessing what the community infrastructure levy should
be across the area as a whole. They might also be something that you
would expect the local authority to take into account.</div>
					<a name="08011064000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
us suppose that it wanted to be able to say that a particular urban
extension, for example, should have a higher rate of community
infrastructure levy&#151;perhaps it was a greenfield urban extension
or something like that. Again you might want to be able to include
value as part of the consideration of what the overall levy should be.
We are talking about value in the context of setting the levy as a
whole, which would then apply across areas, as opposed to the planning
gain supplement approach, which was to consider the value increase on
every individual piece of
land.</div>

							<a name="08011064000548"></a>Mr.
Betts:
						</b> I do not think that it is absolutely clear in the
Bill. We may want to return to that. I still think that there is a
danger that clause 163, as currently drafted, could lead to individual
owners of pieces of land that are developed arguing that they are
exempt from it. We have to be a bit concerned about that. I also think
that in terms of your urban extension, you might easily cover the
difference between that area and another area by simply putting the
word &#147;locality&#148; somewhere into clause 166. I think that
that was the original proposal from the British Property Federation and
the Home Builders Federation when they came forward with their
proposals.</div>

								Yvette
Cooper:

						</i> But what is it that is significant about one
locality rather than another? One of the things that is significant
about one locality rather than another will be around the land values
in that area. To be unable to take account of land values in the
setting of the levy would be to take a risk with viability. The key
issue here is being able to think about what the appropriate level of
the levy should be in order to ensure that it supports development,
housing growth and economic growth, and to make sure that development
in the area is viable.</div>
					<a name="08011064000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
order to have an assessment of what is viable in that area, one of the
things that you need to take into account is broad assessments of land
value. That is a very different approach from looking at valuations on
individual pieces of land or saying that individual pieces of land,
according to valuation, would not therefore be covered by the levy. The
approach is to look at the levy-setting across the area as a whole. As
I said, we are keen to set out further detail and hopefully to clarify
that for the Committee. But this is very different. The local planning
authorities are looking at setting a charge across an area as a whole
and they need to take viability into account. They are not looking to
assess the value on every individual site that will come
forward.</div>

draft order for Committee scrutiny and then lay an order for approval.

						 The sorts of primary legislation that we
envisage the IPC needing to amend to discharge its primary function of
allowing the development consent are primarily private Acts of
Parliament in relation to transport projects, many of which are
ancient. They will be about byways and other provisions. The Bill also
includes provision so that when the IPC exercises those powers, a
Secretary of State can ensure that it does so in a way that is
compliant with the European convention on human rights and other legal
obligations. It is not a swinging power to amend all legislation. It is

the delay caused by the planning process, which we all want to do
something about. Minister, you have seen evidence submitted by the
various witnesses that suggests that, in fact, a good deal of the delay
is not occasioned by the prolongation of hearings by third parties or
their representatives, but either by inadequate preparation by the
applicants to start with, which was the case at terminal 5, or by the
lengthy time taken within your own Department&#151;about eight and a

</div>
					<a name="08011064000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
and by way of providing some reassurance I hope, at no point will the
IPC decision on any application be taken by a single person. Even where
there may be some cases that are heard by a single member of the

IPC council, which will have between five and nine members.</div>
					<a name="08011064000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, it
is not just a question of speed. If one thinks about some of the most
complex, major inquiries, we were in a situation with the terminal 5
inquiry, for example, where Hillingdon council played an important part
in ensuring that the views and concerns of its local residents were
registered as part of that process, but it had to withdraw because it
had exhausted its funds to be able to do so. In a situation such as
that, simply tinkering with the timing rules of the existing system
frankly will not do in order to put in place a planning system that can
play its part in meeting some of those very big challenges and in
helping to make some of the really difficult decisions that we face
more broadly, which I referred to earlier.</div>

						</i> Sir John, this is a theme that Mr.
Neill has been pursuing all week. Just to be clear, if I may, this Bill
does not abolish the right to cross-examination nor the practice of
cross-examination. What it does is to set out a way of proceeding for
the IPC that aims to probe, test and assess the evidence through direct
questions rather than through cross-examination, particularly the
hiring of expensive third hands, as I mentioned earlier. However,
exceptionally&#151;where it is necessary&#151;if either the
adequate testing of any representations or the representation of
interested parties requires that type of cross-examination, there is
provision in clause 85 for that to happen, and that can be secured at
the discretion and decision of the commission.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column151" />Column number: 151</div>

you will also have heard them express some concern about devolved
planning applications that could slow the process. Some concerns were
expressed about that, not just on cost but about the security of
supply. Call me a cynic, but when organisations such as the CBI express
concern, that usually means either disinvestment or job losses, which
gives us cause for concern. Where planning applications are devolved,
please do not give up on your northern comrades. Reassure us and the

not a Bill in which it is appropriate to change or reopen the
devolution settlement. As you rightly say, planning is a devolved
matter, but aspects such as air transport policy or energy policy are
not. It would be a great shame and it would serve Scotland and the
people of Scotland badly if the exercise of the devolved functions in

otherwise appropriately look to Scotland did not come to Scotland

						</i> It is clearly important to ensure that the
levy supports development and does not deter it. Its whole purpose is
to raise additional resources on top of what is raised currently
through section 106 in order to fund the additional infrastructure we
need. We believe that there is significant additional planning gain
that can be tapped in that way, without deterring development, and one
of the strongest pieces of evidence supporting that is the fact that,
according to one piece of research, only 14 per cent. of planning
permissions for housing had a section 106 attached. Obviously, that is
not 14 per cent. of houses built because that will cover the largest
planning permissions granted and does not take account of the fact that
some planning permissions are granted but the houses are never
built.</div>
					<a name="08011064000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">We recognise
that, but nevertheless it is certainly clear that a lot of medium and
smaller-sized developments do not contribute anything to infrastructure
of affordable housing at the moment, and it is right that we should be

those smaller developments on infrastructure, and be
able to tap some of those resources for infrastructure
too.</div>
					<a name="08011064000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe,
therefore, that it is possible to raise additional resources without
deterring development. You are of course right that, if the levy is set
too high, it could deter development and become a problem, so it is
important to take account of that as part of the regulations and
guidance and ensure that there is a process in place 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column153" />Column number: 153</div>to set the community infrastructure levy at the right level. That will

						</i> Let us deal first with clause 167. Again,
this is about enabling regulations. As we have set out before, we want
to have further consultation before we draw up the regulations and
those regulations will be consulted on in extensive detail in draft as
well. The principle that this is getting at is that there may well be
areas where, for example, a piece of infrastructure needs to be
provided up front and where a series of developments that take place
over time ought to contribute to that infrastructure because they will
all benefit from it. It might be appropriate for various agencies to
borrow or provide additional funding in advance to get the
infrastructure in place. However, as the development will start at a
later date, it will contribute towards the infrastructure through the
community infrastructure levy. A similar principle has been adopted as
part of the Milton Keynes tariff approach, where some of the funding is
being provided up front by English Partnerships and others, but is
being effectively reimbursed as the development takes
place.</div>
					<a name="08011064000385"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is an important issue behind your question about the need to ensure
that this process is supporting infrastructure additional to that
provided by mainstream budgets and funding. We must recognise that some
of the things that it will contribute towards will also need mainstream
budget funding. There will be some pieces of infrastructure that will
get funding from not only a community infrastructure levy, but from the
Highways Agency or other budgets. It is important to have that
flexibility in order to get the infrastructure in place on
time.</div>
					<a name="08011064000386"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
regard to your second question about the charging authorities, we are
providing flexibility, which we can discuss further, as part of the
establishment of the regulations. Currently, there are bodies that can
collect 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column155" />Column number: 155</div>section 106 agreements as part of their planning work. We want to look
further at the range of bodies that need to be involved in setting the
levy.</div>
					<a name="08011064000387"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
envisage this primarily as a local authority-driven process, but there
is a wide debate about how to deal with sub-regional and regional
infrastructure requirements. For example, junction 30 of the M25 will
have an impact on south Essex and part of the Thames Gateway and will
have an impact across local authority boundaries. Crossrail is a
classic example of a piece of infrastructure that will have an impact
across local authority boundaries. We want to have further discussions
about how those arrangements should
work.</div>
					<a name="08011064000388"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
example of that is the south-east councils that, through the South East
England regional assembly, put forward a proposal for a regional
infrastructure fund, which they wanted to be funded by our affordable 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column156" />Column number: 156</div>housing pot. We did not think that that was an appropriate source of
funds because that money should go towards affordable housing.
Nevertheless, they wanted to work together to have a regional
infrastructure fund so that they could look at some of their strategic
infrastructure issues across the region as a
whole.</div>
					<a name="08011064000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have not taken any final decisions on how to support such arrangements.
We want to have flexibility in how we can deal with them. I cannot give
you a definitive list of all the bodies that might be involved, but I
am very happy to have further discussions on how it should work so that
it can work as effectively as
possible.</div>
