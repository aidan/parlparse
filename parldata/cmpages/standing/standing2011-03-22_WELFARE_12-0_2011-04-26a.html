from where we left off, but I am sure that hon. Members will remind me
if I fail to address the issues that we were discussing before lunch.
We were looking at the potential for target setting in the number of
sanctions imposed by Jobcentre Plus. We accept that we do not have
evidence that Ministers have set any targets for the number of
sanctions to be imposed, but we have demonstrated that some Jobcentre
Plus offices have interpreted that that is what went with the grain of
Ministers’ intentions. I think that there is broad agreement
that some of the behaviours in Jobcentre Plus offices in recent months
are, as the hon. Member for Battersea has pointed out, issues to do
with performance management and the way in which discretion and
decision making are
applied.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000021">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
tone that has been set has given rise to this situation. As I said this
morning, its context is the benchmarking approach undertaken by
Jobcentre Plus since at least the end of last year, according to the
written answer I received from the agency’s chief executive.
That has raised the concern in our minds that some Jobcentre Plus staff
feel that, if they do not come close to or within those benchmarks,
that will bring their approach to sanctioning into question, and that
may well have dictated some of the behaviours that we have
seen.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000022">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
practice, we can see the way in which this is playing out in the kinds
of behaviours being displayed by Jobcentre Plus advisers. Some of them
were referred to this morning by my hon. Friend the Member for
Makerfield. I have been given information about the interesting case

                           </div>of a gentleman called George Jones—that is not his correct name,
but I have been asked to protect his identity. He is an ex-offender who
is claiming jobseeker’s allowance and undertaking activities set
out in his jobseeker’s agreement, one of which was to attend a
provision by an organisation called Calder UK once a week. He also
attended the Foundation Training Company, which helps offenders find
work. Foundation located a training course for him, which meant that he
attended the Ability media centre for 16 hours a week while continuing
to look for work. Because he was attending Ability, he was not able to
attend Calder on a Thursday, but the Calder job coach was happy with
that and accepted the reasons for George’s absence. None the
less, the Calder agency continued to send letters to George. At the
same time that all that was going on—George was being told by
one bit of the system that it was okay for him to attend the course and
not turn up on a Thursday, but he was receiving letters from another
part asking him where on earth he was on Thursdays—he continued
to sign on at the Department for Work and Pensions and the Jobcentre
Plus staff who dealt with him raised no
objections.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000023">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
mid-March, George attended a 13-week review at Jobcentre Plus of his
job-seeking activities, and it is here that we get an indication of how
a mindset might be seeping into some Jobcentre Plus officials. The
jobcentre official accused George of failing to seek work and of being
unavailable to work. It is reported that the official became aggressive
and refused to listen to George’s account of what was happening
or to examine the facts. Eventually, the official walked out of the
interview, refusing to do anything to verify the information provided.
In fact, he walked out and said to George, “I’m going to
lunch.”<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000024">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
next thing that happened in the middle of March was that George
discovered that his benefit had been cut off. He received a letter on
30 March advising him that it had been cut off from the 12th until the
26th. It did not say anything specifically about that being a sanction.
For the rest of the period, George attempted to explain the situation
to the jobcentre, both in phone calls and through visits. He spoke to
three different managers, without any assistance or guidance, and other
agencies, including the police, helped negotiate with the DWP on
George’s behalf as well. Finally, the Zacchaeus 2000 Trust, with
which hon. Members will be familiar, was able to assist George with a
small cash payment as he had had no money for three weeks. When we look
at the behaviour of the official who was conducting the 13-week review,
we can see that the climate means that at least some officials feel
that the pressure is not to offer any tolerance or space. They simply
take the facts at face value and apply sanctions. That is clearly a
cause for
concern.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000025">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
think we all feel—I picked this up from listening to the
Minister this morning—that there needs to be a much more subtle
and potentially discretionary judgmental approach taken to the
application of sanctions. It is difficult to see how that can be the
right approach in the context where any targets are set. If Ministers
are confident that they never intended to set targets, they should have
no difficulty with the amendment because it would simply say that that
is something they would not seek to do.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000026">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Finally, I am
concerned that any climate the ratcheting up of the likelihood of
sanctions has created, whether by intention, misinterpretation or
otherwise, will bear most harshly on the disadvantaged. All the
evidence shows that they are the people—those with the most
chaotic lifestyles, the disabled, those with learning difficulties,
those with language difficulties, those from ethnic minority
backgrounds and so on—who are most likely already to face a
sanction. In a target regime, whether intended or accidental, the
people who are likely to continue to be most vulnerable to facing a
sanction will be the easy pickings. Therefore, we would like it to be
overtly stated in the legislation that no such climate of targets to
meet as many sanctions as are required will be
implemented.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000027">&#160;</a>

Grayling):<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000348">&#160;</a>
                              </span>
                           </strong> I have listened to the debate with a degree of
surprise. I do not blame the hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston
(Kate Green) because she is a new Member of Parliament, but I cannot
believe the gall of the Opposition in what they say about the number of
sanctions.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000028">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let us start
by considering the practical facts. The main reason for the increase in
the number of sanctions over the past 12 months is a change in the way
that failure to attend a mandatory interview is treated. Previously,
such failures resulted in disentitlement if the claimant did not make
contact within five days. In such cases, many claimants would then make
a fresh claim to benefit, losing on average a few days a month. The
approach did not provide a strong enough incentive to attend those
important announcements.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000029">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Therefore,
the previous Government thought long and hard and took a decision to
change the system in the Welfare Reform Act 2009. If I am not mistaken,
the Labour party was in power in 2009 and the 2009 Act was its policy.
That legislation introduced a new sanction for failure to attend
mandatory appointments, which was introduced from April 2010 by the
previous Government. The key reason why there has been a big jump in
the number of sanctions in the past year is because of a policy
decision taken by the previous Government. We agree with that decision,
but it was a direct result of decisions taken not by the right hon.
Member for East Ham because he was not in that job at the time, but by
his parliamentary colleagues.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000030">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To hear the
faux accusation that somehow this is an evil decision taken by the
current Government, is simply a travesty of the truth. This was a
conscious policy decision taken by the previous Government and it has
led to a significant increase in the number of sanctions. Under the new
approach, if a claimant can demonstrate good cause, the benefit
continues. However, where they cannot, a one-week sanction is imposed,
which is increased to a two-week sanction for the second and subsequent
failures. Where the customer does not return within five days, their
case is closed. That is the reason for the increase in sanctions from
2010.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000031">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is another point, in relation to which I should make an apology. It is
certainly the case that we underestimated the extent to which 13 years
of centralised, top-down target setting meant that people were so used
to living in a target culture, they would replicate it, even without
instruction from the top. I freely admit that, a few weeks ago, I
discovered that a pretty loose set of policy indications that aimed to
create a system that 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 496<a class="bkMark" name="Column496">&#160;</a>
                           </div>was firm but fair in treating claimants—a two-way contract, as we
mentioned this morning—was, in a small number of
cases, being turned into target setting, not across
the country, but on a local level. The moment we discovered that, we
took steps to stop it. None the less, a consequence—Opposition
Members should be ashamed—is that for 13 years Jobcentre Plus
and other public sector organisations were wrapped up in such a culture
of target setting that it is now a huge change challenge to turn such
organisations around, saying to them, “Actually, we want you to
use your discretion.” It is a matter of great regret that we
failed to understand the degree to which the previous Administration
damaged those organisations. We are now seeking to put right that
damage.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000032">&#160;</a>

learn some rather hard lessons about how large organisations such as
Jobcentre Plus respond to the kind of things he will say to them. He
told us—I am grateful—that he learned some weeks ago
about the problem with targets being set. Which jobcentres applied
those targets? As I asked this morning, did he inform the Secretary of

                           </strong> The answer is that I will not give the right
hon. Gentleman a list of jobcentres—the targets were applied
sporadically, and it would not be fair on those jobcentres to give a
list, but a clear instruction was given. Yes, the Secretary of State
was informed, but he was asked that question at pretty much the same
time as I discovered what had been going
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000034">&#160;</a>

the right hon. Gentleman now regret creating in government such a
target-driven culture, which could lead an organisation to believe that
the only response was a target? Does he understand the degree of damage
that was done by the way his Administration approached the management
of big organisations in that time? There was no sense of devolution of
power and responsibility in the front line, and no sense of
judgment—it was target, target, target and close control, close
control, close control, to the extent that I now find Jobcentre Plus
staff pleasantly surprised to discover that they have discretion to
judge what is right and
wrong.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000035">&#160;</a>

or otherwise of the target-setting regime that existed before last
year. However, I point out that the points target-based approach, which
rewarded Jobcentre Plus advisers for getting people into employment,
saw for example a surge in lone-parenting employment, from 44% to 57%.
As someone who was in no way implicated in setting targets under the
previous Government, I thought it was an effective driver of good
Jobcentre Plus
behaviour.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000036">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I rather disagree with the hon. Lady. The
imposition of centralised targets throughout government—not

                           </strong> That is a disappointing response from the Minister
and, I am afraid, simply draws attention to his present lack of
understanding—sadly, although I know he has only been in the job
for a year—of how large organisations operate and how they
respond to the kind of directives that he will undoubtedly issue, in
the same way that his predecessors
did.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000039">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister has I think made clear his objection to having such
targets—that is implied in what he said, and I take it that he
does so object. He leaves us with a bit of a mystery, because the
statement from his Department a few days after that article in <em>The

said:<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000040">&#160;</a>

am not quite sure why the Minister cannot tell us which
offices—and the Minister said that he told the Secretary of
State at that time. Why the Secretary of State then went on television
to describe the allegations as “claptrap” remains
somewhat unclear. It would have been helpful to have had some
illumination of what exactly went on. Ministers ought to communicate
such information to each other a bit more readily than seems to have
happened on that
occasion.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000041">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
episode illuminates how readily intentions that sound perfectly well
and honourable in Committee could go badly wrong. From what the various
whistleblowers have said, there was clearly a culture change—one
of them said last summer. That is when it happened. There was not
simply a change of legislation—although there was a change of
legislation, as the Minister has rightly said—but a culture
change that led to the targets being set by some
jobcentres.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000042">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
truth is that Ministers unfortunately have to plan for the eventuality
that things go wrong, such as people with mental health problems being
sanctioned inappropriately. So Ministers should not simply tell us
that, because everything has changed as a result of the general
election, none of those things will go wrong in future. They will go
wrong again. The Minister would do better to recognise that reality
rather than pretending that everything has now changed, because such
things
happen.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000043">&#160;</a>

planning assumption needs to be that such things will go wrong. The
Minister will not do well to operate on the hoping-for-the-best basis
that if he says, “All will be well,” it will be. He needs
to plan on the basis that things will go wrong. I am afraid that some
very vulnerable people will lose out severely as a

changed. The problem subsequently arose, however, in some jobcentres
that, in my view, responded to what they thought they were being told
by Ministers. The new culture that was introduced last summer led to
some jobcentres, some regions, or whoever it was—we have not
been able to establish exactly how the problem occurred—setting
targets for sanctions. That was the problem, and it gave rise to the
difficulties that have been exposed. Ministers need to recognise that
such problems happen in large organisations such as Jobcentre Plus, and
they need to plan on that basis. Ministers need to address things to
avoid those problems occurring in the future, as they undoubtedly will
unless steps are taken to avoid

targets have been in place since the election. That is how Jobcentre
Plus has responded to the new Ministers. He needs to recognise that and
not pretend that problems will not happen in future, because they will.
Whoever runs Jobcentre Plus, and it is an organisation for which I have
high regard, there will be targets. There is no point in pretending
that targets will not be there any more, because they certainly

specifically refers to targets that would

targets that we would not think were desirable, so why are they not
specified? Is it not right that an organisation such as Jobcentre Plus
might have a target that resulted in improvements—for example,
to be more careful about how it interprets existing legislation to
ensure that people who should be sanctioned are sanctioned? Ultimately,
the amendment makes little or no sense. It is internally

been set; the amendment is a device to ensure that they will not be so

The Royal National Institute for Deaf People has made that point. It

details of how that is calculated. I am keen to hear from the Minister

                           </strong> The amendments seek to ensure that, as the
shadow Minister said, where one member of a couple is sanctioned the
couple’s universal credit award is not reduced to below the
appropriate amount for the compliant member of the couple, except in
prescribed circumstances. That is an important issue and the right hon.
Gentleman is sensible to raise it.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000061">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let me
reassure the Committee: if one member of a couple is sanctioned, the
compliant member will be left with an appropriate amount of universal
credit. Sanctionable amounts will be set by reference to the standard
allowance that will be included in a claimant’s universal credit
maximum amount. Since the standard allowance for couple claimants will
be more than, but not double, that of a single claimant, we may set
different sanctionable rates for failures by one member of a couple
compared with a failure by an individual. We are carefully considering
what the rate should be, but I give the Committee an absolute assurance
that where only one member of a couple is sanctioned, the household
award will not be reduced by more than the single person standard
allowance. That means that where the household receives its maximum
universal credit amount, the sanctioned award will still include an
identifiable amount to support the basic living costs of the compliant
member.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000062">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Furthermore,
any additional amounts included in the award for housing or children
would not be affected by a sanction. Where a household’s award
is less than its maximum amount, due to its level of income or savings,
a sanction could reduce the universal credit to less than the
additional amounts for children and housing, including the maximum
amount, and the Committee will remember that I explained this morning
how and why that might happen. In such cases, claimants will have
access to income or savings to support those costs. I hope that that
gives the right hon. Gentleman the reassurance he sought and that he
will withdraw the

job, any sanction that had been imposed on them prior to that and by
which they were affected immediately before taking up their job would
end. The amendments are intended to ensure that that is the case. As
the Bill stands, however, that is not the case. As I understand it, the
current intention is that if somebody is sanctioned and then gets a
job, but subsequently loses that job, the sanction on them immediately
before going into work would apply to them again. It strikes me that it
would be better, not least to increase the attractiveness of being in a
job, to let the sanction lapse once somebody goes into employment. I
suppose that there might be a problem with people getting a job for a
very short time just to escape the sanction and then leaving that job
in order to go back on benefits, so there might have to be some
prescribed period, but to say that the sanction that they go into work
with effectively stays with them, in abeyance, throughout their time in
work and then comes back into life at the moment when they lose their
job seems to be a puzzling arrangement and one that I would not have
thought the Minister would want in the Bill. I hope that, on

There is the separate question about the sanction coming back to life
if they subsequently lose their job, but it strikes me as entirely
possible that a sanction might apply and be effective while the person
is working, particularly given that that person is likely to be
receiving universal credit while in work. That has given rise to some
significant concern among the organisations that have been looking at
the measures, and I would be grateful if the Minister will consider

that the flexibility he seeks is already included in the
regulation-making powers for clauses 26 and 27, which both provide for
powers that would bring sanctions to an end in certain circumstances.
For example, clause 26 provides for the higher-level
sanctions: subsection (4)(a) allows us to make regulations to reduce
the sanctionable amount to zero and subsection (8)(c) allows us to make
regulations to terminate or suspend a sanction. These powers are
mirrored in clause 27. We are carefully considering the circumstances
where it may be necessary to use those powers. Our expectation is that
we will lift sanctions only in a very narrow range of circumstances,
for example, where a claimant moves into the no work-related
requirements group due to severe
illness.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000070">&#160;</a>

will be circumstances in which we do not want to do that. There is a
world of difference between someone who receives an extended sanction,
then gets into employment, stays there for a number of years and
subsequently loses their job long after they have clearly demonstrated
that they have a substantial and ongoing employment record and someone
who simply takes a job for a few days and then says, “Please
lift my sanction,” which might otherwise have lasted for six
months. It is not as simple as saying that regulations must provide for
the lifting or termination of sanctions because there will be
circumstances where entering employment does not, should not and would
not make that

a number now, because our general approach should be and will be that
if someone receives a sanction it is something that they should
experience; it should not simply disappear as a result of a single
change in circumstances. We will want to look clearly at where there is
a change in health, for example: if someone comes back and needs
employment and support allowance because they are seriously ill or have
acquired a severe disability, that is a different set of circumstances.
We will certainly look at whether there is an appropriate period after
which somebody can be deemed to have been in work sufficiently long
that we did not need to reapply a sanction. It is not something that I
would seek to do lightly, nor something that I would seek to prescribe
in too much detail. Again, I look to the discretion of front-line staff
to decide circumstances where it may be appropriate to do so.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000074">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The right
hon. Gentleman should assume that the default approach set out in the
Bill is that a sanction will be a sanction will be a sanction,
regardless of the circumstances, except in unusual cases where there
has clearly been such a significant and material change of
circumstances that it makes sense for the sanction not to be applied in
the way that was originally envisaged. From a practical point of view,
for the purposes of the Bill, the powers exist to do what he suggests
we should do. He makes a sensible point about someone who has been in
work for a lengthy period and I can give him an assurance that that is
something that we will consider carefully when putting together the
regulations. What I cannot give him is an undertaking that I will put a
time limit on it because I think that would be wrong.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000075">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Generally
speaking, I think that the same principle applies throughout our
system—people do not get off an offence because it does not come
up for a number of years—but of course there will be a
common-sense point at which we say that it is not logical to reapply a
sanction long after the event. We will look at that question when
forming the regulations. Generally speaking, it will require a material
change of circumstances such as a change in someone’s health
before we would make a change, but I do not rule out what the right
hon. Gentleman has described. I hope that he will accept that the
elements I have just set out allow us to do what

                           </div>he wishes anyway, but I am not prepared to accept a “must”
element, because it would be very easy for someone to enter short-term
employment, lose the sanction and then move on from that. That would
not be
right.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000076">&#160;</a>

he accepts the common-sense point, as he described it, that once
someone has been in a job for a reasonable period it does not make much
sense, should they lose that job, for a long-forgotten sanction
suddenly to burst into life again. I am grateful for the assurance on
the existing powers. I encourage him to develop the regulations to that

                           </span> With the Committee’s
indulgence, I will take the opportunity to put down a marker against
future regulations and the administration of this part of the sanctions
regime policy. As I do about all areas of public policy, I feel
strongly—indeed, I raised the issue during Health questions
recently—that we should look beyond the postal system and make
increased use of mobile communications when corresponding with
individuals about important matters. It is important that a sanctions
regime is delivered through modern methods of communication, especially
when the penalties and the impact on someone’s life can be
severe if they do not receive a letter or know what is going on around
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000080">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Increasingly,
and across all branches of Government, we are not really keeping up
with modern social trends and habits. We have all met constituents who
said that they did not receive critical letters that made a big
difference to their lives. Royal Mail admits that on its figures,
around 280,000 letters a week are lost—that is more than 14
million letters a year. In many cases, those who come to my surgery and
say that they did not receive letters are telling the truth. Some say
that they do not open letters, but that is another problem
altogether.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000081">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My area is
about the No. 1 postcode in the UK for identity fraud, which the police
largely put down to post being stolen from communal hallways and areas
that do not have individual post boxes. The other postcodes in the top
20 for identity fraud are generally also urban areas that suffer from
the same sorts of issues. As I said, I would like to put down a marker
and suggest that we look more closely at changing the way we
communicate with people. There are more than 70 million mobile phones
in the UK, and changing rental habits mean that the length of tenure in
both council and private stock is declining, but many young people will
have the same mobile phone number and e-mail address for much longer
than they stay at the same postal address. We need to catch up a little
with where the modern world is going.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000082">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As well as
the problem of shared hallways and the lack of private post boxes, I am
acutely aware that we must consider the nature of the accommodation
lived in by some of those people about whom the Committee has been
talking, who may find themselves more readily drawn into the sanctions
regime. They are vulnerable 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 504<a class="bkMark" name="Column504">&#160;</a>
                           </div>people who perhaps live in hostels, bed and breakfasts, or housing
association accommodation designed for ex-offenders and vulnerable
adults—generally not places where people can rely on getting
post through private mail boxes. Some of those situations might be
patchy at best, and I would not wish people to become vulnerable to an
escalating sanctions regime because they are not aware that a process
has begun. I hope the Minister will respond to that point.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000083">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I have spoken
about this matter in relation to a number of other areas of public
policy. No one is contemplating our going down the route of registered
post, because the same problems are associated with that, but we are
moving into a different era and we must look at greater use of mobile
technology. That is common in the private sector and delivers all sorts
of things from tickets to services. It might be cheaper, but I am
particularly interested in communications that are effective in
delivering critical messages that could make an important difference to
someone’s life in a way that is as reliable as humanly
possible.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000084">&#160;</a>

                           </span> I congratulate the
hon. Lady on her contribution to this important issue, and I will add a
few words. My constituency shares with hers the characteristic of
having the highest levels of multiple occupation in the country, so I
am very aware of the problems that she describes. Indeed, I know of a
number of cases in which sanctions and disbenefiting were imposed
because correspondence went missing. For instance, all the houses on
two large estates that had been the subject of regeneration programmes
were given fresh addresses, being changed from blocks to streets. To
this day, DWP and other agencies send letters to addresses that no
longer exist and then subject people to sanctions and other penalties
because the correspondence does not arrive.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000085">&#160;</a>

what the hon. Lady says, and I hope that the Minister will be
sympathetic, but I stress that it is disproportionately the people in
the private rented sector, and sometimes other sectors, who have the
greatest difficulty with mail who also have the greatest difficulty
with internet access, and sometimes with being able to afford reliable
forms of mobile communication. It is very much a question of looking at
local circumstances and building in safeguards on forms of
communication, rather than looking for alternatives, as we will in
later debates on welfare advice, in those constituencies and boroughs
that are likely to have the biggest
problem.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000086">&#160;</a>

                        <p>The

“a combination of both” which opens up the possibility of
claimants being sanctioned for an indeterminate period until they
comply and then, having complied, being subject to a sanction for
another period of up to 26 weeks. That seems to be how the combination
under paragraph (c) would operate. If that were the effect of the
provision, it would make it highly discouraging for people in work and
potentially damaging to families with children. In any case, 26 weeks
is a long time in such circumstances. I hope that the Minister will
give a compelling explanation, or accept that these two forms of
sanction ought to run concurrently if they are both imposed, rather
than one after the other, which appears to be what is envisaged at the
moment.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000094">&#160;</a>

provided for in clause 27 could last for either a fixed period of up to
26 weeks, or for an open-ended period, until the claimant meets a

that combine both open-ended and fixed periods.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000097">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let me
explain our strategy. We intend to use clause 27 to provide
for three broad levels of sanction. There would be fixed-period
medium-level sanctions for claimants who are subject to all
work-related requirements who fail to take all reasonable action to
search for work or be available for work—being available for
work is a long-standing element of the sanctions regime. There would be
lower-level sanctions for claimants who are subject to all work-related
requirements, or work preparation and work-focused interview
requirements, who fail to meet particular work preparation or connected
requirements—perhaps they have not taken part in skills
training, not prepared a CV, or have failed to turn up for their
fortnightly job search review. Finally, there would be open-ended
sanctions for claimants who are only required to attend work-focused
interviews.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000098">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The amendment
would prevent the proposed application of lower-level sanctions. We
intend there to be two components of a lower-level sanction: an
open-ended sanction that continues until a claimant re-engages with
requirements, followed by a fixed sanction. We want fixed sanctions to
last for one week for a first failure, two weeks for a second, and four
weeks for a third and subsequent
failures.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000099">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
purpose of the open-ended element is straightforward. If someone does
not turn up for their work-focused interview and does not make contact,
why should we continue to pay benefits until that person decides to
turn up and say, “Here I am”? Should that person, at that
point, be able to say, “Right, that’s the end of my
sanction”? I do not think that they should. If someone does not
turn up, does not engage and does not participate, they should not
collect benefits while they are not in contact, but there should still
be a consequence. Someone should not be able to turn up and say,
“Well, that’s all right then.” It is not all
right, actually. That person has stepped way outside the rules of the
system, and there should be a consequence.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000100">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Our proposals
would also have the benefit of removing some anomalies. Somebody who
has committed a previous offence, for example, can turn up four or five
days later, having skipped their first interview and perhaps the second
one that has been booked for them and say, “Oh well,
that’s fine. I’ll carry on as I am.” We want to
send a very clear message: if a person does not bother to turn up or
engage, there are consequences. The benefits will not start again until
the person re-engages, and then there will be a short-term—not
long-term—consequence thereafter, because of not having
re-engaged.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000101">&#160;</a>

for three elements to the sanctions process. Failure to make oneself
available for work is a much more significant offence, which can
command a sanction lasting up to 26 weeks. I am setting out for the
right hon. Gentleman our intention to use the disengagement sanction
for lower level issues and to require people to re-participate. If
someone is not turning up for their fortnightly signing-on and job
search interview, they will face a consequence; their benefits will
stop until they re-engage, but then, on top of that, there is a
consequence to their failure to participate. I hope that this is not a
matter on which there are differences between us. To say that there are
consequences for not participating is a sensible approach. If someone
does not turn up and does not engage, their benefits should stop; and
when they re-engage they should face a short-term consequence for
having committed a
breach.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000105">&#160;</a>

return to the point I made this morning, we expect Jobcentre Plus
advisers to ensure, to the point of carrying out home visits, that they
do not sanction people with mental health problems. That is absolutely
clear, it is our aspiration and it is an instruction from Ministers to
Jobcentre Plus. We expect advisers to look at individual cases, and if
there is an impact from a mental health condition, we do not expect a
sanction to be applied. What we have put in place across the sanctions
regime is a sensible balance in which there are real consequences for
failure to participate in the process and for ignoring what has been
agreed, and this is a part of that balance. Our intention is that if
someone does not turn up, does not engage and does not arrive at
Jobcentre Plus, their benefits will stop until they do so. It is
exactly as the right hon. Gentleman has read it, and we intend to
proceed accordingly.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000106">&#160;</a>

for subsection (5)(a)—that the claimant meets a compliance
condition before their benefit starts—and he made a good case
for why the sanction might last a bit longer than that and suggested
four weeks, but he has not made a case for a 26-week sanction at the
end of the compliance sanction, at least not in a way that I
understood. I do not understand the circumstances in which the 26-week
sanction would apply rather than the four-week sanction, which he has
defended in a way with which I am entirely happy. When would the

make that substitution. It is quite right that, even if a family has
conditionality applied, it can still claim for a hardship payment to
avoid destitution. The White Paper suggested that those payments might
be replaced in some circumstances by loans, and perhaps taken away
entirely if there were over-reliance on them—a suggestion that

would be grateful if the Minister set out the circumstances in which it
is proposed that hardship payments will be replaced
by loans. Will he accept that that change could well cause serious
hardship? Depending on his answer, he might want to reflect on whether
it is the right thing to do. Hardship payments, by definition, are
given in case of hardship—someone has looked at the situation
and decided that there is hardship. Will not recovering such payments
often recreate the hardship that the payments were intended to avoid?
What measures does the Minister propose to stop that
happening?<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000118">&#160;</a>

major change in how the system works. It has always been recognised
that, even when sanctions are imposed, there will be cases where real
hardship results—for children, for example—and where
something needs to be done to alleviate that hardship. If in future all
that will be done is to give a loan that has to be recovered, is there
not a real danger of recreating the hardship that the payment was

one other point on the Government’s intentions regarding
hardship payments. We were helpfully supplied before Easter with a
paper from the Department outlining the likely content of the
regulations that will support the clause. I noted that that would
probably include defining the circumstances in which the claimant or
household would be considered to be most vulnerable and therefore
eligible for hardship payments. The briefing paper notes that that
would be expected to follow the permanent provisions that apply in
relation to jobseeker’s allowance. The briefing note suggests
what some of those situations might be: the single claimant who is
pregnant or responsible for a young person who would suffer hardship if
no payment were made, people who have caring obligations, and young
people looked after by the local authority.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000120">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The current
regulations, I understand, also specifically include the situation
where an individual or his or her partner is responsible for a child
under the age of 16 and where that child would suffer hardship if no
payment were made. I would be grateful for clarification from the
Minister if that is also intended to apply in the new regime to
parents, where a sanction imposed on them could lead to hardship for
the child for whom they are responsible.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000121">&#160;</a>

to prevent regulations being made which would allow for hardship
payments to be recoverable. Alongside changes to the sanctions system,
we want to improve the hardship regime so that the existence of
hardship payments does not undermine the deterrent effect of sanctions.
The challenge is that if you sanction somebody and take away their
out-of-work benefits, but you then replace at least part of that money
through an unrecoverable hardship payment, you diminish the
effectiveness of the sanction. Many aspects of the system that we plan
to introduce are similar to current arrangements under JSA, but one
change will be to make some of those payments
recoverable.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000122">&#160;</a>

Government recognise the need to ensure that a robust safety net is in
place, so the change will not be applied to those claimants currently
eligible for JSA hardship payments without being required to wait
14 days from the beginning of the sanctions period. As the
hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston rightly said, they were set out
in the note sent to members of the Committee. It will be based on the
list currently contained in the 1996 JSA regulations. Regulation 140
for single people and 146(a) for joint claim couples, basically set
aside the following groups: single persons or couples wherein at least
one member is pregnant or responsible for a child or young person, or a
household that includes a person eligible for a disability premium; a
person who suffers from a chronic medical condition that results in
their functional capability being limited; a person with significant
caring responsibilities; and a person who is being looked after by a
local authority, pursuant to the Children Act 1989. In each of these
cases, for an award to be made, it has to be the person listed there
who would otherwise suffer hardship, not necessarily the principal
benefit claimant. We will add to the list claimants who would be
entitled to ESA under the current system, and we will make any further
changes to ensure consistency with the universal credit
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000124">&#160;</a>

of those claimants who will be eligible only for recoverable payments,
we will make it absolutely clear to them up front that that is the
case. We also expect rates of recovery to be broadly in line with
existing recovery arrangements. However, I think it sensible to be able
to take a decision to recover payments where we are applying hardship
payments after the 14 days have expired. I do not see why
somebody should be subject to a three-month sanction, for example, for
a major breach—refusal to apply for a job or accept a job
offer—but be able to receive unrefundable, unrecoverable
hardship payments. That is the key purpose of the change. The recovery
of payments should help to incentivise certain claimants to meet their
work-related requirements, while protecting the most vulnerable
claimants and their dependants.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000125">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In response
to the hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston on the subject of
children, the 1996 regulations expressly do not provide an absolute
blanket circumstance, but they refer to a person with significant
caring responsibilities, which would cover the case of a parent with a
child. She should bear in mind that the sanction does not remove the
equivalent of the child tax credit—the child element of the
universal credit when it is introduced—nor does it require us to
withdraw child benefit or the housing element. There is simply a
consequence in terms of an amount equivalent to the standard allowance.
Yes, there will be some circumstances where there is a child under the
age of 16 where no blanket rule is applied. That is sensible: one

hope that Members will accept that what we propose is a sensible way
forward. It is a change, and we freely accept that, but it is a
common-sense change. If someone has committed a transgression, why
should they be able to carry on receiving unrecoverable hardship
payments? It is right and proper that we ensure that people can eat,
but when the sanction period is over and they have
sorted themselves out and are receiving money again,

                           </strong> The difficulty here is the reality of the situation
that quite a lot of people find themselves in when they are on the
receiving end of sanctions and then apply for hardship payments. It is
by no means always their own fault that people find themselves in such
circumstances. We have already heard examples cited in our debate
earlier today of circumstances that were not the responsibility of the
individual being sanctioned; they were in circumstances that have
caused the sanction to be

that when somebody has been sanctioned through a mistake or through no

but the reality of people’s circumstances means that they may
not be sufficiently together to pursue that. The Minister has often
talked about people with mental health problems and the way this
affects them. The big problem is that as a result of the proposed
change—along with some of the others debated today—we are
likely to cause real hardship to significant numbers of people to whom
nobody in the Committee would wish to see hardship caused. I accept
that it is not the Minister’s intention that that should happen,

                           </strong> Could the Minister provide brief clarification in
relation to clause 29? I am pleased that the delegation and contracting
out functions do not apply to the sanctioning and hardship payment
decisions. It would 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 512<a class="bkMark" name="Column512">&#160;</a>
                           </div>have been of great concern if they were delegated outside the public
sphere. I therefore assume that the possibility of delegating and
contracting out relates particularly to circumstances in which private
and voluntary sector Work programme providers are the principal point
of engagement with the claimant. In those circumstances it would make
perfect sense for such providers to discuss the claimant’s
commitment and the work-related activity that the claimant would be
required to
undertake.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000136">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
as the Minister may be aware, when evidence was presented to the Work
and Pensions Select Committee recently, some concern was expressed
about the potential for confusion should claimants be dealing with the
private or voluntary sector Work programme providers while also
continuing to have some sort of signing on and review arrangement with
Jobcentre Plus. Some of the witnesses to the Work and Pensions Select
Committee were concerned that that procedure needed to be streamlined
so that claimants were absolutely clear about who was requiring them to
do what, so that they did not fall foul of requirements of one or the
other, or assume that by attending a meeting with one, they had met the
requirements of another, and so on. We understood that a number of Work
programme providers themselves were also concerned about this. Some
attempts were being made, for example, to try to co-locate Jobcentre
Plus and Work programme provider offices so that the package of
intervention with claimants could be available in one place and
potentially offered at one time, but clearly that is not going to be
feasible everywhere. Once Work programme providers and non-statutory
providers are in place it could mean that claimants will have to go off
in two different directions for two different sets of meetings and
interviews.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000137">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I would be
grateful if the Minister could indicate how that possible confusion
might be best addressed. Has he discussed with Work programme providers
their concerns about the issue? If claimants, as a result of the
potential confusion but without any malicious intent, failed formally
to attend one bit of what we might call the logging-on process but were
otherwise completely compliant, can he assure us that the much more
subtle and discretionary process that we were discussing a few minutes
ago will be well attuned to taking that into
account?<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000138">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I can assure the hon. Lady about how we intend
the process to work. We have had many conversations with would-be Work
programme providers over the months about sanctioning, and there were
divided opinions: some wanted the power to sanction, others clearly did
not. Obviously, a defined role for them and for Jobcentre Plus is
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000139">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Our
intention is, as the hon. Lady rightly said, that Work programme
providers will not have a power to sanction. They will have the right
to make a recommendation to Jobcentre Plus about the need to sanction,
but they will need to provide an explanation, and it is down to the
Jobcentre Plus decision makers to ensure that they are confident that
the decision is right and then to make that decision. The sanctioning
power will clearly remain with Jobcentre
Plus.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000140">&#160;</a>

                           </div>to require someone to undertake particular activities that will be
beneficial in helping that person to move into work—effectively,
they are acting as agents for the Secretary of State, as provided for
in the clause and as related to the various activities set out in the
previous
clauses.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000141">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Our
intention is that the role of Jobcentre Plus at that point should be
limited to two things. First, simply, is the fortnightly signing off.
We felt it appropriate and necessary to retain a link with Jobcentre
Plus, albeit simply through that mechanical activity of going in once a
fortnight and signing on—a quick summary of what people are
doing and whether they are doing fine. Apart from anything else, that
gives them an opportunity to express any concerns, so that Jobcentre
Plus is in contact with what is happening to the individuals, but it is
not directing them to do anything. It is engaged purely in a formulaic
catch-up and the process of the fortnightly signing on, to enable the
individuals to continue to receive jobseeker’s allowance and,
subsequently, the universal
credit.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000142">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
Jobcentre Plus will deal with sanctions, as and when the situation
arises and if a Work programme provider recommends the need for a
sanction to Jobcentre Plus. The provider will have to explain why and
what the breach has been, and it will be for the Jobcentre Plus
decision maker to decide whether the sanction should be applied. I
expect that, in most cases, the sanction would be administered as
recommended by the Work programme provider, but we will also give clear
guidance to the Jobcentre Plus decision makers that they should not
always take the word of the provider as gospel but should be ready to
ask questions if they have doubts about
anything.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000143">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
role of Jobcentre Plus while the person is on the Work programme should
be limited to those two things. The nature of the claimant commitment
at that point becomes very much a move from Jobcentre Plus to being a
further set of tasks agreed with the Work programme provider. I expect
every Work programme provider and every claimant to sit down and have
an initial, in-depth, work-focused interview to decide what kind of
things that person will do, what kind of help will be provided and a
programme to be set out for them as they proceed. That is our clear
expectation—providers will have set out in the course of their
bids a minimum level of support that they will provide to each
individual referred. We have not dictated that, but we expect them to
come forward and demonstrate that there will be a certain level of
support provided to every single individual. Over and above that, they
will tailor support depending on the needs of the
individual.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000144">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
hope that that provides the hon. Lady with the reassurance she is
looking for. We want a simple process. Effectively, when on the Work
programme, any employment-related activities are entirely a matter for
the Work programme provider, but we need the individuals to come into
Jobcentre Plus once a fortnight to keep in touch and to sign on
formally, but that is
all.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000145">&#160;</a>

welcome the provisions in the clause. They allow for the piloting of
some of the changes that the Bill seeks to introduce. We are all
mindful of the radical extent of some of the proposed changes. The
focus of the piloting is to test the extent to which the provisions
enable people to remain in work or to obtain work, which is absolutely
the right thrust. Piloting has a long and useful history in welfare
reform and I was pleased to see that we will, at least to some degree,
have that opportunity in relation to this

hon. Members will be aware from a number of earlier debates on this
Bill, I am concerned about the potential health implications for
recipients of the universal credit, which is one of the less obvious
consequences of the measures, especially when financial sanctions and
penalties are imposed. Given that the current levels of benefit that
are likely to be read across to the universal credit are already
insufficient to secure a healthy diet and to meet other basic needs
satisfactorily, I am particularly anxious that we continue to take
account of the health impact on universal credit claimants, especially
if those payments could be
reduced.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000150">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is considerable evidence already of the damage that financial sanctions
can do to child health. Families who have been sanctioned, as opposed
to those who have not been in receipt of any financial sanction but who
are otherwise on social security payments, experienced a 30% higher
incidence of hospitalisation, a 60% greater risk of food insecurity,
which includes being under weight as the result of a lack of a
nourishing diet, and a 90% greater risk of being admitted to hospital
on an accident and emergency visit.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000151">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On 26 March,
Mintel, the market research company, reported in <em>The Grocer
Magazine</em>—this debate covers wide-ranging territory and many
sources—that the cost of fresh fruit has risen by 7.9%, which
has affected people in low income groups and people under the age of
25. Some 26% of under-25-year-olds and 22% of those earning less than
£15,500 a year say that they now eat less fruit and vegetables
because of the cost. Families with young children are among the most
likely to cut back. Some 30% of those with children under the age of
five and 26% of those with children under the age of 10 claim that they
were reducing the amount of fruit and vegetables that they
ate.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000152">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clearly,
healthy diets are already under pressure for families who are on low
incomes and who are currently reliant on safety-net benefits as a
result of rising costs. I am concerned that we keep this issue on the
radar, particularly in the context of our discussions today about the
way in which the universal credit will be both paid and potentially
sanctioned. We are also concerned about the payment mechanism,
especially where it is not clear that the payment will necessarily go
to the mothers who are most likely to be incurring the expenditure 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 515<a class="bkMark" name="Column515">&#160;</a>
                           </div>and making the decisions in relation to the family diet. We are not
clear about what sorts of choices couples may make about which member
of a couple may seek to receive universal credit. I am still not clear
about the circumstances in which couples will be enabled to exercise
such a choice. On the health outcomes of universal credit, it is
important that we are mindful that there is at least a
possibility—I would go further and say a likelihood—that
universal credit in couples will typically be paid to the man in the

are not irrelevant or trivial points. I hope that the Minister will
understand that I do not make them in the spirit of creating
difficulties, but because I am genuinely concerned that we are moving
to a different kind of benefit payment and that the support directed to
children in particular is less clear-cut in a single, integrated
credit. We must be aware of the health impact that this policy change
will have on children and on families in
general.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000154">&#160;</a>

ask in the amendment that the piloting should review specifically the
health impacts and that there should be a measurement of the health
outcomes affected by the introduction of universal credit and the
associated regulations. That will require cross-government activity.
There will need to be discussion with colleagues in the Department of
Health and I am keen to hear from the Minister about what discussions
have already taken place on the introduction of universal credit and
any health impact. There will also be an interest at local level
because of the new public health duties to be undertaken by local
authorities in England. Again, I am keen to hear whether there have
been any discussions about possible health implications with the Local
Government Association and those who will be responsible for public
health
locally.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000155">&#160;</a>

excellent longitudinal sources that will provide a much broader picture

changes being introduced by this Bill and associated regulations.
However, it will be possible, through some form of sampling and
surveying activity, to understand what choices families are making as a
result of the introduction of universal credit. It will be particularly
important to understand what happens to payments within the household.
The issue was raised in an earlier debate and it is a very real one in
relation to healthy diet and good spending on

from the Minister about the intentions behind the provisions,
particularly those that we have debated today and in previous sittings
that set up a complex series of requirements both for people who are
out of work and, for the first time, for people who are in work and in
receipt of universal credit. Those people will primarily be in low-paid
work, especially since it is clear that universal credit will be paid
to those who are in work on relatively low levels of income compared
with the tax credit system. Although they will be in work to some
extent, we will be dealing predominantly with people who are on low
pay.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000159">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It has been
said on several occasions that people who have mental health problems
will be dealt with sensitively—although I am not entirely clear
what that will mean—but it is relevant in health terms to look
at some of the things that have happened in relation to employment
support allowance, which will be incorporated into universal credit in
due course. I appreciate that the previous Labour Government introduced
employment support allowance; as I have said several times in debate on
the subject, when I came to the House I agreed in principle with the
aim of the employment support allowance, but in talking to people about
their experience, I have learnt about some of the operational
difficulties that have arisen. Some people, particularly those who have
mental health difficulties and even some other kinds of illnesses, find
complying with the process of constant requirements very difficult
indeed. Even in the short term—I appreciate that some of the
health implications are long term—it can have severe
implications for people’s health, just at a point when they may
be recovering.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000160">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">A constituent
came to see me in January to explain what he had been through with ESA.
He told me that he had been refused benefit, had appealed, had a long
wait for that to be dealt with and, in six months, was reassessed and
put through another process. He felt that that had affected his health
badly, and had made his recovery from the breakdown that he had
suffered, which had caused him to become unemployed in the first
place—after a long working career; he was not a long-term
recipient—more difficult. He felt that some of the processes
that he had been through had affected his health adversely.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000161">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">That is why
it is important that health implications are looked at across the
piece, including for people who have some mental health difficulties.
The Bill does not state that such people—unless, presumably,
they fall into the support group—would not be expected to comply
with some of the requirements, even if they are

It is relevant, even in the short term, to look at the health
implications for some groups of people and to ensure that the processes
that are put in place do not have an unintended adverse impact. If
those implications are looked at and reviewed, it is possible to
include changes in the system to avoid such an impact in
future.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000162">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Bill addresses health issues. Clause 19, for example, ensures that
benefit payments will remain unconditional for claimants who, because
of ill health or disability, cannot be expected to work or to prepare
for work. Clause 21 ensures that any claimant assessed as having
limited capability for work cannot be made to look for or take a
job.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000165">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">More
generally, when we impose requirements, advisers will ensure that they
fit in with an individual’s personal circumstances and
capability, hence the point I keep making about mental health, which we
regard as extremely important. Where necessary, we will get expert help
with that. We will, for example, refer disabled claimants to disability
employment advisers to assess the particular support that they need.
There are also the specialist support programmes such as Work Choice
and the access to work programmes, which are overseen by  the
Minister with responsibility for disabled people, the Under-Secretary
of State for Work and Pensions, my hon. Friend the Member for
Basingstoke.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000166">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
want to get it right, and we want to evaluate the health impact of our
policies wherever necessary. Having a particular requirement to measure
the health impact of any pilot or regulations, however, would not be
helpful. The purpose of this chapter of the Bill is to improve the
chances of people entering work or doing more or better-paid work. It
is right, therefore, that any pilot must assess whether regulations on
claimant responsibilities help deliver those goals,
too.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000167">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
assure the Committee that, as part of any evaluation, we will consider
other impacts. Where health is a potential issue, we will consider it
as a possible impact, but it will not always be an issue. A requirement
to measure the health impacts might be an unnecessary
burden.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000168">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Looking
at the clauses on work search requirements, a situation could be
imagined three, four or five years down the track in which it is clear
that a claimant’s job search prospects would be dramatically
enhanced by, for example, putting a self-advertisement on Facebook. 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 518<a class="bkMark" name="Column518">&#160;</a>
                           </div>We might pilot that to assess whether it is sensible to require a
claimant to put a personal advert on Facebook and to work with them to
do so. Clearly, that would not be a health-related requirement, and it
would be an over-convoluted process if we had to carry out a detailed
health impact assessment in order to try it out as an approach with
some of our claimants. That is a simple example, and it might be
totally irrelevant for the future, but there will be cases in which we
want to pilot something to see if it enhances the process, in which an
extra element of conditionality makes it more likely that a claimant
will get a job, but has no relationship to health matters. It would,
therefore, be too complicated and bureaucratic to measure health
outcomes in such
cases.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000169">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The Low
Incomes Tax Reform Group gave evidence to the Committee at the
beginning of our deliberations and drew attention to the danger of the
move from working tax credit to universal credit. At the moment, that
represents a significantly backward step for self-employed people and
will affect the viability of self-employment for some. The
group’s briefing makes it starkly clear how much worse off some
self-employed people will be if the Bill is left unamended and if this
part of schedule 1 is used in the way that the White Paper indicates:
to assume that everybody in self-employment is earning at least the
minimum wage for the number of hours that they are working in their
business.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000180">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
White Paper proposed that, under universal credit, the self-employed
should be deemed to have earnings at least equal to the national
minimum wage for the hours that they work. It will probably be clear to
everyone in Committee that that is simply not a realistic assumption
for a significant group of self-employed people. The earnings that such
people draw from their business will not, for significant
periods—not just at the beginning of the business—be as
large as the minimum wage. In imposing an income floor on self-employed
people in such a way, the danger is that the measure will run strongly
counter to the Government’s intention to make work pay through
universal credit, specifically for people who see an opportunity for
becoming self-employed. That is why the amendment proposes the removal
of the enabling paragraph in the
schedule.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000181">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_ParaIndent">The
briefing from the Chartered Institute of Taxation points out that the
working tax credit succeeds in encouraging self-employment because of
the alignment of working tax credit with the tax system in its
structure and in how it measures and defines income. Under working tax
credit, tax definitions are used; under universal credit, it looks as
though benefit definitions will be used. If a self-employed person
applies for working tax credit, the applicant simply has to insert in
the trading income box on the working tax credit claim form the annual
declaration—the net profit—which also appears on his or
her self-assessment tax return. If there has been a trading loss, they
write “nil”.</p>
                        <p class="hs_ParaIndent">By
contrast, income measurement for the DWP requires the claimant to
report income and expenses on a cash-flow basis, rather than on an
accruals basis as for tax, and so imposes an extra reporting burden.
Incidentally, there is a real question mark about how the system can be
made to work in practice for people who will expect and hope to receive
universal credit every month, because the actual income received by a
self-employed person will clearly be extremely volatile. Some months it
may be none, and other months, if an order comes in or a deal is done,
it may be quite a lot. We have not yet been told about that. If the
Minister can shed some light on that, it would be helpful for not only
the Committee, but all those listening to our
deliberations.</p>
                        <p class="hs_ParaIndent">In
practice, how can a monthly universal credit assessment be carried out
for the self-employed? Currently, it is done on an annual basis with
working tax credits, and the view of the Chartered Institute of
Taxation and others is that that has actually worked particularly well
in making self-employment viable and feasible for many people for whom
it would not otherwise have been a realistic prospect.</p>

the tax system, and by extension, therefore, the tax credit system,
there is a recognition of the economic reality of how a business is
doing by taking into account not only income minus relevant expenses,
but, for example, investment in business assets and equipment through
the capital allowances system, which is available for tax credit
applicants, and through trading losses, which can be set against other
income or against the profits of earlier—in tax—or later,
in tax credits, periods of the
trade.</p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
the income definition that is used in the benefits system, however,
there is no allowance for capital expenditure, depreciation or losses.
The tax system has ways of disallowing losses or other deductions that
do not conform to certain rules or are not genuine. In particular, loss
relief is not allowed unless the business is carried out on a
commercial basis and with a view to generating profit. The whole
system, as one would expect, as it belongs in the tax system, has been
worked out well from a self-employed person’s point of
view.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000182">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Chartered Institute of Taxation went on to say that the fact that
trading income for the purposes of working tax credit is measured in
the same way as trading profits for income tax purposes ensures that
working tax credit can promote work for several reasons. Ordinary
business expenses are deductible in computing profit and, therefore,
working tax credit trading income. Moneys that the business owner
invests in essential business equipment, such as premises, are
reflected in the tax system through capital allowances and, therefore,
in working tax credit trading income. Tax, and, therefore, working tax
credit, recognises a nil profit in a period in which a business
generates a loss. That allows the loss to be set off against other
income, including, for working tax credit, other income of the
trader’s partner and the profits of other, more profitable
periods.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000183">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Tax credits
take into account actual income from capital when assessing
entitlement, so that business capital and bank loans, for example,
which generate little or no income, do not artificially depress the
amount of support a self-employed person receives—I will return
to that point in a moment. Alignment with the tax system in tax credits
allows a self-employed person to compute their profits or trading
income once for one assessment period and use the result for both tax
and tax credits. That substantially reduces the bureaucratic burden on
the self-employed person and frees them to get on with running their
business, which we all
want.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000184">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Chartered Institute of Taxation went on to say that such advantages
will be removed if the existing DWP rules for measuring and defining
income from self-employment were adopted for the purposes of universal
credit. The DWP recognises expenses as a deduction from trading income,
but no allowance is made for investment in essential business equipment
or for trading losses. Computing self-employment income week by week,
rather than annually, and on a cash-flow basis, rather than an accruals
basis, would mean having to compute business profits twice—once
for tax and once for DWP purposes—an extra reporting obligation
that would eat into the time available for business
activity.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000185">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My
next point is the one that I said that I would come back to. If a bank
loan or other start-up capital were to be subject to the normal tariff
income under capital rules for universal credit with no adjustment or
special disregards, that could substantially reduce or eliminate

                           </div>the claimant’s entitlement. That would be inappropriate where the
loan or capital was used wholly in the claimant’s business, and
it would result in the withdrawal of support for a self-employed
venture at the time when support was most needed.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000186">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The Charted
Institute of Taxation said that special rules will be needed to deal
with fixed and circulating capital used in the business as it develops
and grows, and I ask the Minister to comment specifically on that
latter point. If, as we have discussed, someone with £16,000 or
more is not entitled to any universal credit, will an exemption be made
for someone going into self-employment who has taken out a loan to
enable them to set up a business and get going, or will having that
loan in the bank prevent someone from receiving universal
credit?<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000187">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
imposition of a minimum income floor, which is specifically addressed
in this part of schedule 1, has been justified—or an attempt has
been made to justify it—on the basis that too many self-employed
people under-declare their profits. That is a justification for
targeting those who manipulate their accounts to maximise their claim
for universal credit; it is not a justification for denying support to
what everyone agrees are the majority of cases that really need that
support.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000188">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government have been clear that they want to encourage people to enter
self-employment, and for a significant group of people that is the way
to get off benefits and into work. The great danger is that, by
assuming that those people will all get at least the national minimum
wage for the hours that they work in their businesses, they will find
it much harder. The Chartered Institute of Taxation has circulated some
examples to show how dramatic that effect may prove to be in
practice.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000189">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The notional
income rules in tax credits, the enabling provision for which is
replicated in paragraph (4)(3)(a) to schedule 1, already provide
protection against such abuses. I do not believe that there has been a
significant problem of people overstating their profits in applying for
tax credits, and I suggest that creating an additional power to impose
a minimum income floor adds nothing valuable to the powers that already
exist. What is needed is the sort of wisdom that is built into the
working tax credit system, which, by general consent, has worked well
in supporting self-employment. That needs to be brought across to the
universal credit, so that the significant gains that have been made are
not lost.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000190">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">What is worse
about this provision is that, if every hour produces a deemed income in
the way that the Bill suggests, a business in trouble will be
incentivised to under-declare the number of hours spent on that
business. If the system is set up in such a way, it will encourage
avoidance. An obvious and straightforward point is that, if someone
tells the jobcentre how many hours they have been working on their
business and then say that they worked an extra hour, the jobcentre
will assume that they earned an extra hour of the national minimum wage
and that person will receive less universal credit. That is an
undesirable set of incentives to build into the system, and I am afraid
that it will inevitably

                        <p class="tabbed">We know that
self-employed people work for long periods to get their businesses
going and sustain them during difficult times. Under this legislation,
people who seek to get into work through self-employment will find
themselves in a system that is unsympathetic to what they are trying to
do. That is unlike the tax credit system, which has been very
supportive.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000192">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The White
Paper proposes that the minimum income floor should apply not to new
businesses, but only when they become established. I hope that the
Minister will tell us a little more about what he envisages. That is
certainly a welcome concession, but we need to know what counts as
established. Are we talking about a fixed period at the beginning of
the life of a business, or will there be another way of measuring
whether a business has become established? Nevertheless, it is a
welcome adjustment, and I hope that the Minister will tell us how the
Government and his Department will apply it. However, we all know that
businesses can experience pretty hard times not only in the early years
but subsequently, and for a host of reasons—for instance, as a
result of economic difficulties such as those that we face in this
recession, because a key customer has been lost, because of a bad debt
or a succession of slow payers, or even by taking on a new
employee.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000193">&#160;</a>

failure to do so raises the serious risk that the self-employed will be
discouraged from developing their businesses or, in some cases, from
continuing in business. That is directly contrary to the

                           </strong> I was referring to how self-employment will be
treated under universal credit and to the proposal addressed by the
amendment that a minimum income floor assumed for those who are
self-employed, irrespective of how much they earn from their
businesses. In practice, the worry is that many self-employed people
will no longer get the sort of help that has been provided until now to
enable them to get their businesses started, up and running and
flourishing—and sometimes helped through difficult patches,
perhaps for a long time after the business was started.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000197">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It is a
little surprising that it should be necessary to argue that universal
credit should encourage self-employment at least to the same extent as
working tax credit, particularly at a time when the ranks of the
self-employed—already some 4 million people—are expected
to grow. Ministers rightly draw attention to the potential of
self-employment to assist the economy at difficult times, and people
who previously claimed incapacity benefit will be transferred to
jobseeker’s allowance via employment and support allowance. The
Government clearly want to encourage self-employment, but it seems that
self-employed claimants currently on working tax

			Column number: 523<a class="bkMark" name="Column523">&#160;</a>
                           </div>credit will have to migrate to a significantly less helpful system under
universal credit. According to the experts, some people will have to
give up self-employment as a result, which is
directly contrary to the Government’s stated
intention.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000198">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government may ask what self-employed people are living on if their
businesses are earning little or no profit, but the truth is that the
self-employed often work all hours and submit invoices that may
sometimes not be paid. The income that they receive will go towards the
rent for the premises and the business rates, the salaries of the
people whom they work with, periodic payments on hired equipment and
other normal business expenditure, plus drawings for the proprietor to
live on. The income from the business might have to be supplemented by
a bank loan or start-up grant, or something similar, to meet all the
business outgoings.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000199">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">People will
be worried about whether they will be caught in future by the
£16,000 cap. The bank loan will carry interest
payments—an additional business expense—and unless or
until the income exceeds the outgoings, the business will run at a
loss. Imposing an assumed minimum income that is not achieved in such
circumstances simply ignores the reality faced by such businesses. The
Minister is right on occasion to draw attention to the strengths of his
Department by comparison with other parts of the Government, and IT
systems is a case in point. However, HMRC is good at dealing with and
understanding the needs of the self-employed in a way that the benefits
system is not.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000200">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To sum up,
the success of working tax credit in encouraging self-employment rests
on its recognition, in alignment with the tax system, of the economic
realities of how a business is doing, particularly the need for
investment in business equipment and the impact of trading losses. It
is essential that universal credit is able to cope with a large influx
of new self-employed claimants, many encouraged by the Government,
including through the enterprise allowance.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000201">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The system
needs to give adequate support through universal credit for those
people not only in the early years of their business, but later on in
lean or difficult periods during the life of that business. That has
been accomplished through working tax credit, and I think that it would
be the Minister’s wish to do so with universal credit as well.
However, artificial, assumed minimum income is a real barrier to that
being delivered. There is a clear distinction between profits, on the
one hand, and drawings on the other. The system for universal credit
needs to reflect that distinction if in-work support is to succeed in
promoting work through self-employment, as we all hope that it
will.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000202">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> There are two separate ways in which we need to
consider the amendment. Let us start by being absolutely clear:
self-employment plays a vital part in our economy and society. It can
be an important route into work for many people, including some of the
hardest to help. We want to make Britain a great place to start and
build a business, to enter self-employment and to help small businesses
grow and develop. We have every intention of ensuring that we create a
system that supports and encourages that.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000203">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We are
looking at creating a predictable tax system that rewards endeavour,
better access to debt and equity finance, and reducing red tape. The
right hon. Gentleman rightly referred to the new enterprise allowance,

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 524<a class="bkMark" name="Column524">&#160;</a>
                           </div>a number of ways in which we are currently supplying self-employed
people with the support that they need to develop their businesses. We
will ensure that universal credit provides self-employed people with
the additional financial support that they need to meet their living
costs. That is a given.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000204">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We will do
everything that we can to ensure that universal credit treats
self-employed people fairly and properly and works with and helps the
self-employed. However, that support must be reasonable. In supporting
self-employed people through universal credit, we are removing any
requirement to look for employment. Therefore, that self-employment
must be genuine. In the current system, self-employed people can report
no or very low income from their business activity and continue to
receive full entitlement to benefits and tax credits. We think it right
that, once people are in work, they should generally become more
financially independent and less reliant on benefits.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000205">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We must take
steps to ensure that we protect the taxpayer from supporting people who
have the means to support themselves and their families. We want to
safeguard universal credit, so that it does not end up subsidising
people undertaking unprofitable activities. That is why we have given a
lot of thought to the matter, and why in the White Paper we referred to
the fact that we would set an income floor for self-employed people
equal to the national minimum wage for their reported hours.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000206">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Of course,
common sense must apply. We will not apply the national minimum wage to
a 100-hour week for someone who works all day, every day, or all
evening every evening, trying to make their business work. There must
be a sensible upper threshold, probably around the time of a normal
working week.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000207">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The problem
the other way round is that, if we applied no floor at all and if we
simply provided full payment of universal credit, including the
standard amount that would normally be equivalent to what someone was
paid if they were out of work and on benefits, we would be effectively
saying that the taxpayer would provide financial support if someone
said they were self-employed, regardless of how well they were doing
and irrespective of whether the business was viable or whether there
was any chance of achieving profitability. That would not be sensible,
and it is where we have to draw a line.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000208">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We have
carefully considered the responses to the proposal. Clearly, some
consequences could arise from setting a floor for each hour’s
work. In the Bill, we have provided flexibility to apply a floor in
different ways if doing so is more appropriate. We need to apply a
minimum income floor, alongside the range of support that we are
providing for small businesses. We think that that strikes an
appropriate balance between supporting enterprise and protecting the
public
purse.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000209">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Let
me touch on some of the points raised by the right hon. Gentleman. In
practice, the definition of income for benefit purposes is very close
to the net profit for income tax. However, it is important to consider
the income that is actually available to a person in deciding whether
to pay a means-tested benefit. We must be careful and consider the
nature of their income and how they use it. It cannot be right that
someone can simply write-off a large chunk of income to secure access
to state support. In fact, we are not reinventing

self-employed people for housing and council tax benefit. We are not

                           </strong> We will probably take evidence on that in the
next couple of years as we prepare for universal credit through the
successes of the new enterprise allowance. The new enterprise allowance
has been introduced for, and is funded for, a two-year period, but if
it proves successful, we are likely to want to continue the initiative.
We will want to learn from those first two years and identify the best
way of continuing it in the context of introducing universal credit. I
do not want to give the right hon. Gentleman a definitive answer now,
beyond saying that we recognise the need to support start-up
businesses, which is why, through the new enterprise allowance, we will
give new entrepreneurs who have been out of work for a time the
opportunity to retain part of their benefits for a period while they
enter self-employment. We have not finalised the details.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000213">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I am happy to
accept the right hon. Gentleman’s input on this. The issues are
complicated and there are not simple, straightforward answers. We must
do the best we can to get the dividing line right, so that we encourage
enterprise and protect the taxpayer. That is where our focus lies. We
will continue discussions with external groups, such as the Low Incomes
Tax Reform Group, and work closely with HMRC to use its experience in
shaping this. The DWP and HMRC are working closely to develop universal
credit in its entirety.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000214">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The right
hon. Gentleman referred to a loan, and I think that that would depend
on the circumstances. No one would seriously suggest that, if someone
got a bank loan to buy a van to set themselves up as a plumber, for
example, having that loan in their bank account for three or four days
while they bought the van would lead to their losing universal credit.
That would be crazy. If they had a loan in their account for six
months, it would be different, but I think it is highly unlikely,
because someone would not borrow money, stick it in the bank for six
months and pay the interest for no good reason. We will apply common
sense.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000215">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The right
hon. Gentleman also made a point about avoidance. As I said in a
previous debate on that, there will be a self-reporting mechanism. We
need a mechanism that can establish the monthly payment of universal
credit for the self-employed. We said clearly that we will 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 526<a class="bkMark" name="Column526">&#160;</a>
                           </div>put in place a self-reporting mechanism so that people can ensure that
universal credit payments reflect their
circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000216">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
the end, this will all have to be evened out. There will have to be a
proper assessment at the end of the year of what a self-employed
person’s income was and the amount of universal credit they
received. That was clear when we discussed the issue earlier. There
will be a point of reckoning, to work out whether we paid too much or
too little. The system will clearly be in the interests of those who
are claiming. One reason for introducing the self-reporting mechanism
is to ensure that our information is as timely as possible, so that we
do not end up in the mess we ended up in with the tax credit system.
Where possible, the final figures will be as close to being right as is
feasible.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000217">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We must have
the safeguards I described, and the problem with the amendment is that
it makes it impossible set any floor, and I do not think that that is
sensible. In an extreme situation, it is not enough for someone who
does not really want to look for a job to say, “I’m
self-employed”, and be able to claim the maximum universal
credit with no job search requirements attached. We have to ensure that
we are supporting self-employed people with viable businesses, even
though, as the right hon. Gentleman rightly says, building a business
is a challenge and a struggle. It is not easy, and we need to create a
system that is as responsive as possible to that reality. However, we
cannot support ongoing, consistently unprofitable businesses when,
frankly, the person should be looking for employment opportunities
rather than
self-employment.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000218">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am encouraged by the Minister’s
recognition of the importance of getting things right. I share his view

currently on

                        <p class="tabbed">I
will illustrate what a big difference could be made—again, the
information is from the Chartered Institute of Taxation—by using
the position of a single person, who is over 25, has no children and is
working 30 hours a week. That person is self-employed but actually
earns nothing from the business—getting no money at all would
not be an unusual circumstance for people beginning in self-employment.
Under the current system, if such people were paying rent of £70
a week and council tax of £15 a week, they would get a little
more than £137 a week through tax credits, housing benefit and
council tax
benefit.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000220">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under
universal credit, if people tell the jobcentre that they are working
for 30 hours, they will be deemed to have earned £177.90 that
week, even though in reality they have earned nothing. Assuming that
they are truthful, they will get a total income from universal credit
of £35 a week—more than £100 less under
the new system than under the old system. That is an enormous
difference; certainly, a big enough difference to dissuade a
significant number of people from getting into self-employment at
all—perhaps even big enough to persuade them to give it
up.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000221">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> No. There is certainly a case for having a grace
period at the beginning of a person’s self-employment when the
deemed income would not apply. I hoped that the Minister could be a
little more forthright about it, picking up the point in the White
Paper and encouraging us by at least saying that there will be such a
period.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000223">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
my example, people would be significantly better off if they were not
working at all. I know that is an extreme case, because in the example
they are not earning at all from their business. However, for many
people starting in self-employment, there will be quite a few weeks
when they do not earn anything, and they would be significantly worse
off from being in work because the jobcentre would treat them as if
they were earning £137 a week from their business, even though
they were earning nothing. That is a real problem, and I am glad that
the Minister said that he is anxious to get the provisions right. I am
also pleased that he will talk to the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group,
because it has some helpful
ideas.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000224">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
our example, people telling the jobcentre that  they are
working for 30 hours will lose 30 multiplied by £5.93 from
universal credit that week, so the temptation for people not to be
frank about how many hours they have put in would be huge. That is bad
policy if it creates such incentives. I was grateful that the Minister
said that the jobcentre would not make such assumptions. Perhaps there
will be a cap, equivalent to a full working week, but for people
working 25 to 30 hours on their business, there will be some real
incentive problems as to whether they are frank about how much work
they are doing and how much time they are spending on their
business.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000225">&#160;</a>

Member for Glasgow East will speak in a moment about paragraph (7)(a)
of our amendment, which refers to disregards for people with a
disability. I hope that the Minister will give us an encouraging
response to paragraph (7)(b) about lone parents and their access to a

                        <p class="tabbed">I want
briefly to speak about sub-paragraph (c), which relates to the
desirability of a separate disregard for the second earner in a couple.
Universal credit disregards the first part of the household’s
income and then applies a taper to the balance. In a two-adult
household, it is proposed that the disregard will apply only to the
first earner. The second earner in a couple will have their universal
credit withdrawn at the rate of 65% from their first pound of income
onwards. That means that second earners will have much weaker
incentives than at present to get into a job. The current figure is
39%, going up to 41%, compared with 65% in the future, which is a much
higher rate of benefit withdrawal for second earners.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000236">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That is an
absolutely crucial point for tackling child poverty. The Government
have said that they are committed to achieving the targets on reducing
child poverty set out in the Child Poverty Act 2010, and I welcome that
assurance. However, fiscally plausible strategies for tackling child
poverty, especially when the Government’s resources are so
stretched, rest on encouraging second earners in couples to move into
work and, if they are already working, to increase their
hours.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000237">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On current
figures, 29% of couple families are in poverty if just one parent works
full time. That proportion falls to 7% if the second member of the
couple is in part-time work and to only 3% if both are in full-time
work. Having that second earner in work makes a huge difference to
whether families can earn their way out of
poverty.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000238">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_ParaIndent">In
families with caring responsibilities, according to the Women’s
Budget Group, the second earners, who are usually women, are more
sensitive to work disincentives because it costs them more in time and
money to start work. With a 65% taper applying from the very first
pound, there is a serious new discouragement to second earners to move
into employment.</p>
                        <p class="hs_ParaIndent">The
consequences for child poverty could, over time, be very serious
indeed. In our discussion this morning, the Minister said that he would
use conditionality to require people to increase their hours and move
from a part-time to a full-time job. I suppose that he intends to apply
such conditionality to second earners in
couples.</p>

someone’s earnings and a withdrawal of the standard rate
subsequently. I am asking: what about the second

                           </strong> Potentially a very large one. I have tabled some
questions about that and, of course, the answer to what the cost would
be depends on the level at which the disregard is set. It could be a
very significant sum, and that may well influence what we do with the
amendment when it comes to deciding whether to vote for it. It is
important to recognise the realities of the new environment into which
we are moving. As I say, there appears to be a significant disincentive
for second earners in couples to move into work compared with the
current system.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000242">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If the
Government are going to use the stick of sanctions and all the
paraphernalia we were talking about earlier to force people who are
working part-time to work longer, I am not sure how the conditionality
would work for the second earner in a couple who is not currently
working. Presumably, sanctions might well be imposed on the first
earner to force the second earner to make themselves available for
work. Perhaps the Minister can explain how that will work. Certainly,
he has explained that he wants to impose conditionality on people who
are working for shorter hours to force them to work longer. It seems
odd to be doing that at the same time as making the benefits of work so
much fewer than they are at the moment because second earners in
couples will have no
disregard.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000243">&#160;</a>

this afternoon. As my right hon. Friend said, I will make reference to
paragraph (8) of our amendment. Before I address the details of the
measure, it is worth bearing in mind the context and reminding
ourselves what is in our hands as we go through the Bill. The measure
is, indeed, a major shift in welfare provision in this country. As we
go through the details, sometimes it is easy for us to forget the scale
of the change that is about to be implemented. Despite the many
differences in Committee and, indeed, the general way of things, there
is a core agreement among us about the need for change if reform is to
be introduced. We wish it to be effective and to meet the proper
targets.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000244">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In all the
discussions and disagreements that we have had on the changes to be
introduced, no one in the Committee has said that they think that
disabled people should be worse off as a result of the changes. We all

                           </div>want to empower disabled people, assist them to get back into the
workplace and to live full and proper lives. I do not think that we
should mess up some of our political disagreements in that; we can
share that aim. As we look at the detail, we must ensure that that is
the outcome of what we do. It is reasonable to say that the detail of
these changes should be measured against that big policy
outcome.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000245">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One of the
other struggles that we have when we talk about welfare policy and
welfare reform is that things get very technical. We are talking about
the realities of people’s lives—as my right hon. Friend
has said, the lives lived in messy detail—and sometimes we see
that reality, but it is subsequently translated into technical language
that is hard to relate back. It is particularly difficult for the
people who are living those lives to relate to. What does a disregard
mean? What does a component mean? When does an element apply? That can
be difficult, and we have to remind ourselves that we are talking about
the lives of vulnerable people, who are often trying to make a step
forward and live a full life. The decisions that we make here can
affect them greatly. Our focus this afternoon needs to be on moving
away from that technical detail, which, if I am honest, I do not think
that I have quite succeeded in
doing.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000246">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
essential point of our amendment is to ensure that the disregard that
is proposed in the DWP’s policy paper is an addition to other
possible disregards, not a replacement. If it were to be a replacement,
it could well mean a substantial reduction in the incomes of many
disabled people. I refer to the evidence of two organisations that are
well respected in this field. Family Action has said that if the
disregards are<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000247">&#160;</a>

additive—<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000248">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“households
with disabled members could lose out
significantly.”<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000304">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>For
example, lone parents with a disability would see no benefit from a
disability disregard, because it would be cancelled out by the
equivalent of the lone parent disregard, whereas single people without
children would keep it all. That would create significant
inconsistencies in the system and significant difficulties for disabled
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000249">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Disability Benefits Consortium has reinforced that point by recognising
that we have a complex system of disregards—I can understand the
Government’s motivation for trying to address that and to
introduce some simplification—but, as the consortium has
said,<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000250">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“In the present
system this is not a problem as extra support for someone with a
disability is mainly through the disability element of the working tax
credit and so that then doesn’t get clawed
back.”<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000305">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>The
fact that we do not properly have the additions in the current system
does not give us reason not to introduce it in this system because it
is already addressed by the different elements that we have. It is
important that the disregards that are introduced are additive and not
replacements.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000251">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I should like
to ask a number of questions briefly about the operation of the
disregards and how they will be introduced. Again, they reflect
concerns from the disability movement. If two members of one family are
entitled to the disregard, for example, will they continue to be
entitled to that disregard? If they are not entitled to it, as they
currently are, that would mean a significant loss to a disabled
family.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000252">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Will the
Minister explain how the disregard will be brought into operation in
practice? As I understand it, the briefing note indicated that it would
build on the framework of the work capability assessment and that it
would essentially supplement that. I am sure that he appreciates that
some issues and questions surround that and how it
will work. Many organisations have asked whether they will be
consulted. Has the Minister already undertaken such consultation, or
does he intend to do so?<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000253">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Perhaps most
significantly, there are proposals for a range of changes to disability
benefits, most notably disability living allowance and the introduction
of the personal independence payment. How will that affect people who
currently receive such benefits, and how does that relate to the
disability disregard?<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000254">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is
important that we have this detail because it really matters to the
quality of life of so many people. I am sure that none of us wants to
introduce legislation that would reduce the incomes of disabled people,
who are perhaps among the poorest in society because of their
disability. We want to increase their opportunities, and it is vital
that we obtain the necessary clarifications and assurances to ensure
that disabled people properly get the welfare support that most of us
want them to get.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000255">&#160;</a>

points raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for East Ham about the
position of second earners and the proposal that there should be a
disregard for the second earner in a couple, although it is a household
benefit. I am concerned about the structure of a benefit that
disincentivises the second earner in a
couple.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000256">&#160;</a>

have said on a number of occasions, not just in relation to the Bill,
that they are concerned that we have what they say is the highest rate
in Europe of children in workless households. The problem from a child
poverty perspective, however, is the high proportion of children who
are in poverty but in working households. About 60% of children in
poverty are in households in which at least one adult is undertaking
paid work. Although it is important to improve the working income of
one adult in the household—perhaps by improving their earnings,
by extending their hours, or both—it is also right that we seek
to facilitate access to the labour market for all adults in the
household if we are to ensure that children are protected properly from
in-work poverty and that work is incentivised
properly.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000257">&#160;</a>

Gentleman raised a moment ago. I will say what I have to say first and
then I will be happy to take an intervention from him. He asked a very
good question about what sort of disregard might be appropriate to
incentivise second earners into the workplace and what it might cost.
In that regard, I ask the Minister: what assessment has been made of
that option? This is one of my difficulties: it is not clear whether
Ministers agree in principle that we should do all that we can to
facilitate employment for both members of a couple but feel that that
is unaffordable. If so, what offsetting calculation has been made in
terms of the long-term financial losses of not keeping one member of
the couple attached to the labour market? Or do Ministers, as a matter
of 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 532<a class="bkMark" name="Column532">&#160;</a>
                           </div>principle, not want to see second earners in couples in the labour
market, because they would prefer the second member of the couple to be
at home caring for children, perhaps because they believe that that is
better for child well-being or that child care provision is simply
insufficient to facilitate access to the workplace for lots of second
earners. The reasons may be philosophical and practical, but what
thought have Ministers given to the
option?<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000259">&#160;</a>

Social Justice, which, as  I recall, stated that this would
cost about £750,000. I draw her attention to table A2 in the Red
Book, which includes a calculation with or without universal credit,
and my interpretation is that mini-jobs for both earners are
incentivised. The issue is a mini-job, plus a 35-hour job, where the
second, longer-working-hours person loses
out.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000262">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> There are two problems with mini-jobs and, indeed,
with no job at all. First, those jobs are often the least likely to be
stable and sustainable, and people will not have a genuine opportunity
to progress and improve their incomes. As I have said in earlier
debates, without a clear strategy to ensure that mini-jobs are a
stepping stone to better prospects, I am concerned that designing a
benefit around keeping people in minimal employment will, at best, move
them only just around or above the poverty line. It will not
significantly improve a family’s long-term financial
prospects.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000263">&#160;</a>

second difficulty with mini-jobs and no employment relates to long-term
economic well-being, including, unfortunately, people’s pension
entitlements. People will not build up decent pension pots if they are
not working or if they are working only limited hours for a long
period. I am aware of the Government’s proposals to create a
foundation pension, which I welcome and I look forward to seeing the
detail. However, occupational pensions are an important way of lifting
people into a decent pension income, and we will create substantial
discrepancies if we do not allow and support people building up
earnings early on and contributing to an occupational pension through
the structure of our benefits system. I am concerned about both the
short and long-term financial implications of the
proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000264">&#160;</a>

a household benefit. However, that is largely anecdotal. I have seen

			Column number: 533<a class="bkMark" name="Column533">&#160;</a>
                           </div>no rigorously researched evidence that shows that couples base decisions
about their living arrangements on the design of the social security
system. I have heard plenty of anecdotal evidence, and the odd report
from a personal adviser here or welfare adviser there, but I have not
seen the evidence that shows that that is a significant problem for the
social security system. People really do not choose to make that sort
of decision in that

other substantial point that I want to make about the position of
second earners and the dangers of the Bill’s approach is that we
know that a substantial number of relationships do not last. One in
four children in this country can expect to spend some time in a lone
parent household. That means that if we put couples  in a
position whereby one member is significantly disincentivised from
remaining in and close to the labour market, the risk that that person
may experience relationship breakdown and will therefore find it
particularly difficult to provide support to their children through

                        <p class="tabbed">It is
important that we do not disconnect what will probably be predominantly
women from the labour market when there is that risk of their having to
support themselves, at certain times at least, without the support of a
second earner. There is a very clear need to ensure that we keep all
working age adults appropriately in touch with the labour market,
because that is the best way to cushion them against the shocks and
risks that may come along in future. It is important that we take
protective and preventive measures against those shocks and
risks.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000269">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am interested in the philosophical argument that says that it is right
for lone parents to be in the workplace. I support that
broadly—I want to see lone parents helped into good quality
employment that enables them to support their children, and combine
that with their caring responsibilities. However, there seems to be a
different view when it comes to couples. The hon. Member for Dover
highlights a very interesting question; if the proposed model is that
both members of the couple should do less work, I would like to hear
the Minister explain the analysis behind that, because it is not the
way in which most couples organise their economic and domestic lives.
It may be difficult for couples to make that model work. We know that
men in particular are already reluctant to ask and discouraged from
asking for more flexible working arrangements, so there must be a
reality check, if that is indeed the
intention.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000270">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am not sure that the idea is that there are
two people on part-time work and that that is the incentive. The
incentive is that people should work longer hours and eventually leave
benefits altogether. We should not have benefits going all the way up
the income scale, as happened in the past 10
years.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000271">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> With respect, we are confusing two things. The
benefits that stretched a long way up the income scale have been
payments for children. I think that that is right, because it is about
society sharing the cost of the long-term investment that we all make
in children. The working tax credit, which has supported people on
low-paid earnings, has not stretched up the income scale substantially;
it has been a very specific subsidy 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 534<a class="bkMark" name="Column534">&#160;</a>
                           </div>for low-paid work. I expect that that is the model Ministers broadly
want to replicate in universal credit. I agree with the hon. Gentleman
that the long-term intention is for as many people as possible to earn
at such a level that they have no need to rely on in-work financial
support to subsidise low wages.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000272">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However, I
hope that we recognise that there will be a continuing need to provide
common support for some of the extra costs, including raising children
or costs for those with disabilities and so on. The Government’s
decision to leave child benefit out of universal credit is therefore
welcome. In such circumstances, people have a right to look to the
state to provide additional financial support.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000273">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am
concerned that the design structure of this benefit will damage
women’s economic independence, and we should be worried about
that in the context of the economic well-being of families and of
women. I have two questions for the Minister, and I would be grateful
for his answers.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000274">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">First, I want
to unpick some of the broad statements that have been made about the
impact of universal credit on child poverty. Grand claims have been
made about the number of children and working-age adults that the
Government expect to be lifted above the poverty line as a result of
the welfare reforms. What analysis has been conducted into levels of
in-work child poverty in couple households as a result of the
proposals? I would be grateful if the Minister shared that information
with the Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000275">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly, I
want to ask about the impact on women’s participation in the
labour market and their economic independence. I appreciate that the
Government have carried out equality impact assessments to support the
welfare reform proposals before the Committee, but is there a financial
disincentive that may discourage women from participation in the labour
market? What mitigating steps do Ministers propose to take to support
women’s connection to the labour market? In that context, will
the Minister offer reassurances that the measure will not, probably by
accident rather than design, set women’s economic independence
on a backwards course? I would very much regret
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000276">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Let me
respond in two halves. The hon. Member for Glasgow East commented on
people with disabilities. As she knows, in the White Paper we set out
our proposals for disregards to apply to earnings, which includes
disregards for disabled people, couples and lone parents.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000280">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It is
probably about time that the famous bookcase made its first post-Easter
appearance. Clause 8(3)(a) contains the powers for those disregards to
be put in

			Column number: 535<a class="bkMark" name="Column535">&#160;</a>
                           </div>place through regulations. We could put more detail in the Bill, but as
I have explained to the Committee on several occasions, we believe that
we should maintain flexibility for the current Administration and any
future Administration, so that such matters can be changed in the light
of economic circumstances or the unexpected. My hon. Friends have
referred in the past to a situation where it was necessary to revisit
primary legislation and make a change for people who are blind or
visually impaired. That was due simply to an unintended consequence of
the way that something had been written into the Bill. As I have said,
it was the habit and intent of the previous Administration to leave
flexibility in welfare reform measures where possible, and they did so
on several occasions. There is no intention to leave out lone parents
or disabled people from the provision of disregards. We simply seek to
leave flexibility in the system to deliver what we believe to be the
right approach.<a class="bkMark" name="11042715000281">&#160;</a>
