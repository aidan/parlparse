<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): I beg to move amendment No. 133, in page 34, line 23, after ``effect'' add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`from the day on which stamp duty ceases to be chargeable on the conveyance or transfer of stock or marketable securities (within the meaning of Schedule 13 to the Finance Act 1999)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen Timms):</B> On a point of order, Mr. Cook. Amendment No. 133 seems to be a device to secure a debate on stamp duty under clause 47, which deals with employee share ownership. Clauses 113 to 130 deal specifically with stamp duty and we shall be debating them in future proceedings. To what extent will you allow us to debate stamp duty under this clause, Mr. Cook, given that we have not yet reached the appropriate part of the Bill?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> To the extent that stamp duty is referred to in the amendment, reference to it will be in order when we debate amendment No. 133. However, the main focus of the debate should be on the proposal to delay the new employee share scheme. The proper time for debate on the future of stamp duty will be when we reach clauses 113 to 130.

<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): On a point of order, Mr. Cook. I must convict myself either of more than usual incoherence or of mumbling. In a spare moment, I noted that I was reported as saying in a previous sitting, in relation to the climate change levy, that the Government
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>were driven away from taxing consumers  instead of producers-[Official Report, Standing Committee H, 18 May 2000; c. 297.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, I had intended to say that they were driven to taxing consumers, instead of producers. I am not sure whether it was because I was mumbling that the record of our proceedings is incorrect or whether it was because I was incoherent. Either way, I should like to set the record straight.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With regard to that point of order, I am sure that all experienced right hon. and hon. members of the Committee have had cause in the past to regret what they have said and to seek means of altering the record afterwards. I am sure that Hansard will record the hon. Gentleman's statement with great diligence.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> We are about to discuss a most important section of the Bill concerned with employee share ownership, something that Conservative Members support strongly in concept, even though we have many quarrels with the way in which the Government are promoting it. They are in danger of doing to share ownership what they did to the mass savings market when they abolished personal equity plans and tax-exempt special savings accounts and replaced them with individual savings accounts. That had an overall detrimental effect under the guise of improvement. We shall be looking carefully at the precise way in which the Government are introducing new schemes and abolishing old ones. The amendment is important because it concerns stamp duty on shares. As the Financial Secretary said in his point of order, we shall have other opportunities to refer to the issue; nevertheless it is important in the context of share ownership. If we want to encourage people to buy or take options on shares, save them and then sell them, the level of tax-or whether there is a tax at all-on any such transactions is important.

<P>
Most employers would prefer the London stock exchange to remain the centre for their share dealings and would be dismayed if the Government took action or failed to take action as a result of which a lot of business was transferred to another stock market. That is a real possibility following the projected merger of London and Frankfurt.

<P>
The core of the issue is that in Germany, no tax is levied on share transactions, while in this country, we have stamp duty at 0.5 per cent. That is the clearest contrast, but in fact we are unusual in having stamp duty of any significance. France has a 0.3 per cent. share transaction tax, but Italy does not, except for off-exchange transactions, for which it is 0.14 per cent. Although the United States technically has a tax, it is 1/300 of 1 per cent. Japan has no tax.

<P>
The clear trend is towards the abolition of share transaction taxes. If we hold out against that trend, we face the familiar problem under this Government of becoming an increasingly less attractive place in which to do business. That will be to the detriment of not only the London stock exchange but the wider shareowning public, and will inhibit development.

<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): Will the right hon. Gentleman tell me, as I have temporarily forgotten, when the 0.5 per cent. stamp duty on share transactions was introduced?

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Of course we can always go back in history; indeed, in the context of taxation, we could go back to measures such as the window tax. However, it is more important to consider modern developments. It is perfectly acceptable and tolerable, and it is not damaging, to tax share transactions when national jurisdictions are involved. The development that may have escaped the Liberal Democrats is that capital is highly mobile, and transactions now take place not on bits of paper on the floor of the stock exchange, as they did when the tax was introduced, but on trading screens, and can therefore take place anywhere. For that reason, today and in future, the existence of differential rates of tax between ourselves and other stock exchanges has become especially important. It does not constitute an especially telling intervention to ask when the taxes were introduced and in what circumstances.

<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): Stamp duty was in fact reduced to 0.5 per cent. by the Conservative Government in 1986, and in 1990 the previous Government expressed the view that it would have to be abolished. Members of the present Government have publicly expressed similar views in the past two years.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. It is just as well that we did not have a Lib-Lab coalition for those years, as we would be facing not merely a 0.5 per cent. share transaction tax or stamp duty but a much higher rate. The high taxation party-the Liberal Democrats-is in an extremely weak position to contribute to the debate, unless the hon. Gentleman wants to repent of his errors.</B><P>

<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson):</B> Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that the duty paid relates not to where the shares are traded but to where the company is registered? A company that is registered in Germany or France and trades shares on the United Kingdom stock exchanges will pay no stamp duty on its share transactions because what is relevant is where the company is registered. As a consequence, only companies that are registered in the UK pay for trading shares on the London stock exchanges.

<P>
The right hon. Gentleman might want to bear in mind how many companies have decided to register in the UK. All the evidence suggests that lots of companies are still choosing for a variety of good reasons to be registered in the UK. They include companies that have recently had obvious other options available, such as Vodafone-Mannesmann, which could have decided not to continue to be registered in the UK. However, it has continued here despite the merger because of the benefits of UK registration. The right hon. Gentleman is completely ignoring clear evidence that the stamp duty on shares is not relevant to the issues that he raised.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> We have heard that breathtakingly complacent attitude before. In European terms the United Kingdom is a comparatively low-tax jurisdiction, although that is being rapidly undermined by successive Finance Bills, but that does not mean that we have an unthreatened advantage in world terms. I urge the hon. Lady to lift here eyes a little to further horizons, and to see London and the United Kingdom in the global context in which we are fighting a pitiless day-to-day battle for international competitiveness. Differences between tax levels are an important element of that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> The right hon. Gentleman suggested that my party was not keen on reducing taxes. We would consider the case, as it might have merit. Will he explain why, to judge from the intervention by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight), the Conservatives considered getting rid of the tax in 1990 but still had not done so seven years later?

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs explained that we had a good record in bringing down the taxes, even though we had to contend with the budget deficit. As was evidenced by the intervention by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) and by Ministers' comments, people are blind to future developments. The competitive pressures are increasing, so we need to look ahead at whether it is sustainable for Britain, and in this case its stock exchange, to have a level of duty and tax that is clearly out of line with those of international competitors.

<P>
The Economic Secretary complacently said that everything was fine on the London stock exchange, but there is evidence from the turnover figures for 1998 that London lagged behind NASDAQ and the American and Frankfurt stock exchanges in terms of velocity of turnover. We have a strong position, but we cannot rely on it unless the Government actively take account of the question of differential taxation. We are drawing attention to that.

<P>
We would like to draw the Government out a little more on their plans on the subject. What representations have been made to them? Will they further outline their views about whether it is irrelevant to have a stamp duty tax on shares when our competitors do not?

<P>

<B>Mr. Davey:</B> There is no rationale for delaying the implementation of such beneficial changes to employee share-ownership plans and their tax regime. The fact that the Conservatives want to delay those benefits is bizarre, as all employees attached to such schemes could enjoy them. The right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) did not make a case for delaying the beneficial improvements, so the Liberal Democrats will not support the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The Committee has served a useful purpose, as the Economic Secretary has pointed out something that I had not sufficiently understood before. Previously, I understood that companies registered and companies trading in the UK paid the stamp duty, but I assume that she was right to say that only companies that are registered pay. She has therefore brought to light an extremely important connection between the amendment and a debate on schedule 30 that I shall not begin now, because you would rule me out of order, Mr. Cook. We had that debate in part on the Floor of the House under clause 102, which brings into effect schedule 30. If the stamp duty on share transfers applies exclusively to companies registered here, and if companies that seek to register here have their headquarters here-generally that will be the case, although we must take into account phantom registration-the Economic Secretary is right and there is an additional sum to do. As we shall see when we come to schedule 30, the Government are imposing an extraordinary burden on companies that seek to headquarter here. That burden is unique among G7 countries and the industrialised world, including the Netherlands, which is the headquartering centre in northern Europe. The measure adds a stamp duty differential on share transfers of the stocks of companies that, quite naturally, seek to register where they are headquartered.

<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Therefore, if the Economic Secretary is right, she is admitting that the Government have, either deliberately or-if we assume that the effect is unintentional-by omission, given companies an incentive to locate their headquarters and register elsewhere. They have, from two points of view, given companies such as Vodafone-Mannesmann that incentive. Such companies might go to the Netherlands or to Germany, where they would be exempt from both the stamp duty on transfers and corporation tax on foreign dividends through the exemption system.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that there are reasons why this country continues to be a place in which companies register? There is plenty of evidence of continuing extra registration and of companies choosing to remain UK-registered. There are many benefits, including the low rates of personal and corporate tax, the fact that we have the largest network of tax treaties and our smooth system for takeovers. The evidence suggests that the Government, and not the Opposition, are moving in the right direction.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The Economic Secretary has helpfully brought me to my second point. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells spoke of complacency. I do not suggest that Ministers are consciously complacent. However, the Economic Secretary is in a similar position into which some of us fell in the early stages of the last recession. Although we were told anecdotally, in taxis and other such places, that there was a recession going on, we chose to believe the figures, which told us that there was no recession.

<P>
The Economic Secretary is right, but she fails to recognise why she is right. In the past few years, all the comparisons made by major accountancy firms of the various plausible centres in which to headquarter and register have shown London to have a marginal lead over any other centre in northern Europe. I stress that that lead is marginal. However, that was the situation before they knew about the changes to be made by schedule 30 and when they knew about the stamp duty. The Economic Secretary is telling us that, by introducing schedule 30 and not changing the stamp duty, she is beginning erode the advantages of this country and she rightly trumpets.

<P>
The hon. Lady accepts that where companies are headquartered and registered is important and that we should make this country an attractive place in which to do that. I hope that she will give the Committee a guarantee about some of the large companies that have the option that she describes upon merger and acquisition. In common with every other merchant bank director, merchant banker, banker, lawyer and accountant-with the entire City of London and, indeed, all British citizens-I have a great personal interest in the matter. If the Economic Secretary, who also has a non-pecuniary interest in the matter as a Minister of the Crown who is looking after the public interest, discovers-as I think she will-that major companies are avoiding stamp duty by going to Europe, will she guarantee a change to the stamp duty-

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I may be at fault, but although I am concentrating, I am having great difficulty in identifying much reference to employee share ownership plans. Could hon. Members heed the advice that I have a while ago?

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> You are not at fault, Mr. Cook. You are right. I was grossly misled by the attractions of answering the Economic Secretary's point. Having done so, I will desist from trying your patience further.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Thank you.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The amendment is self-evidently a probing one. Its immediate relevance to employee share ownership schemes is that the stamp duty is obviously a cost and a tax, in a territory that is supposed to be a major tax incentive. As the Government will be aware, no other country in Europe imposes stamp duty on transactions of around £5,000 or less. The UK has the highest level of stamp tax on small transactions. The purpose of employee share ownership incentive schemes is to deliver ownership at the small end of the market. Are the Government considering bringing the UK into line with France and other European countries by removing stamp duty on small amounts?

<P>
My next general point is that the vehicle eqivalent to American depository receipts, which British companies will consider if the merged stock exchange goes ahead, will-to put it bluntly-be a means of avoiding UK stamp duty. The Government are being a little complacent if they think, as the Economic Secretary said earlier, that we are a fortress. Two years ago at a public meeting I asked Lord Simon, then a Minister at the Department of Trade and Industry, what the Government's stance was on stamp duty and the single market. He responded that the Government were well aware of the need to abolish stamp duty and would be looking to do so within the next two years. The Government should reassure us that they are focusing on the issue, in terms both of the lower end of the scheme and of the broader picture of the merger of the stock exchanges, although Ministers will obviously not want to explain their policies now.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The right hon. Member for Wells said that the clause might lead to our doing for employee share ownership what we have done with ISAs, which is to make them much more popular than their predecessors. He is right. We are making employee share ownership much more popular and widespread. Unlike the right hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin), I shall focus on the proposal in the amendment to delay the introduction of the new plan. I look forward to debating stamp duty later. The points made by those hon. Members were effectively dealt with by my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary and I do not intend to explore that subject further.

<P>
The clause introduces an all-employee share ownership plan. The amendment would delay its introduction. As the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton rightly said, that would be an unfortunate change, and a huge disappointment to a large number of people. The Committee will have gathered that what lies at the heart of the Budget and this Bill is the ambition to make the economy more successful and inclusive. We want to build an economy that is modern and decent at the same time, and in which enterprise and fairness are not opposites but complement each other. Nowhere in the Bill is that clearer than in these clauses, which herald a big step forward for employee share ownership in the UK. That is good news for enterprise, productivity and the economy, and extremely good news for fairness.

<P>
I strongly disagree with Opposition Members' attempt in the amendment to delay those changes. Offering employees the opportunity to have shares in their company builds a community of interest between workers and owners, in making the company successful and helping it grow. That is backed by research in this country and the United States, which clearly shows that productivity increases when employees have a stake in the business.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> When the Financial Secretary says that the Opposition want to delay the introduction of the employee share ownership scheme, he is misrepresenting us. As we hope that the Government will take action to fulfil the hypothesis, we want to ensure its introduction without delay.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> No. I refer the hon. Gentleman to the wording of the amendment, which explicitly calls for a delay, pending a change in stamp duty. However, there is no proposal on the amendment paper to make such a change.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Will the Financial Secretary give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> No; I will make some headway.

<P>
The new Rover company will put aside a large part of its shares for its work force. The importance of extending employee share ownership, and of making it easier and more accessible, is increasingly recognised. The changes under discussion will increase the number of firms for which the introduction of an all-employee share ownership plan will be possible and practicable.

<P>
The plan outlined in these clauses has been widely welcomed. It is not only the most generous all-employee share scheme ever introduced in the UK but one that has been carefully designed, with the needs of firms clearly in mind. It was designed with the help of a private sector advisory group, representatives of companies with share schemes, service providers and the Trades Union Congress. I want to put on record my thanks to all those who contributed time and expertise to make a success of the initiative. Two periods of public consultation have taken place on the general shape of the new plan and on the first draft of the Bill. Many hon. Members, including some who are members of this Committee, have been involved in discussions and consultation, and have contributed, in a variety of ways, to the success of the initiative, culminating in these clauses.

<P>
The plan should appeal to big and small companies, as they have had the opportunity to influence the policy. It is an excellent example of how modern government should work. It has been a successful initiative, which the amendment would frustrate and delay. I urge the Committee to oppose the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> We never intended to press the amendment; we intended to find out the Government's thinking on stamp duty and shares. Some of what we have heard has amazed and appalled us. With regard to taxation, this Government have a paper bag over their head, especially in terms of the international arena. They are no friends of the small investor if they persist with a stamp duty regime that almost uniquely-

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The right hon. Gentleman will have heard my appeal earlier and will know that he has the opportunity to make such representations at the proper time when we discuss clauses 113 to 130.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Ever mindful of your strictures, Mr. Cook, I noticed out of the corner of my eye your shifting in your chair. I referred to the small investor in the hope that it would bring us back to the amendment.

<P>
The United Kingdom, Belgium and Switzerland are the only countries that impose stamp duty for on-line trades of £5,000-or the equivalent-or lower. Not only will stamp duty on shares damage the culture of share ownership but the Government are persisting with a structure that fails to exempt smaller trades that are exempted by almost all other countries. The other two countries that fail, like us, to exempt smaller trades both have rates of duty that are substantially lower than those in the United Kingdom.

<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The Government are contradicting themselves. They are promoting employee share ownership, which we support, but they are failing to reform the structure and the tax duty rate that would make it more of a success. We shall be returning to such matters, but we want to put down a marker that everything that the Government do will fail-like their action to counter smuggling-unless they look at the tax structure. They must return to the root problem and look at the differential duty rate. Some of what the Minister said has given us more cause for alarm than we had when we began the debate, but I shall leave the matter there. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Clause 47 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Schedule 8</center></H4>
<H4><center>Employee share ownership plans</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 135, in page 228, line 41, after ``company'' insert ``and the trustees''.

<P>
We come now to the details of the new scheme. I say up front that most of our amendments are designed to iron out issues and to improve the scheme. They are not hostile to it. We welcome a share-owning democracy even more than the Government, and we are delighted that they are a convert to something that has been a strong plank of Conservative party policy for many years. The amendment would tidy up a drafting defect. Partnership agreements must be three-way agreements so that they can cater for how trustees deal with dividends and voting rights.

<P>
I had a plaintive meeting with the officer of the Inland Revenue who has been responsible for more than 12 years for implementing the approved profit-sharing scheme that was put in place by the previous Labour Government and developed under the period of Conservative government. The combination of that scheme and qualifying employee share schemes, with save-as-you-earn schemes underneath, represent a package of share ownership incentives that are more generous in some areas than that which is replacing them. The Government say that they want to keep SAYEs, but certain measures in the Bill will put an end to qualifying employee share ownership trusts. SAYEs without QUESTS are much less attractive than with them.
 
<P>
Many regret the abolition of the approved profit-sharing scheme and what went with it. Not everything in the new arrangements is an improvement, which forms an analogy to PEPs, TESSAs and ISAs. The points that we want to raise are constructive. We will work through them as we work through the schedule.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I acknowledge the fact that the hon. Gentleman has tabled a constructive amendment, which contrasts to the one moved by the right hon. Member for Wells. I hope to persuade the hon. Gentleman that the amendment is unnecessary.

<P>
Paragraph 34 of schedule 8 provides for an employee to enter into an agreement with the company that authorises it to set aside part of his salary to buy partnership shares before the deduction of tax. Under the rules of the plan, the money deducted from the employee's salary needs to be held by trustees of the share plan on his behalf in a bank or building society account. The trustees will also acquire the shares on behalf of the employees and hold them in trust. The amendment seeks to include the trustees of the plan as a third party to the agreement.

<P>
The partnership share agreement will set out the rights and obligations of employees and companies in accordance with the rules of the plan. It will also include details of what the trustees are required to do by the legislation. The agreement and partnership are primarily between employer and employee, but the trustees are also an essential part of the plan as they safeguard the interests of employess.

<P>
The trustees are already required by legislation to fulfil their obligations under the plan. They are concerned not solely with partnership shares and the money set aside by employees to buy them but with all the shares and funds that they hold on behalf of employees. Schedule 8 clearly sets out their obligations in relation to the plan itself. I suggest to the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs that to include the trustees as a necessary party to the agreement is not required. The legislation does not prevent the trustees from being a party to the agreement if the company wishes. There is no need to change the legislation to achieve that when the duties of the trustees are already specified in the schedule.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman also raised some points about the future of the approved profit-sharing scheme and of QUESTs. We shall deal with those matters on later amendments. I recognise that what he proposes is constructive and I hope that my response has been helpful. The amendment is not wrong, but it is unnecessary, so I hope that he will feel able to withdraw it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We are happy to withdraw the amendment on the basis of what the Financial Secretary said, but I ask the Government to check that, under the wording as it stands, the situation is automatically covered in terms of trustees, dividends and voting rights. I am not certain that what he said about that was necessarily correct, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 137, in page 233, line 24, after ``Schedule.'' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Where an individual's emoluments are not liable to deduction under section 203 ``salary'' shall mean such emoluments as would have been liable to deduction under section 203 had the individual held an office or employment assessabe to income tax under Schedule E or was not otherwise exempt from such deduction.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
This is another amendment on a drafting point. Partnership shares and, as a result, matching shares can be available only to employees making deductions out of salary. However, salary is defined for the purpose with reference to pay-as-you-earn, hence only UK employees would be eligible to participate. That prevents the plans from including, for example, employees who are temporarily seconded to Europe or elsewhere and have NT tax codings. We think that it may be out of kilter with European rights to exclude such employees.

<P>
More generally, in today's international world, we see no reason why long-term employees of an international business should be excluded. We do not see that to do so would affect the revenue in any way. The amendment would make it clear that ``salary'' also means salary that would have been subject to PAYE had the individual been within the PAYE net.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> It is improtant to recognise the increasingly global nature of many companies. As the hon. Gentleman said, multinational companies increasingly provide incentives to their employees on a worldwide basis. We need to recognise that fact. By awarding shares to employees, such companies unify their interests across international boundaries and across a variety of businesses within their groups. We strongly support share ownership; UK companies lead the way in establishing global share plans, and we hope that that trend continues and that multinationals will base their global employee share plans here to an increasing extent. However, we cannot give relief on UK tax for people who do not pay that tax. The amendment would extend the salary deduction mechanism and the limits on partnership share purchase to individuals who are not subject to UK tax on their salaries. In reality, we cannot legislate to give UK tax relief for foreign tax that is payable on income from foreign employments, which would be the effect of the proposal.

<P>
There is nothing to stop a company from allowing its non-UK employees to buy shares, but we cannot provide tax relief for them. If companies want employees to be able to buy shares, they may do so as a separate matter outside the plan. The new plan, under case 1 of schedule E, allows companies to award free shares to employees who are not UK taxpayers.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Surely there can be no question of obtaining tax relief when UK tax is not paid. I do not agree with the Financial Secretary that the amendment would result in, for example, an employee based in Belgium being awarded a UK tax rebate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> That is the issue that the schedule addresses. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that giving relief to people who do not pay UK tax is nonsense, but that is why the amendment does not make sense. The new plan was designed with the wider international picture in mind; we have consulted widely and provided flexibility. For example, companies operating on a worldwide scale will be able to award matching shares, to adapt their plans to operate in the UK. That will be attractive particularly to UK subsidiaries of US corporations, which can copy the structure of their US plans to set up similar ones for their UK employees. Given that background, the amendment does not make sense.

<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Someone is making a mistake, and I believe that it is the Financial Secretary, because he has not understood that we intend the same results as he does.

<P>
We should focus on three groups of employees. First, we should consider those who are employed in the UK, have a PAYE tax coding and are covered by PAYE. They are uncontroversially within the scheme. Secondly, we must consider those who are not British, are employed by overseas subsidiaries or branches,
are not UK taxpayers and are uncontroversially not covered by the scheme. It is no part of the amendment's purpose that such employees should receive rebates. If our amendment suggests that, it has a technical defect that should be dealt with by the Government's introduction, on Report, of a properly worded amendment.

<P>
The Financial Secretary excludes a third class of employees, at whom we are aiming our amendment, and to whom my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs may have referred too briefly. Those employees are UK taxpayers but because they are not employed in the UK, they are not PAYE-covered. They are separately coded. There is no reason why, under the Financial Secretary's logic and ours, those people should be excluded from the scheme. That is the group of employees who would be introduced into the scheme through what is perhaps a misdrafted amendment.

<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
I turn to the question of whether the amendment is misdrafted. I may be in error, as the Financial Secretary and his advisers may know something that I do not. However, our logic was that, as the scheme is not a rebate scheme in the sense of enabling someone to get on a cross-channel ferry and come to the Inland Revenue to ask for some cash but is a relief scheme, it is unlikely in practice-I flash the irony card; I mean that it is impossible in practice-that someone who is not a UK taxpayer will receive relief, because there will be nothing to relieve. We do not believe that the undoubted fact that the amendment might cover a set of employees who are not UK taxpayers would lead to any adverse consequences in practice, because they would not receive the relief. We would therefore be left catching the group that we want to catch-people who are UK taxpayers, but are not PAYE coded.

<P>
If we are in error in the sense that under the scheme, by some means that we had not imagined, a non-UK taxpayer could collected an uncovenanted bonus of cash from the Inland Revenue, we have misdrafted the amendment, and it should be redrafted and reintroduced by the Government. I hope that we can reach agreement on the matter.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The amendment is in error not because it would have the effect that the hon. Gentleman suggests but because it does not make sense. I shall attempt to explain the technicalities.

<P>
The amendment refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>an office or employment assessable  under Schedule E.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That concept is mistaken. It is not the office or employment that is assessable but the emoluments or income from an office or employment. However, even reading the amendment to refer to emoluments of the office or employment, it would still not be sufficient. Emoluments are chargeable only if they fall within one of the three cases of schedule E, which consider the residence status of the employee and whether the duties are carried out in the UK. Merely to impute some theoretical schedule E charging provision would still not be sufficient.

<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Jack </B>(Fylde): For the benefit of the Committee and to allow us to follow his argument, will the Financial Secretary refresh our memories on the three cases of schedule E?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Indeed. The three cases of schedule E take into account the residence status of the employee and whether the duties are carried out in the UK. Merely to impute some theoretical schedule E charging provision would still not be sufficient, because there is a requirement to investigate further the individual's circumstances and the location of the duties. I do not believe that the amendment correctly tackles that issue, or, even if one were to take a generous view of what the amendment is intended to do, that it is appropriate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Will the Financial Secretary give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I want to make one final point.

<P>
In the case of an employee who is ordinarily resident in the UK but working overseas on a foreign assignment, as the duties are performed outside the UK, the employee is not chargeable for UK income tax on his salary. I hope that that provides some reassurance for Opposition Members.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> It is not a controversial issue. I did not understand what the Financial Secretary read out, but it may be right. In the spirit of trying to get the Bill right, will he, stripping away all the jargon, go back and find out whether there is, as we believe, a class of employee who is a UK taxpayer but is not covered under the PAYE provisions? We have not simply arrived at that conclusion as a result of inspiration on the tube from Charing Cross. It has been suggested to us by people who know about such matters. If he should discover in the privacy of his room that such a group of people exists, will he assure the Committee that he will introduce a suitable and properly drafted amendment on Report to cover that group so that we can rest easily?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am certainly happy to consider the matter further. I can give the assurance that he requests. I was talking about an employee who is ordinarily resident in the UK but working overseas on a foreign assignment. That employee could not buy partnership shares under the plan because he or she has no UK salary against which tax relief could be given, but could buy any amount of shares outside the plan, without enjoying the tax breaks. It is not clear what class of individual we are discussing, but if Opposition Members want me to suggest circumstances in which they think that there might be a problem, I would be happy to look at them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The territory has been well aired. We will not push the amendment to a vote. I took the Minister to say earlier that, although he appreciated the problems in the Bill, the Government would in principle like such schemes to cover employees globally, if effective ways of doing so could be found.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Again, it depends what sort of people the hon. Gentleman is talking about. People who pay UK tax are clearly covered. We want to allow for the possibility of global plans, but much of that depends on matters outside our control.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Without going off at a tangent, a number of issues arise in the case of employees who go abroad for a time and then come back, in terms of what employee shares they may have acquired when they return. It is a question not just of time of issuance but of whether employees enjoyed the tax privileges at a time of disposal. Schedule 8 was drafted with no regard to the habit of employment, which the Minister readily acknowledged, in terms of people going around the world to work. The Government need to think about that issue if we are to have a modern, workable
share employee scheme. I took the Minister's acknowledgment of the globalisation of employment to imply that the Government were interested in doing so.

<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I am following my hon. Friend's arguments carefully; is he saying that employees who are paid in this country, who have entered a plan, and whose company want to send them abroad for a period may think, ``I'd love to go abroad, but the way in which the plan has been drawn up under Government rules means that there will be a tremendous tax penalty.'' The planning of the company and its allocation of employees where they are most needed would be disrupted by the way in which the schedule has been drafted.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for fleshing out a key point. The same could apply in the case of people coming back to the country, having got shares in a company as a result; they may be subject to a different capital gains tax regime from that of the scheme. The thinking in the schedule is extraordinarily narrow in terms of today's world; it treats Britain as an island, which will be an increasingly problematic perspective.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> That is mistaken. We have taken a wider view in drawing up the plan. Indeed, we took careful and deliberate account of the important issues that he raises in designing it. In our consultations, I was party to a discussion with experts to ensure that as far as it was within our control we took account of the wider issues that multinational companies faced.

<P>
In particular, the new plan can be adapted to produce a very similar share plan in the US which will qualify US employees for US tax release. We have taken the concerns on board.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Will the Minister give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I will not give way again.

<P>
If there are categories of individuals about whom Opposition Members are concerned, I would be happy to consider them. I repeat that we have been conscious of the issues in designing the plan and in drafting the schedule.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> As the Financial Secretary will not answer a simple question, I shall have to repeat it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Barry Gardiner </B>(Brent, North): In that case, the right hon. Gentleman should ask a difficult question.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman want to intervene?

<P>
<B>Mr. Gardiner:</B> No. I just did.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I want clarification from the Financial Secretary. He said that the Government had taken all the matters into account, discussed them with experts and considered them carefully. My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs pointed out in his sage comments that, effectively, a United Kingdom national serving abroad could not benefit from the scheme. That worries me. As an example, if BAe Systems, a major employer in my constituency, adopted the proposals in schedule 8 in the new form of a company share scheme, those serving in Saudi Arabia who do vital work for the country on the Al Yammah project could not benefit from that form of employee share ownership. Will the Financial Secretary enlighten my constituents and me as to how, in all his consultations, he took their potential interests into account?

<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am not sure whether the right hon. Gentleman was present at the start of the debate, so he might have missed my remarks on the matter. The basis for the plan is that it offers relief from UK tax. Those who do not pay UK tax cannot be given a relief from it, so the issue does not arise.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> We will write to the Financial Secretary to try to point out groups of employees whom we think are UK taxpayers but would not be included in such a scheme. I think that he agreed to consider those groups and, it they are not covered, to do something about them. On that basis, we can withdraw the amendment happily.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 138, in page 234, line 10, leave out from beginning to end of line 42 on page 235 and insert-

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Dividends<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>53. The first £1,500 of dividends received in any tax year in respect of plan shares held on behalf of a participant shall not be subject to any additional charge to tax. Dividends received on plan shares held on behalf of a participant may be applied by that participant in the acquisition of partnership shares.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 139, in page 246, line 31, leave out from the beginning to end of line 7 on page 248.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The provisions of schedule 8 relating to dividends are confusing and possibly punitive. I am aware that the Government have received comments on the subject from commerce and industry generally. Dividends are tax free up to £1,500 in aggregate, but only if reinvested in shares. The reinvested shares are subject to forfeiture with a tight three-year rule from acquisition. We see that regime as unnecessarily grudging and mean-spirited. It is hardly likely to be worth anyone's while to avoid tax by taking dividend shares and selling them on within the scale in which they can be granted.

<P>
The Chancellor seems to have accepted the tax loss on the dividends, so it seems sensible to leave matters at that and allow dividends to be invested voluntarily as partnership shares, hence the £1,500 a year limit. The Chancellor would get hs tax in the end, of course.

<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I fear that the Chancellor would not get his tax in the end under the proposal, which would carry a considerable costs and do nothing to encourage employee share ownership. It would provide a simple route for additional salary to be paid tax free to employees. For most employees, the amendment would provide higher tax charges than in the Bill.

<P>
The plan provides the opportunity for employees to reinvest the dividends arising on their plan shares in additional shares. That is in addition to the free, partnership and matching shares of the plan. Employees could reinvest up to £1,500 of dividends each year. Those dividends would not be treated as income if kept in the plan for three years, and could be withdrawn free of income tax. The gain in their value while in the plan would not be subject to capital gains tax.

<P>
The amendment proposes that dividends up to £1,500 a year
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>shall not be subject to any additional charge to tax.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We propose that there should be tax relief on dividends only when the employee reinvests them in the plan shares and holds them for a time. That is evidence of our intention to encourage employees to become shareholders in their companies and to hold those shares for a period of time.

<P>
The amendment would allow employers to provide £1,500 of tax-free dividends each year instead of taxed salary, without there being any additional investment in shares. That would cost the taxpayer an additional £15 million a year. The second part of that proposal states that dividends
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>may be applied by that participant in the acquisition of partnership shares.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would take away from companies the option of offering dividend reinvestment, and it is uncertain how it would operate in practice. Therefore, it is in everyone's interest that the Bill remains as it stands and that the amendment is not agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The Financial Secretary is slightly missing my point. He commented on a revenue cost of £15 million. However, that figure is purely conceptual because dividends received will be reinvested and qualified, so the Revenue will not take any tax from them. The scheme is structured to give that result.

<P>
The problem with the rules is that they involve more record keeping and that the three-year forteiture rule could prove unfair. The simplification would not cost any revenue because employees are unlikely to say, ``Oh well, we will take the money and not reinvest it''-most are only too keen to build up shareholdings in their companies. The issue is not that there may be an actual cost of £15 million, but that there will be a cost to the Revenue and to companies and that the forfeiture may be unfair. It is not an issue of huge moment, and the thought behind the Financial Secretary's response is understandable, but he misses the point.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The amendment says that the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>first £1,500 of dividends received in any tax year in respect of plan shares held on behalf of a participant shall not be subject to any additional charge to tax.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman says that money will be reinvested automatically, but that is not necessarily the case. Our proposal means that there will be relief when it is reinvested, which gives an incentive for reinvestment. It is not supposed to be a source of tax-free income-there is no justification for that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> As matters stand, there will be no tax revenue because everyone will reinvest, but the price of that is complication, paper keeping and potential unfairness. The Financial Secretary suggests that, if the measure were simplified in the way that we suggest, there is the risk that one or two people might simply take the money. However, that is improbable because most employees are only too delighted to build up shareholdings, especially when they are tax-free, as the Financial Secretary knows from his experience in commerce. The added attraction for reinvesting the dividends is the capital gains tax-free nature of that investment.

<P>
Amendment negatived.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 134, in page 236, line 22, leave out from ``not'' to end of line 25 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a dependent subsidiary within the meaning of section 86 to the Finance Act 1988'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Without the amendment, the list of qualifying companies would be too restrictive and would exclude many unlisted companies that need majority shareholders, such as venture capital houses or other strategic investors. That is precisely the sort of company for which employee share ownership is desirable and necessary, to encourage growth in share value and return for investors and to constrain what is paid in salaries and wages.

<P>
The object of the Government's exclusions is to ensure that all-employee share option plans are operated only by independent companies, although a test already exists in the employee share legislation. A dependent subsidiary is one that is operated on a non-independent basis-in relation to other companies within the group, most of its business is at arm's length-which can result in an artificial share price. Crucially, there is a requirement that a company escapes dependent subsidiary status only if the parent company auditors are preapred to certify that it is independent. Surely that provides the third party control on which the Inland Revenue is already prepared to rely. The anxiety that led the Government to restrict the scheme is already subject to a degree of policing, and might be subject to slightly more policing if necessary. It must be wrong for the Government to exclude many businesses from the new growing economy that they want to encourage.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> As the hon. Gentleman said, the plan does not allow the use of shares in subsidiary companies unless the parent company is a listed company. The value of shares in subsidiaries is open to manipulation, as the prospects of an unquoted subsidiary can be changed completely by parent company decisions, which can artificially increase the value of its subsidiary's shares in a way that does not reflect the subsidiary's profitability.

<P>
The amendment suggests that the dependent subsidiary rules in the Finance Act 1988 could be used to identify subsidiaries whose shares would be acceptable for the new plan. Those anti-avoidance provisions are fairly complex, and meeting their requirements would impose significant administrative burdens on companies. The directors of the parent company would be required to certify that the relevant requirements were satisfied, and an auditor's report would need to be obtained. That contrasts starkly with the simple requirement in the Bill that when a subsidiary's shares are used, the parent company's shares should be quoted on a recognised stock exchange. There would also be a problem of uncertainty for companies that became dependent subsidiaries after the plan had been implemented. Corporation tax deductions that are already allowed could be at risk-

<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Dorrell </B>(Charnwood): Will the Financial Secretary explain why it is more difficult to use the shares of a subsidiary of an unquoted company than of a quoted company? I do not accept his argument, and I do not understand the distinction that he draws between the subsidiaries of a quoted and an unquoted company.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The disciplines in the quotation and listing process provide safeguards and limit what can be done with the shares of a subsidiary.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I do not think that the Financial Secretary is correct. Will he write to me to set out the limitations, in the listing rules, on what a quoted company can do with its subsidiaries? When he does so, will he enlarge on why he draws such a distinction? My understanding is that a quoted company has the freedom in the way that it uses its subsidiaries that an unquoted company has.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I think that my point is correct, but I am happy to write to the right hon. Gentleman to expand further.

<P>
There is no question of denying access to the plan to employees who happen to work in a subsidiary company. They, too, can take part. The subsidiary company can operate the new plan using shares in the parent company. Alternatively, the parent company can include employees in the subsidiary in its new plan. The right hon. Gentleman's objectives can be achieved, but the arrangements contain safeguards that are helpful and appropriate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We understand the issues, but the Government do not seem to accept that dealing with subsidiaries in such a way will exclude many new unlisted businesses that might be viewed as subsidiaries of a venture capital business. Surely those are exactly the businesses that the Government would want to have employee share schemes. It is no good for the Financial Secretary to say, ``These are the problems and this is what we are trying to stop.'' If our solution is deemed not to be adequate, he must find a constructive solution that will include such companies. We shall press the matter to a Division unless the Government are willing to explore ways in which to ensure non-exclusion in respect of qualifying for the plan.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I sense that the Committee wants to make reasonable progress. There is no great division of principle among us on the matter. I strongly support what my hon. Friend has just said. I shall declare an interest, although it may not be relevant. I am a director and shareholder of a private unquoted company. I am also in conversation with venture capital interests about the possible formation of other companies.

<P>
Companies that are to be backed by venture capital interests are, by definition-at least in their early days-unquoted. I do not understand why, if they choose to do so, they should not be free to use their shares in the employee share scheme, which I welcome. Nor do I understand why the Financial Secretary draws the distinction between the subsidiary of a quoted company and that of an unquoted company. He as undertaken to write to me on that second point, but I hope that he will reflect on what my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs said about how the rules under the schedule will impact on companies that are backed by venture capitalists, who will often take more than 50 per cent. of the equity with the result that they would count as subsidiaries within the accounting rules. Will the Financial Secretary also refer in his letter, which I am sure will be copied to other members of the Committee, to the broader questions raised by my hon. Friend?

</FONT>Question accordingly negatived.

<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the Eighth schedule to the Bill.

<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I draw to the Financial Secretary's attention the injustices under the schedule regarding national insurance, which the Government may not have thought about. A low-paid employee who enters a partnership share agreement will pay lower national insurance contributions and could lose some entitlement to social security benefits. The schedule recognises that because it requires employers to warn their staff to that effect, but such a measure is discouraging to such employees who are surely the sort of people whom the Chancellor wants to encourage and help.

<P>
I am sure that the Government did not intend to penalise the low-paid, as that would be mean-spirited. They have made arrangements in somewhat similar situations to cater for such matters by ensuring that employees' entitlement to social security benefits is not affected. If they wish to achieve their objective, they should consider taking such action under the Bill. There are also complications in the national insurance contribution scheme and we should like the NIC exposure of employees and employers simplified by relating the maximum charge to the actual benefit that the employee receives.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is behaving in what he considers a diligent manner, but he is referring to amendments about benefits that have not been selected for discussion. Will he confine his remarks to taxation?

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I accept your admonition, Mr. Cook. In essence, you are correct. Those specific amendments were not selected for technical reasons because they relate to national insurance.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The amendments were not selected because they relate to benefits. Technicalities have nothing to do with the matter.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I accept your point, Mr. Cook. We are talking about an employee share benefit scheme, to which the incidence of national insurance is relevant. It is wrong for the Committee not to be aware of how the Government make the scheme unattractive, particularly to the low-paid. I hope that they will reconsider matters.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> We are well aware of the issues that the hon. Gentleman has raised. Our key concern was to ensure that low-paid employees were not excluded from the benefits of participation in the scheme. They should have the opportunity to take up share ownership in their employer. Information will be made available to employees to help them to decide whether they want to run any risk of damaging their future benefit entitlement if they choose to buy shares. Some will still decide to purchase them, if they consider that the advantages outweigh the potential loss of benefit entitlement. It should be up to them to decide. Easy fixes cannot be applied to overcome the possible difficulty to which the hon. Gentleman referred. The Inland Revenue has worked closely with the Department of Social Security in examining the issue. The approach that emerged from that work-which is the correct one-was that we should ensure that everyone has full information on which to base a decision about share purchase; that is the right approach.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I am disappointed that that is the position. The Government must realise that that makes the scheme unattractive; it removes motivation for lower-paid employees because it threatens something of great importance to them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I wish to make it clear that we are talking about people whose income is in a narrow range: potentially 1 per cent. of eligible employees would be affected, so I think that the hon. Gentleman is overstating the impact of the difficulty.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 125, in page 264, leave out lines 4 to 10 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`if they were held by the claimant would have been business assets of his within the meaning of section 2A'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 126, in page 264, line 33, leave out ``(a)''.

<P>
No. 127, in page 264, leave out lines 35 to 37.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Schedule 9 deals with the detailed rules for reliefs of transfers of shares to employee share schemes and, broadly, copies the arrangements for QUESTs. The amendments cover related territory. The provision for roll-over relief for sales and gifts to ESOPs are largely copied from the Finance Act 1989 but the capital gains tax regime has changed since then-not least in the Bill, which overturns a lot of the old minimum holding requirements for business assets. It seems somewhat illogical to retain the 11-year-old provision in the new climate. The arrangements should therefore reflect changes elsewhere in the Bill. ESOPs can also hold non-voting shares. It is unlikely that they would have full participation on other counts, so a 10 per cent. dividend or winding-up entitlement is likely to be difficult to maintain in a company in which employees get non-voting shares.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 126 and 127 address the provision that would prevent a shareholder from selling shares from an ESOP and subscribing for new shares, which could happen in the case of refinancing. We cannot see what the tax objection to that could be. The disqualification for CGT roll-over should be abolished where the seller puts money back into the business.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The reason for the 10 per cent. requirement, which amendment No. 125 would remove, is to encouarge small companies to allow their employees to acquire a sizeable stake in the company while not creating barriers to the setting up of share plans. The relief is not intended merely to provide an outlet for proprietors to sell a small number of shares while effectively retaining full control of the company. That would defeat the purpose of the roll-over relief and of the new plan. The reliefs are being provided to encourage employees to acquire a real stake in the companies for which they work. In the case of small companies, that can be achieved only if the roll-over relief is confined to cases where a sufficiently large stake in the company is released to the share plan for the benefit of employees.

<P>
The relief was discussed with the advisory group in the run up to the Budget. The 10 per cent. limit was accepted by the group as a necessary element in the new relief and has been used for QUESTs, without anxieties being expressed. It is significantly more generous than the equivalent provision in the United States for ESOPs, which sets the test at 30 per cent. Setting aside a reasonable shareholding for employees in order to give them a suitable size stake in the business and linking their interests with those of the company is an important element of the new plan and should be retained.

<P>
We do not believe that a case can be made for allowing shareholders to obtain roll-over relief on selling their shares only to reacquire shares in the same company. Nor do I understand why shareholders would want to do that for genuine reasons other than to acquire shares under the new plan, which is specifically catered for.

<P>
To allow reinvestment in the same company would be risking abuse. We do not want arrangements under which shares simply go round in a circle and back to the shareholder who originally held them. We want the shares to remain in the share plan trust for the benefit of employees. It is a valuable relief for shareholders and provides an important outlet for the disposal of shares that might be difficult to sell on the market, but the key purpose is to facilitate the acquisition by the work force of significant shareholdings in the company through the share plan, not reacquisitions by proprietors of shares that they have previously held.

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> These are not major issues, and we do not intend to press them to a Division. However, in light of the other changes that the Government have made, the Government's and the Revenue's thinking is unnecessarily restrictive, to little end. The 10 per cent. requirement is intended as an incentive to make decent amounts of shares available for the scheme. However, given the position of shareholders with other business assets, the value of the relief is not great. As a result of the restriction, shareholders are unlikely to make available to employees the 7 or 8 per cent. that they might otherwise. When the roll-over relief was more valuable than it will be under the Bill, it might have been an incentive to ensure that the amout was at least 10 per cent. However, the scheme may suffer as a result of the requirement, because shareholders will find other, more attractive ways of disposing of the shares.

<P>
A venture capital issue is also involved. A shareholder may put 11 or 12 per cent. into a scheme, but later, within the specified time period, the company may expand or try to raise funds. In such circumstances, it would be ridiculous if the original shareholder could not agree to put the money back into the business. If the business needs money, that is a good source. Again, an anti-avoidance dogma is at work, along with a failure to realise that the business and the employees may suffer as a result.

<P>
We shall not press the amendment to a Division. I merely hope that one day the Treasury and the Revenue will have a commercial perception of the impact of their actions as well as a narrow tax-avoidance perception. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Schedule 9 agreed to.

<H4><center>Clause 49</center></H4>
<H4><center>Phasing out of approved profit sharing schemes</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Clause 49 abolishes the approved profit sharing scheme, which is seen as the natural quid pro quo of the new scheme. As we shall discuss, the future for QUESTs is made difficult by the other arrangements. The Government have so far suggested that they will retain save-as-you-earn schemes. Is that a long-term commitment? If approved profit sharing schemes, QUESTs and SAYE are phased out, leaving just the Government's new scheme, that will reduce rather than increase the maximum amounts that can be taken up, just as the individual savings account arrangements reduced rather than increased the amount that people could invest on a tax-efficient basis.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> We considered carefully whether to retain save as you earn, and decided that we should do so. That decision has been widely welcomed.

<P>
The approved profit-sharing scheme, which is dealt with in this clause, has existed for more than 20 years, and has been popular with some companies. However, its lack of flexibility limited its appeal to many others, as I see the hon. Gentleman acknowledging. The new plan introduced in clause 47 includes the most attractive features of the approved profit-sharing scheme, together with greater flexibility and new features that companies have told us are necessary to make the plan more attractive and to meet the needs of their businesses.

<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Clause 49 does two things. First, it allows new schemes to be approved, provided the Inland Revenue receives the application for approval with full supporting documentation by 5 April 2001. Secondly, it stops tax relief on the appropriation of shares to employees under an existing profit-sharing scheme after 5 April 2002. We are allowing companies to run down their existing profit-sharing schemes within a reasonable and workable time scale and in an orderly way, which allows them time to set up a new plan if they choose. I can assure the Committee, as has already been announced, that we intend to retain the popular SAYE schemes.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I add that the approved profit-sharing scheme, although less flexible, had the advantage of being simple. The Government will no doubt have noticed that the response by the Confederation of British Industry to the new arrangements is to comment that, while the new arrangements will be appropriate for larger employers, their complexity will make them unattractive to small and medium-sized companies. It hopes that the Government will arrive at a simpler scheme for smaller private companies, along the lines that it has proposed.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> It is true that there is a great deal of flexibility in the new plan, but that does not mean that each plan, as implemented, needs to be complex. A range of choices is available to companies, and it is perfectly possible to design a simple plan for a small company. The plan introduced in clause 47 allows small companies to do precisely that.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 49 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 50</center></H4>
<H4><center>Phasing out of relief for payments to trustees of profit sharing schemes.</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 132, in page 35, line 12, leave out ``6th April 2002'' and insert ``31st December 2002''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 124, in page 35, line 20, leave out ``6th April 2002'' and insert ``31st December 2002''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Clause 50, as the Financial Secretary said a few moments ago, arranges for certain aspects of transfer from previous schemes to the new scheme. Amendments Nos. 132 and 124 address the same issue: first, in relation to buying shares; and, secondly, in relation to expenses. Under profit-sharing scheme legislation, trustees have nine months in which to acquire and appropriate shares to employees, and to meet administration expenses. The Bill does not challenge that. However, the deadline for payments to approved profit-sharing scheme trusts is 5 April 2002, as specified in clause 50(3). If the appropriate deadline is also 5 April 2002, it is not feasible for the trustees to receive the sums and appropriate shares in a single day. Under the legislation governing such schemes, the trustees would be obliged to invite employees to participate and check that there were no ineligible employees. I do not think that the Government intend such a stealth deadline to exist. It would surely be fairer and more honest to keep the deadlie of 5 April for contributions and give the trust nine months in which to appropriate shares and meet expenses. That would mean a deadline of 31 December 2002.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I shall endeavour to help the hon. Gentleman. I acknowledge the constructive way in which he has made the proposals. I am aware that some companies have said that they would like more time to phase out their profit-sharing schemes and bring in the new all-employee plan. For example, the accounting years of some companies end on 31 December, and those companies may prefer to change to the new plan at the start of their financial years. Putting in place a plan for January 2002 could be difficult, especially for companies with many employees who all need to be told about it. Some companies may prefer to work towards a launch in January 2002. Throughout the process, we have listened to constructive suggestions. Consistent with them, I see no difficulty in allowing a short extension to the time limit.

<P>
The amendments do not achieve their intention. They need to refer to 1 January 2003 rather than 31 December 2002, which is a technical point. Another consideration is that if the change is made to allow companies to claim tax relief, a similar extension will be needed for consistency to ensure that employees have the benefit of tax relief on shares up to 31 December. That would require an amendment to clause 49, but is entirely consistent with what the hon. Gentleman proposed.

<P>
I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment on the basis that I will undertake to table suitable amendments on Report to achieve the purpose that we have agreed is desirable.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Financial Secretary for his response. I am glad that the Government appreciate the point, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

</UL></FONT>

<P>
This is a probing amendment. I am glad to hear that the Government have reaffirmed their commitment to keep SAYEs, but considerable uncertainty has been created by leaks and by some other measures about whether the Government intend to abolish QUESTs in due course. Given that much of the speculation has been created by certain Budget press releases, it is only fair that they end it so that employers can plan their remuneration strategies for the year ahead. Do the Government intend to phase out QUESTs?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> If agreed, the amendment would effectively state that the relief would continue so long as it were possible for the relief to continue, which would not be an especially helpful addition to the Bill. Since its introduction, the relief has been little used. There have been fewer than a dozen claims in the past 10 years. It was introduced in the expectation that it would encourage shareholders to dispose of their shares to a trust for the benefit of their company's employees, but has not succeeded in achieving that to any significant extent.

<P>
The provisions introduced by clause 48 for transfers of shares to the trust for the all-employee plan under clause 47 replace that relief and we expect the new relief to be more widely used. It has far fewer restrictions than the old relief and those restrictions were at least part of the reason for its lack of popularity. Shareholders have until 6 April 2001 to claim relief under the old rules for transfers to QUESTs. They will then have the opportunity to transfer their shares into a trust for the all-employee plan, using the new relief. There are no provisions in the Bill, and none are proposed, to remove the other reliefs associated with QUESTs. Naturally, we keep all such matters under review, as is the case for the wider QUEST reliefs and others, but we are not intending to remove any of the reliefs under the Bill.

``(13) for the avoidance of doubt, the occasion of a qualifying transfer within subsection (3AA) above shall not be a disposal by the trustees for the purposes of the taxation of chargeable gains Act 1992''.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Amendment No. 120 would remove the tortuous double negative in the original provision and make it more understandable in relation to the provisions of section 69(1) of the Finance Act 1989. Amendment No. 122 makes the point that, while not immediately obvious, there is no capital gains tax charge on the QUEST when a new ESOP purchases from it the shares at less than market value, which it could do to avoid useless cash building up inside the QUEST and creating exposure to claw-back charges or other tax costs if QUESTs are to be further curtailed. The amendment would clarify the position.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Clause 55 allows the trustees of a qualifying employee share ownership trust, commonly known as a QUEST, to transfer shares to the trustees of an employee share ownership plan under clause 47 without triggering an income tax charge. The measure allows companies to use shares that they already hold in a QUEST in the new plan, so that they can make a smooth transition from their existing arrangements to the new plan. To qualify, the shares must have been held by the QUEST on 21 March 2000, which was Budget day, or be bought by using funds held by the trustees on that date. That is to ensure that companies cannot take undue advantage of the measure by putting large amounts of shares into the QUEST after the change was announced. Companies may be tempted to do that because generous tax reliefs are associated with QUESTs.

<P>
The two amendments relate to the situation in which shares are transferred to the new plan by the trustees of a QUEST by gift rather than for consideration. Amendment No. 120 substitutes a reference to shares transferred with or without consideration for a part of the clause that is concerned only with transfers where there is consideration. It is therefore unnecessary. The clause already makes provision for transfer by gift in subsection (3), which extends the definition of a ``qualifying transfer'' to include transfers from a QUEST to the new plan where there may be no consideration for the transfer.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
There is no case for amendment No. 122. It would provide a CGT exemption on the transfer of shares from a QUEST to the trustees of a new share plan. The purpose of clause 55 is to provide for such a transfer without triggering an income tax charge on the trustees-in other words a clawback of the deduction given for corporation tax to the company for its contribution to the QUEST. It is not intended to provide any special tax privileges to QUESTs by removing a capital gains tax liability and nor should it do so.

<P>
Gifts holdover relief for capital gains tax is available on the transfer of business assets. Business assets for the purpose of this relief cover all unlisted shares and shares in a listed company where the trustees hold not less than 25 per cent. of the voting rights of the company. So for the many smaller companies that can and do claim holdover relief there will be no capital gains tax charge on transfer of the shares to the new plan. I see no need to introduce further tax breaks for the big companies that have already done pretty well out of the QUEST reliefs.

<P>
Clause 55 allows companies to use shares that they already hold in a QUEST in the new plan and it allows them to buy shares with the funds they hold in a QUEST and transfer them to a new plan. As it stands, the clause allows new companies to make smooth transition from their existing arrangements to the new plan. We all agree that that is a desirable state of affairs. I hope that the Committee agrees that the amendments are not needed.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> These are not hugely material points, but there is an underlying point of principle here. Where companies transfer from existing QUESTs into the new scheme, I cannot think that the Government intend that there should be unnecessary tax liabilities on so doing in error. These amendments and one or two subsequent amendments aim to ensure that that is not the case. The Minister does not consider that either amendment is necessary, as the position is already covered. We would obviously find it inappropriate if it subsequently arose that that was not the case. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 121, in page 38, line 26, after ``not'', insert ``manifestly''.

<P>
This amendment deals with a similar point. There could be doubt as to the precise market value of an unlisted company on the date or, due to late trading, the market value of a highly volatile listed company might close at a lower price than the strike price. The amendment uses the rubric that the Government use in schedule 9 to afford a little flexibility to cover those situations.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I hope that, again, I can persuade the hon. Gentleman that this is already covered. There is already a definition of market value in the clause. It is to be found in subsection (3), which introduces new subsection (3AC) into section 69 of the Finance Act 1989. It gives the phrase ``market value'' the same meaning as in schedule 8 of the Bill. Paragraph 125 of that schedule includes a definition that applies for all purposes of the new plan, with one minor exception. That definition allows the Inland Revenue and the trustees to agree that the market value shall be determined by reference to a particular date or dates, or the average of the values on a number of dates. That provides plenty of leeway to enable shares to be valued in a sensible and reasonable way, which is the hon. Gentleman's aim in moving the amendment. The matter is already catered for, so I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that comfort. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 117, in page 39, line 4, after ``by'', insert

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or by the order of or on behalf of'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The amendments make the same point in slightly different contexts. The Treasury will be aware that in practice funds are often not physically transferred into a trust account. They may be retained by group companies and held to the order of the trustees. Beneficial ownership of the sums is transferred to the fund, but banker's charges are saved on remitting sums from the company of the trust and are needed back again to subscribe for shares. Similarly, for a group company that has committed itself to a fund and could incur accounting consequences for so doing, but has not yet transmitted the funds, the benefit of the provision would be lost without our amendment. It is a technical point, to which we hope that the Government will be sympathetic.

<P>
On amendment No. 118, although QUESTs are required, under schedule 5 of the Finance Act 1989, to be UK-resident, their bank accounts are not. It is possible for funds to be held by an institution that is technically neither a bank nor a building society-a US savings and loans company, for example. I am sure that the Government do not want to penalise them when the trustees allow that to happen. Amendment No. 119 makes the same point.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> As we have discussed, clause 55 allows the trustees of a QUEST to transfer shares held in a QUEST before Budget day to a new all-employee plan trust without triggering a tax charge on the QUEST trustees. We have extended that to any funds that the QUEST trustees may hold in a bank or building society account on Budget day, which could be used to acquire shares in a company. We need the cut-off point of Budget day to prevent companies seeking to take advantage of the upfront tax relief that they receive under the QUEST rules as well as the benefit of clause 55 by putting large sums of money into QUESTS, which would be used to buy shares that would then be released to the new planned trust as and when required.

<P>
Amendment No. 117 would extend the definition of funds held by the trustees on Budget day to include funds that have been committed or resolved to be paid to them. That is a broad description of those funds. The terms in which the amendment is drafted could include a private unwritten resolve to pay something into the trust in the future. It would be difficult, and perhaps impossible, to police such a broad definition.

<P>
I accept that some owner shareholders have long-term commitments to transfer shares to a company QUEST. The upfront corporation tax relief available for companies that may payments to QUESTs continues unchanged. Shares can still be passed, through QUESTs, to employees using the SAYE scheme and in the profit-sharing scheme until it is phased out in 2001. So there are ample opportunities for companies to make use of funds and shares put into QUESTs after Budget day, or, indeed, to rearrange their affairs to take advantage of the new plan.

<P>
You may wonder, Mr. Cook, why we are so hard on companies that want to use their QUEST as a feeder trust for their new all-employee share plan. Although that would certainly help companies that set up QUESTs for the reasons originally enacted in 1989, other companies would use that route to secure a large upfront tax deduction, leading to a significant loss to the Exchequer.

<P>
Amendment No. 118 has a different intention-to extend the meaning of ``bank and building society'' to include the overseas equivalent. However, where QUESTs hold funds on deposit, the trustees are required under schedule 5 of the Finance Act 1989, which sets out the rules for QUESTs, to hold them in a bank or building society and not in the overseas equivalent. The wording of the clause reflects those requirements and uses the same wording as schedule 5. The clause refers to the type of account in which trustees of QUESTs must hold their funds. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment on that basis. I may have made a slip of the tongue when I referred earlier to the phasing out of the profit-sharing scheme and the year 2001; I should have referred to 2002.

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Amendment No. 118 is clearly unnecessary, given the Financial Secretary's remarks. Amendments Nos. 117 and 119 cover the same point. There may well be legal dispute due to the Bill's drafting, if the funds are legally committed and the documents are signed but happen to sit with the bank account of the company that holds them in a trustee capacity. The point in question is not the improper use that may be made of tax matters but the potential legal dispute. Should that arise, and if the funds were clearly committed, I think that the courts would find against the Government. The amendment would help the Government in their drafting. Ultimately, however, companies are legally protected when there is a bona fide situation. On those grounds, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would extend the list of things that QUESTs are allowed to do, to enable assets to be transferred at any time, and not just on Budget day. Most companies may decide that the Government's new AESOPs are better able to provide employees with incentives and remunerations suitable to their situations than are QUESTs. However, it would encourage employees to establish the new schemes and use spare cash trapped in QUESTs, if that cash could be unlocked and passed on directly to a new AESOP. We cannot understand the logic of the Budget day limitation on the movement of that money.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The amendment would add the gifts to trustees that it describes to the list of qualifying transfers that do not give rise to a tax charge on the trustees. However, the section to which the words of the amendment would be added defines how some of the money received by the trust can be applied for a qualifying purpose, so the amendment does not make sense. When the shares are transferred by gift, there are no sums involve for the trustees to apply. If the intention behind the amendment is to allow shares to be transferred by way of a gift from a QUEST to a trust for the new all-employee plan, it is unnecessary. As we have said in relation to amendments Nos. 120 and 122, the clause allows for that in subsection (3). I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Financial Secretary for his clarification. That is the intent of the amendment; it was not clear to me that subsection (3) provided for it. Given those assurances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
The Government have provided five new sections to the Taxes Act 1988 to extend employer-funded training to education and training that is provided by a third party and paid for directly by the employer. Applying common sense, the Government's objective could be achieved by inserting just two words in section 200B, as the amendment would provide. There is conflict between the DTI and the Treasury in that regard because, while the DTI envisages several fancy things being included in the new arrangements for individual learning accounts, the Treasury wants to ensure that such fancy things are not supported through tax relief to companies. The amendments suggest a much easier way of dealing with the issue.

<P>
<B>The Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo):</B> I was a little confused by the hon. Gentleman's remarks because they were directed to an amendment that was not selected, amendment No. 163, which attempted significantly to shorten some provisions in the Bill. That amendment contains some technical errors; I am happy to speak to the hon. Gentleman afterwards to explain what they are, but because it has not been selected, I cannot refer to amendment No. 163.

<P>
Amendment No. 162 seeks simply to include training that the employer procures as well as provides in the exemption from the cost of employer-financed work-related training in sections 200B and 200D of the Taxes Act 1988. The narrow provision of the amendment is not necessary because the current relief covers both ``provided'' and ``procured''. I hope that on that basis the hon. Gentleman will withdraw it.

The purpose of this amendment is to clarify that the new provision should not penalise employees who are, in effect, being trained for promotion.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> In the interests of directness, I assure the hon. Gentleman that the provision will not penalise employees who are seeking training for promotion. It stops the payment of moneys that are remuneration, not those that are payment for a course. If he is seeking an undertaking that it would not preclude those employees from having such opportunities, I am more than happy to give it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Paymaster General for that confirmation. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 166, in page 42, line 24, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2A) For the purposes of subsection (2) above, the fact that contributions to be made by the employer vary according to the levels of the remuneration of the employees, the length of their service, the nature or responsibility of their duties or similar factors shall not be regarded as meaning that they are not available on similar terms.'.<P>

<P>
In practice, employers may want to target contributions to the particular circumstances of staff involved. Education for people in a particular division may be different from and more expensive than that for people in another division. The purpose of the amendment is to clarify that the Government are not stipulating that everyone has to receive exactly the same amount of cash in respect of training.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> At this rate, I am tempted to ask whether we can finish the rest of the Bill by 11.25.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman's amendment goes further than he suggests-

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Will the Paymaster General give way?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> If I may finish the point, I am sure that we can have a joke outside the Committee, rather than waste the Committee's time.

<P>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs is seeking an assurance with regard to the fairness of treatment of employees, and the avoidance of undue burdens on the employer. If he casts his mind back, he will remember that the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that all employees must be treated fairly, in the same way, and that such opportunities should be open to all employees. The purpose of the provision is not to put unfair financial obligations on employers, but to make sure that higher-paid employees do not benefit disproportionately. For instance, an employer might agree to match the funds that the employee puts in. That covers the point that the hon. Gentleman made about some training courses being more expensive than others. It is not the courses themselves that are important but fairness and equality of treatment, and ensuring that the same criteria are applied to all employees. That is what ILAs are designed to achieve.

<P>
That will probably clarify the matter for the hon. Gentleman, and I am sure that he will be happy to withdraw the amendment on that basis.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I confirm that that is what the amendment sought to clarify. On the basis of the Paymaster General's statement, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 169, in page 276, line 32, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`1A. In section 168 of the Taxes Act 1988, subsection (5)(e) shall cease to apply, and sections 168A to 168G of that Act shall cease to apply.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> As the Committee will be aware, the new car provisions are tied to the list price of the car, even though, as part of the Government's worthy campaign to end rip-off Britain, the list price will be abolished as a wholly inaccurate guide to the true market value of a car. Therefore, the amendment says that the price should be the higher of either the second-hand value of the car if immediately resold by the employee-which is arguably the benefit that he would receive-or the cost to the employer of providing the car. The second-hand value may be low, but using the list price does not make sense, as it is already virtually a concept of the past.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The new company car tax regime is another in the series of important, imaginative and ambitious environmental reforms that we are introducing through the Bill. It is a major revenue-neutral reform of company car taxation that will help to protect the environment. Cleaner and more fuel-efficient company cars will be rewarded by linking the tax charge to the cars' exhaust emissions. It will give company car drivers and their employers a significant tax incentive to choose more fuel-efficient cars. I hoped that the whole Committee would welcome that important step forward. The hon. Gentleman says that the list price is about to be abolished, but I can reassure him that it is not.

<P>
I hope that the proposals in the amendments will be rejected. They would impose a significant regulatory burden on employers and create inequities between employees driving identical cars, who would receive different tax charges. In addition, the amendment would cost £650 million a year in lost tax and employers' national insurance contributions. The existing company car tax regime and the new environmentally friendly regime being introduced take as their starting point the car's recommended retail price-the list price. That information is easily accessible and is the same for everyone.

<P>
The Opposition's first alternative-the expected resale value on the open car market, less the value of certain exempted accessories-would mean that every company car needed to be independently valued every year. We all know that an almost new car fetches a considerable amount less second hand than it cost only a few months previously. Car values vary across the country. Before the employer could work out the value of the car benefit that he was providing for each employee, he would need to have each car valued. That would place an enormous extra burden on business.

<P>
The second alternative is equally unfair. Large companies that buy large fleets of cars inevitably obtain much bigger discounts than small companies that buy one or a few cars. Therefore, a company car driver who works for a small employer would pay more tax than someone who drives the same model of car, but works for a large employer.

<P>
It is important to bear it in mind that the company car tax charge on the employee represents a proxy for the value to the employee of having that car available for private use. Having an employer who is able to negotiate bigger discounts does not decrease that value. The right approach is that the charge should be based on the same price for all employees who drive similar company cars. Currently, that means the recommended retail price or list price. That information will continue to be available. I hope that the Committee will reject the amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I believe that the Financial Secretary is mistaken, in that by the time that the new arrangements come into operation, it is likely that list prices will no longer exist. Therefore, the Government will be forced to deal with the matter. Clearly, the cost is the only option left in that situation. We understand the logic behind using the list price, as long as the list price meaningfully exists. However, the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission may deem list prices to be inappropriate. The matter will have to be dealt with at some stage, but we shall not press the amendment to a Division.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> For clarification, I wish to say that the Competition Commission has not endorsed the abolition of recommended retail prices for cars and there is no reason why we cannot continue to use them in the foreseeable future.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>and Y is the mileage which the car travels on business travel (as defined in section 168(5) in the year.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
For some extraordinary reason, the new provisions treat equally an employee who, as a perk, is provided with a car exclusively for personal use and someone, such as a sales representative, who uses a car exclusively for business use. That must be unfair and inappropriate. Surely that was not the Government's intention.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman is wrong. We are treating the same all employees who have a car available for their private use. The amendment would cause significant difficulties. One problem with the existing arrangements is that people are subjected to a lower rate of tax if they drive more than 18,000 business miles and to a lesser discount if they drive more than 2,500 business miles. That provides the incentive for people to drive extra miles that they do not need to drive. It is estimated that, at least, an additional 300 million business miles are driven each year than are necessary, because people want to qualify for the discounts under the existing arrangements.

<P>
The amendment would make matters worse still, because all company car drivers, not only those who come near the current thresholds, would have an incentive to drive extra business miles to reduce their company car tax. It would also be a major new headache for employees. Our proposal does away with the need to keep records of business mileage only for tax purposes. The amendment would require businesses to keep records not just of whether an employee had crossed the threshold, as under the existing arrangements, but of the exact business mileage driven and of the individual's total mileage-business and private. The employer would then have to calculate the individual tax charge for each employee, which is a nightmarish proposal.

<P>
The amendment would also cost the Exchequer and the national insurance fund £1.5 billion a year. Apart from that, it is a good idea.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Will the Financial Secretary place in the Library details of where that huge figure came from and how it was calculated?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I shall be delighted to send to all members of the Committee the details of how the figure was arrived at.

<P>
We announced the shape of the new scheme in 1999. We have given employers, employees and fleet managers plenty of time to plan. The message is simple: a fuel-efficient car means paying less tax. That will be in the interests of everyone, and I urge the Committee to reject the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> As ever, the arrangements reveal the Government's disconnection from commercial reality. We are aware of people potentially undertaking unnecessary business mileage to qualify, but selling is one of the most important activities in today's economy. Sadly, it is not the value of manufacture that matters, but the ability to sell. The new arrangements will lead either to dishonesty or to problems for salesmen who are provided with cars and who genuinely use them for selling. The rules will lead to the notional concept that the salesman cannot use his car for personal mileage, so that he is not taxed unfairly. Dishonesty will then be encouraged and people will use the vehicles on the side. It is unfair to have the arrangements as they stand for a salesman, when the car is used genuinely as part of his job. The amendments seek to get at the fact that the new arrangements do not deal with that situation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> They certainly deal with that arrangement, because people who use a company car can opt for a fuel-efficient car, in which case they will continue to benefit from low rates of taxation. The hon. Gentleman is wrong to suggest that we are out of touch with commercial reality. His suggestion that the employer would have to calculate a different tax rate for all employees, based on the actual number of miles that they had driven privately and for business use, would be a regulatory nightmare. It is he who is out of touch with commercial reality. I hope that the Committee will swiftly reject the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The Financial Secretary may not be aware, but employers are already obliged to keep accurate records of business mileage for staff to whom they provide cars. Obviously, keeping the business mileage records also keeps the non-business mileage records. Ironically, that burden, to the extent that it is relieved, is welcome.

<P>
It is nonsense to argue that lower taxable benefits on fuel-efficient cars relate to the issue of the provision of a car to a salesperson when that car is used almost entirely as part of the individual's job. It is simply wrong to tax such people at the same rate as would be used if their cars had been provided as perks. The Government should be aware that considerable ill will is generated by that proposal, because it is unfair and from a Chancellor who never ceases to tell us that his measures are designed to be fair and entrepreneurial.

<P>
I would not argue that our amendment is ideal. It exists to create what, in theory, would be the fairest arrangement of the lot. We shall not put it to the vote now, but the matter should be returned to in the other House with a corrected and refined approach. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Schedule 11 agreed to.
