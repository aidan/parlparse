<H5>9 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes </B>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey): I beg to move amendment No. 34 in page 2, line 3, at end add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"for as long as there is annual agreement by Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 2 deals with the non-continuation of existing temporary legislation, particularly that which relates to Northern Ireland. New provisions for Northern Ireland will be found in part VII. The amendment is a probing one. I wonder whether the new provisions should be a continuation of the existing temporary provision, but drawn up to allow for the agreement of both Parliament and, more important, the new democratic body--the Northern Ireland Assembly.
<P>
The amendment also raises the question whether temporary provisions should come to an end rather than be extended. The consensus of opinion in Northern Ireland over the next few years may be that temporary provisions should come to an end. The Government said clearly on Second Reading that they wish eventually to remove the temporary provisions. I do not argue that the provisions should not continue, but the reason for continuing the regular review is that we are keeping legislation that provides for it.
<P>
Until now, Parliament has had one debate every year and other debates periodically on whether to keep emergency and special powers under existing terrorist legislation. I shall discuss later something that we debated on Second Reading--whether the Bill as a whole should be reviewed periodically. Ministers were positive that they had not excluded from their minds the possibility that Parliament would be given the opportunity to review the Bill as a whole. The amendment, however, does not deal with the Bill as a whole. It seeks a periodic review of its provisions for Northern Ireland.
<P>
I raise two other points. First, one of the benefits of having the proposals periodically return to Parliament--the amendment suggests an annual review--is that Parliament would have the opportunity to consider Northern Ireland matters and to be updated by Ministers. Broad, democratic debate would not be hidden away.
<P>
Secondly, although security matters are not devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly, the members of the Assembly clearly have the greatest personal and local interest and are the ideal people to express a view. I do not pretend that they should have the final say, but the amendment suggests that they should be able to express their view. They should be permitted to contribute to the conclusion that emergency powers should continue, even if others make the final decision. If the Assembly says no to the continuation of emergency powers, those powers clearly should not automatically continue.
<P>
The amendment gives us the opportunity to consider whether the Northern Ireland Assembly should have a role in the discussion of such matters, together with Parliament. It could allow the Bill to be a marker between now and the time when Westminster ceases to legislate for Northern Ireland.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Lidington </B>(Aylesbury): Like the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes), I believe that it is important that some way is found for Parliament to debate regularly--perhaps once a year--how the legislation is administered, and whether its powers are effective and remain necessary. The amendments and new clauses on the amendment paper--some tabled by myself, some by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey--would give effect to that aspiration, although in different ways. I hope that, before we conclude our discussions in Committee, the Government will tell us how they perceive the way forward with regard to parliamentary scrutiny and consideration.
<P>
I have some sympathy with what the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey said about the desirability of engaging the Northern Ireland Assembly in the work of scrutiny and, like him, I hope that the Govenunent will find a mechanism to accomplish that desirable objective.
<P>
Can the Minister give the Committee a clue as to the Government's assumptions about the length of time that the temporary provisions will be carried over? I accept that any such decision must be contingent on events in Northern Ireland, which are inevitably subject to a fair degree of uncertainty, but surely the Government have at least some working assumptions. It would be helpful if they could share them with the Committee.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office </B>(Mr. Adam Ingram): I appreciate that the amendment is a probing amendment and that we should examine such issues because, clearly, they are important and worthy of discussion by a wider community of interests outside the Committee. It is worth my outlining the transitional arrangements. The Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996 will expire on 24 August of this year. In due course, it will be replaced by the Bill, once enacted, which will be brought into force early in 2001. We do not have a precise date, but when I say that it will be in force early, I mean early, because we want to make sure that the various agencies involved are comfortable and familiar with the new procedures before we dispense with the existing legislation.
<P>
Between 24 August and when the Bill is enacted at the beginning of next year there will be a transition period during which it will be necessary to retain the EPA, as amended by schedule 1. The amendment is based on the premise that the transition period will continue indefinitely. I want to make it clear that the transitional period will not have an indefinite lifetime, but will cease early in 2001.
The amendment refers to annual agreement by Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly. Points of view were expressed on Second Reading about the need for such scrutiny, given that existing legislation is subject to scrutiny, and whether that should apply to the new corpus of law in relation to terrorism throughout the United Kingdom. As the hon. Gentleman said, that will be dealt with in terms of amendments to the Bill and will perhaps be better explored in depth at that later stage.
<P>
In one sense, I accept and understand the basis on which points have been made about the views of the Northern Ireland Assembly and the people of Northern Ireland, as the matter relates to their society. However, the Northern Ireland Act 1998 clearly separates powers into those retained by the United Kingdom and those devolved. The function, purpose and import of devolution is that bodies that are set up should deal with the matters for which they are responsible, while we deal with matters for which we are responsible. There will be interfaces. Protocols have been drafted, and if a view were expressed on a matter that was within the Assembly's powers, the Government would obviously take it into account. However, the provisions could not be subject to approval as proposed in the amendment, as that would be outwith the powers that the 1998 Act established for the Assembly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> The Minister says that the EPA's cut-off point is August. If the Bill received Royal Assent before the summer--there is no reason why it should not--it would not be necessary for the EPA to be extended because there are transitional provisions in part VII. Will he confirm that?
<P>
I understand and agree that the UK Parliament should provide similar legislation for the whole of the UK, as in the continuing part VII carry-over. Will the Minister confirm that he as a Northern Ireland Minister and the Government have no objection to the Northern Ireland Assembly expressing a view on the matter, even if it cannot be required to have a formal agreement or non-agreement entitlement?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Let me deal with the provisional period first. We have a belt-and-braces approach intended to ensure that there is no vacuum. I accept that the Committee understands the need for that. Even if the Bill receives Royal Assent before the expiry date, there will be a period after that for the commencement of the new legislation. We want to be sure that everything is in place and functioning properly, which is the reason for the transitional aspects. They will cover the carry-over period before what is in effect new schedule 2, to which I will refer later, bites and becomes part of the legislation. We must cover all eventualities in the Bill, which is why we have drafted it as we have. Things would not work in quite the way in which the hon. Gentleman has expressed. It would be nice if they could do so, but we must protect ourselves, not simply as legislators but as society overall.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned a view being expressed. We find that the devolved Administrations express views on a range of issues, which is part of the bedding-down process. Northern Ireland seems distinctly different because of that society's terrorist aspect. It would clearly be wrong for any Minister in the UK Government to say, "We don't want you to have a view, and we will not listen if you express it." The Assembly would be expressing its view on a cross-community basis, one would hope, about what was happening on the ground and how it felt its society was evolving. We should absorb such cross-community views.
<P>
We are into the question of how to evaluate the quality of the debate and the views expressed. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman understands that the views could not simply be one-sided, but that cross-community views would add to the quality of our final judgment as to how to move issues forward. Politicians, with all respect, do not necessarily have all the information available, especially intelligence and security information that may belie what is on the surface. It is therefore fundamental to ensure that that becomes the determining factor in how Ministers decide whether to alter, remove or substantially amend existing legislation that protects everyone. They can take account of such a view, but they do not necessarily have all the information available that would be available to, for example, myself as a Minister responsible for security, to the Prime Minister or to the Secretary of State.

<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> The Minister is being helpful. The Bill contains a provision relating to commencement orders for its different parts, which may result in the usual bureaucratic delay between when the Bill comes into force and when the button is pressed, because the commencement order will come later. Do the Government intend part VII and the relevant schedule to come into force before the end of this calendar year at the latest, to send a clear message that they envisage only a short carry-over for the EPA? It has been suggested that the danger is that clause 2 will leave an open-ended carry-over. In trying to inspire a new confidence about homegrown views on security by introducing a package of measures that will phase out special measures and place Northern Ireland in the same position as the rest of the United Kingdom, the Government need to let people know that a sword will not hang over them indefinitely. I hear the Minister say that, whatever the Government's view, the Assemblies in Wales and Northern Ireland, like the Parliament in Scotland, are entitled to express views on all matters, even if the Government do not want them to do so.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Hon. Members will be aware that they may speak more than once. Interventions should be as brief as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> If we had been working to a different timetable, the transitional arrangements would not have been necessary. The Government intended to introduce a UK-wide Bill, defined in terms of Lord Lloyd's review, the Government's response to that review and subsequent consultation. We are working hard against a timetable. It would have been better if we had not needed the transitional arrangements, which we want to remove as quickly as possible. I would not like to set a date, because many of the ways in which the matter is handled will be outwith Ministers' direct responsibility once the 41 42 Bill is being implemented by the various agencies involved. If those agencies are not comfortable with some aspects, and require further clarification, a vacuum and a hiatus may develop. If we specify that the EPA will cease to apply by a set date, we may, because we are hard up against that date, have to resile on that, which I would not want to do. It is therefore better to proceed on the basis of a commitment that the the EPA will be subsumed and short-lived, but give ourselves the protection that in the event of good reasons for it not to be short-lived it will continue to provide protection.
<P>
I understand the hon. Gentleman's anxiety about the fact that the time scale is open-ended, and we are conscious of that. If, for whatever reason, we encountered a problem, we would have to revisit the matter, because underlying the Bill is the principle that it be subject to scrutiny and review. We do not want to avoid scrutiny. We shall have to revisit the Bill if it is not biting as we expect. That is the best assurance that I can give at this stage. Specifying a definite time scale would not be helpful. We want the Bill to be UK-wide.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> The Minister is being entirely reasonable. I can imagine the notes that civil servants provide on such issues, and, in my mind's eye, I can envisage him drafting his own, more succinct notes. What arrangements do the Government have in mind for Parliament to be consulted on the interim period in relation not only to the clause but to part VII and the schedule? As the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) and I said, one of the features of special legislation--and irrespective of whether cross-party agreement is reached on whether there should be a review of the Act--is that Parliament wants to be able to review what is happening.
<P>
There will be much reasonable pressure on us from both sides of the community in Northern Ireland and that will come to us in the form of requests for questions to be raised in Parliament. As Ministers will know, a convenient way of doing that is to have the possibility of meeting regularly to discuss Northern Ireland matters. It is important for us to know that it will be possible, one way or another, to discuss any matter that has arisen on the Floor of the House. The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis) is not here this morning, but I know that that is always the view of all Northern Ireland Members.
<P>
The Minister dealt reasonably and properly with the points about the Assembly and about the Government's intention to repeal clause 2 at the earliest possible date. What do Ministers think is the logical frequency with which Parliament should be consulted and allowed to express a view about the continuation of emergency powers? If the Minister could answer that, it would be a third matter dealt with and we could move happily on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I am not sure that I want to get into that debate at this point. I thought that we had a understanding that amendments have been tabled to deal with the way in which that can be explored. As I said, views were expressed on Second Reading that dealt substantially with that. We will take that serious point on board; it will be dealt with by my ministerial colleague in the Committee at a later stage. That would be the time to explore the matter in greater depth. I am not ducking the matter but postponing it to a time when it can be explored more thoroughly--otherwise we will just be repeating points over and over, and that is not of benefit. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept my assurance that it will be debated, but not yet.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> The Minister, on his first appearance in Committee, has been engaging and persuasive, and I am happy to help him.
<P>
We have flagged up the matter. We have realised that there is a carry-over and have made progress in getting information about it that we were not able to deal with in detail on the Floor of the House. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The amendment dealt with the substance of the short clause. We will come in a moment to schedule 1, which is the other part of the package.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 1</center></H4>
Northern Ireland (Emergency
Provisions) Act 1996
<P>
<B> Mr. Ingram:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 22, in page 58, leave out line 25 and insert "or".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following: Government amendments Nos. 23 to 25 and Nos. 18 to 21.
<P>
Government new clause 5--Private security services
<P>
Government new schedule 2--Private Security Services
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Amendment No. 22 amends part V of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996 and puts that into force from 15 June. Amendment No. 23 is a substantive amendment that has two main purposes. First, it confers on the Secretary of State a power to impose a condition when granting a certificate for the provision of security services. Secondly, it introduces a new avenue of appeal to the tribunal established under the Northern Ireland Act 1998.
<P>
Part V of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996 prevents paramilitary groups from profiting from businesses operating in the private security industry. At present, the Secretary of State has a choice between granting a certificate and not granting or revoking it. The inclusion of the power to impose a condition on the granting of a certificate would permit a much more proportionate response to applications. That is one of the underlying purposes of the amendment.
<P>
Decisions not to grant or to revoke a certificate are likely to be based on sensitive intelligence information. With the only current avenue for challenge being by judicial review, it is difficult to make such decisions when, because of the sensitivity of these issues, they cannot be defended in open court. Access to the Northern Ireland Act Tribunal, which is set out in the provisions, will make the position fairer by giving a right of appeal and making it possible to apply the Act far more robustly in the knowledge that the intelligence information used can be scrutinised while still being protected. A further important consideration is that the introduction of such an appeals procedure is necessary to comply with the European Court of Human Rights. The amendments will continue in force until they are superseded by new schedule 2.
<P>
Before turning to the new schedule, I shall explain briefly the purpose of the related Government amendments Nos. 18 to 21, 24 and 25 and new clause 5. These are all minor and consequential provisions. Amendments Nos. 18 and 19 will ensure that proceedings relating to offences under the new schedule do not require the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions in common with similar provisions elsewhere in part VII. Amendment No. 20 provides that an order under the new schedule to vary the duration of a licence shall be laid before Parliament. Amendment No. 21 provides that the provisions relating to the private security industry apply in Northern Ireland only. Government amendments Nos. 24 and 25 add certain offences under the private security industry provisions to the list of scheduled offences in schedule 8. New clause 5 is needed to give effect to new schedule 2.
<P>
The new schedule, headed "Private Security Services", re-enacts part V of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996, including the amendments made to that Act by the amendment to schedule 1, to which amendment No. 23 refers. New schedule 2 provides for the advertisement, offer or provision of unlicensed security services to remain offences. It provides for the application for a licence, and for the issue, duration and, if necessary, revocation of that licence. It also provides the avenue of appeal, under amendment No. 23, referring to the Northern Ireland Act Tribunal. It requires the providers of security services to give notice within 14 days of any changes in their personnel since their licence was last granted and it allows a constable to enter premises and examine records of persons employed in the provision of security services. It also provides for the liability of officers of bodies corporate and requires all notice to be given in writing.
<P>
A comparison with part V of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996 will show only changes of substance relating to the imposition of conditions and the appeals mechanism. Some of the language has changed, but the draftsmen have made a conscious effort to make the legislation more user-friendly. I hope that my explanation has been user-friendly.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation and I am reasonably content with the Government's proposals. I have a number of brief questions for the Minister, which I accept may be related as much to the existing law, with which I do not claim to be especially familiar, as with the Government's new proposals.
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
My first question refers to the definition of "security services". New schedule 2 states that that term
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"means the services of one or more individuals as security guards (whether or not provided together with other services relating to the protection of property or persons)."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When we have discussed Home Office matters over the years and regulation of the private security industry, the terms "private security industry" or "security services" have been used to describe a wide range of services. They have included everything from personal escorts to bouncers or door stewards at the entrance to pubs and clubs and marshals for organised demonstrations. I understand that the Government are including private wheel clampers within the scope of their current review of the private security industry. I should be grateful for some elucidation on what types of activity the Government believe should be covered by the term "security services". Is it a narrower definition than the one that we have become accustomed to using in layman's language when discussing the industry in general?
<P>
The Government's proposal to introduce a power to vary certificates and to grant a right of appeal is sensible. Will judicial review still be available to someone who is dissatisfied with the results of the first appeal? Will the Minister assure the Committee that the Government's proposed amendments will apply not only to home-grown security businesses in Northern Ireland? My assumption is that a security provider who is based elsewhere in the United Kingdom, or in another country, will still be caught by these licensing arrangements, and that it will not be possible for an organisation that wished to evade the regulations to do so by hiring security personnel who are employed by an outfit based outside Northern Ireland.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I shall not pursue matters much on these Government amendments because, to be honest, I have not had all the briefing that I should have liked, as the amendments were tabled fairly late in the day, Why do we have to have Government amendments so early in our proceedings, when the Bill was published only a short time ago? By definition, it is easier for all of us to do our business if we have notice of the issues. Depending on the outcome of the Minister's reply to the hon. Member for Aylesbury, and further discussions with someone who was not available, I may have to return to the matter on Report. I am a veteran of the Committee that considered the Greater London Authority Bill, like the hon. Member for Ilford, South (Mr. Gapes), in which rafts of Government amendments, new schedules and new clauses were tabled at the last possible moment. We want to proceed in businesslike and workmanlike manner. If the Government need to make amendments, the hon. Members for Aylesbury and for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and I should ideally be given maximum notice of them, with briefing. We would then have the chance to talk to Ministers and others. We would not have to waste time opposing amendments simply to discover whether there was anything behind them that we should know about.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> On the first debate, I was given a gold star. I am now being told that I have been derelict in my responsibilities and that I have not provided sufficient information to the Committee--a complete litany.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> It is all part of the political rollercoaster.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I appreciate that. It will be visited on the hon. Gentleman in due course.
<P>
I agree that we should give as much notice as possible of Government amendments and their import, and that if they are tabled at short notice we should explain why. It was our original intention to include in the Bill the provisions contained in the amendments. The hon. Gentleman will understand that ensuring that legislation is compliant with the European convention on human rights involves considerable debate among parliamentary draftsmen. That is why the provision was not included in the Bill. However, we were determined to ensure that it saw the light of day as early as possible. Indeed, it was raised in Northern Ireland questions; hon. Members wanted to know about the regulation and scrutiny of the organisations and agencies that provide such services. That was why it was determined that we should table the amendments as soon as possible.
<P>
If it falls to me, I shall try to ensure that full information is given to members of the Committee about Government amendments. I find it beneficial to handle all Northern Ireland legislation in that way. I know that that is the ethos under which my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Home Office wants to operate. We do not want to keep things hidden; we want people to understand the import of our actions.
<P>
Let me answer the hon. Member for Aylesbury's question about the definition of the word "guards". The word is a direct lift from section 37(5) of the EPA. It is certainly capable of wide interpretation, but the service must be provided for reward--the reward is the trigger. It will be for the courts to decide the meaning of the word in particular cases. It would be wrong for me to list all the categories that could be included in a definition; it would complicate matters somewhat if something was outwith that list. That is why the Home Office is involved; the consultation exercise covers all of Great Britain because we want to ensure that we include as best we can all the activities of the private security industry. It is a burgeoning industry that needs proper and effective regulation. What we are doing in the Bill is proportionate to what we do in Northern Ireland.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> Do I take it that from what the Minister said that, in Northern Ireland, the term "security guard" is in practice given a fairly wide interpretation and covers a large number of activities carried out by the private security industry?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> My answer is yes. It is for the courts to define it. If we said that an activity came within the ambit of the definition, people and organisations would clearly have the legal right to say that the way in which they were treated was not appropriate. It should be for the courts to decide, not Ministers. Nevertheless, the right to judicial review will remain available, although the courts would expect applicants for judicial review to have exhausted their statutory right of appeal. Again, it is not for us to determine how the courts would act in any given circumstance. The procedures taking place will be new. We believe them to be fully compliant with the ECHR, otherwise we would not have introduced them. They provide important safeguards for applicants and for those purchasing the services of such organisations.
<P>
I think that I have dealt with all the points, and I hope that the amendment finds favour with the Committee.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 23, in page 59, line 8, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>".--(1) Part V (private security services) shall have effect subject to the provisions of this paragraph.
<P>
(2) On issuing a certificate under section 39 the Secretary of State may impose a condition if satisfied that it is necessary in order to prevent an organisation within section 39(8) from benefiting from the certificate.
<P>
(3) To the grounds for refusal to issue a certificate and for revocation of a certificate in sections 39(1) and (5) there shall be added the ground that the Secretary of State is satisfied that the applicant for or holder of a certificate has failed to comply with a condition imposed by virtue of sub-paragraph (2) above.
<P>
(4) The applicant for a certificate may appeal to the High Court if--
<P>
(a) the application is refused,
<P>
(b) a condition is imposed on the grant of the certificate, or
<P>
(c) the certificate is revoked.
<P>
(5) Where an appeal is brought under sub-paragraph (4), the Secretary of State may issue a certificate that the decision to which the appeal relates--
<P>
(a) was taken for the purpose of preventing benefit from accruing to an organisation which was within section 39(8), and
<P>
(b) was justified by that purpose.
<P>
(6) If he intends to rely on a certificate under sub-paragraph (5), the Secretary of State shall notify the appellant.
<P>
(7) Where the appellant is notified of the Secretary of State's intention to rely on a certificate under sub-paragraph (5)--
<P>
(a) he may, in accordance with rules made by the Lord Chancellor, appeal against the certificate to the Tribunal established under section 91 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, and
<P>
(b) sections 90(3) and (4), 91(2) to (9) and 92 of that Act (effect of appeal, procedure, and further appeal) shall apply.".<P>
</UL></FONT>[Mr. Ingram.]<P>

<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule, as amended, be the First schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I have a few questions for the Minister about the schedule. His explanation, in answer to the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, of the way in which the temporary provisions were designed to operate has cleared matters up a great deal as regards paragraphs 1 to 3. I still have a query about the power that the Secretary of State will enjoy to renew any of the transitional provisions for a 12-month period, and for him to extend that period. I assume from the content of the previous debate on the subject that that is a belt-and-braces operation by the Government in case something were to go wrong with the Bill before it came into effect. I think that the provision is there to ensure, as the Minister said, that there is no vacuum in the counter-terrorist arrangements in Northern Ireland, but I would be grateful for confirmation of that.
<P>
Paragraphs 4 to 8 refer to the changes that the Government propose to make to the powers in the EPA. Why do the Government propose to remove section 35 of the EPA, which is about the wearing of hoods? Will that be covered by clause 12, which will make it an offence to wear a uniform or other insignia that suggests support for a terrorist organisation? Given what the Minister said about the need to avoid a vacuum, it is odd that he apparently proposes to drop the arrangement under which wearing a hood or balaclava to conceal the face can be an offence for the period of the EPA's temporary extension, but intends to re-impose it through clause 12. I shall be grateful if the Minister will deal with the policy point about that as well as the procedural one.
<P>
Similarly, I would like to ask the Minister about his intention to remove section 50 of the EPA. That section allows the Secretary of State to refuse a licence for an explosives factory or store if it would pose a risk to security. What is it about the situation in Northern Ireland that leads the Government to believe that the arrangement in section 50 of the EPA can be dropped without risk? We all hope that the terrorist groups will commit themselves to peaceful and democratic politics, but the sad fact is that not one ounce of semtex has yet been handed in, decommissioned or put under the supervision of General de Chastelain. Are not the Government being a little too rash in introducing such a proposal now?
<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
My third question is about searches for munitions. I understand from the explanatory notes that the Government propose that the special powers of the armed forces when searching for munitions, such as directing people to leave property, may still be extended. Under the EPA, such an extension may be made more than once. However, under the transitional arrangements, it may be made on one occasion only. What is the reason for such a policy?
<P>
I agree with the Government's proposal under paragraph 7 of schedule 1 to limit the grounds on which the Secretary of State may authorise entry into property. I am also content with what is proposed in paragraph 8, which allows someone to have his case heard in court if he claims to be the owner of the property that the court is about to order to be forfeited. While I accept some of the Government's proposals, I should be grateful to receive a detailed explanation of the schedule from the Minister.

<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Consistent with what I said earlier, I shall reserve my position. I accept the points made by the hon. Member for Aylesbury and I am sure that we shall return to what are quite complex issues. I shall listen to what the Minister has to say, but that does not mean that the Government may not have some further questions to answer when the Bill is debated Downstairs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I shall deal first with the matters raised by the hon. Member for Aylesbury. The transitional arrangements do not require renewal. They are belt-and-braces arrangements to deal with the potential period of vacuum. The Secretary of State's power to make an order under paragraph 1(2)(b) of the schedule relates to bringing the transitional period to an end. If what we believed to be an eventuality was not proven to be so, we would have to revisit it. It was not our original intention to have transitional arrangements; we have had to deal with such matters on that basis because of the calendar of events. We do not want it to be the de facto process. I give the Committee my firm commitment that we shall revisit the process.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman referred also to sections 35 and 50 of the EPA. Such provisions have always been subject to review by independent reviewers and the Chief Constable of the RUC and his officers on the basis of whether they help and are effective. We have always considered each element of the legislation. The fundamental question to ask is whether it is required.
<P>
The provision relating to wearing hoods has not been used, and the Chief Constable is content for it to be disposed of. We do not intend it to be covered under clause 12. In considering its effect, we asked whether it was necessary and being used, and, if not, why it should be retained. The same applies to section 50, and again, the Chief Constable is content with its removal. We would not remove any provision from the legislation to tackle terrorism if the Chief Constable and our security advice told us that it was necessary and that, although it might not have been used for some time, it might be of benefit in future. We bring that value judgment into play on the basis of the best advice available. We would not act solely on the basis of a political analysis. The legislation exists to enable agencies of the law to bring people to justice, and we must take into account their judgment of whether provisions are necessary and useful. In the two cases cited, the Chief Constable is content that the provisions be removed.
<P>
The reason for the change introduced in paragraph 6 is that, previously, under section 20 of the EPA, no restriction was placed on the number of times that a period could be extended. As the hon. Gentleman rightly said, that can now be done only once. That places a reasonable absolute time limit on the requirement specified in the legislation and is compatible with article 8 of the ECHR. That is important. As the hon. Gentleman will be aware, all measures must pass that fundamental test, on which legislation is judged. We felt that sufficient powers reside in those who would be carrying out such a search and exercising such a power that they should have that power of extension only once. The fact that that makes it compatible with the ECHR gives everyone security--not only legislators and those who apply the law, but those who are conditioned by the law, too.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I thank the Minister for his reply. Although I am reassured by what he has said, I reserve my right to return to the matter at a later stage in the Bill's progress.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I shall also speak to the other two amendments tabled in my name and that of my hon. Friends.
<P>
This is the first debate on clause 3--the first clause in the important and controversial section on proscription, and the beginning of part II, which deals with proscribed organisations. Issues on several levels are involved, and I shall try to make specific points on the amendments against the background of general anxieties about the matter.
<P>
Proscription has been hotly debated and a controversial issue ever since it was first introduced 20 years ago in the current legislation. As the various notes on the Bill that have been prepared for us make clear, there has not always been a generally positive view towards powers of proscription. Indeed, some of those who were charged with advising the Government and Parliament on proscription in its early days were, in their words, lukewarm about it. When I first came to the House, we had annual debates on the renewal of temporary provisions, which came with advice from those who had been put into the position of advising us--Lord Colville and Lord Jellicoe, for example, both of whom were uncomfortable about the proscription power. It is fair to say that the inquiry set up by the Government, chaired by Lord Lloyd of Berwick, was more positive about proscription powers and recommended that they be included in legislation. I accept that.
<P>
I am not automatically persuaded, by virtue of their political histories, that the countries cited as examples of why proscription powers are necessary--Germany, Italy and the United States--create an overwhelmingly strong case. I would be much more comfortable if other countries with proscription powers had been prayed in aid. While I am not an expert, although I have read some of the preparatory material supplied to us, my understanding is that proscription powers are unusual and not generally available. Most democracies do not have them to the extent that is proposed in the legislation and we need to be naturally cautious.
<P>
The group of amendments probe the test by which somebody would be held to be committing an offence. Amendment No. 43 suggests that we tighten the law and therefore increase the burden of proof. The legislation is based on more than the Secretary of State simply having a belief that an organisation is concerned in terrorism. The starting point of the Bill is that the Secretary of State will be required to declare that he believes that an organisation is concerned in terrorism. The amendment proposes that there be "reasonable grounds for belief"--a phrase used in other legislation--for believing that an organisation is "actively concerned in terrorism". We necessarily get into legal terminology in this area. I accept that words are only a vehicle.
<P>
It is arguable that even if we did not include the phrase "reasonable grounds for belief" and left the Secretary of State the unqualified power to say that he believed that an organisation was involved in terrorism, that would, under the Wednesbury rules and other provisions, have to be a reasonable belief. That may be true, but it does not mean that we should not spell out in such a Bill, which deals with a hugely controversial area, a test for reasonableness that would form the legal basis on which any court could judge the Secretary of State's decision. It would also avoid reasonableness being judged only in the context of a judicial review. We should try to reduce the number of matters that have to go to judicial review and increase the clarity of the legislation so that a straightforward argument can be presented in a court on whether an organisation should be proscribed.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): I have been following the hon. Gentleman's line of argument closely. Does he agree that the Wednesbury test of the Minister's decision is not about its reasonableness but about the fact that it falls short of perversity?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I do not want to get involved in a seminar with the hon. Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor)--he is also a lawyer--and I am sure, Mr. Stevenson, that you would not want us to do so. However, it is a perfectly proper question.
<P>
The test of what is reasonable under the Wednesbury rules, which are the result of a court case, has a fairly low threshold. As the hon. Member for Solihull said, it would give the Minister fairly wide discretion. The test is that if a reasonable person would have come to a particular conclusion--or, to use the other side of the coin, if that decision was not perverse--it would be judged acceptable. The intervention was helpful. We should not leave too wide a discretion in the Bill because we shall need to know exactly what we are dealing with. Whether or not he contributes further to the debate, I hope that the hon. Gentleman sees the benefit of a tight definition.
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 36 would rewrite clause 3(5), which defines "concerned in terrorism". The Government propose four qualifying criteria. The first is:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(a) commits or participates in acts of terrorism".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not think that anyone could argue that that was evidence of being involved in terrorism. The three other definitions are:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(b) prepares for terrorism,
<P>
(c) promotes or encourages terrorism, or
<P>
(d) is otherwise concerned in terrorism."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment seeks to limit the test to the first of those qualifying criteria, but slightly rewording it in two paragraphs that state,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(a) commit, participate in or prepare for acts of terrorism"<P>
</UL></FONT>--<P>

<P>
those are specific activities; and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(b) promote or encourage acts of terrorism."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The phrase "acts of terrorism" is included in both paragraphs--it is also to be found in the first of the Government's four criteria--because terrorism might be defined by some as a group of people with an idea, or a philosophical matter; however, unless it is linked to activity, it is too far removed to justify criminal proceedings. That leads me to a more general point.
<P>
At the moment, membership of, support for, or fundraising for proscribed organisations is a criminal offence, I hope that the amendments will give us the chance to address the principled argument that it is actions that should give rise to criminal offences, not indications of support for political organisations or involvement in them. To include being involved in something or expressing support for something takes the criminal law much further than is traditional.
<P>
The criminal law normally requires both intention and action. The real test is whether, as proposed in the Bill, we should introduce the power to proscribe organisations not only in Northern Ireland but throughout the United Kingdom. Under the clause, not only the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland but the Home Secretary can exercise the power to proscribe an organisation, and do it simply because he believes that it is "concerned in terrorism".
<P>
That is an extremely wide power. It brings us to the important question whether one can prove what is going on. The history of proscription shows how difficult it can be to prove that someone belongs to an organisation. It has always been difficult to secure convictions. The figures vary slightly, but the notes supplied as part of the Library briefing quoted the Government's consultation paper, which stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "There have been no convictions from proscription-related offences in GB since 1990, though, period, in the same period, 195 convictions in Northern Ireland (usually as the second count on the charge sheet)."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister and the hon, Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, who is not here, would know better than me, but it seems that all the legislation that affects Northern Ireland should be wherever possible, on a continuing basis and in collaboration with the Government of Ireland, similar to legislation in the 26 counties. That would allow parallelism as to which organisations are regarded as terrorist. If our Government and Ireland's cannot agree on that, there will be a problem. However, there must be no extension beyond what is necessary.
<P>
I stand to be corrected by the Minister, but I have been told that in Britain up to the end of 1990, only three charges were preferred under section 3 of the PTA dealing with membership, two of which were later withdrawn, and that there were a further seven prosecutions resulting in two convictions under section  2. In Northern Ireland--I do not pretend that the figures are perfect, but they they are the best information that I have--there were 16 convictions in 1991, 15 in 1992 and 24 in 1993, but there were none in those years in Britain.
<P>
The Committee should at least consider whether we want organisations to be proscribed on the basis of so thin a test. Would it not be better to ensure a tight definition that involves committing, participating in, preparing for, promoting or encouraging acts of terrorism? We all must be sensitive to the way in which we help the people in Northern Ireland, their political representatives, the Government of this country and the Government of Ireland move towards a stable peace. It is therefore important that we proceed carefully and ensure that we legislate gradually--the previous debate related to that--so that no one feels that important matters have suddenly been taken away, and that the changes are made with the maximum amount of agreement.
<P>
I hope that the legislation, as it does not relate only to Northern Ireland, gives us the possibility of ensuring watertight tests in criminal law of what becomes a criminal offence. It is much more sensible to say that the criminal law should deal with terrorism and its activities wherever possible, and that we should add additional law to say, "You will be a criminal if you support or become involved with those organisations", in only the most extreme circumstances, if at all, and when evidence might be available.
<P>
We have already gone down the road in the wrong direction, and I want to ensure that we go no further. The Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act 1998 was put through Parliament in haste when we were recalled for a couple of days in September of that year. The legislation dealt with the issue of membership of proscribed organisations. The Government were given the power to find someone who belonged to a proscribed organisation guilty with no evidence. My understanding is that it was sufficient to have the opinion of a police officer and the accused person's silence. That is not enough in criminal justice terms in any part of the United Kingdom. There is a debate about trials by jury in the other place today, and there have been changes in the law on the right of silence. We must be very careful that we do not start eating away at the normal tests for people who are charged with offences.
<P>
Amendment No. 35 is intended to test the issue to see whether the legislation should go wider than Northern Ireland into the United Kingdom. It is a probing amendment. Our concern, which I flagged up on Second Reading, is that the Bill, which I accept is Lord Lloyd's recommendation, seeks to define terrorism as not only Northern Ireland-related. If we do not include subsection (6), as proposed in the amendment, the acts of terrorism set out in clause 3 can be committed anywhere. The Government have the power elsewhere to proscribe organisations that have nothing to do with Ireland but are involved in other activities all over the world. Schedule 2 lists the organisations that the Government want to proscribe, which derives from existing emergency powers legislation. There are 14 organisations in that list, including the Irish National Liberation Army and the Irish Republican Army. We could have a perfectly proper debate on whether that is the right list and should 53 54 be kept. Another debate, which would take us much further, is whether we should give Ministers the power to proscribe other organisations. Amendment No. 35 is designed to test whether we should allow the proscription power to extend to organisations outside the Irish context.
<P>
There will be opportunities on clause stand part to deal with the wider issues and there are other groups of amendments to discuss, so I shall not take up the Committee's time now. I am sure that there is no difference between us in the desire for legislation, but on these sensitive issues we need clear definitions. We must not criminalise people whom we did not intend to be included or whose engagement or link with terrorist activity is tenuous. Amendments Nos. 43 and 36 would tighten the law because they require that someone has something to do with acts of terrorism, rather than the nebulous concept of terrorism, which may be defined entirely differently by different people, whether in Northern Ireland or elsewhere, depending on their point of view.

<P>

<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman and I am sympathetic to some of his remarks, but not to others, I start from the position of believing, along with Lord Lloyd and the Government, that there remains a need for the power of proscription.
<P>
In the Government's consultation document, which preceded the Bill, Ministers acknowledged that the arguments were finely balanced. I have been influenced by the firm views of Lord Lloyd. He said in his report that there should continue to be a power to proscribe terrorist organisations that should not be limited to Irish terrorism but should be extended to include international as well as domestic terrorism. He argued that the purpose of the power of proscription was twofold. First, it would give a conclusive presumption that a proscribed organisation is a terrorist organisation. He argued that that would facilitate the burden of proof in terrorist cases when the courts were considering particular offences and said that the knowledge that someone was a member of a proscribed organisation would contribute towards the prosecution's case.
<P>
Secondly, Lord Lloyd said that proscription would be the starting point for the creation of a number of fundraising and other offences. We shall debate that matter in greater detail in later clauses of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
 The effect of the powers of proscription has been beneficial. That seems to be the view of the police and the security services most directly concerned with counter-terrorist operations in Northern Ireland and elsewhere. There have been nearly 200 prosecutions in Northern Ireland because of proscription powers and the security agencies believe that proscription has acted as a deterrent to organisations in Northern Ireland and Great Britain that might otherwise have been tempted to engage in high-profile demonstrations, fundraising activities or other publicity campaigns. Such an effect on terrorist organisations is a clear point in favour of maintaining the power of proscription.
<P>
We cannot ignore the fact that proscribing an organisation has symbolic importance. It is saying to that organisation and to anyone tempted to join it, subscribe to it or support it, that it lies outwith the bounds of democratic and constitutional politics. It is not part of the civil debate on how to construct and reform our society. Proscription is a useful tool to show the abhorrence that every democrat feels about those who engage in acts of terror to advance their political ends. It also signifies the dividing line between constitutional politics and unacceptable actions. I believe that the powers of proscription need to be maintained in the Bill. I have more confidence than the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey in the Government's proposals.
<P>
Amendment No. 43 would limit the Secretary of State's grounds for proscribing an organisation. My worry is that it could inadvertently open the way for the proposed appeal body to start to pick away at some of the information that led to proscription in the first place. The body charged with the duty of considering the facts and assessing whether the Secretary of State's grounds for proscription are reasonable will have details of informants and evidence that may become available to the representatives of terrorist organisations. I am sure that that is not what the hon. Gentleman intends, but I wonder whether his amendment would take us in that direction.
<P>
Amendment No. 36 would remove the reference in the clause to an organisation that was "otherwise concerned in terrorism". When I thought about the Govemment's reasons for including such a provision, it occurred to me that it may be another belt-and-braces operation. Terrorism is changing in character all the time; in his report, Lord Lloyd said that terrorist organisations are notoriously fissile. I suppose that the Government would not want so to draft the law that the terrorist organisation, by subdividing itself in some way, could take parts of its operations beyond the scope of proscription when, in fact, a fundraising subdivision of a terrorist organisation was integrally connected with its campaigning. We must avoid allowing such bodies to be taken outside subsection 5(a), (b) and (c) by some deft reorganisation. The hon. Gentleman has posed a legitimate question and I shall be interested to hear the Minister's explanation of the phrase "otherwise concerned in terrorism".
<P>
I am half sympathetic to amendment No. 35. 1 understand where the hon. Gentleman is coming from and I wish to express a few concerns about the potential proscription of foreign organisations. Given what else is contained in the Bill, such as the dropping of exclusion powers, it would not be right to distinguish between one part of the United Kingdom and another when considering proscription powers, None of us knows how terrorist organisations will evolve. For example, an organisation in Great Britain may operate in ways similar to Provisional IRA or the INLA to achieve a particular objective with regard to the political status of Scotland or Wales. I hope, as do all members of the Committee, that we are never faced with such a prospect and that it remains something confined to the novels of my noble friend, Lord Hurd.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office </B>(Mr. Charles Clarke): Do you read them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I assure the Minister that I read such books assiduously. I recommend them to him.
<P>
Given that we are debating counter-terrorist legislation, which we hope will serve this country for years to come, it would be sensible to include within it powers of proscription of organisations based in Great Britain in case such a power has to be exercised in the future. I am a little worried about how the powers might be used in relation to organisations alleged to be concerned with international terrorism. Lord Lloyd said firmly that powers of proscription should be so extended, but my thinking on amendment No. 35 is influenced by the debate that we had the other day on clause I and what safeguards exist to prevent one man's freedom fighter from being defined as a Government's terrorist.
<P>
Intensive lobbying is being undertaken by various foreign Governments for the British authorities to take action against organisations based in London or elsewhere in the United Kingdom that are active in the politics of the middle east. When the Bill becomes law, I envisage different Governments approaching British ambassadors or British Ministers and saying "This organisation, which is based in London, is promoting the overthrow by force of our Government with which you, the British, have good diplomatic and commercial relations. We ask you to proscribe it because it is a terrorist body."
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike Gapes </B>(Ilford, South): This is not a new problem. The hon. Gentleman will recall that the previous Home Secretary got into trouble with the courts because of the removal of someone to the Caribbean for precisely the same reason.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> The problem is not new, I agree. What is new, however, is the proposal to extend the power of proscription to international terrorist organisations. On Tuesday, we were told that the role of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Crown Prosecution Service would be an adequate safeguard to ensure that someone was not prosecuted in this country as a terrorist for supporting action against a tyrannical regime overseas.
<P>
Such powers of proscription would be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and to an affirmative resolution of both Houses of Parliament, but not to the decision of independent prosecuting authorities. I am worried that a Government, under intense political pressure from a country whose friendship they cherish, might decide that it is in the overall interests of good relations with that state to proscribe an organisation that that foreign Government regards as a terrorist body. Does the Bill provide sufficient safeguards against the abuse of such powers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that one of the problems with the proscription of organisations outside the United Kingdom is that the decision whether that they are "otherwise concerned in terrorism" may be almost entirely reliant on information that is supplied by the foreign Government? How will the Government test an allegation that an organisation that is based abroad is concerned with terrorism? Will they carry out the test or will some other body undertake it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. It would not be enough for the British Government to say that their expert diplomatic corps would gather such information. They do, indeed, have an expert professional diplomatic corps, but during my short time working at the Foreign Office, I felt that the diplomats were not always able--sometimes because of constraints on resources, sometimes because of the laws of the country to which they were posted--to make contact with opposition or dissident groups, let alone groups that might be involved in armed insurrection against the regime in power. The Government have a legitimate question to answer, and I look forward to the Minister's reply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Hunter </B>(Basingstoke): I sympathise with what has been said about the potential abuse of the powers of proscription and I warm to the amendments. Will the Minister address my next point when he responds to them? I was surprised that a judicial element was not introduced into proscription in the early stages. Over the years, the Labour party, probably quite rightly, has argued for judicial provision in regard to the extension of detention and that has now been set out in the Bill. We will come later to clause 5 and the Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission -- but that provision will come into operation after the power of proscription has been applied. Why have the Government rejected the option of including a judicial element at the first stage of proscription?

<P>

<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> This has been a helpful discussion. I agree wholeheartedly with the initial point of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey that the debate on proscription is important. We addressed it to some extent on Second Reading, but this is the place to discuss it further. I too have been influenced, as have the Government, by Lord Lloyd's recommendations and by his important and detailed work on the nature of modern terrorism--work that informs the Bill. However, I thought that the hon. Gentleman departed somewhat from his usual forensic standards when he suggested that the Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) Bill in the other place had something to do with that. To slide together a range of supposed Government illiberalisms was not worthy of him.
<P>
I begin by addressing the fundamental issue of proscription. Why do we have it and how does it operate? I concede immediately to the hon. Member for Aylesbury that the issues involved are finely balanced and matters for judgment. We are reasonable people who can take different views about the best way of proceeding.
<P>
There are three principal reasons why we think proscription is important. First, it has been, and remains, a powerful deterrent to people to engage in terrorist activity. Secondly, related offences are a way of tackling some of the lower-level support for terrorist organisations. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey spoke about numbers: he is right that, broadly speaking, about 200 incidents have been dealt with since 1990--as he said, usually on the second count of the charge. Without commenting on the details that he 57 58 gave earlier, it is true that while that is a relatively small number, it is not insignificant. It has been a significant factor in dealing with some of the issues.
<P>
Thirdly, proscription acts as a powerful signal of the rejection by the Government--and indeed by society as a whole--of organisations' claim to legitimacy. The points made by the hon. Member for Aylesbury in that context were eloquent. It is important for society to state that certain activities are simply--I hesitate to use the phrase in this context--beyond the pale; I do not mean it in the Irish sense, but in the sense of the way in which civilised, democratic society operates. The legislation is a powerful symbol of that censure and is important. So I believe that the Government are right to continue with proscription and that the provision is justified.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I understand those three arguments. On the first of them, does the Minister agree that, although it may be true that the legislative power of proscription is a powerful deterrent, that does not determine how widely drawn it is? There is no evidence, from what I understand, that those involved on the margins have been greatly deterred by proscription. The evidence of the cases taken to court is that it has deterred those who have been actively involved in or who have subscribed to activities that would have landed them in the courts under the present legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I am coming to deal with the points about the width of definition that the hon. Gentleman raised earlier. I would like to deal first with amendment No. 35, because concerns have been raised on the issues it deals with. On domestic groups, it seems highly unlikely, on present information, that any domestic groups would be proscribed. Proscription is a very serious power that can be contemplated only if absolutely necessary. I wish to be clear and direct about the fact that there is no intention to pick out any domestic group that has a particular approach. I state that because of some of the concerns that have been flying around --although not in Committee--about the extent to which the power might be used. I think that the Committee will acknowledge that successive Secretaries of State, of all parties, have used the power with great discretion and care. I stress that that will continue to be the case--there is no open door to another position.
<P>
When we consider extending the power to international groups--
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Before the Minister moves on--he has raised an issue that I was going to deal with later--will he deal with the point made by the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter)? One of the concerns of organisations that feel that they might at some stage be proscribed--environmental campaigning organisations have been mentioned in this regard--is that there is no mechanism for them to challenge that eventuality through the normal processes of the court. If a positive answer could be given to the question of the hon. Member for Basingstoke, it might lessen the concern about domestic organisations that fear that they might be caught by a future Secretary of State, for whom the Minister obviously cannot speak.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I shall address the point made by the hon. Member for Basingstoke later, if the hon. Gentleman will allow me to wait until then.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sure that the Minister will get to it eventually.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I hope so, Mr. Stevenson.
<P>
The effect of amendment No. 35 would be simply to exclude international groups from everything to do with the Bill. That would be short-sighted and foolhardy. The appendix by Professor Wilkinson to Lord Lloyd's report sets out graphically the extent to which international terrorism is an issue for the modern world. It is trite to observe that society is becoming much more globalised, but the fact that something is trite does not mean that it is not true. We are aware of all kinds of examples of international terrorism being a real threat, but I shall not detain the Committee by listing them. We have suffered attacks from international terrorist groups and recent history shows that attacks from such groups remain a real risk. That is why we should resist amendment No. 35 and state that we are prepared to take powers to deal with international terrorism.
<P>
That said, I acknowledge the concerns raised by Opposition Members about how to apply the power. Important issues of judgment are involved. I wish to make a few points in that regard. First, on the fear that foreign Governments would lobby in the way suggested by the hon. Member for Aylesbury, I have no control over whether they would. No doubt they would. However, I cannot envisage any circumstances in which Ministers or a Secretary of State from any party would be ready to surrender that quality of independent authority to deal with the matter in that way. I hope that I can set the hon. Gentleman's mind at rest about the issue of foreign lobbying. I do not deny that it could take place, but we can be confident that it would be resisted. The interests of the Government and the people of our country would be paramount in dealing with international terrorism.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked where intelligence would come from. Again, I can set his mind at rest. There is no question of the Government--not the Labour Government, but any Government of this country--taking any decision based on some kind of hearsay from someone else. As he knows, there is a lot of co-operation between intelligence agencies of different countries. That will continue and I predict that it will intensify as the world becomes smaller. None of that could surrender the sovereign obligation of a British Home Secretary or Prime Minister to consider a situation directly on the information that they have. We would not simply accept another Government or intelligence service's word and do what we are told because of it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Does the Minister appreciate that, without a review process in the courts for a decision to proscribe and without the most extensive freedom of information legislation, it would be difficult to test any such decision? Intelligence, whether our own or passed on from elsewhere, would by definition be exactly the sort of information that a Government would not want to disclose. Therefore, the chance of having any such decision reviewed seems thin.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I heard the Minister say earlier that he would come to the points made by hon. Members. We should resist the temptation of anticipating in interventions what Ministers might say. I hope that that is helpful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I struggle with anticipating myself on some occasions, so I appreciate your guidance on the matter, Mr. Stevenson.
<P>
For those reasons, I hope that the Committee will resist amendment No. 35, which would simply exclude activity against international terrorism.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 43 and 36 are about active involvement in terrorism and the issues that it raises. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey spoke clearly, and the purpose of the amendments is also clear: they are designed to restrict the grounds on which the Secretary of State can proscribe an organisation. The operation of the proscription regime by this Government and previous Governments demonstrates how seriously the responsibility is taken. No suggestion can be made--I do not think that the hon. Gentleman made one--that the past provides evidence of any frivolity in the way in which it has been dealt with. The evidence stands up and is strong.
<P>
The core and central thrust of the hon. Gentleman's proposal is that the definition should specifically be restricted to acts of terrorism. Not all the organisations are actively concerned in terrorism at all times, but they nevertheless pose a serious threat to society. By their nature, organisations go through periods when they are unable to take action, either for some security reason, such as the security service having been successful at curtailing their activity, or due to some political judgment about how they should operate. As a result, they may not actively focus at certain times on acts of terrorism, although they may have done in the past and may intend to do so in future. It is important to retain in the Bill the power to examine what constitutes a terrorist organisation rather than to restrict it as tightly as the hon. Gentleman's amendments would specifically to preparing and participating in acts of terrorism. For significant periods, proscribed terrorist organisations do not participate in acts of terrorism, yet retain the power to do so. The Secretary of State should retain the power to proscribe organisations involved in such activity.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, amendment No. 36 would require the Secretary of State to judge not only organisations as a whole, but the intentions of individual members of an organisation. I am not sure that that is a helpful distinction. Proscribing organisations involves judging the organisation and the activity in which it is involved. The deterrent effect that I have described inhibits individuals or citizens from being drawn into an organisation's activity. The judgment should be made about the organisation, rather than its individual members.
<P>
I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman will accept what I have said about acts of terrorism; he will say when he winds up on his amendments. However, it is important for the entire Committee to acknowledge that the ebb and flow of the activity of proscribed terrorist organisations reflects many different factors, including the security situation and the political situation, for example. We should not make acts the core of our definition.
<P>
The hon. Members for Basingstoke and for Southwark, North and Bermondsey mentioned the law. The thrust of several of the amendments that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey has tabled is to give the courts a different--he might say, higher--role. The hon. Member for Basingstoke suggested that they might be introduced at the beginning of the process and asked why the Government took the view that they did. The Government took the view that a cycle of events is involved, from the Secretary of State making a judgment on the basis of information available to him or her about the nature of the organisation about whether it should be proscribed, to an appeals process, as specified in clause 5, through which that judgment can be challenged or tested. We judged that, on balance, that was the best way to proceed. We did not believe that a case could be made for involving the courts at the beginning of the process. Nor do we take the view that the POAC process should be replaced by a purely judicial process, as some of the amendments suggest.
<P>
To return to the point that I made earlier in response to the hon. Member for Aylesbury, the fundamental reason why we reached that view was our view that the powers of the Secretary of State--who is always directly accountable to Parliament for his or her actions--have been used responsibly and carefully, and that a judicial role earlier in the process would not be effective or, as I shall argue when we reach clause 5, assist the process. The effectiveness of the security campaign against international terrorism rests on the Secretary of State's responsibility to Parliament.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> am listening carefully to what the Minister is saying. The Government are open to questioning on this matter. Over the months and years, we have heard powerful arguments for providing a judicial role in curtailing individuals' freedom through the extension of detention. There seems to be considerable inconsistency between those arguments and what the Minister is now saying about curtailing organisations' freedom. We cannot continue repeating points of view. I note what the Minister says, but the accusation still stands.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I understand what the hon. Gentleman said, but there is no inconsistency. The whole thrust of the Bill is to inhibit terrorist activity and terrorist organisations. That is what we are about. Judgments about what has happened--and how those decisions are reached--are defended in Parliament. I believe that it is critical in fighting all forms of terrorism that the Home Secretary, the Prime Minister and others are able to take action. Those who take the decisions are accountable to Parliament, but the decisions are taken on the best available intelligence. What we propose in the Bill is the right way to proceed. For those reasons, I hope that the Committee will not agree to the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I think that this may be the first time when we shall reach such an agreement. Indeed, I hope that 1 can persuade the hon. Member for Basingstoke, if not others, to join me in supporting the 61 62 amendment, not least to put down a marker that we believe that the Government are going too far. 1 understand the Minister's answers, but I do not agree with them. I shall mention one or two specific points to show why I believe that he is wrong.
<P>
I shall not press amendment No. 35 to a Division. I said that it was a probing amendment on whether we should limit the Bill to Northern Ireland or UK matters, although I realise that terrorism is international. Logically, the amendment falls to be debated with amendment No. 5, which we shall debate later, because one of the safeguards that the Committee and Parliament will look for is how and when we check any extension of the legislation. Because amendment No. 5 will be debated later, as will the periodicity of the legislation, I am happy to leave amendment No. 35 on the back burner. I shall not press the matter.
<P>
That brings us to the more important definitional questions posed by amendments Nos. 43 and 36. 1 shall precede my answers to the Minister by pointing out that the argument put by the hon. Member for Basingstoke, which I seek to support in this and later amendments, has not yet been property addressed.
<P>
In certain circumstances, if the police want to arrest a person, they have to appear before a magistrate to obtain a warrant. It is normal in all parts of the United Kingdom that a law enforcement ageney's application should be tested before it can be proceeded with. The Bill fails to provide that testing; it allows the Secretary of State to make the decision. Under later clauses, people will be able to challenge a decision, but that will be done by virtue of regulations, which we have not yet seen. They are important, and it would help if we could see them in draft sooner rather later.
<P>
To be able to challenge such decisions might allay some concerns. However, if the Home Secretary was to proscribe an Organisation on I November, just after the Bill became law, there is no assurance that anyone could challenge the decision before the courts or the Commission within an hour, a day or a week. It is often in that window of time, between something becoming an offence or a body becoming proscribed, that arrests can be made and people can be found guilty before being able to make a challenge.
<P>
I do not accuse the present Government or their predecessors of bad faith, but Parliament's job is to ensure that legislation protects the citizen against the powers of the state as much as to give the state power against the citizen. I am seriously worried that by having an ex post facto, a posthumous, a secondary set of events for undoing a proscription process, we are getting into a constitutional position where the state has the power up front. Getting out of that is difficult.
<P>
That leads me to the arguments advanced by the Minister on amendments Nos. 43 and 36. To be fair to him, he did not deal specifically with reasonableness and so on. He concentrated mainly on acts of terrorism. We need to be sure that members of an organisation
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "commit, participate in or prepare for . . . or promote or encourage acts of terrorism".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Under clause 1, terrorism is defined as "the use or threat" of action. Only if the Bill were amended along the lines that I am suggesting would we make the proscription clause stand on all fours with the definition of terrorism elsewhere in the Bill. Otherwise, we will end up with terrorism for the purpose of proscription as something that is defined less closely to an activity of a terrorist nature. We are in danger of giving the Government wider powers to proscribe because of a broader definition of terrorism under clause 3 than was resolved under clause 1.
<P>
The Minister said that we must define proscription on the basis of the organisation as a whole. The amendment refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"its member or members knowingly"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
committing or participating in acts of terrorism. It is not good law to proscribe on the basis of a view of an organisation, if the argument that its members were involved in certain acts cannot be sustained. I carefully drafted the amendment so that it referred to "member or members", thus ensuring that real people were involved and that they "knowingly" committed such acts. If I had used only the word "member", the Government may have referred to circumstances in which only one member had committed an act.
<P>
Later provisions were criticised on the Floor of the House. For example, a person could attend a meeting at which someone claimed to be a member of a terrorist organisation and that person could be found guilty of an offence simply by speaking at or participating in such a meeting. I am sure that that provision can be amended, because it goes too far.
<P>
I have sought to ensure that we do not allow into the Bill the power to proscribe organisations, whether in Northern Ireland or elsewhere, unless there is evidence to show that someone is involved in terrorism and that that can be tested in the courts. It would have to be proved that members of an organisation were involved in acts of terrorism "knowingly" and that their names were not put on a list without their agreement just to make trouble for them. Northern Ireland has had plenty of experience of that. I ask colleagues to support me.

11 am
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Stevenson. I would like to press amendment No. 36, and I have not been told when I may do so.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Once we have disposed of amendment No. 15.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 15, in page 2, line 19, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(4A) The Secretary of State may exercise his power under subsection 3(b) in respect of an organisation only if he believes that it has ceased to be concerned in terrorism.".
<P>
</UL></FONT>This probing amendment would change the Secretary of State's power to de-proscribe an organisation and remove it from schedule 2, permitting him to do so only if he believed that it had ceased to be concerned with terrorism. The amendment mirrors precisely the obligation on the Secretary of State to believe that an organisation is concerned with terrorism when he proscribes it.
<P>
Does the Minister envisage circumstances in which the Government would seek to remove a proscribed organisation from schedule 2 without being persuaded that it had ceased to be concerned with terrorism? Unless the Government can conceive of such circumstances, I find it hard to see why they would oppose an amendment of this nature, even if they opposed this amendment.
<P>
Such an amendment might offer a buffer against Ministers less high-minded than the present Minister acting out of political motivation. I am aware that there are numerous competing political pressures on Ministers responsible for such areas of policy, and I could imagine circumstances in which the Home Office came under pressure from other Departments to remove a proscribed organisation from the list on wider political grounds. The amendment would give the Home Office Ministers responsible some protection and enable them to resist such pressure from their colleagues. I hope that the Minister will consider such an amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> The amendment is helpful and is in the same spirit as the probing amendments that the hon. Gentleman moved earlier. His underlying concern is that the Secretary of State might seek to de-proscribe an organisation that remains actively involved in terrorism. As we discussed earlier, the conduct of all hon. Members who deal with the matter makes that extremely unlikely, but I understand why he probes as he does.
<P>
When considering whether to de-proscribe an organisation, the Secretary of State has to take account of the nature and scale of the group's activities, the specific threat that the organisation poses to the United Kingdom and to UK citizens abroad, and the extent of the group's presence in the UK. There is also a need to support other members of the international community in the global fight against terrorism. All those questions are matters of judgment and the Secretary of State will take a view based on an assessment of the issues at the time. However, it is conceivable--I stress only conceivable--that a Secretary of State will consider, when weighing the balance of the issues that I have described, that an organisation should cease to be a candidate for proscription in the United Kingdom. By some definitions, that same organisation may remain involved in terrorism in a global sense. That is not likely to happen, but it is conceivable. As I said, the Secretary of State will take his or her responsibilities very seriously. It is right to ensure that the Secretary of State can weigh up the factors that I have described without being constrained in law in such a way that prevents him or her from making a decision on proscription. That is why the proposed legislation is as it is and why I hope that the hon. Gentleman will consider withdrawing his probing amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his reply and for the constructive way in which he has approached my amendment. I shall withdraw my amendment, but I reserve my right to broach the subject again in the later stages of the Bill. I understand the Minister's argument that the Secretary of State should have flexibility to consider all the factors affecting a judgment on an organisation. I understand, too, his argument that proscription must be proportionate to the nature of the organisation's activity. None the less, I remain somewhat concerned about the possibility--however unlikely it seems at the moment--that the Government's decision could be influenced by other political factors that might lead a future Secretary of State to an unwise decision to de-proscribe an organisation that was still engaged in terrorist activity. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 5, in page 2, line 25, at end add--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(6) The Secretary of State shall review once every year all those organisations which are currently proscribed following consultation with interested parties.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would add a new subsection to clause 3, and is part of a set of proposals designed to give us an opportunity to review the legislation regularly. Irrespective of what happens to our amendments, we believe that there must be an opportunity to review regularly proscribed organisations. At present, under the emergency powers legislation, there is an opportunity to debate such issues. We may or may not agree to a periodic review of the legislation as a whole. I guess that even if we were to do so, it would happen probably once a Parliament rather than once a year. Whatever the position, we should have the opportunity to consider which organisations are proscribed. I understand that the Minister said that it was not the Government's intention or expectation that domestic organisations other than Irish ones would be included. He has not yet said whether the Government intend to proscribe international 65 66 organisations. It would help to know the answer to that. Whatever views we have about the process, I hope that the Minister will give a sympathetic response to my suggestion to have regular reviews to which Parliament and others can contribute.
<P>
I hope that the process will allow consultation and that a report of such consultation will be available so that Parliament can see it before its review. Intelligence and counter-intelligence is part of the mechanism for deciding who is a terrorist. It would be easy for the Government to say that they cannot reveal information because it is not in the interests of public safety. How will the Terrorism Bill and the Freedom of Information Bill work together? If we are to have realistic debates every year about which organisations are proscribed, there needs to be information other than declarations from Secretaries of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey has made some sensible points. I hope that the Government will provide for an annual report prior to a debate in Parliament on the issue. I hope, too, that a review of the list of organisations will form part of that overall annual review. I should prefer it to be arranged in that way, rather than to have only a separate annual review of the proscribed organisations, although I understand the procedure that the hon. Gentleman had to follow in moving his amendment.
<P>
The only risk with the requirement for an annual review is that it may become the maximum standard. Whitehall may cease to keep the list of proscribed organisations under regular review, given the circumstances pertaining at any moment, but may save up for the annual duty of reporting to Parliament. In general, I support the thrust of the hon. Gentleman's argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I agree with the hon. Member for Aylesbury. The question needs to be considered in the context of the overall review. While I cannot go beyond what my hon. Friend said earlier, or what I said on the Floor of the House, we are actively looking at the best way of enabling Parliament to discuss the process. I hope that before the Committee stage is over, we shall have proposals for the Committee to consider. I believe that that is the best way of addressing the issue. I emphasise that schedule 2 is a public document so, by definition, changes to it are public matters. I assure the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey that the Government keep proscribed organisations under perpetual review. We do not put their names in a filing cabinet and forget about them. It is a serious matter, which is continually reviewed, and to have a formal annual review would impose a rather artificial time frame. We need to keep the situation under perpetual review; we shall continue to do so. Any changes that arise from that review--either proscription or de-proscription will be made public simply because schedule 2 will need to be amended.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I shall not say anything about international groups at this stage. It is too early to say which, if any, might in future be proscribed. A vast range of factors, of the sort to which I referred in the previous debate, need to be taken into account. With respect to the hon. Gentleman, it is not a matter that relates to amendment No. 5, although I understand the thrust of his argument that those matters should be clearly understood.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be prepared to withdraw the amendment. I assure him that we are looking constructively at how to ensure that Parliament can properly debate the operation of the Bill, including the matter of proscription.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> In a moment, I shall seek the Committee's leave to withdraw the amendment. As the hon. Member for Aylesbury said, I was trying to deal with the matter in a logical order, but I am mindful of the background and the wider issue of how we should review the legislation. I am encouraged that the Minister still intends to pursue that matter, and I am perfectly content to come to it at the appropriate time.
<P>
I wish to press the Minister on two matters. First, his interesting comments on international organisations --they were obviously different from his comments on national organisations--lead me to conclude that the Government are considering whether international organisations should be proscribed, or at least are not excluding the possibility. People listening to our debates or reading Hansard should realise that, soon after enacment of the Bill, action could be taken to proscribe international organisations. The Minister may choose not to do so, but it would be helpful to have that information. I do not want him to be misunderstood, but he made a clear distinction between national and international organisations, and I drew the conclusion that the Government had it on their agenda that international organisations would soon be included in the list.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I stand by the words that I gave earlier. The hon. Gentleman is entitled to draw whatever conclusions he wants, but I have nothing to add to what I said.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is a fair point. The amendment is about review, not about what organisations may or may not be on the list. Although the hon. Gentleman is entitled to use that factor to make his point, I am a little worried that we are should be talking about what may or may not be on the list.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The Minister may simply have neglected to answer another point. In the context of any review that might be undertaken, will he explain the interrelationship of this Bill and the Freedom of Information Bill? It would help if the Minister could answer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I ducked the question because I am not an expert on the Freedom of Information Bill--some may say that I am fortunate, others not. I was therefore loth to be drawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I congratulate the Minister, if only because it saves me a task.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Honest answers and defences are always best, Mr. Stevenson. Other hon. Members are now debating those very matters in another Room.
<P>
The Minister is entitled to make that answer. However, if he has not volunteered the information at a later stage, I shall press him further. We cannot debate the matter if the information is kept secret. We have dealt with the substantive matters that I wished to raise, and we can return to the matter on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> We have made good progress, and I do not intend to take the Committee beyond the end of the time allocated for today's sitting. However, I should like to make a few points about the clause, because it is, as the Minister said, important.
<P>
The weakness of the clause as a whole, putting to one side the individual points that we have debated, is that it will sweep into criminality people attached to organisations involved in criminal activity, when criminal law is, in most cases, sufficient. Criminal law has two elements, both of which involve guilt, which relate to committing an offence as the key activist, and aiding and abetting the commission of an offence. Under criminal law, conspiracy to commit offences and aiding and abetting offences can easily become offences for which the person involved is taken to court, and for which he may be subject to a significant period of imprisonment.
<P>
There is a general civil liberty concern about why an additional offence, namely belonging to an organisation and participation in its activities, has been introduced, when in most cases the criminal law is, or should be, sufficient. That seems to be the key question in relation to proscription, and we should be very careful.
<P>
I should be grateful, if the Minister is kind enough to say that principled abstentions are sometimes acceptable, to have the opportunity to abstain on the clause. As I am sensitive to the Northern Ireland situation, I shall not be a head-banging, inconsiderate Liberal--even if I shall never be a woolly Liberal.
<P>
As I said, I am not happy about the clause. Some arguments have been advanced through amendments, and we shall have an opportunity to return to it. I reserve  my position, but I am not happy. Why are the Government introducing a principled extension of the law in this way? An answer to that question would clarify a matter that we have not yet debated.

<P>

<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I shall eschew the strong temptation to press the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey on which of his parliamentary colleagues he considers to be headbangers.
<P>
Although strong arguments can be advanced on both sides, the balance of the argument is that the power to proscribe terrorist organisations should remain on the statute book. I wish that conditions were such that that power were unnecessary, but the evidence on the nature of terrorist organisations and on the history of how the powers have been used, to the effect that they have, in deterring and branding terrorist organisations is persuasive. The power should remain on the statute book.
<P>
I remain anxious that we may not have struck the right balance between the Secretary of State's freedom of action in making a decision and the necessary safeguards against abuse of power. I may, therefore, want to return to the matter on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> Proscription has a powerful role as a deterrent in tackling low-level support, and as a powerful signal of Government activity. Without, I hope, being head-banging and inconsiderate, I say to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey that, as the hon. Member for Aylesbury said, the matter involves a finely balanced judgment and difficult issues. It discredits the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey and his party not to be prepared to make a judgment on an important issue that involves such a finely balanced judgment. I understand the reasons for sometimes making a principled abstention, but on an issue such as this hon. Members must make a judgment, and I hope that they will agree that the clause should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
