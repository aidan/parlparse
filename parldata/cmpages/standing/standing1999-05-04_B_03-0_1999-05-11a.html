<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Good morning. I see that the national 
press ran several items about the permission given to 
remove garments during our previous sitting. I am happy 
to continue to permit the removal of garments, but it may 
be necessary for Committee members to check again with 
my co-Chairman at the beginning of this afternoon's 
sitting.

<P>
<B>Mr. John Whittingdale </B>(Maldon and East 
Chelmsford): We have already heard a number of good 
speeches from Opposition members of the Committee in 
support of the amendments, so I shall not go over those 
arguments again. However, I should like to touch on a 
few points that have yet to be made fully.
<P>
The key issue is that the differential between the price 
of tobacco products in this country and on the continent 
is encouraging smuggling on a huge scale. It is true that 
the previous Government implemented a policy of 
increasing the price by means of an escalator. However, 
there comes a point when the profit that can be made as 
a result of that differential increases dramatically, and I 
believe that we have now passed that point.
<P>
A few weeks ago I visited Adinkerke, in Belgium, with 
the Tobacco Alliance. [Interruption.] I should tell 
Government members of the Committee that the Tobacco 
Alliance represents 26,000 independent cigarette retailers. 
As a result of the Government's policy, many such 
retailers are suffering. Indeed, many are being driven out 
of business by the current extent of smuggling.



<P>
With some independent retailers, I visited Eastenders, 
a warehouse store with which some hon. Members may 
be familiar, run by Dave West and his wife Kathy. 
Eastenders specialises in the selling in bulk of cigarettes 
and hand-rolling tobacco, and its customers are 
exclusively British. During my visit I saw a steady stream 
of vehicles, all of which had British registration plates, 
loading large quantities of tobacco. The journey to 
Eastenders is remarkably easy one crosses the channel 
on Eurostar and drives a short distance across the Belgian 
border and takes no longer than a couple of hours.
<P>
I saw a man place £1,000 in cash on the counter at 
Eastenders to buy hand-rolling tobacco. In Belgium, 
hand-rolling tobacco costs £2 a pack; in this country it 
costs £8 a pack. Therefore he paid £1,000 for a quantity 
of hand-rolling tobacco that would retail at £4,000 in the 
United Kingdom. He duly loaded the tobacco into the 
boot of his car and I asked him whether that was 
something that he did regularly. He replied, "Oh yes 
about once every three months."	
<P>
As the Minister knows, it is perfectly legal to import 
tobacco into this country for one's own consumption, but 
it strains credulity to imagine that that man intended to 
consume £4,000-worth of hand-rolling tobacco in three 
months. He was merely one of hundreds of such visitors 
to Eastenders, which is open 24 hour a day.



<P>
Mrs. West, a delightful lady, told me that she and her 
husband celebrated when the Budget was announced 
they were probably the only people in the world who did. 
For them, it represented a real opportunity to increase 
sales and make more profit. Mr. Dave West said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"There's brands of cigarettes on sale here in Belgium that 
Belgians don't smoke, so it's obvious that these cigarettes are 
destined for British people and are going back to England. It's very 
clear, the amounts of cigarettes that are sold for example, we sell 
now I think it's one third of all the cigarettes and tobacco that's sold 
in the entirety of Belgium. Now, we don't have any Belgian 
customers."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is what is happening at the small-scale end of the 
business. People are filling up transit vans, Land Rovers 
or the backs of their cars, for themselves and their friends, 
and to make a few bob selling the cigarettes in the pub 
car park.
<P>
Unfortunately, that is not the only aspect of the 
business. There is now a great deal of involvement by 
organised crime. There are worrying reports that the IRA 
has now moved into the business in Ireland. I should like 
to draw the attention of the Committee to a recent 
television programme, "Tonight with Trevor McDonald"	, 
which looked into the matter. The reporter said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It's Wednesday morning in Dover docks, and a massive load of 
six million cigarettes has been discovered inside a container lorry, 
all disguised as an innocent consignment of kiwi fruit. Cigarette 
smuggling is now a major underground industry; it's run by 
organised crime on an international scale. The techniques they use 
are those of the drug smugglers and the attraction is that if you get 
caught, cigarettes, unlike drugs, carry low penalties."<P>
</UL></FONT>	
<P>
The reporter set up a deal with a smuggler. He 
contacted someone named David through another 
gentleman known as Torquay Paul, and arranged to 
purchase 200,000 cigarettes at less than half the legal 
price. He said that David gave them a rendezvous point 
near the M25 in Essex, where they were to meet another 
gang member, Geordie Denis. For the purposes of the 
programme, the deal was set up, and at the end, the 
reporter made himself known to Geordie Denis. I shall 
not quote what Geordie Denis said I shall leave that to 
the imagination of members of the Committee.
<P>
That was a graphic demonstration of the hugh scale of 
the business now being conducted. We are heading 
rapidly towards the same problem that we began to 
experience a few years ago with hand-rolling tobacco. 
Eight years ago, nearly all hand-rolling tobacco sales were 
fully duty-paid. The proportion is now 25 per cent. 
Seventy-five per cent. of hand-rolling tobacco sales are 
now non-duty-paid the vast bulk is illegally imported. 
The Chancellor recognised the problem to some extent 
and did not increase the duty on it, although he did 
increase duty on other things.
<P>
The amendment would cut the duty on hand-rolling 
tobacco to what it was when the Government took office. 
There is no doubt that the hand-rolling tobacco market 
has been lost. Very few legal hand-rolling tobacco sales 
are taking place. The retailers, and the Tobacco Alliance, 
now say that they do not sell it. No one buys it any longer, 
because they can get it so much more cheaply through the 
black market. That is happening not only here but in 
Sweden, which, because of its accession to the European 
Union, was required to increase the duty on cigarettes 
dramatically. The first increase was 25 per cent. in 
January 1997, followed in August 1997 by a further
29 per cent., which resulted in an overall excise duty 
increase of 62.5 per cent.
<P>
The result was a huge increase in smuggling. The 
Swedish customs board estimated that 39.3 million 
cigarettes were smuggled into Sweden in 1997, compared 
with an estimated six million in 1995. A senior customs 
official stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"organised crime is focusing more on cigarettes than narcotics today 
because the profit is better and the risk is minimal."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The parallel with events in this country is clear.
<P>
When the Swedish Government were confronted by the 
problem, they took dramatic action. They cut the rate of 
duty in the 1998 budget by approximately 30 per cent. In 
the budget proposal, the Swedish Government said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Since cigarette prices on the Swedish market are so high 
compared with neighbouring countries and the prices of cigarettes 
sold illegally, the profitability of cross-border trade and smuggling 
will continue to be great enough so as to necessitate additional 
measures. It is therefore important to reduce the prices on the legal 
cigarette market."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are not proposing to cut the duty today, but there is 
no doubt that dramatic measures are needed. I hope that 
the Government will look closely at what happens in 
Sweden as a result of its decision. Preliminary evidence 
shows that the proportion of the market taken by legal 
sales has started to increase following that cut in duty.
<P>
This is a serious problem and it will get worse. I draw 
the Financial Secretary's attention to information 
provided by Customs and Excise, for which her 
Department is responsible. The Public and Commercial 
Services Union, which represents Customs and Excise 
employees, said in its briefing paper:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The published estimate for 1996 stated that 1.5 per cent. of the 
market in cigarettes was lost through cross-channel smuggling. By 
1998 the figure had risen to 10 per cent. The Department now 
estimates that present trends suggest that smuggled cigarettes will 
soon comprise 30 per cent. of the UK market."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have already pointed out that 75 per cent. of hand-rolling 
tobacco is smuggled. The PCSU also said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"There is evidence that the Italian Mafia and organised Eastern 
European gangs are involved as well as UK criminals."<P>
</UL></FONT>	
<P>
I conclude by drawing the Committee's attention to an 
excellent speech which made those points well. In the 
1995 Finance Bill debate on tobacco duty, the current 
Paymaster General said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"As they did during the debate on alcohol, the Government 
completely close their eyes to the implications of their tobacco 
taxation policy and the way in which it will provide opportunities 
for tobacco smuggling. Smuggling not only undermines the industry 
here, and therefore will eventually weaken what tax base there is, but 
undermines the Government's health policy, because the contraband 
goods are unregulated and available to the very groups for whom 
the Government's health policy, "The Health of the Nation", sets 
targets to reduce smoking the 11 to 15-year-old age range.
<P>
By pursuing the tobacco industry, through taxation, the 
Government are undermining that. We have made clear our views 
on the health aspects, on curtailing smoking and encouraging people 
not to smoke, but taxation is not the way to do that."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That was what the Paymaster General said just four years 
ago. She concluded by saying:



<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The industry itself has produced substantial and convincing 
arguments. I say that as a committed anti-smoker. The information 
provided by the tobacco industry shows only too clearly the 
disastrous route down which the Government's taxation policy is 
taking us. We will lose control of tax. We will lose control, through 
tobacco products, of our health policy and we will undermine 
considerably the country's industry."	 [Official Report, 23 January 
1995; Vol. 253, c. 106-7.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If that was the Labour party's view in 1995, surely it must 
be its view today, because the problem is far worse. There 
is evidence that the proportion of people in this country who 
smoke has started to increase again. In 1994, the general 
household survey put that proportion at 27 per cent. and in 
1996 at 28 per cent. Latest research shows that in 1997 it 
stood at 28.2 per cent. and in 1998 at 28.5 per cent. The 
proportion of people who smoke is beginning to increase. It 
must be apparent that a major determinant of those figures 
is the increase in smuggling and the ease with which it is 
possible to obtain cut-price cigarettes illegally.
<P>
The policy of increasing tobacco taxation year after 
year is failing. The proportion of the population who 
smoke is increasing, businesses are being driven under by 
illegal imports and the Government's revenue from 
tobacco tax is forecast to fall. If the policy is failing to 
that extent, surely it makes sense to stop and reconsider 
it. That is why we propose a freeze on tobacco duties and 
a full re-examination of the whole issue. Unless that is 
done, the problem will simply get worse.

<P>

<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury </b>(Mrs. Barbara Roche): The hon. Member for Maldon 
and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale) has just made 
the final contribution to this interesting debate, which 
began last week, when some excellent speeches were 
made by Labour Members.
<P>
I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for highlighting 
the fact that the Opposition stand by their amendments. 
Several interesting articles on this subject appeared in the 
press last Tuesday. One headline stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Tories give a whiff of hope to smokers".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Another particularly interesting article, which described 
the health lobby's reaction, was headed: "Tories make em 
fume"	. I make no comment on another headline: 
"Fag-end Tories"	.
<P>
An article in the Financial Times, which worried me 
considerably, stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Conservative Treasury team's hostility to higher tobacco duties 
... came as something of a surprise to"	 <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the Conservative party's Front-Bench health team, and 
said that the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton 
(Mr. Duncan) and the hon. Member for Maldon and East 
Chelmsford had to have last-minute talks to reconcile 
their approach. This sympathetic Labour Government 
often have to sit back and watch such distressing scenes. 
Last Tuesday, I saw the right hon. Member for Maidstone 
and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe), who is the 
Opposition's Front-Bench spokesman on health, outside 
in the Corridor, and I felt for the hon. Gentleman because 
I thought that he was in for a hard time.
<P>
I shall answer some of the questions raised in our 
debate. The right hon. Member for Charnwood 
(Mr. Dorrell), who is in Committee now, asked what the 
Government's policies were. They involve the approach 
that has been pursued by successive Governments for 
good, urgent health reasons. Smoking kills more than 
120,000 people a year in the United Kingdom, and 
evidence shows that high taxes are an important way to 
reduce tobacco consumption.
<P>
However, taxation is just one part of the Government's 
anti-smoking strategy. We have introduced the first NHS 
programme to help people quit over a three-year period, 
with funding of more than £60 million. No previous 
Government have provided such support. In relation to 
tobacco revenue, the Chancellor said in his Budget speech 
that he would bring forward the duty increases from 
December to March to pay for the package of measures 
for pensioners, which he also announced in that speech. 
How will the Opposition fill that gap in the revenue, and 
what will they say to pensioners?
<P>
The rates in different members states were mentioned 
on several occasions. Cutting tobacco duty to the Belgian 
level could cost the Exchequer £4.5 billion in lost 
revenue, and the Opposition's amendment would cost the 
Exchequer up to £2.5 billion. The Opposition seem to 
fritter money away. During the debate on the Budget, the 
Second Reading debate on the Bill and in Committee, 
moving amendment after amendment, Opposition 
members have never said how they would pay for their 
proposals. would they increase income tax to pay for 
them?
<P>
The effect of smuggling and fraud on revenue 
objectives is a serious threat. The hon. Member for 
Maldon and East Chelmsford, who has just smoken 
[Laughter.] Much of the revenue would go up in smoke 
if the hon. Gentleman who has just smoken, and spoken, 
had his way. We share his view that organised crime plays 
a part in that threat, but to give in to organised crime, as 
Opposition Members suggest, would be blatant nonsense.
<P>
The hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) 
said that Customs did not have the resources to cope with 
the present level of smuggling. That is not so. We have 
allocated an additional £35 million over three years to 
Customs to support the implementation of the alcohol and 
tobacco fraud review. There are now 420 excise 
verification officers in place, compared with only 250 in 
1993. The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford 
referred to my hon. Friend the Paymaster General. When 
she became Financial Secretary she immediately 
increased the resources available to Customs and Excise 
and, at a stroke, ensured that our health and revenue 
policy was protected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> Will not the comprehensive 
spending review result in a cut of 1,200 in the number of 
staff working in Customs and Excise?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The hon. Gentleman must get his facts 
right. As in any Government Department, efficiency 
exercises are always taking place. Any reductions will not 
be in front-line staff. We have not only protected 
front-line staff, we have increased their number. The hon. 
Gentleman must answer for the fact that we have 
increased the number of those valuable officers to 420, 
whereas there were only 250 of them in 1993. If the hon. 
Gentleman and his party care so much about the matter, 
what would they do about it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Colin Breed </B>(South-East Cornwall): Have not the 
verification officers been redesignated from other posts, 
so that no new posts have been produced?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The verification officers have a vital role. 
The hon. Gentleman mentioned Plymouth at our previous 
sitting, and I shall deal with that subject specifically when 
I come to it.
<P>
It is distressing that when the men and women in 
Customs and Excise provide a vital and valuable service, 
often with great difficulty, their successes are not 
celebrated by Opposition Members. During the first six 
months of 1998-99 the tax value of cross-channel 
detection by excise verification officers was £62 million, 
which was an increase of £29 million from the value in 
the equivalent period in the previous year. It would have 
been pleasing to hear from Opposition Members some 
indication that they value the work of customs officers, 
the police and the joint agency.
<P>
The hon. Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed) 
has referred to resources at Plymouth. I assure him that 
there has been no reduction in the staff deployed on the 
detection of alcohol smuggling in Plymouth. In fact, there 
has been a small increase in excise enforcement and in 
the number of fiscal intelligence officers.
<P>
The hon. Member for Cotswold and the hon. Member 
for Maldon and East Chelmsford commented on Canada 
and Sweden, and suggested that we follow their example. 
The parallel with Canada and Sweden is too easily drawn. 
In both cases, the reduction was part of a wider package 
of anti-fraud measures. Furthermore, Sweden reduced its 
duty rate only in August, so it is too early to draw 
conclusions.
<P>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton
(Mr. Davey), in a helpful contribution, pointed out that 
low-taxing countries, such as Spain and Italy, where the 
duty on a packet of 20 cigarettes is only 47p and 77p 
respectively, also suffer significant levels of smuggling 
from third countries. Conservative Members should 
therefore ensure that they mention all the facts to the 
Committee.
<P>
A number of hon. Members said that smuggling was 
creating a criminal culture, which is true. That is no 
reason, however, to give in to that culture and condone it 
by saying, "Because we have this problem, we will cut 
the rate of duty"	.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Dorrell </B>(Charnwood): The Financial 
Secretary has now said twice that removing the duty 
discrepancy that creates the incentive for smuggling is 
giving in to smugglers. Can she explain how removing the 
opportunity that smugglers exploit is giving in to them?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I am surprised at the right hon. 
Gentleman, especially as he is a former Secretary of State 
for Health. A serious criminal culture also surrounds the 
drugs problem. Do we suggest removing the incentive for 
that market by legalisation? Of course not. That is why the 
Government, and all right-thinking hon. Members, have 
firmly rejected legalisation. The right hon. Gentleman's 
argument is complete nonsense.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Mr. Leslie) 
reminded the Committee of the harm that smoking does. 
For every 1,000 20-year-old smokers, one will be 
murdered, six will die in motor accidents, 250 will die in 
middle age as a result of smoking, and 250 will die in old 
age as a result of smoking. United Kingdom studies show 
that a 1 per cent. increase in real price will reduce demand 
by between 0.2 per cent. and 0.6 per cent. I have already 
mentioned the real help that exists for smokers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> No Opposition Member would 
argue about the damage that smoking does to people's 
health. Is the Financial Secretary saying that her hon. 
Friend the Paymaster General was wrong when she said 
that smuggling undermined the Government's health 
policy, and taxation was not the way?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Of course my hon. Friend the Paymaster 
General was right when she said that smuggling 
undermined the Government's health policy. That is why, 
as soon as she took up her post, she put the necessary 
resources into Customs and Excise, which had been 
wilfully neglected by the previous Government.
<P>
I understand and accept that the hon. Gentleman 
genuinely wants to deal with smoking. I hope, however, 
that he will forgive me for saying that I find his plans for 
doing so extraordinary. Last Tuesday, he spoke on the 
"Today"	 programme. Not only were his plans criticised 
by all the cancer research charities in this country, which 
comprise many eminent men and women, but by 
Mr. Clive Bates, the director of Action on Smoking and 
Health, who said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Opposition's plan to reverse the escalator because of illegal 
activity iscompletely spineless."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are not my words but those of the director of a 
national organisation that is well known for its stance on 
this subject. So the hon. Gentleman's protestations that 
the Opposition are doing their best to support 
anti-smoking health policies ring hollow.
<P>
The hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Woodward) said 
that the source of cigarettes for many under-age and other 
young smokers was illegal activity. The hon. Gentleman 
is not in his place at the moment, but most children who 
smoke say that they buy their cigarettes from shops. That 
makes us even more determined to work with local 
enforcement agencies to ensure that everyone complies 
with the law.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Sadly, the right hon. Member for Wells
(Mr. Heathcoat-Amory), who began the debate, is not in 
his place at the moment. He referred to the downward 
revision of the forecast for tobacco revenue, implying that 
smuggling was undermining our revenue objectives. Yes, 
the forecast is down, but the growth in tobacco smuggling 
accounts for only a small proportion of that reduction.

<P>

<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): What about 
the rest?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Hon. Members must curb their 
impatience. Everything comes to those who wait.
I welcome the right hon. Member for Wells to the 
Committee; I was just speaking about him.
<P>
Most of the downward revision is accounted for by the 
effect that bringing forward the escalator from December 
to March will have on cash receipts.
<P>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton asked, 
quite understandably, about progress on the 
implementation of the alcohol and tobacco review.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I was listening carefully to the 
Financial Secretary, and she said that part of the drop in 
revenue to which my right hon. Friend the Member for 
Wells referred in his speech, and the difference between 
the forecast and the Budget estimate of £1.9 billion were 
caused by bringing forward the escalator. Bringing 
forward the escalator would imply an increase in duty, not 
a decrease. Can the hon. Lady explain that?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Yes I can. What will happen this has 
happened in previous years is that, as a result of the 
change that we have implemented, there will be no 
significant forestalling by manufacturers in 1999-2000, 
which will result in a substantial reduction in duty receipts 
this year. It is a very temporary effect. In later years, the 
net effect on cash receipts will be positive. Again, a little 
research on the part of Opposition Members would have 
given them that information.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Heald (North-East Hertfordshire) rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> It is always a pleasure to give way to an 
Opposition Whip.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> There used to be a hotline that members 
of the public could ring if they were aware of smuggling 
or some other breach of customs rules. Is that scheme still 
in place? If so, why is it not publicised?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> So far as I am aware, the answer is yes, 
the hotline is still in place, and it is publicised, As I am 
sure the hon. Gentleman will be pleased to know, I have 
had meetings with the trade and I think that the hotline is 
used. Of course I would be pleased as, I hope would 
Opposition Members if as many members of the public 
as possible used it. The Committee should send out that 
strong message to express what we feel about smuggling.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> rose 
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Of course I shall give way to the Whip 
again,
<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> I promise not to speak too much in 
Committee, but can the Financial Secretary explain how 
the hotline is publicised? One never sees any publicity for 
it anywhere.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I should be happy to find that out for the 
hon. Gentleman, and I shall ensure that the information is 
given to all Committee members. Perhaps we could all 
make sure that the hotline is well publicised in our 
constituencies, which would send out a strong message.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton):
A moment ago, the hon. Lady said that only a small 
proportion of the fall in revenues from tobacco duty was 
due to smuggling. Why, therefore, does the Red Book say 
in paragraph B28:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The forecast of receipts from tobacco duty also takes account of 
new evidence, available since the PBR, that cigarette smuggling and 
the loss of revenue associated with it, has been growing rapidly."<P>
</UL></FONT>	
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> We accepted that. [Interruption.] It may 
be a little early in the morning for some Opposition 
Members, but they must pay attention. I said that the right 
hon. Member for Wells had appeared to suggest that the 
entire fall was due to smuggling, but that is not, of course, 
the case. We accept that smuggling has had an effect, 
which is why we are determined to do something about it.
<P>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbition asked 
what progress had been made in terms of implementing 
proposals from the alcohol and tobacco fraud review. 
Progress is well under way, and many measures will be 
implemented by the end of 1999. As I said, some 
measures have already been implemented, and more than 
100 additional staff are in place. Policies relating to 
prosecutions and seized vehicles have been revised, which 
I am sure will be welcomed.
<P>
My. hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North 
(Ms Keeble) ably reminded us of the record of the right 
hon. Member for Charnwood, who has performed a 
significant U-turn in this context. The situation is very 
sad.
<P>
The hon. Member for Witney discussed the effect of 
tax increased on poorer people. We have ensured that the 
NHS provides real support to help smokers to quit. For 
example, for the first time nicotine patches are being made 
available free of charge to those who are least able to 
afford them. Our measures have been warmly welcomed 
by Labour Members.
<P>
We had a long and, in some ways, very good debate, 
in which many important matters were raised. The 
amendment leaves many questions unanswered. Cutting 
or freezing duty rats would lead to a rise in smoking. 
How would the Opposition discourage young people from 
smoking, and how would they deal with the fact that 
freezing duty rates would not stop smuggling? How 
would they make up the revenue shortfall? Amendment 
No. 9 would cost £2.5 billion, and amendments Nos. 2 to 
5, which were proposed by the shadow Treasury Front 
Bench, would cost £455 million.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> At the previous general election the 
Financial Secretary and her colleagues stood on a 
platform of not increasing taxes. No one denies that the 
duties should not be indexed, but indexing way beyond 
the rate of inflation involves a clear increase in taxation, 
and the Financial Secretary's party was elected on a 
commitment not to introduce such changes. How can she 
fill that black hole?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I was waiting for the hon. Gentleman to 
ask that question. We take no lessons from the 
Conservative party in this regard. An article last week in 
The Times stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Tory move means a reversal of the party's policy at the last 
election. The 1997 Conservative campaign guide said that a Tory 
government would have continued to raise duty".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
[Interruption.] The hon. Gentleman must not protest 
about the fact that he has been caught out. I hate to give 
advice, but one should never ask a question if one cannot 
predict what the answer will be.
<P>
I hope that I hate convinced the Opposition to withdraw 
the amendment. If they do not, I hope that my hon. 
Friends will vote against it.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I should now put the Question 
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> rose 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> You are somewhat late,
Mr. Clifton-Brown.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I have listened carefully to the 
debate on the amendment, which I moved, and I want to 
make one or two points.
<P>
The Financial Secretary, in a typically politically robust 
speech, failed to address the central flaw in the 
Government's tobacco taxation policy. The flaw takes two 
forms, the first of which is that it fails on health grounds. 
The total incidence of cigarette smoking is increasing. 
Tobacco duty is regressive and hits the poor. Cigarette 
smoking among young people, particularly women, is 
increasing. The Financial Secretary said that the 
Government are generously giving out nicotine patches, 
but their provision is so measly that it does not help 
everyone on income support, let alone anyone else.
<P>
The second aspect of the flaw is that the policy fails to 
protect Government revenue. The Financial Secretary 
asked what the Opposition would do to secure the 
shortfall. The answer is obvious: the Government should 
increase the resources of Her Majesty's Customs and 
Excise to deal with the problem properly. Dame Valerie 
Strachan, who, as chairman of Customs and Excise, 
appeared before the Public Accounts Committee 
yesterday, said that between 1997 and 1998, Customs and 
Excise staff was reduced by 1,236 and that a further 
reduction of 1,200 staff is proposed. That is a reduction 
of 2,500 staff. What is the Government's response? They 
have decided to give an extra £35 million over three years, 
which will create a mere 100 extra jobs to replace the 
2,500 lost. The Financial Secretary claimed that the cuts 
have involved back-room staff. That may be so, but 
back-room functions still have to be carried out and 
front-line operations suffer as a result. I gave plenty of 
examples of that in my opening remarks.
<P>
The rate of smuggling is increasing. It is all very well 
for the hon. Lady to say that we should increase duty to 
prevent the consumption of cigarettes. That would work 
in a perfect market but, as my hon. Friend the Member for 
Maldon and East Chelmsford said, it is easy to smuggle 
cigarettes from the continent. The policy will not work 
because smuggling will increase. We should freeze duty, 
increase the resources to Her Majesty's Customs and 
Excise and stop the huge haemorrhage that is taking place 
as a result of smuggling.
<P>
The forecast between the November pre-Budget 
statement and the Red Book shows that total duties that 
the Revenue receives are expected to decrease from 
£99.7 billion to £99.2 billion. The Government are not 
protecting revenue. It is interesting to note that in every 
case where duty is being increased in excess of inflation 
cigarettes, fuel, beer and cider the revenue forecast has 
dropped. An increase in duty that is higher than inflation 
results in an increase in smuggling. Everyone knows that.
<P>
I shall withdraw my amendment on the basis that I will 
support the amendments tabled by my right hon. and hon. 
Friends. I hope that they will press their amendments to a 
vote because the situation is eminently unsatisfactory. The 
Government should look at the resources that they are 
giving to Her Majesty's Customs and Excise. Every 
Opposition Member applauds its work and no one 
condones smuggling or increased smoking, but those 
factors are not being tackled by the Government. I urge 
them to reconsider their policies.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`come into force on 1st December 1999.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not wish to detain the Committee unduly on the 
amendment, which merely flags up the fact that the 
Government have not only increased the duty on cigarettes 
by raising the escalator to five per cent., but brought 
forward the date of implementation. That is yet another 
example of stealth taxation. Smokers will have to pay the 
increase with effect from Budget day, rather than from
1 December 1999, as was the case. We oppose the increase 
and the amendment would restore the previous position.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Given that the measure was introduced 
and announced on Budget day, it is rather odd to be 
accused of taxation by stealth.
<P>
The Chancellor's intention is to align the timing of all 
excise duty changes with the spring Budget. With regard 
to tobacco duties, the decision to implement duty 
increased in March 1999, rather than to defer them until 
March 2000, again underlines the Government's 
commitment to our new tobacco strategy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> Will the Financial Secretary 
confirm a matter that we failed to elucidate during last 
Tuesday's sitting? She said that, henceforth, the 
Chancellor's strategy is for all excise duty increases to 
take effect on Budget day. Clearly, most rates of alcohol 
duty have not changed, but are we to assume that, under 
the new policy, any future increases will take effect on 
Budget day rather than later in the year?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I am slightly surprised by the hon. 
Gentleman's question. I refer him to the Chancellor's 
speech, which I am sure he will find makes interesting 
reading. I cannot see how the Chancellor can make his 
announcements any more public than that.
<P>
The alteration in the timing of changes to tobacco 
duty this year has also helped to reduce the incidence 
of bulk clearances of cigarettes from manufacturers' 
duty-suspense facilities in advance of duty increases. 
That ensures that revenue receipts are protected and 
health objectives are met. Yet again, the Opposition 
have not said how we might recoup the £620 million 
that their amendment would cost. I suppose that that is 
too much to expect from the hon. Gentleman, but
I would be interested to hear it.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the 
amendment. If not, I shall ask my hon. Friends to vote 
against it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I am profoundly unconvinced by 
the Minister's arguments, but I do not wish to detain the 
Committee, as we have made our point clear. I beg to ask 
leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): I beg to 
move amendment No. 11 in page 3, line 2, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3) Subject to subsection (4) below, this section shall cease to 
have effect after 6 o'clock in the evening of 31st December 1999.<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(4) If the House of Commons before the 30th December 1999 
adopts by affirmative resolution a report from Her Majesty's 
Treasury that details the measures the Government proposes to take 
to combat tobacco fraud following its current round of consultations 
on the recommendations published in January 1998 following Her 
Majesty's Customs and Excise Alcohol and Tobacco Fraud Review, 
subsection 3 above shall take effect.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Liberal Democrats have supported the 
Government's increase in duty on tobacco. We believe 
that the Government must pursue health objectives and 
that those are furthered by increasing tobacco duty. We 
share their concern, and the concern of the official 
Opposition, that that method of pursuing health objectives 
is undermined by smuggling. Unlike the official 
Opposition, we believe that some of the alternative ways 
of tackling smuggling, as set out in the alcohol and 
tobacco fraud review, should be pursued in the first 
instance. Those methods offer the prospect of a reduction 
in smoking and an increase in revenues, while maintaining 
the fight against the increase in smoking.
<P>
The amendment would link the increase in tobacco 
duties to action by the Government in pursuing vigorously 
the recommendations of the alcohol and tobacco fraud 
review, which the Minister mentioned in the previous 
debate. We want that obligation put on the statute book, 
as the problem needs to be monitored carefully and 
assiduously over the coming months. The Government 
must not delay consultations, they must explain the results 
of consultations to the House and they must proceed with 
any recommendations that have trade and cross-party 
consent. As duty is to be increased, they must also report 
on the success of measures to protect that revenue.
<P>
We want to give the Financial Secretary an opportunity 
to elaborate further on her comments about the review, on 
the Government's commitment to the review, and on how 
they envisage the review being implemented over the 
remainder of this year.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The hon. Gentleman's remarks are 
helpful. I assume that his reason, in part, for moving the 
amendment is to pursue the debate on how measures can 
be put in place. We are grateful for the Liberal 
Democrats' support in this matter. As I have said, we are 
very concerned about tobacco smuggling and fraud.
<P>
As the Committee will know, we commissioned the 
review shortly after taking office in 1997. I have already 
mentioned the tremendous part that my hon. Friend the 
Paymaster General played in that. The recommendations 
were published last summer, and a significant number 
have already been implemented. Significant additional 
resources were allocated for Customs and Excise as part 
of the comprehensive spending review. I assure the hon. 
Gentleman, and the whole Committee, that we will always 
keep the House informed of significant developments in 
the fight against smuggling and fraud.
<P>
Customs and Excise continues to work closely with our 
European counterparts and with the trade on 
implementing the remaining recommendations of the 
alcohol and tobacco fraud review. I want to place on 
record the Government's thanks to the trade for the part 
that it has played; we are grateful for its collaboration 
with us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> Will the Minister tell us whether the 
penalties for smuggling are to be considered in the 
review? There is a feeling that the penalties exacted on 
people who are caught are insufficient, and that more 
people may be prepared to engage in tobacco smuggling, 
rather than drugs smuggling, because the penalties for the 
latter are extremely high.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Those matters have been taken into 
account in prosecution policy, and in relation to seized 
vehicles. The hon. Member for South-East Cornwall is 
right to mention the increasing role of organised crime, as 
is the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford. The 
Government are concerned about that issue. Those gangs 
also commit other serious offences when they are engaged 
in such trafficking. I assure the Committee that the police, 
Customs and Excise and all other agencies involved will 
use the full rigour of the law to ensure that people who 
perpetrate those crimes and create a climate of criminality 
will be brought to justice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The question of what is permitted 
for personal consumption seems to cause confusion, in 
relation to smuggling. Many documentaries have been 
made on the subject. Huge vans go over the English 
channel to bring back cigarettes, alcohol and other 
commodities. Will the Minister look into this and ensure 
that the rules are tightened, so that only those who 
genuinely intend to use those commodities for personal 
consumption are permitted to do so?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I understand the point that the hon. 
Gentleman is making. He is referring to the indicative 
limits which were, in part, set by the previous 
Government. I am grateful to the hon. Member for 
Maldon and East Chelmsford for having raised the point 
that one should not confuse purchases legitimately made 
by members of the public exercising their right as 
participants in the single market to make purchases 
according to those indicative limits with the organised 
trade that is taking place. It is important to keep those two 
issues separate.
<P>
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Kingston and 
Surbiton for mentioning the importance of the alcohol and 
tobacco fraud review. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we 
shall continue to keep the House informed on that matter. 
I hope that he will withdraw the amendment, which would 
require the Government to produce a document, possibily 
at the wrong time, or at a time inconvenient to the House. 
I am not persuaded that that is necessary. If the hon. 
Gentleman does press the amendment to a Division, I 
would urge my hon. Friends to vote against it.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's 
assurance that the government intend to pursue the matter 
and to return to Parliament so that we can scrutinise their 
actions in the review.
<P>
Will the Minister comment more specifically on 
recommendations in the review? I wanted this debate so 
that she could tell the Committee how the Government 
are minded on specific recommendations. One, on which 
the trade press has commented and which I understand 
the Government are considering, is the recommendation 
for cigarettes and other specified tobacco products to be 
marked in a prominent position on the front of the pack, 
"For sale in the UK only."	 That would assist Excise 
officers to identify which cigarettes had been smuggled 
and which had not. In conjunction with another 
recommendation that the handling and sale of smuggled 
cigarettes and tobacco products be made an offence, that 
would massively increase the powers of Customs and 
Excise to pursue smuggling and, hopefully, to reduce it. 
Will the Minister comment on those specific 
recommendations before I ask leave to withdraw the 
amendment?

<P>

<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I am happy to do so. We are having 
discussions with the trade on recommendations to which 
the hon. Gentleman referred. On his second point, local 
enforcement officers have a role to play. We are 
discussing and considering everything in the review, as 
well as minimum indicative limits, to which the hon. 
Member for Cotswold referred, but that would require the 
unanimous agreement of all 15 member states of the 
European Union, which is often a lengthy process.
<P>
We are having discussions with the trade and all
the proposals in the view are being considered. We have 
implemented those that can be implemented immediately 
for example, the important recommendation for extra 
officers and we shall consider everything in the review as 
speedily as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the 
amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 5 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 6</center></H4>
<H4><center>Rate of pool betting duty</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the 
Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> Let me make it clear from the 
outset that we support clause 6 and welcome the 
Government's decision to reduce pool betting duty from 
26.5 per cent. to 17.5 per cent. The pools industry is 
important and faces serious difficulties. It would be wrong 
to pass over the clause without saying a few words 
about it.
<P>
This is the fourth reduction in pool betting duty. The 
previous Government made three reductions from 
42.5 per cent. to 26.5 per cent. in recognition of the 
enormous impact of the national lottery on the pools 
industry. Before its introduction, there was a steady 
growth in turnover, roughly in line with inflation, in the 
pools industry and in 1994 the total pools market came to 
£988 million. By the end of 1998, just four years later, 
that market had declined by 70 per cent. to just 
£290 million, and that decline continues. There has been 
a steady, downward trend since the national lottery came 
into being.
<P>
As a result, total revenue from pool betting duty has 
fallen from £341 million in 1994-95 to £96 million in 
1997-98. Pools companies have had to take painful 
decisions. Littlewoods, the largest company by far, has 
approximately 80 per cent. of the market. Vernons
has about 16 per cent. and Zetters has the remainder. The 
pools industry traditionally employs many collectors, but 
the number has fallen by 50 per cent. to fewer than 
40,000. For example, Vernons, which is based on 
Merseyside, had more than 1,000 full-time employees at 
the end of 1994. By the end of 1998, that figure had fallen 
to just 173.
<P>
The huge contraction of pools companies has also 
affected the amount of money provided for causes that 
benefit from pools companies, such as the Football Trust, 
the Foundation for Sport and the Arts, and the Football 
League. Pools companies have attempted to take on the 
competition. Vernons introduced a new game, called Easy 
Play, which tired to emulate the national lottery. 
Unfortunately, Easy Play was unable to compete with the 
huge prizes that the national lottery offers, and has been 
discontinued.
<P>
The pools industry made an extremely persuasive case 
for the proposed reduction in pool betting duty to the same 
level as VAT. Littlewoods said that the pools industry's 
survival depended on such a reduction, which would bring 
long-term benefit to the Treasury. Littlewoods calculated 
a net present value of £70 million. The extra money made 
available will be invested in the industry. For example, 
Littlewoods intend to introduce new hand-held terminals 
for its collectors. Trials for such terminals are being 
conducted in Basildon, which is not far from my 
constituency. Littlewoods believes that such investment 
will help stop the decline and enable it to survive.
<P>
All hon. Members have probably received the brief 
from Camelot, which argues that the company is already 
heavily taxed more heavily than football pools 
companies. It quotes an effective tax rate of 79 per cent. 
for the national lottery, compared with 48 per cent. for 
the football pools. I must say that those figures, which 
have been arrived at by lumping together various 
components of the national lottery's total take, are 
somewhat unconvincing. Committee members are 
unlikely to be persuaded that the national lottery is 
suffering hugely from excessive taxation. It was one of 
the successes of the previous Government, and we 
welcome that success. However, because of its strong 
position, competing industries, particularly the pools 
companies, are finding life difficult.
<P>
We certainly welcome the proposed reduction in pool 
betting duty. I hope that the Government will keep the 
mater under review, because the pools industry is 
suffering. If the reduction fails to reverse the industry's 
decline, we may need to reconsider the problem in future 
Finance Bills.
<P>
I should point out that Camelot said that there was a 
case for re-examining the regulation and taxation of the 
gaming industry. Given the great diversity in the taxation 
of gambling methods, that may be a strong argument.
<P>
The Opposition support the clause, but I felt it 
important to say something about an industry that 
continues to employ many people who live in deprived 
areas, and which continues to play an important part in 
the life of our nation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I associate myself and other 
Liberal Democrats with many of the hon. Gentleman's 
remarks. The reduction in pool betting duty is extremely 
welcome, particularly on Merseyside, which he 
mentioned. The pools companies have been important 
employers on Merseyside, which is an area of high 
unemployment and great deprivation. When the previous 
Government introduced the National Lottery Act 1998, 
many of their Back-Bench supporters, including the 
Member who represented Surbition at that time, denied 
that it would have an impact on the pools industry and 
lead to a reduction in employment. History has shown 
those claims to be bogus; pools companies have suffered 
severely because of the introduction of the national 
lottery.
<P>
The cut in pool duty has not come before time. Many 
people in pools companies are worried that it may come 
too late. That does not represent a complaint against the 
Government, who have taken action relatively speedily.
<P>
We discussed this subject when we considered last 
year's Finance Bill, when both sides of the Committee 
urged the Government to take quick action. I am glad 
that they responded by proposing a large cut. However, 
in relation to competition between the national lottery and 
the pools companies, the Government's proposal comes 
late in the day. I agree with the hon. Member for Maldon 
and East Chelmsford, who suggested that the Government 
should keep the matter under review and return to it if 
they find that pools companies' turnover and 
employment especially in relation to Merseyside do 
not pick up.
<P>
Unlike the hon. Gentleman, I did not receive Camelot's 
briefing perhaps my office has not yet passed it on to 
me but, like him, I am unconvinced by the figures that 
he read out. We need to consider the relative levels of tax 
duties on the relevant companies and the other 
competitive advantages that are involved. The national 
lottery gets hugh marketing and advertising advantages 
from its television airing. The relative levels of tax duty 
between the pools companies and the national lottery 
involves the right approach, but we need to go further in 
that regard.
<P>
Another argument for supporting pools companies, as 
the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford said, 
involves the funding that they give to the Football Trust 
and to the Foundation for Sport and the Arts, which help 
many small football clubs in this country. I hope that such 
funding will go to the local football club in my 
constituency, Kingstonian, which I hope will win the FA 
Trophy this Saturday at Wembley. The team's increasing 
prowess and success should make it a prime candidate for 
future funding from the Football Trust. That small local 
example shows the benefits of supporting the pools 
companies, which the Government acknowledge. I hope 
that they sustain their approach.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I start by wishing the very best to 
Kingstonian, which the hon. Member for Kingston and 
Surbition supports. I am happy to do so because it is not 
in contention with perhaps the finest team in the land, 
Tottenham Hotspur.
<P>
I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, and to the hon. 
Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford, for their 
speeches. It is right to spend some time discussing the 
pools industry's contribution and the importance of the 
number of people whom it employs, in some instances in 
areas that had previously suffered high unemployment 
rates.
<P>
The clause introduces a reduction of nine percentage 
points in the rate of pool betting duty. Pools companies 
have seen their turnover decline by about 70 per cent. 
since 1994. The hon. Member for Maldon and East 
Chelmsford rightly said that there had been two previous 
reductions in pool betting duty, both of five percentage 
points, in May and December 1995, which were made to 
assist the industry. This further cut is intended to help the 
pools companies invest in their future.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I have taken the opportunity to meet the industry. It is 
heartening to hear its plans for modernisation by investing 
in new technology. I am sure that all Committee members 
will closely watch its progress.
<P>
The purpose of the duty cut is to help to continue the 
funding for the Football Trust and the Foundation for 
Sport and the Arts, It is right to say that both organisations 
are highly valued by all hon. Members. The Football Trust 
has done a great deal of important work to implement the 
Taylor report. I know that that work is also closely 
followed.
<P>
We were able to agree with the pools promoters that 
they will continue to provide funding until at least March 
2001. After March 2001, any pools company that wants to 
withdraw from the agreement will give 12 months' notice, 
effectively guaranteeing payments until March 2002. I am 
pleased that our achievements have been greeted with 
approval on both sides of the Committee.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 6 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we move on to the next clause, 
I seek the understanding perhaps even the sympathy 
of Committee members because although they are able to 
sing the praises of their local football teams, I, as 
Chairman, am constrained by my duties and denied the 
opportunity to eulogise the two clubs of which I am 
president Billingham Synthonia and Billingham 
Strollers.
<H4><center>Clause 7</center></H4>
<H4><center>Rates of gaming duty</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the 
Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I rise briefly to express the Opposition's 
support for clause 7, which would not have existed 
without our activities during the proceedings of last year's 
Finance Bill. The industry is important. Of the more than 
100 casinos that operate in this country, about 20 are in 
London. The industry employs 12,000 people, of whom 
4,000 work in London. As my hon. Friend the Member 
for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon) explained during last year's 
Committee stage of the Finance Bill on the Floor of the 
House, the new higher rates of gaming duty introduced 
by that Bill were
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a dawn raid with a vengeance."	 [Official Report, 28 April 1998; 
Vol. 311, c. 222.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He urged the Government to give a commitment to index 
the bands of gross gaining yield on which the various 
rates had an impact. That was accepted by the Financial 
Secretary, who is now the Paymaster General, when she 
said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I am persuaded that there is a case for creating an environment 
that allows the industry and its investors a reasonable level of 
certainty in which to operate and plan. Therefore, I am prepared to 
give a commitment to index the gaming duty bands for the 
remainder of this Parliament."	 [Official Report, 28 April 1998; 
Vol. 311, c. 234.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is a pity that the hon. Lady was not able to accept my 
hon. Friend's amendment, which would have incorporated 
into statute the indexation of the bands as the now famous 
Rooker-Wise amendment incorporated into statute the 
indexation of personal allowances. As a tribute to my hon. 
Friend and the hon. Lady, the indexation of gaming duty 
could be called the Fallon-Primarolo commitment. Hon. 
Members will recall that the structure of the bands was 
changed and reduced from its original form as a result 
of representations by the industry and the Opposition, in 
particular my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and 
Southend, East (Sir T. Taylor).
<P>
We welcome the clause and support indexation of the 
bands. However, it is a pity that it is indexing the huge 
tax hikes in last year's Finance Bill another of the now 
infamous stealth taxes that the Government are imposing 
on this country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> The hon. Member for Bognor 
Regis and Littlehampton recalls the debate almost 
correctly. I was party to that debate and supported the 
hon. Member for Sevenoaks in extracting that welcome 
concession from the Government.
<P>
I would like to ask the Minister what the Government's 
policy is on gaming duties and their affect on the casino 
industry. The casino industry is especially important in 
London, which competes with other large cities around 
the world for an international clientele. The London 
casino industry has been hit in the last year or so as a 
result of the tax changes. Last year, when the then 
Financial Secretary discussed the Government's approach, 
it appeared that that approach was driven by 
considerations of revenue. She said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I shall continue to ensure that the forecast revenue yield on the 
measure is maintained."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
She seemed to suggest that the policy would be 
determined by a forecast of revenue. I must therefore ask 
the Minister how the performance of the revenue yields 
compares with the relevant forecasts. Will she publish 
those forecasts, so that we can check whether they were 
too high or too low, and determine what the implications 
are for future tax policy?
<P>
We should not view tax policy in isolation from the 
Government's other policy on the gaming and casino 
industry. Proposals are being considered by other 
Committees in the House for deregulation measures to 
enable casinos to obtain other revenues from their clients. 
For example, casinos might be permitted to have different 
types of fruit machines on the premises, which they are 
currently prevented from having. Will the Minister give 
us an idea of the progress on deregulation in the casino 
industry? It could be considered a quid pro quo if we 
allowed the Government to increase duties on the 
industry, while they were compensating it in other ways.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> At the beginning of this debate, I hoped 
that we would get an unambiguous statement from the 
hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, 
congratulating the Government, and I was going to say 
some terribly nice things about him. However, he was a 
little grudging, and I changed my mind. He them came up 
with a joke, which I thought was pretty good. The hon. 
Member for Kingston and Surbiton seemed to put in a 
plea for an amendment to the joke, so that it would not 
simply be the Fallon-Primarolo amendment, but the 
Fallon-Primarolo-Davey amendment. I do not know 
whether he would press that to a vote. Perhaps, having 
made his point, he will not.
<P>
When the House considered last year's Finance Bill in 
Committee, my predecessor now the Paymaster 
General promised to revalorise the duty bands for 
gaming duty during the life of this Parliament. As the hon. 
Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton pointed out, 
that will be achieved by this year's measure and I am 
glad that it has received the support of both sides of the 
Committee. Indexation of the bands means that casino 
operators will pay approximately £1 million less this year 
than would otherwise have been the case. The measure 
will therefore provide a fair and stable tax regime for the 
industry, giving it some security to plan for the future, 
amid the many changing factors that can affect its 
performance. I say to the hon. Member for Kingston and 
Surbiton that it is not only taxation that affects the 
industry in London, but other factors, such as the 
difficulties experienced in some of the far eastern 
economies.
<P>
Much has been said about last year's Finance Bill 
Committee, on which I did not, unfortunately, have the 
pleasure to serve. As you will know, Mr. Cook, we 
amended the duty band structure in the previous Finance 
Bill to help London casinos in the middle turnover range. 
It was a shame that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis 
and Littlehampton did not mention that. The concession 
was worth £6 million a figure that I did not hear from 
the hon. Gentleman to casinos in London. The three per 
cent. reduction in corporation tax since we came to power 
will also reduce casinos' tax liabilities this year by £{**fr3,4**} 
million. Positive cash flow effects will also result from 
the abolition of advance corporation tax and the 
introduction of quarterly instalment payments for large 
companies.
<P>
I can tell the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton 
that the Government keep rates of gaming duty and all 
other duties under constant review, although we consider 
the present level of taxation to be fair and appropriate.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 7 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 8</center></H4>
<H4><center>The general rate of vehicle excise duty</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn (Guildford):</B> I beg to move 
amendment No. 46, in page 3, line 25, after `having', 
insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`an engine powered by road fuel gas or'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to 
consider amendment No. 47, in page 3, line 31, after 
`£100."	,' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and in the case of a vehicle having an engine of any capacity 
powered by road fuel gas, the general rate is £20'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I begin by lamenting the 
Government's failure to comply with even the simplest of 
their general election pledges. They promised that a Green 
Book as well as a Red Book would be produced for every 
Budget. This year, there is not even a green chapter. There 
are only five pages of text on green issues in a volume of 
189 pages 
<P>
<B>Mrs. Helen Brinton </B>(Peterborough): Will the hon. 
Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Let me make this point first. There 
are only five pages dealing with important environmental 
issues, and those are what the amendment addresses.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Brinton:</B> I am grateful that the hon. gentleman is 
raising important environmental issues, such as road fuel 
gas. As he will be aware, the Government cut duty on 
road fuel gas by 29 per cent. in the previous Budget, and 
I hope that there is a long-term commitment to supporting 
that environmentally friendly fuel. I am sure that the 
Treasury team is committed to that. It is a pleasure to find 
that the hon. Gentleman is so supportive of the Labour 
Government on this matter. Most of his colleagues are 
spending their time whingeing about the fuel escalator.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interventions must be brief. It 
appears that the hon. Lady is reading from a prepared text, 
which she may be able to present at a later stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> It is always a great pleasure to listen 
to the hon. Lady. I hope that her false start will not 
discourage her from making a full contribution to debate 
on this and other clauses. She almost took the words out 
of my mouth. We dealt with clause 2 on the Floor of the 
House, where it was well established that there had been 
a cut in duty. Committee members should be reminded 
why that cut in duty occurred. The smidgen about the 
environment in the Red Book a paltry token, given the 
commitment to a Green Book includes the two lines on 
page 78, which state that the Government's policy is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"encouraging the use of road fuel gases, which produce much lower 
emissions, especially of particulates, than conventional fuels".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am hopeful about the Government's reception of the 
amendment. They clearly agree with Opposition Members 
that more action is required. Although the industry made 
strong representations to the Government, to which the 
Government clearly listened, as they reduced the duty, 
further action is necessary.


<P>
The British Oxygen Company, which is based in my 
constituency, played a leading role in developing liquid 
petroleum gas, the most widely know form of road fuel 
gas and the sort that is most likely to be commercially 
viable in future. Also in my constituency is the Dennis 
bus company, which has expressed an interest in using 
road gas fuel engines in its vehicles. I therefore have a 
constituency interest in seeing the Government take this 
further.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
Since the industry made its representations, naturally 
some months before the Budget was presented, there has 
been a notable change in the situation because the 
company that was developing LPG engines, Perkins 
Engines, has been taken over by Caterpillar. As a result, 
the research and development work, which is an important 
part of the programme, has been halted. I hope that it has 
been halted only temporarily while the new owners of 
Perkins Engines investigate the validity of its research and 
development expenditure, but, because of that, it is very 
important that the Government should give a clear signal 
of their commitment to the use of that sort of road fuel. 
If they do not, there is a real risk that the whole project 
might flounder for a considerable time without 
expenditure on research and development, and Caterpillar 
may decide that the game is not worth the candle.
<P>
I welcome the reduction in duty on road fuel gas, 
which, I believe, is worth 6p a litre. That means that fuel 
savings on a typical car, driven 15,000 miles a year, will 
be about £100 a year. However, that must be seen in the 
context of the cost of having an LPG tank in one's 
vehicle. I am advised by BOC that the additional capital 
cost of having a car that runs on that sort of fuel is £2,000. 
To spend an extra £2,000 in order to save £100 a year is 
not a financial proposition that even the Economic 
Secretary would consider to be a good deal. If she does, 
perhaps she is in the wrong job. We propose that there 
should be an additional saving of £135 a year for such 
vehicles by reducing the general rate from £155 to £20.
<P>
I know that the Government are always, rightly, 
concerned about the cost of our proposals, and I would 
not pretend for one moment that cutting the rate of duty 
will increase the amount of revenue. There is a real cost 
to cutting this tax. This is the exception to the rule that I 
expounded at our first sitting last week. However, the cost 
is tiny. We know from an answer to my hon. Friend the 
Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford from the 
Department of the Environment, Transport and the 
Regions that the cost of reducing the duty from £155 to 
£20 would be just £1 million a year. That is a measure of 
how few such vehicles there are on the roads.
<P>
I now come to the heart of the case for taking this 
measure. For road fuel gas to become commercially 
viable, there needs to be a critical mass of cars using the 
road fuel gas. That is necessary to justify investment in 
the infrastructure, both for the companies producing the 
fuel and for the manufacturers producing the tanks, 
because the capital cost would fall if production levels 
were higher and, most importantly, the number of outlets 
would rise. At the moment, there are hardly any outlets 
for road fuel gas, and the industry says that that is the 
single most important restraining factor on growth in the 
use of that fuel and in the number of vehicles that use it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Geraint Davies (Croydon, Central):</B> Is the hon. 
Gentleman aware that Government grants are available 
for converting lorries to take LPG? Why is the 
amendment not drafted in terms of subsidies for capital 
conversion? The essence of his argument revolves around 
capital conversion rather than running costs, which would 
mean an increasing burden on the Exchequer as the 
market sector takes off.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am delighted with the help that I 
am receiving from Labour Members. I hope that the hon. 
Gentleman will not be deterred from making his own 
contribution to our debates but know from previous 
experience that, sadly, he is often far from deterred.
<P>
I have a business in the west country, and last week 
we considered buying a new vehicle. We investigated the 
possibility of a vehicle powered by road fuel gas, but the 
grant provided by the Government is almost entirely 
offset by the fees that they charge for checking that the 
vehicle is roadworthy when the conversion has taken 
place. The grant is welcome, but it is not very helpful. 
After the grant and the cost of testing, £2,000 represents 
the net capital cost to those who want one of those 
vehicles. The economics do not stack up.
<P>
On the merits of the case, it must be conceded that 
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> No. I must make some progress 
[Interruption.] I know that the hon. Gentleman is keen to 
make a contribution and I am grateful for his support for 
my amendment. I hope that I can persuade him that it 
represents the right way to go, but perhaps he will allow 
me to make the case. We can then hear his alternative 
proposals, although I fear that they will cost even more 
than mine, and that his Front Bench will watch them 
carefully.
<P>
We must consider the intrinsic merits of the case for 
road fuel gas. The Kyoto targets are not relevant because 
road fuel gas does not involve a reduction in CO{**ep2 
emissions; indeed, it may involve an increase in some 
emissions. Only 20 per cent. of all CO<ep2 emissions come  from the transport sector, so 80 per cent. come from other  sectors. Real dedication to reducing those emissions will  be shown when the Government encourage the growth of  gas-fired power stations rather than entrenching coal-fired  power stations, with their CO<ep2 emissions. We must decide  what target we want to reach. The way to reduce CO<ep2  emissions is to tackle emissions in the power generation  sector above all. The way to reduce particulate emissions  and the emission of nitrous oxide is to encourage  alternative fuels such as road fuel gas. <p4**}It is part of the Government's agenda to encourage  ultra-low sulphur diesel, but that also has drawbacks, and  road fuel gas should be favoured. I should like Treasury  Ministers to make a statement on the Government's  preference between the various options for reducing  emissions for example, ultra-low sulphur diesel and road  fuel gas. I look forward to the Minister's expertise being  put to the test. <P>
Road gas fuel would provide some incidental benefits: 
engines that use road gas fuel are much quieter, and 
because of the lower level of particulates, that fuel is more 
acceptable in built-up environments. One of the 
arguments of the proponents of road fuel gas is that it is 
so much more friendly to city environments that transport 
that uses it might augur a complete rethink of traffic 
patterns in cities such as London. Some delivery vehicles 
might be encouraged to travel at times of the night when 
they are currently prohibited. If the road use patterns 
changed, we might avoid having to make too many 
changes to road infrastructure. As Committee members 
know, the most serious road congestion occurs at peak 
periods. We should encourage the use of new vehicles, 
especially at times when the roads would not otherwise 
be used. Adopting that imaginative and powerful strategy 
might have tremendous on-going benefits for our society.
<P>
I notice that my right hon. and hon. Friends, and some 
Labour Members, want to speak, so I should conclude my 
remarks. In establishing a valid environmental strategy, 
we must take account of the Kyoto targets and national 
targets. Relevant targets are also buried somewhere in the 
Red Book. The Government said that road fuel gas would 
help in that regard. I hope that they will make clear their 
support for the programme, which may cost only
£1 million. The programme may be about to suffer a 
setback at this critical moment, which might affect, for 
example, the constituents of the hon. Member for 
Peterborough (Mrs. Brinton). The Government should 
give the proposal the time that it needs to prove itself and 
to get a critical mass behind the use of road fuel gas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I congratulate my hon. Friend the 
Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) on the 
amendment. Unlike some subjects that we have discussed 
previously, and others to which we shall presently come 
this is not a party political issue. Committee members are 
unanimous about the desirability of promoting the use of 
LPG, which is a more environmentally benign fuel than 
those that are currently used.
<P>
My hon. Friend made it clear that he embraced the 
Government's policy. We congratulate the Government 
on the steps that they have already taken to encourage the 
use of LPG, but they should acknowledge that they have 
not yet delivered their objective of encouraging greater 
market penetration and greater use of LPG. My hon. 
Friend said that the revenue cost of the proposal was 
estimated at less than £1 million, which underlines the 
fact that the Government's objective has not yet been 
delivered.
<P>
The amendment proposes a way in which that objective 
could be delivered more effectively. My hon. Friend's 
suggestion that we should embrace the Government's 
objective is reasonable, and his suggestion that we should 
embrace the methods in the Bill is ultra-reasonable.
<P>
The Chancellor said that there should be two classes of 
vehicle for the purposes of vehicle excise duty, and that 
conventionally powered vehicles of less than 1100 cc 
should be regarded as being more environmentally 
benign. However, my hon. Friend rightly pointed out that 
if that meant that a 25-year-old Fiat 850 an old banger 
was regarded as being environmentally benign, we should 
also include in that class vehicles that are designed to 
use LPG, which the Government acknowledge is a more 
environmentally friendly fuel.
<P>
I am sure that the Economic Secretary has in front of 
her a piece of paper about the amendment saying "resist"	. 
I expect I speak with some experience that that piece 
of paper will develop a line of argument to the effect "The 
Chancellor cannot possibly afford to shell out an extra
£1 million to deliver this policy objective."	
<P>
The amendment provides the Economic Secretary with 
an opportunity to demonstrate her capacity for 
independent thought, although she need not say, "I shall 
overrule my officials and ignore their instruction to 
resist."	 She should simply tell the Committee that the 
Government will reflect on that line of argument and 
return to it on Report. We are not asking the Government 
to change their stated public objectives, which we recently 
restated in the Red Book; we are asking them to consider 
whether they are being met. The evidence put before the 
Economic Secretary will make it clear that they have yet 
to be met.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Bill contains proposals for the creation of a class 
of vehicle that will benefit from a concessionary rate of 
VED. Is not this a good opportunity for Ministers to 
consider ways in which that class might be enlarged to 
include vehicles that the Government agree are more 
deserving of a concessionary tax rate than the 25-year-old 
Fiat 850, which the Chancellor apparently believes to be 
a great environmental saviour?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> We will address in due course 
whether 1100 cc is the right threshold at which the rate 
of duty for cars should be reduced. I congratulate my hon. 
Friend the Member for Guildford on moving the 
amendment, which would encourage the use of LPG 
vehicles. I know of no environmentalist who would 
disagree with the view that  with the possible exception 
of nuclear fuel and moving to zero emissions of 
electricity LPG is much more environmentally friendly 
than any other form of fuel. Indeed, the Government have 
recognised as much, because most of their own cars and 
dispatch agency vehicles now run on LPG.
<P>
The industry is looking for a commitment from the 
Economic Secretary to maintain a medium and long-term 
strategy for encouraging LPG vehicles. [Interruption.] If 
she were to listen, the debate might progress a little 
further. [Interruption.] I am now given to understand that 
it is the Financial Secretary who will respond to the 
debate. However, I stand by the observation that, were the 
Economic Secretary to listen, the debate might progress 
even further.
<P>
There are 400,000 LPG road vehicles in Holland,
1 million in Italy, 350,00 in the USA and 330,000 in 
Australia. In France, buses, taxis and company cars 
fuelled by LPG are granted tax exemptions. It has been 
estimated that by the end of 1998 there would be 150,000 
LPG vehicles in France, but only 7,780 in this country. If 
we seriously intend to help the environment, the 
Government must do much more to encourage the use of 
LPG vehicles.
<P>
Marketline International, a polling company, estimates 
that the market for LPG vehicles in this country could rise 
to half a million by 2003, so there is huge potential for 
increased use. My hon. Friend the Member for Guildford 
mentioned the costs associated with conversion, but he 
did not mention those associated with the infrastructure. 
Unless the Government establish a medium and long-term 
framework, there will be no incentive to provide the 
infrastructure, the filling stations and the associated 
capital costs.
<P>
Although the cut of 29p a litre is welcome, the 
amendment is sensible and I call on the Government to 
give the industry, which is listening carefully to our 
debate, some assurance that they are seriously committed 
to encouraging greater take-up of LPG vehicles over the 
medium term. There is no doubt that, in respect of almost 
every type of harmful emission from both petrol and 
diesel engines, LPG vehicles are more environmentally 
friendly. As my hon. Friend said, the engines are 
quieter, too.
<P>
We know from the Office for National Statistics that 
some of our cities will have great difficulty in meeting 
sustainability targets for some emissions. For example, 
Belfast and Liverpool will have a problem with sulphur 
dioxide. The emission factor for petrol engines is 130, 
compared with 24 for LPG vehicles. London wil have a 
problem with benzene and the oxides and nitrogens. 
Benzene is one of the most dangerous emissions because 
it is carcinogenic. The emission factor for LPG is 1.1, 
compared with 14 for petrol.
<P>
There is a huge amount of environmental gain to be 
had from switching to LPG. Furthermore, that would help 
us to meet our international commitment on carbon 
dioxide emissions, which we made recently at Kyoto. The 
emission factor for petrol is 3, and for diesel it is 0.75; 
LPG is somewhere between petrol and diesel. In every 
sense there is a lot to be gained form introducing LPG 
vehicles, and I hope that the Government will embark on 
a programme not only to provide grants to industry for 
converting vehicles, but to ensure that inspection tests 
involve a minimum of bureaucracy and cost, that research 
is carried out to enable more engines to be introduced in 
this country and elsewhere, and that encouragement is 
given to setting up the infrastructure for LPG vehicles. 
If the Government do that, they will do much to help 
our environment.

Member for Guildford providing the opportunity to say a 
little more about LPG. When we debated clause 2 on the 
Floor of the House, I made it clear that the Opposition 
welcomed the cut in the duty on IPG and natural gas for 
vehicles. I can tell the hon. Member for Peterborough that 
the process was started under the previous Government. 
We began by reducing duty to encourage the take-up of 
LPG, and I am pleased that the present Government have 
decided to continue that process.
<P>
I should declare a small interest because a few weeks 
ago I was given the opportunity of driving a Morgan 
fuelled by LPG round New Palace yard, which I believe 
was arranged by Calor Gas Ltd. Some people have 
doubted whether LPG provides the same performance as 
normal petrol-driven cars, and although I was unable to 
put the Morgan fully through its paces while going round 
New Palace yard I had a close shave with my hon. 
Friend the Member for Bexhill and Battle (Mr. Wardle) 
it was impressive, and I am certainly a convert.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Guildford referred to 
one of the main problems the difficulty of refuelling 
with LPG. When discussing clause 2, I said that British 
Gas had closed eight fuel outlet points, including one in 
my constituency, and I shall take the opportunity to refer 
to that again.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold said that 
although the reduction in duty is welcome, it is important 
to encourage further take-up and to provide the industry 
with some certainty about the medium-term prospects. On 
clause 2 we asked the Minister whether the Government 
would undertake to maintain the reduction in duty on LPG 
in future Budgets, but we spent most of the time debating 
other issues and she was unable to deal with that point. It 
would be welcome if she would now say a little about the 
Government's future intentions with regard to 
encouraging take-up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> It is amazing that the Opposition, 
having abandoned their commitment to the escalator on 
petrol, suddenly put on green clothes and now say that 
they would spend more and more money on greater 
subsidies for LPG.
<P>
Like the hon. Member for Maldon and East 
Chelmsford, I have driven a Morgan and I have a 
photograph of it; it may be the very same Morgan. The 
number of people driving such cars has doubled year on 
year but, as the hon. Member for Cotswold said, the 
number of LPG cars in Britain is remarkably low. It is 
clear from the recent Budget and previous Budgets, and 
from general announcements, that the Government are 
moving forward, particularly given our ambitious Kyoto 
targets. Anyone in industry who looks at market 
development in Britain and Europe would be wise to 
invest now in a green future, which includes LPG. I have 
no doubt that the big oil companies will move forward 
with LPG.
<P>
There is a question mark over the amendment, given 
the Opposition's desire to give away money by abolishing 
the escalator. They want to pump more and more money 
into achieving objectives that the market is beginning to 
deliver. We have sent signals to the market and continue 
to give incentives to consumers. I welcome the 29p 
incentive in the Budget.
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaun Woodward (Witney):</B> I wonder whether 
the hon. Gentleman can make sense of what seems to be 
a contradiction in the Bill. The Government say that they 
will cut vehicle excise duty for cars with a small engine 
capacity, yet the hon. Gentleman resists my hon. Friend's 
amendment. Will he explain that apparently incoherent 
position?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I tried to explain the difference in a 
previous intervention. There is a difference between 
running costs and capital costs, and the overheads of the 
capital costs include VED. In the past the Government 
have provided subsidies for conversion, and now we are 
introducing a running-cost deduction. There are always 
debates on whether VED should be reduced. The 
Government have already been asked to consider that. The 
Government continue to monitor, develop and evolve 
their green policy on fuel and cars. Presumably they will 
continue to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The hon. Gentleman might want to make 
it clear to the Committee that he prefers to encourage the 
introduction of LPG cars with grant assistance rather than 
with tax reductions. That is not the line taken by his hon. 
Friends on the Front Bench.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> No. I prefer a rationally mixed portfolio 
of capital and running-cost incentives, depending on how 
the market develops and with a view to the future needs 
of the Exchequer. Those instruments must be balanced, 
not set down simplistically in black and white.
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury </b>(Ms Patricia Hewitt): I, too, should declare that I had the 
pleasure not of driving, but at least of sitting in a 
gas-powered motor car that had been equipped by DG 
Technology in my neighbouring constituency of 
Loughborough. It was an excellent car. I should also 
declare that my Government car, and those of several of 
my right hon. and hon. friends, will be converted to LPG 
later this year.
<P>
The hon. Member for Guildford made an interesting 
and occasionally entertaining speech. He began, perhaps 
less than graciously, by criticising the environmental 
information made available in this year's Red Book. I 
draw the Committee's attention to the fact that in this 
year's Red Book we have given far more information on 
environmental measures and the environmental impact of 
Budget measures than has ever been given by the present 
or previous Governments, whether in the Red Book or the 
"Pre-Budget Report"	. We said last year that we wanted to 
build on the environmental information given in the 
Budget and the "Pre-Budget Report"	.
<P>
We have done that, which was consistent with the fact 
that this year's Budget contained the most far-reaching 
and radical programme of environmental tax reforms that 
we have ever seen. The package of measures and the 
information that we gave in the environmental assessment 
in the Red Book have been welcomed by the Select 
Committee and by environmental groups. We are happy 
to consider constructive suggestions about how we can 
build on that information. If the hon. gentleman wishes
to contribute to that, I will consider his suggestions 
carefully.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman raised the important issue of the 
Government's attitude to different fuels, and what our 
objectives should be in promoting the use of different 
fuels to achieve the environmental objectives that I think 
we all share. We have to balance our climate change 
objectives and the need to reduce the COstanding1{**ep2 
emissions produced by sectors of the economy, including 
the road transport sector, against the need to reduce 
particulates and the other emissions that are so damaging 
to local air quality, which we must do to meet our national 
air quality targets. We balance those two objectives and 
keep the situation under close review.
<p4**}However, as the hon. Member for Cotswold said,  although diesel delivers lower CO{**ep2 emissions for each  kilometre driven, ordinary diesel delivers higher  particulates, which worsen local air quality. That is one  reason why we introduced the differential for ultra-low  sulphur diesel, which has been enormously successful. In  comparison with ordinary diesel, ULSD substantially cuts  the emission of particulates and other forms of local air  pollutants. That differential, like the differential  introduced by the previous Government for unleaded  petrol, has been so successful that nearly 100 per cent. of  the diesel market will soon be taken by ULSD. <p4**}The general attitude is not to say that road fuel gases,  whether they are LPG or compressed natural gas, are  always to be preferred to other forms of road fuel, but to  look at the different balance of fuels that will best achieve  the objectives of the Kyoto targets, the CO{**ep2 emission  target and the local air quality target. <p4**}The hon. Member for Guildford and others made an  important point about the infrastructure needed to ensure  that drivers who convert to gas-powered vehicles can  obtain the gas for their cars. Several hon. Members  suggested that the proposed cut in VED was necessary to  get the market to respond and roll out the infrastructure.  That argument does not stand up. <P>
Shell UK and BP recently made the welcome 
announcement that they would implement major 
investment programmes to ensure that there is a network 
of LPG sites on forecourts throughout the United 
Kingdom. In particular, Shell UK announced a £10 
million investment programme designed to make auto 
LPG available to 80 per cent. of motorists by 2001. Its 
key aims are to have 300 of its forecourts dispensing LPG 
within the next five years, and 75 sites on line by the 
millennium. That investment in infrastructure is 
happening without the proposed VED cut.
<P>
<B>Mr. Roger Casale (Wimbledon):</B> Unlike the hon. 
Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford, I have not 
found time in my busy schedule to drive around the House 
of Commons in a Morgan powered by LPG. However,
I recently drove round my constituency in an LPG car 
owned and run by Merton council. Will my hon. Friend 
confirm that local authorities have an important role to 
play in promoting the use of more environmentally 
friendly cars? Perhaps Opposition Members can 
encourage some of the new Conservative authorities to do 
the same.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that 
intervention. He is right there is already a significant 
programme of investment and conversion to gas-fuel 
powered cars by local authorities, bus operators and other 
large fleet operators. That is welcome, and my hon. Friend 
is right to suggest that Opposition members who support 
our objective of encouraging the use of cleaner fuels 
should ensure that their own local authorities are taking 
appropriate measures.
<P>
The Government share the objective of encouraging the 
use of cleaner fuels, and we are taking steps to ensure that 
that take-up happens. It is because of those steps that the 
private sector investments to which I referred are already 
being made.

<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Will the Economic Secretary tell us 
how many years it would take someone who has spent 
£2,000 converting his car to recoup that added investment 
through the lower rate of duty proposed in the Bill, 
without the benefit of the additional cut in vehicle excise 
duty that we are proposing, assuming that he drove an 
average number of miles per year in a typical car?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to 
the fact that any large vehicle that is gas-fuel operated 
would almost certainly qualify for a reduced pollution 
certificate. It would then be entitled, under our proposal 
to a reduction in vehicle excise duty of £1,000 a year a 
reduction that has been doubled in this Budget.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Perhaps my question was not clear. 
I was referring to ordinary cars, which are subject to the 
general rate of duty. That is what this clause and the 
amendment deal with, not heavy-duty vehicles.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for 
giving me a second opportunity to answer the question. 
I observe I think that my arithmetic is correct that the 
vehicle excise duty reduction of £100 proposed in his 
amendment would mean that it would take about 20 years 
to recoup the £2,000 invested in the conversion.
<P>
The point that I was making in response to both the 
hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members was that the 
absence of an infrastructure has been the major factor in 
holding back demand for gas-fuel powered vehicles. That 
infrastructure problem will be solved as the investments 
being made by Shell and BP roll out. Those companies 
rightly anticipate a substantial growth in this market, 
regardless of the amendment proposed by the hon. 
Member for Guildford.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Cawsey </B>(Brigg and Goole): I have no personal 
experience of LPG, but my neighbour converted his car 
just before the Budget. He informed me that he expects 
to recoup the conversion cost over two or three years, and 
that time will now be halved as a result of the 
Chancellor's Budget statement.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> My hon. Friend makes a telling point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that 
it would be naive to do a simple calculation involving the 
sums of £100 and £2,000 and a period of 20 years? One 
must also consider the relative cost of running a 
petrol-driven car, the impact of the escalator and the 
changes per mile in terms of fuel costs. In those wider 
terms, it is clear that rational consumers will move into 
this market much faster than the somewhat naive analysis 
of the hon. Member for Guildford would suggest.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> My hon. Friend is right. The investments 
that BP and Shell are making illustrate that this market 
is growing in response to the measures already taken by 
the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I will give way one more time.



<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> This is an important point because we 
have given the Economic Secretary the chance to get help 
from her hon. Friends to answer a fundamental question, 
to which the Government really should know the answer. 
Will she confirm that she does not know how long it 
would take a typical car driver to recover the cost of 
investing in an LPG fuel tank as a result of the modest 
savings put forward by the Government? She simply does 
not know the answer.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I have already answered the hon. 
Gentleman's question twice. The Government are taking 
effective measures to encourage the use of road fuel gases. 
In the Budget, we cut duty on those gases by 29 per cent. 
compared with the real increase in both petrol and diesel 
duty. That duty differential is now one of the largest in 
Europe, the duty being only a fifth of the duty on diesel.
<P>
Having welcomed the cut in gas duty, the hon. 
Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford asked 
whether the Government were committed to maintaining 
the differential. Let me repeat the assurance given by 
my right hon. Friend the Chancellor: we will maintain 
the differential between duty on road fuel gases and 
that on diesel, at least for the lifetime of this Parliament. 
That commitment gives both drivers and the industry 
the stability that they need to encourage them to make 
the necessary investments.
<P>
I also draw to the Committee's attention the existence 
of the DETR-funded Powershift programme, which, as the 
right hon. Member for Charnwood mentioned, makes 
grants available to help cover the additional purchasing 
costs of gas-powered vehicles, and indeed electric 
vehicles, in order further to stimulate the market for 
alternative-fuelled vehicles. I believe that that programme 
is successful, especially in helping larger operators to 
meet the cost of conversion or purchase of such vehicles.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Charnwood, who is only 
too familiar with official briefings for Finance Bills, 
suggested that I had been briefed to resist the amendment 
on the ground of cost. Of course, the costs would be very 
small, for the simple reason that the take-off in the market 
has not yet occurred. But that is not why I am resisting 
the amendment. The amendment is unnecessary to secure 
the investment in infrastructure that is the essential 
precondition for a take-off in gas-powered cars. That 
investment is already taking place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Can the Economic Secretary answer one 
simple question? Are the Government satisfied with the 
pace of advance of the use of LPG and other road fuel 
gases?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> We want the take-up of gas-powered 
vehicles to happen as fast as it possibly can, but as I have 
argued, and as other Committee members have argued, 
the biggest barrier to take-up is the lack of refuelling 
infrastructure. If one cannot fill one's car with gas, one is 
unlikely to purchase a gas-powered car or to convert one's 
present car. Those investment decisions have now been 
made. Conversion of forecourt pumps is now under way 
and will come on stream rapidly. I am pleased with that 
progress and hope that it will be welcomed by the 
Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Will the Economic Secretary say what 
percentage of Shell's annual spend on forecourt 
investment is its £10 million forecourt conversion 
programme?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I do not know. Shell estimates 
[Interruption.] I am not responsible for Shell's 
investment programme. I hope that the hon. Gentleman 
shares my interest in the fact that the investment of 
£10 million could deliver LPG to 80 per cent. of 
motorists by 2001, which is an extensive and rapid 
approach. I believe, and Shell clearly believes, that that 
would have a significant effect on the use of 
LPG-powered vehicles.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Surely the clause is meant to 
encourage behavioural change in our purchasing decisions 
about smaller cars. Do not the Government want to bring 
about a causal, behavioural change in the purchase of LPG 
vehicles? If so, what is the Economic Secretary's estimate 
of the cost of the amendment and of the clause?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The hon. Member for Guildford rightly 
said that, given the current level of use of gas-powered 
vehicles, the amendment would cost £1 million a year. 
That figure is very low, but it reflects the fact that there 
is a small take-up of such vehicles. My point I have 
made it several times, but I am not sure that the hon. 
Member for Cotswold was listening is that the real 
barrier that prevents ordinary drivers from purchasing or 
converting to a gas-powered car is the fact that the 
infrastructure is not available to allow them to refuel the 
car easily, although the necessary investment is under 
way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I understand that the Economic Secretary is 
not responsible for Shell's investment programme, but she 
is responsible for the clause. I sympathise with her for not 
knowing the answer to the question of my hon. Friend the 
Member for Guildford, who asked how long it would take 
the owner of a converted car to recoup his £2,000 capital 
investment from the reductions in the duty on LPG. 
However, she is responsible for matters relating to vehicle 
excise duty, and she should be able to tell us whether the 
Government have assessed the figures.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> We have examined the combination of 
incentives that will encourage the purchase of, or 
conversion to, cleaner vehicles and a greater reliance on 
cleaner fuel. The clause is part of that overall strategy, as 
are the various proposals to which I have referred.
<P>
We have other reasons for resisting the amendment. 
First 
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Should I take it from that response that the 
Economic Secretary does not know whether the 
Government have assessed the figures? I appreciate that 
she may not know the results of that assessment 
complicated calculations are involved but is not it rather 
odd for her not to know whether the Treasury has carried 
out an assessment in an area for which she is responsible?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> If there is further information that I can 
supply to the hon. Gentleman in this regard, I shall do so. 
We have cut the duty on the relevant gases by 29 per 
cent., and we have ensured that this country will have the 
biggest differentials in the European Union. We, and the 
market, are confident that that will assist in the take-up of 
gas-powered cars.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Will the Economic Secretary 
give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> No. I have given way on several occasions, 
and I want to make progress.
<P>
The first reason why Committee members should resist 
the amendment is that it is not necessary to generate such 
investment in the infrastructure, and the second reason is 
that, although gas-powered vehicles produce fewer local 
air pollutants, they damage the roads and produce CO2 
emissions. They should therefore bear the cost of VED in 
the same way as other vehicles.
<P>
I have already referred to the Powershift programme, 
as well as to the substantial cut, which was doubled in 
this Budget, for the larger vehicles that operate on cleaner 
fuels. That will be kept under review as we monitor the 
impact of the 29 per cent. differential in fuel duties that 
we introduced to assist in the take-up of gas fuel-powered 
cars. I will also continue to monitor the impact of the 
private sector investment programme to which I referred.
<P>
I therefore hope that the hon. Member for Guildford 
will feel able to withdraw the amendment. If he presses 
the amendment to a vote, I shall ask my hon. Friends to 
oppose it.

<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I welcome the Government's 
important concession that they will maintain the 
differential between this type of fuel and others 
throughout this Parliament. I would not want the 
Economic Secretary to think me ungracious, so I shall 
withdraw my amendment, which has served its purpose 
by revealing the ignorance and indifference of Labour 
Members.
<P>
I have every sympathy with the hon. Member for 
Peterborough, in whose constituency Perkins Engines is 
based. It is a fine firm, which I visited some years ago. 
Its research and development facilities are outstanding. 
Many people in her constituency will be sorry to see that 
she has been busy with other affairs while the future of 
an important research project involving LPG in which 
BOC, in my constituency, is also involved is at stake 
following the takeover of the company.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Brinton:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> In a moment. That important research 
and development programme is in jeopardy and the 
Government's attitude will have an important bearing on 
whether Caterpillar, the new owners of the company in 
her constituency, proceed with that project.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Brinton:</B> I need take no lectures from the hon. 
Gentleman about Perkins in my constituency, nor about 
anything else in my constituency. My commitment to 
LPG and my knowledge of the matter have been made 
public today.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Clearly, the hon. Lady feels that she 
knows so much about the subject that she does not have 
to listen to the debate. That puts her on a par with the 
hon. Member for Brigg and Goole (Mr. Cawsey), who 
thinks that he can rely on his neighbour's information as 
a guide to Government policy. I do not know how many 
hundreds of thousands of miles his neighbour drives in a 
year and a half, but he is clearly not an environmentally 
friendly person.
<P>
As a result of those hon. Members' interventions, we 
discovered that the Government do not have a clue about 
how much the reduction in fuel duty for road fuel gas will 
assist those who have to pay the conversion cost of 
£2,000, as they have not done the necessary research. 
That shows a shocking degree of ignorance and a cavalier 
attitude. The Government are prepared to give away 
money without knowing what effect it will have.
<P>
It is not sufficient for the Economic Secretary to tell us 
that BP will adjust the fuel provision on 300 of its 
forecourts, or that Shell will spend £10 million doing the 
same. The statistic that 80 per cent. of cars would then be 
able to reach such stations is fairly meaningless the 
typical car has a range of 200 or 300 miles in its fuel tank. 
The idea that, by plotting their routes around the country 
strategically to reach each BP and Shell fuel station, 
people will just manage to get their cars there before they 
run out of fuel, shows the Government's lack of 
understanding. There are thousands of forecourts around 
the country. Although I welcome the investment in 
infrastructure by Shell and BP, it is a fraction of what is 
needed if the issue is to be seriously addressed.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Brinton:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I will give way if the hon. Lady's 
intervention is more productive and constructive than her 
previous comment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Brinton:</B> I am happy to tell the hon. Gentleman 
that my intervention will be more informed than his 
contribution. Is he aware that both Calor and Shell said 
that this Government have done more for LPG in one 
stroke in this Budget than any other Government in 
history? They agreed that we have given LPG the biggest 
and most productive boost ever. What does he have to say 
about that?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> LPG has not been around throughout 
history. As we approach the millennium, other measures 
will have a greater impact.
<P>
Had the hon. Member for Peterborough listened to the 
debate, she would have heard me welcome the reduction 
in duty, which has pleased a firm in my constituency. 
However, she ignores what is happening on her own 
doorstep. One of the prime movers in the project has 
decided, despite the fact that the Chancellor announced a 
reduction in fuel duty in the Budget, to spend no more on 
research and development while it reviews whether the 
project is worth while. The debate has moved on. 
Although the change in duty is welcome, the research and 
development programme in the hon. Lady's constituency 
has been frozen. She should be aware that no matter how 
many plaudits the Government have won, representations 
were made to them months before the Budget. Events 
have moved on and they are not responding to them today.
<P>
We estimated that the typical investor in an LPG fuel 
tank would save £100 a year from the Government's 
reduction in duty. We proposed an additional saving of 
£135 by reducing the duty from £155 to £20. The 
Government's proposal on LPG is a sop, because 
according to their own figures, it will take 20 years of car 
use to recoup the cost of investing in an LPG fuel tank. 
We are being more realistic.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give 
way?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I will not.
<P>
I welcome the fact that the Economic Secretary has 
promised to keep the issue under review. I hope that she 
will go away and do her homework properly because she 
had not done so this morning. I also hope, given what is 
said in the Red Book and this commitment, that real 
progress will be made before the research and 
development programme that is in the constituency of the 
hon. Member for Peterborough is knocked on the head 
because of lack of action by her Government and the 
indifference that she, as its Member of Parliament, has 
shown this morning.
