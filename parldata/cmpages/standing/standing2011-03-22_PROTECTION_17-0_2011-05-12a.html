                           </span> On a point of order, Mr Caton. May
I ask whether you or, indeed, the Minister have any comment to make on
this issue? You will not know this, but we received an e-mailed letter
from the Minister on Monday; mine came at 7.35 in the evening, and I
believe that is when other Members received theirs. It informed members
of the Committee that the Government would submit a wide range of
amendments on vetting and barring and criminal records, effectively
merging the Independent Safeguarding Authority and the Criminal Records
Bureau. To be honest, the Opposition would not necessarily disagree
with that, but we discussed vetting and barring, the ISA and criminal
records at our sitting on Tuesday, yet on that day we had pages of
fairly significant Government amendments. Although we had had the
letter telling us that those amendments would be tabled, none of us on
the Committee had seen them. They could, and do, have a huge impact on
the clauses they relate to. Although we may agree on a principle, the
purpose of Committees for Members on both sides is to scrutinise Bills
and to ensure that even where we agree, we, and indeed those who read
the record of our proceedings, fully understand proposals, but that
cannot happen if we do not have proper time to look at
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000027">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
having read the amendments, as others did, I was surprised that no
mention was made of any of them during any of Tuesday’s debates
on the clauses on vetting and barring or the Criminal Records Bureau,
despite the fact there was a huge number of amendments. I want to put
on the record that I was, to be frank, upset about that, and I would
like to hear any comment you may have, Mr Caton. The situation made it
impossible for us to do as effective a job as we would have liked of
scrutinising the Government’s proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000028">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To be fair to
the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member
for Old Bexley and Sidcup, he has been in my position, and he has
berated me once or twice for doing exactly the same thing. I know that
he will take this on board, but what 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 648<a class="bkMark" name="Column648">&#160;</a>
                           </div>has happened is a reminder to us all that, without the necessary time,
it is virtually impossible to scrutinise legislation, particularly in
opposition; it is hard enough in government to understand exactly what
is being proposed. To be fair to her, my hon. Friend the Member for
Kingston upon Hull North did an excellent job on Tuesday, but having
read the amendments, we might have amended some of the things that we
said and asked different questions. I have calmed down a bit now, but I
was extremely annoyed and angry at the time. The Government need to
reflect on the situation, because what happened really was not good
enough.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000029">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Further to that point of order, Mr Caton.
Perhaps I can respond to assist you on the point of order raised by the
hon. Member for Gedling. I know him well, and he does not raise issues
capriciously. I thank him for alerting me to this issue outside the
Committee in the normal way. I certainly hear the points that he has
made.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000031">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Before
proceedings on the Bill, we obviously telegraphed the fact that we were
minded to take forward the merger of the Independent Safeguarding
Authority and the Criminal Records Bureau in the Bill. Obviously, we
could have waited to table amendments on Report, but we felt that it
was appropriate to table them in Committee to give the House as a whole
as much time as possible to examine the new schedules, new clauses and
amendments. As the hon. Gentleman rightly said, I believe in scrutiny
and Parliament’s ability to examine Government proposals. We
wished to table amendments earlier in the process, but that was not
possible, so we tabled them as early as we could. That was reflected in
the marshalled list that appeared on Tuesday morning and the letter on
Monday evening.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000032">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We have about
23 clauses to get through today. I understand that a discussion has
taken place through the usual channels to consider timing the Bill to
allow for proper debate and discussion and for Opposition consideration
of the new clauses and new schedules. If time is allowed, I hope that
that will give the Opposition the opportunity to examine the new
provisions and debate them more slowly, so that they can assess them.
However, we have the opportunity to come back on Report should any

despite all the help that Government Front-Bench Members get from civil

introduce the provisions, as the Minister said, they did so at such
short notice. Will you ask the Speaker about the situation, Mr Caton?
Back-Bench Members, in particular, are being put in the incredible
position of not being able to look at amendments. This is the first
time that I have really had a look at them, and the number is
incredible. There is no way that a mere Back Bencher with other work to

this change. That is absolutely correct, but when the Bill was
published and on Second Reading, the change was not included. There has
been no indication at all throughout our extensive deliberations that
the matter would be addressed in the Bill. I am particularly concerned
that on Tuesday we spent a great deal of time considering the
provisions relating to vetting and barring, and no indication was given
of this structural change, which might have had implications for some
of the Opposition’s amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000035">&#160;</a>

of amendments will have on the discussions that we have already had.

he has. He mentioned the discussions that have taken place about
timing, so that we can perhaps discuss the matter next
Tuesday—wherever we get to today—to ensure that we can
cut off then, and my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull
North will deal with that. I appreciate the Minister’s tone, the
points that he has made about timing and his offer of a briefing for my
hon. Friend. I know that he takes these things seriously, but it is a
reminder to us all that the process is important, especially from our
point of view, so that we can understand what is going on. The whole
purpose of Committees is to hold the Government to account properly,
rather than just ranting as we all do sometimes. The Minister’s
point was well made, and I wish to put on record again my thanks to

section 12 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956 on buggery,
section 13 of that Act relating to gross indecency between men, section
61 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 or section 11 of the

related to consensual sex between two people over the age of 16 and not
committed in a public toilet, which is still an offence under section
71 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003, the procedure under the clause will
apply. Section 12 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956 also covers other
offences, such as bestiality, non-consensual buggery and under-age
buggery. I want confirmation from the Minister that such convictions
will not be overturned, leaving a narrow group of offences that can be
dealt with under the

referred to the number of individuals who might be covered by the
provisions. It spoke of 16,000 relevant convictions on the public
record at the moment that might be suitable for the Secretary of State
to take into consideration in the changing of records. Although that
was welcomed, much was made in the debate on criminal record checks
about how convictions—even irrelevant ones—can put off
people from
volunteering.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000046">&#160;</a>

said that a large group of men in the past might have felt very uneasy
about putting themselves forward for positions that might need criminal
record checks. Hopefully, the provisions will go some way towards
allowing that group to pursue volunteer positions. It is right that, in
future, people will not be deterred from volunteering or taking on
roles requiring such
checks.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000047">&#160;</a>

wonder about the level of evidence or documentation that might still be
available. How much of a problem might that cause in dealing with

time, not been illegal, but which can, nevertheless, show up on a
criminal record check. That situation might prevent an individual from
taking up certain opportunities in life, such as applying
for particular occupations, or volunteering—not because they
present a risk, but simply because they do not want to risk anyone
finding out about their past. They may not have told their family or
partner about the matter, and allowing that history to be revealed can
have devastating effects on

involving section 12 or 13 offences. Unless the police look into each
and every case, it is hard to establish all the facts. It would be
difficult to look back through every single one of the 50,000 cases to
establish whether the individuals involved were over 16 or whether
there are any consent issues. As we shall see on later clauses, that is

50,000 cases would have to be re-examined to see which were appropriate
for a disregard, we have provided for a pragmatic solution whereby
individuals may apply to the Secretary of State to have their records
disregarded. The scheme will allow the individual to choose what to do.
If they want to pursue that course of action they can but, equally, if
they do not want to they do not have
to.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000061">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">An
application will be granted only if certain conditions are met. In
particular, the Secretary of State must be satisfied that the conduct
that led to the conviction or caution was consensual and involved a
person aged over 16—that is, over the current age of consent. If
the conduct is still covered by the offence specified in section 71 of
the Sexual Offences Act 2003—sexual activity in a public
lavatory, which the hon. Lady mentioned—an application would not
be successful. Once an application has been granted, a notice to that
effect will be sent to the applicant. The relevant conviction or
caution will be treated as a disregarded conviction or caution 14 days
thereafter, which will allow time for the conviction or caution to be
removed from police records.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000062">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
asked about the practical difficulties of going back over cases and
about what information will be available. We will come on to more
detail about that in later clauses, but there are issues about where
information comes from and what is available. The process is not a
re-hearing of the case; it is simply an administrative operation to
elicit the disregard for those who apply. The information available
will therefore depend on how long ago the case was, whether the records
can be found and how clear they are.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000063">&#160;</a>

whole range of practical issues, but only when we start to look into
each case will we see what official records are available as evidence.
The facts—such as name, address and date of
conviction—produced by the applicant and what is available in
the official records are the two sources of information on which the
Secretary of State will make her judgment. I have dealt with the narrow
focus.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000064">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
appreciate what the hon. Lady said about the potential number involved.
We at the Home Office are working through how the process will work, in
terms of what the Home Office can make available, what resources will
be made available and how to make the whole procedure as smooth,
informal and easy as possible—even if 16,000 people come
forward, which the hon. Lady cited as being the number for whom the
disregard might be relevant.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000065">&#160;</a>

unlikely that all 16,000 would come forward on day one, but we are
looking to see how, were they to do so, all of that could be processed
and what resources could be made available. Later we will come on to
the issues around the Home Secretary, who will have an expert panel who
can help her in that. We are working through what will be involved and
what resources will be needed as we go through the process. We will
come back to it in more

can fully understand how the scheme will operate and highlight whether
we have any concerns with the practicalities of the scheme at this
stage. As I understand it, clause 83 sets out for the conditions for
the application to be made. It has to be in writing, giving the name,
address and so on of the applicant. It must give the specifics of the
offence or caution that will be looked at. It must also include any
other information that the Secretary of State requires to ascertain
whether the conviction relates to an act between consenting
adults.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000077">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">How
will people know about this application process? What communication
strategy does the Minister envisage needs to be put in place, to ensure
that everyone who may want to put an application in fully understands
what the process is and what will happen? In Stonewall’s
submission to the Committee, it highlighted that particular issue on
the communication strategy. It said that it hopes that it will reach
out to professional bodies such as the General Medical Council or the
Nursing and Midwifery Council to ensure that they understand the
changes and implications for their disclosure processes as well. That
deals with the employer side as well. Will the Minister say a little
more about how that will all
work?<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000078">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Will
the Minister indicate just how much information will be required by an
applicant? Does she believe that because there are issues of consent it
would be appropriate for the Secretary of State to look for information
from both parties involved in any offence, or is it just the person
making the application? What happens if there is a lack of information,
or records have been lost? I note that the Minister says that some
cases will be more recent, but equally, there will be some much older
cases. We know that records do not always stay where they are supposed
to be, or they go missing, so will there be a presumption by the
Secretary of State that if information is not readily available, the
offence should be expunged from the record? Is that a presumption that
the Secretary of State would take forward or not? The practicalities
are the Opposition’s key concerns at this
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000079">&#160;</a>

important because the provision affects people who, because the case
was long ago, may or may not be private about it. They may be anywhere
in the world, so it is very important that the message gets out and

accessed and what the conditions will be.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000080">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 83
sets out the process that an individual will have to follow when
applying to have their conviction or caution under sections 12 or 13 of
the Sexual Offences Act 1956 disregarded. The essence of the provision
is that we really want to make the process as simple as possible; it is
not meant to be complicated, difficult or challenging. To keep it as
simple as possible, we have kept the information requirements to the
minimum. The relevant records in most cases are, as we discussed,
likely to relate to events that took place a long time
ago—although not exclusively so—some of them perhaps,
decades ago. Tracking down the records may not be straightforward. Many
will exist from the time before computerised records and may be on
paper or microfiche, so we shall need a certain amount of basic
information—name, address and date of birth; name and address at
the time of the conviction; and the time and place of the conviction,
if possible. It will also be open to an applicant to supply additional
information in support of their
application.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000081">&#160;</a>

hon. Lady asked what would happen if the position was unclear. The Home
Secretary will look at the records and at whatever the applicant can
supply. There is no need for a formal process; if more information
comes to light, it can be sent on, added to and included in the
submission for the conviction or caution to be
disregarded.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000082">&#160;</a>

hon. Lady asked how we will get the information out. We are working
with all parties with an interest in the area—we are obviously
involving Stonewall—to ensure that the provisions are well
publicised. Clearly, that is very important. I take on board what she
says about employers and all those who need to know that the
opportunity is available. They may be able to spread the word in an
informed and helpful way to people who might want to make an
application.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000083">&#160;</a>

details are very thin on the ground, which could be the case when much
time has elapsed or when records are not legible—who knows why
the information may not be available—and the only available
information is that supplied by the applicant, it is likely, but not
yet finally decided, that the decision will be based on what the
applicant provides. We will, however, keep that point under close
review to ensure that only offences that fall within the scope of the
proposal are deleted. It is unlikely that there would be any going back
to the other party, because this is not a re-hearing; it is based on
what the applicant provides and the details on record.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000084">&#160;</a>

the process in response to the application, the applicant will be
encouraged to give as much information as possible, but without being
made to feel that they have to give any more than is necessary. The

information. As I say, we will look at all official records.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000085">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> As drafted, clause 84(2) rules the Secretary of
State out from holding oral hearings. Amendment 204 would strike out
that part of the clause. We do not quite understand why the Secretary
of State would not, in some circumstances, need an oral
hearing.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000095">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Striking out
offences can be a difficult and delicate business, and complex and
personal information might have to be sought and considered, as hon.
Members have said. It may be hard to distinguish irrelevant and
out-of-date information or convictions that society no longer
recognises, and which can be disregarded, from offences that are still
serious and need to be properly looked at. It is vital to find the
right balance, and we should not rule out, as the clause does, the
opportunity for the Secretary of State to hold an oral hearing in some
circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000096">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Another
concern is that if the applicant wishes to appeal when their
application is refused, the only remedy open to them under the Bill as
drafted is to go to the High Court. As we all know, going to the High
Court can be an expensive business. Furthermore, it would not be
appropriate if the matter could be dealt with by an oral hearing, which
would obviously be a much cheaper and perhaps much quicker remedy, and
would allow  the Secretary of State to look at all the
evidence. Amendment 204 would therefore assist applicants
and give the Secretary of State the opportunity to have an oral hearing
when required.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000097">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 84(4)
demands that the Secretary of State record her verdict in writing and
give notice to the applicant. Our amendment 205 would add to the
clause. We want the Secretary of State to give reasons for her decision
and to be obliged to review her decision on receipt of new information.
It is important to give reasons because, as we have said, the matter is
sensitive, and the applicant needs to be aware of what information has
been considered so that they will know if a mistake has been made. If
the Secretary of State does not give reasons and does not explain the
rationale for her decision, the only way to correct any mistake, as I
have just set out, would be to go to the High Court. Again, the
amendment would be a helpful means of dealing with problems. A mistake
might have been made on the basis of information provided, but it could
be picked up if the reasons for the decision were set out clearly. We
believe that a right to a certain level of redress before resorting to
the High Court is important, and would fit with the coalition
Government’s attempt to set such redress in train and protect
the rights of individuals who apply to have their convictions
disregarded.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000098">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
mentioned the cost of the High Court. There are also, as we have said,
potential difficulties with information not being readily available. I
do not understand why the Government are saying at this stage,
“We’re not going to allow any oral hearing; the only
opportunity to right what might be an administrative mistake is to go
to the High Court.” Amendment 204, which would provide the
opportunity for an oral hearing, and amendment 205, which
would require the Secretary of State to set out clearly her reasons for
making a decision, would be helpful to the process of transparency,
openness and clarity.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000099">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 206
is a probing amendment supported by Stonewall, which has indicated that
it is interested in pursuing the Government’s thinking. The
amendment relates to clause 89 and the fact that the only right of
appeal is to the High Court. The amendment would give the right to
access a lower court to remedy minor or administrative errors in an
application under clause 82, without the need to appeal to the High
Court. It is a general probing amendment. Are the Government really
minded to say that an individual must go to the High Court? That seems
disproportionate.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000100">&#160;</a>

there should be an opportunity, if the applicant wishes, to appeal the
decision of the Secretary of State. We explored in the evidence
sessions Stonewall’s feeling that it did not want the initial
decision to be made in the courts and was happy for it to be made by
the Home Secretary. However, if someone then appeals the decision, is
it appropriate to go straight to the High Court? Would not some other
court be more appropriate? That is the purpose of the amendment. I
wanted to test whether the Government had thought through other options
involving the lower courts and had disregarded

information must be considered and the decision reviewed if new
information becomes available after the decision has been made. On oral

do not think that oral hearings would help at all in that regard. They
detract from the purpose of the proposal, which is to correct a
wrong—in fact, on paper, which has existed for however long it
has existed—so that it may be disregarded in future. That is our
aim. The Bill sets up an administrative process that allows an

want to assure the hon. Lady about matters before the position covered
by clause 89 is reached. Having received the letter setting out the
reasons for his refusal, if the applicant discovers extra information
that he did not give in the first wave of information or certain
matters lead to other information that will be helpful, he can then
submit that to the Home Secretary and it will be reviewed without the
need to go on to an appeal stage. Such cases are not finite. The Home
Secretary would be minded to consider more information that came on the
back of the first
refusal.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000117">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I do not wish to make heavy weather of the issue
because we all agree that such an approach is sensible. However, if we
are setting up such a process, there needs to be clarity about what the
process is so that everyone can understand it. Given the clauses as
drafted, there will be an opportunity to make the application to the
Secretary of State to make her or his decision, but nothing in the Bill
refers to the review procedure. Perhaps the Minister can help me about
that. It seems that the applicant would have to go straight to the High
Court.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000118">&#160;</a>

the ultimate appeal process, but the original issue for the applicant
in terms of the publicity and the application form, all of the
information about what can be done if the application is
refused—<em>[</em>
                           <em>Interruption.</em>
                           <em>]</em> It says here that
we will set out the processes in clear guidance to applicants. That is
what I am saying, but in another way. Clear information will be
available to those thinking of applying. Once they apply, it will be
made clear what the process is, what they are likely to receive if
their application is accepted or refused and what they can do if they
wish to correct a point or if there is more information. The guidance
will be clear. None of that is on the face of the Bill in those terms,
because it is the simple side of the process.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000119">&#160;</a>

we as a Committee should be clear about exactly what the process is for
dealing with that sensitive issue. I am not sure that waiting for later
guidance sends the right message. We might introduce a clause—we
could return to this on Report—to make it clear that there will
be an opportunity for review. In such matters, we need to be clear that
the public will want to understand fully what they are getting

hon. Lady that everything will be set out in clear guidance. However,
for the avoidance of doubt, there will be a process whereby the
applicant will know what information will be provided, what is
happening, how to apply, what a granting of the application means, what
a refusal means and that the reasons for a refusal will be included in
case alterations or more information are needed. I assure her that if
the applicant produces additional information affecting the decision
made, it will be considered and, where appropriate, the decision will
be altered, without the applicant’s having to go through the
formalities of an appeal. I hope that that puts clearly on the record
the intention and practice of the Government.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000122">&#160;</a>

seeks to provide for minor or administrative errors to be remedied
without the need for the applicant to lodge a formal appeal to the High
Court. As I said, I share the hon. Lady’s desire not to go to
the High Court and to avoid unnecessary appeals. I therefore endorse
the principle underpinning the amendment, although I consider the
amendment unnecessary, as I have just explained that there are other
administrative processes and stages through which an applicant can go
before getting to the point of
appeal.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000123">&#160;</a>

I said, if the applicant produces additional information affecting the

application. For example, if he has sent one lot of information and
suddenly thinks, “There is something I could have added,”
he is welcome to do so. As I said, it is in no one’s interest to
let matters proceed to the High Court when that can be
avoided.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000124">&#160;</a>

                           </div>want to know the reason. We envisage that the letter advising the
applicant that his application has been rejected will contain a note
saying that if additional information comes to light or there was an
error in the original application, the application should let the Home
Office know as soon as possible.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000126">&#160;</a>

that the fact that a decision is questioned or more information is
added does not mean that the refusal will be reversed, but it will
ensure that all relevant information is considered without affecting
the applicant’s right to appeal to the High Court should the
decision to refuse the application be confirmed. Having explained our
approach to applications to have a conviction or caution disregarded, I

everybody understands, and it would be better to have the
option—the option only—available to the Home Secretary if
she felt that it was appropriate to have an oral hearing. We are not
saying that there should be such hearings in all cases. Clearly, the
vast majority will be based on paperwork, but it would be foolish to
say that there will not be those few cases where it would be helpful

could receive the information on their behalf—that will be
absolutely fine, and they should be able to do that. There is no
hesitation in making this as easy and unembarrassing as possible to
remove any difficulties that might be encountered and to ensure that
the process can be followed and that the remedy is received with the
least difficulty possible. On that basis, I ask the Committee to let

records. If the records are police records, the data controller is
likely to be a chief officer of police—that is the relevant
point. The onus is on the police to delete their records as soon as is
reasonably practicable. We will expect people to act swiftly in all
regards as soon as a decision is made, so as soon as is
viable.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000184">&#160;</a>

records expunged, one might have to research back into records dating
from perhaps the 1940s. We must not be too prescriptive, therefore,
about record keepers, as they used to be called, or data controllers,
as they seem to be called now, annulling those
records.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000186">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My hon. Friend makes a really valid point.
Ultimately, even if it takes a bit longer to get to the right answer,
that is absolutely the correct approach and it is the approach that the
Government would take. To sum up, clause 85 sets out what happens if an
application to disregard a conviction or caution is successful. It
might help the Committee if I explain what is meant by
“disregard”. I know that in some quarters there was a
suggestion that the Government had made some sort of change, because a
promise had been made to delete these records.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000187">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The purpose
of the proposals is to ensure that the personal details of an
individual who had been convicted or cautioned under section 12 or 13
of the Sexual Offences Act 1956 are not disclosed. Clause 85 sets out
that the Secretary of State will tell the relevant data
controller—or record keeper—to delete the records of the
conviction or caution in question. That will apply to records that are
kept on the police national computer and local police
records.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000188">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Some records
are kept in formats that do not allow for simple deletion, however.
Those include court records, which are often kept in bound volumes
containing details of thousands of convictions, and records of
historical interest such as those kept by the National Archives. One
cannot destroy such pages. In such cases—where it is not
possible to destroy the physical record, because to do so would mean
the destruction of other criminal records or the destruction of
documents of historical importance—we have provided for the
relevant conviction or caution to be annotated with a statement that it
is a disregarded conviction or caution, and that the effect of such a
disregard is that the person is to be treated for all purposes in law
as though they had not committed the offence. Obviously, if it is an
electronic record, it will be deleted.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000189">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> In a previous contribution, the Minister said
that she was going to talk about the disregard, and obviously Clause 86
deals with the effects of disregarding a conviction. As I understand
it, the person will be treated as if the conviction never existed. The
conviction cannot be mentioned in judicial proceedings, it will not
apply to agreements demanding the disclosure of convictions and it
cannot be used as grounds for dismissal. What remedy would be open to
an applicant who had gone through the process of having the conviction
disregarded and then found themselves in a position 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 667<a class="bkMark" name="Column667">&#160;</a>
                           </div>where that conviction was being used in an inappropriate way? Would
remedies would be open to individual applicants in that
case?<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000203">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I will come to that point. We are unable to
delete every newspaper reporting of any conviction or caution happening
at the time. We can be clear for the purposes of disregard for criminal
records, for judicial hearings, all those purposes; however, we cannot
say that the actual act never happened. Although it may be no longer
relevant or disregarded, as if it never happened in criminal law, we
cannot expunge it from history because it actually happened and it
might have been reported on. It is possible that a newspaper article
somewhere will exist.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000204">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I will come
back to what remedy might be available should the conviction
accidentally be exposed—for example, for the reasons mentioned
by the hon. Member for West Bromwich East.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000205">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let me put it
simply. Once a conviction or caution is disregarded, the person is
treated for all purposes in law as though the offence, and what
followed from it, never happened. The record of the conviction or
caution can never be disclosed and the person to whom the disregard
applies is under no legal obligation—I want to put this on the
record—to disclose it on any form of criminal record check or
enquiry. A disregarded conviction or caution will not appear on any
criminal record certificate issued by the Criminal Records Bureau and
it cannot be revealed in any kind of judicial
proceedings.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000206">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
this respect we are going beyond the provisions of the Rehabilitation
of Offenders Act 1974. Under that Act, even spent convictions are
disclosable in certain circumstances, and will be on CRB certificates,
as we have discussed. Under the Bill, that will not be the case for
disregarded convictions and cautions, and a person with such a
conviction or caution will be treated for all purposes as if he had
never committed the offence and therefore had never been charged,
prosecuted, convicted and sentenced for the
offence.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000207">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
would like to make clear an important point. The provisions will apply
only when an individual has had a conviction or caution disregarded. As
I explained under clause 82, an application to have a conviction or
caution for an offence under section 12 or 13 of the Sexual Offences
Act 1956 disregarded is at the individual’s discretion. If the
individual does not apply, or applies and is not successful, the
conviction or caution will remain, and can be disclosed in a CRB check.
I would not like the message inadvertently to go out that there is an
automatic deletion; the deletion is applicant-applied-for. That is why
we will be working with interested parties, such as Stonewall, to
advertise the measure and to encourage as many individuals as possible
who come within its scope to apply and have their conviction or caution
disregarded.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000208">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull North asked about the remedy. An
applicant can take legal action if their application for a conviction
to be disregarded is refused inappropriately, in employment cases for
example, and that can be done at an employment
tribunal.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000209">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It is there probably because it is better to
have a clear explanation in the Bill of the distinction between a royal
pardon and Her Majesty’s auspices, and to state that the
provisions do not change the situation with regard to Her Majesty. The
clause provides that nothing in the Bill affects Her Majesty’s
power to grant a free pardon, quash a conviction or sentence, or
commute a sentence. The power to issue a royal pardon remains,
irrespective of the operation of the provisions. Her Majesty would take
precedence over any decision to disregard, or not, an
individual’s record, and that needs to be made
clear.<a class="bkMark" name="11051244000216">&#160;</a>
