to ask the Minister. I was surprised at a point that she made in
response to my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk. She
suggested that it would be best to have a consultation after the Bill
has come to the House. I am curious about that practice. I appreciate
that I am a fairly new boy, but would it not be better to have a
consultation, as my hon. Friend suggested, prior to the Bill coming to
the House, rather than
afterwards?</div>

process. We believe that we are fully informed and that we can put
forward a sufficient framework to get the new structure on the move.
Thereafter, there will be a huge amount of detail that will require yet
further consultation. That is the process that we have adopted; I hope
that that reassures the hon.

First-tier Tribunal may review a decision made by it on a matter in a

purposes of section
11(1)&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07031612000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">My amendment
probes the powers of the first-tier tribunal to review its own
decision. What is the scope of that power of review? Is it merely
limited to points of law or does it go beyond that to evidential
matters? If it is only a power of review, does it refer purely to
formal matters or does it extend to something more
substantial?</div>
					<a name="07031612000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Presumably, the essence of the
subsection is to ensure that the only cases that go to appeal will be
those that really need to&#151;the power is to enable minor errors to
be corrected swiftly and informally. I recall from my time at the Bar
that there are certain rules of procedure allowing magistrates courts,
for example, to overturn their own decisions quickly within a certain
period. I believe that there are other precedents as well. Will the
Minister say what other precedents there are for the correction of
minor mistakes without the need for a full
appeal?</div>
					<a name="07031612000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the power
is all part of trying to make the tribunal system more informal,
user-friendly and generally more efficient, we would support it.
However, I should be grateful if the Minister enlightened us further.
These are probing amendments.</div>
					
					<a name="07031612000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07031612000419"></a>
							<b class="B">Simon
Hughes</b> (North Southwark and Bermondsey) (LD): There are
four amendments in the group, but only the lead amendment relates to
the clause; the other three relate to clauses 11 and 12. I do not
support the first amendment in the group, because I believe it is
important that there should be a general power of review left to the
lower-level tribunal. That is something that tribunals need to do,
because there may be factual inaccuracies or information given may need
to be corrected. There are all sorts of reasons why it is sensible for
the same tribunal to return to a matter if something is pointed out,
whether on direction from elsewhere or, as the Bill says, instigated by
the tribunal. That process should not be fettered. I understand that,
at the moment, although the Minister will no doubt 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column33" />Column number: 33</div>correct us, such a return is generally likely to be on points of fact,
evidence or procedure, but it could be on a point of law as well if
that were
necessary.</div>
					<a name="07031612000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The more
substantive matters are covered by amendments Nos. 45, 46 and 49, which
would allow a right of appeal to the upper tribunal, and not only on a
point of law. That is a significant matter. There is merit in amendment
No. 49, which would allow a right of appeal not just on a matter of
law, but in respect of where the facts did not bear out or justify the
decision, or on a question of fact with the leave of the higher
tribunal. However, I am nervous about the idea that factual matters
cannot be appealed against and that only legal matters can be appealed
against. There are all sorts of cases, from past experience, where the
facts do not lead to the tribunal&#146;s conclusion. I have been
involved in some cases like that and I am sure that Committee
colleagues have,
too.</div>
					<a name="07031612000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">I realise that
this is not a new matter&#151;like most things in the
Bill&#151;because it has already been to the House of Lords and there
has already been at least one set of discussions on it. However, a
fairly strong case was put in the Lords for ensuring that there was a
wider power of review by the upper tribunal of the lower
tribunal. If we are going to keep things in the tribunal system and
prevent them from going to the Court of Appeal, or from going outside
the tribunal system to a higher court, which is more expensive, would
take longer and so on, we should allow the two levels of tribunal to
sort things out as much as
possible.</div>
					<a name="07031612000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">One does not
want the ability to have a completely new run of the case at the upper
tribunal, in the same way as it was run in the lower tribunal. One
should not be able simply to appeal for the sake of it, with no check
or balance. At the moment, in your constituency, Mr. Bercow,
as in mine, many parents will have received letters telling them that
their child cannot go to the school that was the family&#146;s first
choice. An appeal system is permitted in such cases in almost every
school, apart from&#151;anomalously&#151;city technology colleges,
where there is no appeal system, which is an injustice that has never
been corrected. Many people appeal against such decisions as a matter
of course, simply because they want a review and cannot believe that
they should not get into the school that is near them. I understand
that we do not want a tribunal system that allows an appeal as a matter
of course, in effect, to a similar body, although one tier up, simply
to hear the facts. The onus is on the Government to argue for such a
restriction. I hope that the Minister is sympathetic, at least to
amendment No. 49 and, if not, to a variant of amendment No. 45, but
resists amendment No.
40.</div>
					
					<a name="07031612000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031612000420"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> This is about the tribunal&#146;s review powers
and the right of onward appeal. The first tier tribunal can be reviewed
or appealed against. Appeals are only to correct errors of law or to
clarify the law, but essentially they are to correct accidental errors.
The hon. Member for North-West Norfolk has put his finger on what the
review panel is about. A review can be done either through the
tribunal&#146;s own initiative or on application by a person who has
a right of appeal. As he said, the point is to ensure that only those
cases that lead to appeal go there.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column34" />Column number: 34</div>
					<a name="07031612000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are parallels. The hon.
Gentleman referred to the civil procedure rules. Rule 40.12 provides
for slips and omissions in civil courts to be corrected without the
need for an appeal. Section 155 of the Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act
2000 provides a slip rule for the criminal courts to vary or rescind a
sentence within 28 days. There is a similar power in section 142 of the
Magistrates&#146; Courts Act 1980. Those are the precedents that he
sought from
me.</div>
					<a name="07031612000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similar amendments
were tabled in the House of Lords. We modified the review provisions to
make sure that they were not too wide. They are now subject to tribunal
procedure rules that can be used, for example, to stop frivolous
applications for review for the sake of it&#151;of the sort that the
hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey conjured up in his
analogy of school appeals. I hope that I have satisfied him about
reviews.</div>
					<a name="07031612000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for
broadening the scope of appeal to the upper tribunals, the pattern is
that the first tier is to hear appeals from the decision maker. It will
consider all the evidence. It will make findings of fact and, where
necessary, law. It would be completely disproportionate to set up
another tribunal that could rerun that. However, if the first tier
tribunal gets the law wrong or substantive issues of law need an
authoritative ruling, the upper tribunal is there to deal with such
matters. Without it, those rulings would have to go to the High Court
or the Court of Session to be made. It is exactly the model that we are
used to through the employment tribunals, the Employment Appeal
Tribunal and the social security commissioners. It is straightforward
and flexible.</div>
					<a name="07031612000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey mentioned manifestly
unreasonable conclusions on the facts and the importance of having a
ground of appeal wide enough to stop those automatically from going out
into the more expensive, more complex and longer procedure of judicial
review. We feel confident that our error of law is wide enough to deal
with manifestly unreasonable conclusions on the facts. I hope that both
hon. Gentlemen will accept that we have struck a fair and proportionate
balance and that the amendments can be
withdrawn.</div>

							<a name="07031612000421"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for her
explanation of the amendments to which I spoke earlier. Further to the
point made by the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey, will
the hon. and learned Lady comment on the Tsfayo case that was raised in
the other place by Lord Maclennan of Rogart? It is not sub judice; the
case was heard before the European Court of Human Rights. The Tsfayo
party won the case. The decision was that the facts could be brought
forward on appeal, not only a point of law. Will she comment on what
was discussed in the House of Lords? I understand that her colleague
said that the Government would provide more detail about it at a later
stage. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

						</b> The principal amendment is a simple probing
amendment that would replace the word &#147;may&#148; with the word
&#147;must&#148;. The others are consequential on it. If the upper
tribunal decides against the lower tier, it is surely not the case
merely that the upper tribunal may be able to set aside the decision.
Rather, surely it is the case that it must set the decision aside.
There should not be any &#147;mays&#148;, &#147;perhapses&#148;
or &#147;coulds&#148;; the word should be &#147;must&#148;.
That would represent better drafting and would be altogether neater and
clearer.</div>

important, but I want to set the scene and to point out 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column37" />Column number: 37</div>to the Minister that judicial review is an important part of our
jurisprudence and whole legal system.</div>
					<a name="07031612000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any student at the Bar or
trainee solicitor is taught about judicial review from the earliest
stage. It is a vital part of our law and this piece of the Bill has to
be regarded in that context. Will the Minister say a bit more about how
the judicial review process will work and give us a little more detail?
How often does she expect it to be used? I do not want to go into the
detail of what we will discuss on clause 18, where we will consider the
limits of jurisdiction, but clause 15(1) sets out exactly what the
power will be and what kinds of relief will be available under judicial
review. I do not want to anticipate my amendments to clause 18, because
they are the ones that we feel strongly about. However, all these
clauses are of profound importance and I am anxious that we should not
let them go by without some explanation from the Minister. I would be
grateful if she could give that.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031612000431"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> Essentially, the point of enabling the judiciary to
transfer cases from the normal judicial review jurisdiction into the
upper tribunal is to harness the expertise that is likely to be
available in that forum on the special kinds of business that the
tribunal system takes care of. The provisions do not remove or resist
judicial review, but make it possible for selected judicial reviews
that would normally be heard before the High Court to be dealt with in
the upper tribunal. The powers will be the same as those of judicial
review, so the fact that it is in the tribunal system does not mean
that there will not be the power to grant mandatory orders,
prohibition, quashing orders, declarations or injunctions. The hon.
Gentleman will recall from Second Reading that the range of judiciary
available to deal with quasi-judicial reviews in the upper tribunal is
restricted to the High Court and those approved by the chief
justices.</div>
					<a name="07031612000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">We expect
the power to be used comparatively rarely&#151;dozens of times at
most and certainly not in large numbers&#151;and that its use is
likely to be confined to technical situations that would be better
dealt with by technically expert people.</div>

							<a name="07031612000432"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> The Minister is right, as is the hon. Member for
North-West Norfolk. This is an important development, which I do not
resist. Can the Minister say whether it is expected that this will be a
quicker procedure and, as many assume, a cheaper one? When thinking
about judicial review, people are always concerned about the potential
cost implications and the delay. There is a linked question which,
although we may debate it later, is relevant to this set of clauses, of
which clause 15 is the first. Will legal aid be available for judicial
review proceedings in an upper level tribunal, as it is normally
available for a judicial review in the High
Court?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031612000433"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> Will it be quicker and cheaper? One imagines that
it will be cheaper, because the informality of the tribunals makes them
quicker, generally, than courts. Whether they are quicker depends on
listing, the number of cases and the backlog in the upper tribunal.
Granted that there is frequent discussion about shortages of judicial
manpower in the High Court, one imagines that it is likely that cases
could be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column38" />Column number: 38</div>heard more quickly. However, I cannot say more than that. I am told that
judicial reviews are being got to court quite quickly now. That is not
what it used to be like. I can give no promises as to whether the
process will be quicker, but it ought to be
cheaper.</div>
					<a name="07031612000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey asked me about legal aid.
That is an important point. There is not, on the face of it, a right to
legal aid in the tribunal system. I have raised that matter and I will
write to the hon. Gentleman, if I may, with a more comprehensive
answer. There are situations where it is probably not necessary, but
there may still be situations that he would continue to be concerned
about, so I shall write to
him.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031612000434"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s
generically helpful answer. I have experience of, and am involved at
arm&#146;s length with, a judicial review application at the moment
on a Government decision to close the 24-hour emergency clinic at
Maudsley hospital. The application was made some weeks ago and nothing
has happened yet, so my honest view is that judicial reviews do not
always swing into the courts on the next day after the
application&#151;although some may be
quicker.</div>
					<a name="07031612000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is an
important matter. The presumption should be that a judicial review for
somebody who does not have the resources should be legally aided,
whichever tribunal is dealing with the matter. Depending on the
Minister&#146;s answer, we would be keen to reserve the right to
return to this matter. There is general concern about some important
cases currently in tribunals. I hope that we can reach agreement and,
if not, I give notice now that we may be able to work together
to achieve an amendment on Report that would deal with the
concerns.</div>

Baird:
						</b> The amendments would remove the ability of the High
Court to transfer any class of case to the upper tribunal for the
purposes that we have already started to discuss. It would be for the
Lord Chief Justice, with the agreement of the Lord Chancellor, to
designate classes of cases for which the upper tribunal would have sole
responsibility and for the High Court to decide other cases, as and
when they arise. That seems the right balance. The initiative is with
the judiciary throughout, which again seems correct.</div>
					<a name="07031612000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the amendments were carried,
it would not be possible for a class of cases to be transferred. The
whole power would not have been excluded, but it would have to be
exercised on a case-by-case basis. That seems a wasteful use of
judicial resources. As I said, the power is intended to be used only in
fairly technical cases. Classes of cases would be more likely to be
moved when there were good technical reasons to do so and not
otherwise. It seems sensible to have that power so that a tranche of
cases, which might be similar or which might have the same technical
components, could go over at once, instead of each case having to be
considered separately.</div>
					<a name="07031612000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Lord Chief Justice is
content that he can define a class of case of this nature. Therefore,
we should not gainsay that by saying that each and every individual one
ought to be considered separately. I hope that it is the

							<a name="07031612000445"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:
						</b> I certainly take the view that it makes sense
to refer judicial review matters to the upper tribunal. The Opposition
broadly support what the Government are trying to do. We feel that it
makes sense and in some ways is an overdue step.</div>
					<a name="07031612000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless, this is an area
of great importance. In the past, the power to grant judicial review
has been confined to the High Court. We should look at the phrasing of
the Bill and the way in which the term &#147;judicial review&#148;
has been put in inverted commas in clause 15. The reason why judicial
review is so important is that it allows the individual citizen to
challenge the decisions of Departments and of other public bodies.
Judicial review cases are often extremely high-profile. One thinks of
certain recent cases that have hit the headlines, and of the occasions
when previous Home Secretaries have been overruled on judicial review,
such as when Mr. Justice Collins overruled the Home
Secretary on a matter of anti-terrorist
law.</div>
					<a name="07031612000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the history
of judicial review and its importance in our whole legal system and our
constitution, I share the view of many other Conservative Members that
there has to be a High Court to keep the Government in check by means
of the judicial review process. An important aspect of the fulfilment
of that function is that High Court judges decide such vital issues. If
the Bill proceeds as it stands, however, matters could be decided
by</div>
					<a name="07031612000354"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;such other persons as
may be agreed from time to
time&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07031612000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously,
those other such persons will not be High Court judges, although they
will be hugely eminent and experienced, and the agreement on who they
are will be made between the Lord Chief Justice, the Lord President or
the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, or, as the case may be, the
senior president of tribunals. I do not suggest for one moment that
they will not be of the highest calibre, nor that they will lack the
advice of experienced people. Maybe the Opposition are being purist.
However, there is a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column41" />Column number: 41</div>significant body of opinion in legal circles to the effect that the
decisions should be made by High Court judges, that that is what the
Bill should say expressly, and that the words that I have quoted should
be removed. If they were, the Opposition would be far more
content.</div>
					<a name="07031612000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Only in rare
circumstances will it be the case that such key judicial review
applications do not go before a High Court judge&#151;once or twice a
year, maybe. Perhaps the Minister will tell us how often she expects
that to happen. It might be only once every five years. However, those
few cases could be of overwhelming importance, and in those
circumstances we believe that it would always be appropriate for them
to be heard by a High Court judge.</div>
					<a name="07031612000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The Minister,
and the Department for Constitutional Affairs, might well say that
there are not enough High Court judges around and that there will at
all times be insufficient such judges to take on the task. However, if
there is such a shortage, and if there is an argument that more are
needed, there is a vast pool of talent out there. We shall shortly be
debating the widening of the pool for judicial appointments. If the
DCA&#146;s position is based on unavailability of High Court judges,
my response is that there are easily enough people around with the
serious talent and intellect to fill the spare places on the High Court
bench.</div>
					<a name="07031612000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						If
the Government are concerned about a lack of judges, they should make
one or two additional appointments, which would immediately remove the
administrative concern about such a lack. We could then put the Bill to
Her Majesty in due course knowing that a very important part of our
constitution had been preserved. The ability for such cases to be
properly heard has been a part of our legal system for a very long time
indeed. It provides the modus operandi whereby citizens of this country
can actually challenge the Executive in cases that go to the root of
our freedoms. I might be getting slightly carried away, and it might be
that the matters that will come from tribunals on judicial review will
not be anything like as weighty as I have suggested, but they could be.
Given the types of issue that tribunals deal with day in, day out, it
might well be that from time to time there will be appeals on judicial
review that are pretty fundamental to the citizens of this country, our
electors and our constituents. That is why we feel strongly that, at
the very least, the Government should give a further explanation than
the one that they gave in another place. We need to be satisfied that
there is an overwhelming reason why the Bill cannot state that High
Court judges will exclusively hear the
applications.</div>

							<a name="07031612000446"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> I added my name to the amendment because I share
the strong views that are held about this matter. So far judicial
review is carried out only by the High Court, but using the relatively
newly developed opportunity in this country, people can use
administrative law to challenge the Executive. Citizens have the
opportunity to go to the independent judiciary to challenge the
Executive. The Executive could be a Secretary of State, an agency, a
Department or an official of the Government. That principle, certainly
in the early days of the newly structured Tribunals Service, should be
subject only to the judgment of someone who has the authority of a High
Court judge. Clause 18(8) and its condition 4 give flexibility for
other appointments.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column42" />Column number: 42</div>
					<a name="07031612000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course, people acting in the
best interests of the system and the post holders, such as the Lord
Chief Justice, the Lord President, the Lord Chief Justice of Northern
Ireland and the senior president of the tribunals, will obviously
consider such matters wisely. However, it should be not for them, but
for us, to decide the matter. A lot of things in the Bill could be
dealt with by secondary legislation or even rules of court or
tribunals, not primary
legislation.</div>
					<a name="07031612000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						However,
what we are discussing should, first, be dealt with by legislation and,
secondly, retain its present position. It is an innovation. It will
give tribunals in the upper tier that we are creating the power to deal
with judicial review applications. They are matters in which decisions
are of major significance. They could go to the highest authorities in
the land, so my request is for the Minister to reconsider the matter
and accept that for the time being and for the first five or 10 years
of the system, such a provision should be excluded. The best way in
which to do that is to support the amendment. If later experience
suggests that we can change things, we can return to the matter in the
fullness of time. I would far rather that we struck out the provision
now and kept the authority of the High Court for judicial review. I
support the
amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031612000447"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> We do not agree. I agree with the hon. Member for
North-West Norfolk that the current provisions will guarantee the
highest calibre of judiciary in the upper tribunal to deal with
judicial reviews. I also agree that there is a significant pool of
talent able to be appointed, but this is not about personnel
availability, but about
flexibility.</div>
					<a name="07031612000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked how many cases we expect to be dealt with. We expect
there to be a mixture. The Lord Chief Justice will second some High
Court judges to the upper tribunals. They will do some of the work, but
many of the cases will be dealt with by the expert judges who are
already in the upper tribunal. As my noble Friend Baroness Ashton
explained in the other place, we regard a blanket requirement saying
that a High Court judge is necessary for every judicial review in the
upper tribunal as neither desirable nor necessary. The lengthy debate
in the other place resulted in a clause that now encapsulates the
principle that judicial review should be heard only by those judges who
have the experience and expertise to do so. The clause would not do
that by limiting the judges to those who are currently hearing judicial
review in the
courts.</div>
					<a name="07031612000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should
emphasise that both the senior president and the Lord Chief Justice
agreed that the amendments are workable and practical. I do not agree
with the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey, who said that
in this case the allocation of judges ought to be done by legislation;
I think that it is better done internally, by the judiciary
itself.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="07031612000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would also
point out to the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk that deputy High
Court judges now hear judicial reviews. Sometimes they are circuit
judges and sometimes they are QCs who are not judges at all, so we are
not exactly striking out on a new line.</div>
					<a name="07031612000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for North-West
Norfolk has discerned a significant body of opinion in legal circles 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column43" />Column number: 43</div>that the ability to decide on judicial reviews ought to be confined to
High Court judges. I should tell him that the Lord Chief Justice is not
a member of that body of opinion. He
states:</div>
					<a name="07031612000355"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Some
cases in the Upper Tribunal will need High Court judges to hear them,
and I intend to make such judges available to sit on those cases.
However, it is
imperative&#148;</div>
					<a name="07031612000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#151;imperative&#151;</div>
					<a name="07031612000356"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that
there is flexibility in relation to the circumstances where cases
should be transferred to the Upper Tribunal, and flexibility as to who
they will be heard by. That flexibility would be disturbed if the Bill
was to include a provision limiting such cases to High Court judges,
regardless of the relevant circumstances of the case. There are some
persuasive examples of cases where judges of the Upper Tribunal will
have the expertise to handle particular cases in the most appropriate
way. Technical tax cases have, for example, been mentioned in the
course of our
discussions.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07031612000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
course, we would expect special commissioners of income tax and social
security&#151;people who might hear judicial reviews in their own
area of technical expertise&#151;to be people of the highest
imaginable calibre, as the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk said.
However, flexibility is imperative, so I invite the hon. Gentleman to
feel persuaded to withdraw his amendments because they are opposed by
the Government.</div>

Bellingham:
						</b> This is a modest point and concerns the powers
to make procedural rules for tribunals. A number of categories are set
out in clause 22(4)(a) to (e), which we think could be strengthened by
adding an expression relating to the achievement of the interests of
justice. I imagine that the Minister will say that the achievement of
the interests of justice underlies every 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column44" />Column number: 44</div>measure in the Bill, but I would suggest that having the words contained
in amendment No. 66 in the Bill would send an important message and
that the Bill would be stronger as a
consequence.</div>
					
					<a name="07031612000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031612000452"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> There are three amendments in this group and I
want to speak specifically to amendments Nos. 66 and 68. The hon.
Member for North-West Norfolk moved amendment No. 65. I anticipate that
the Minister will say that that amendment does not materially change
what is currently in 22 (4) (a), which also talks about justice.
However, does she not agree that the amendment is slightly wider and
therefore slightly better? Also, an important point in the amendment
establishes that every part of the judiciary and the judicial process
complies with the European convention on human rights, which states
that people must have access to justice and a fair trial&#151;either
civil or criminal. The amendment is a link to amendment No. 67, which
comes in the following
group.</div>
					<a name="07031612000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we come to
debate the next group, which is specifically about legal aid
provisions, it is important to see the amendments as part of the debate
about access to justice and compliance with the European convention. If
the Minister can satisfy us that all aspects of the tribunal system
have been checked and proof read for ECHR compliance, as every Bill is
required to be, and that all the rules issued to the tribunals are
satisfactory, then we will have to accept that for the time being. Does
she not think that it would be better to have that sort of statement
within the Bill? In that context, I want to ask the wider question. For
those who know the workings of the civil and the High Courts relatively
well, they will know that there are two books of rules that are used by
all practitioners, including judges and lawyers. One is a large white
book for the High Court and the other a smaller green book for the
lower courts, which is known as the county court book. Many of the
rules governing the courts are in those two books rather than in
primary legislation. Why, in this case, was the judgment made to put
slightly more of the detailed rules into primary legislation than
Governments normally wish to do? Is there an exact comparison that has
been done to make sure that we are doing here what we have already done
in the High
Court?</div>
					<a name="07031612000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">I&#146;m
always keen that we have Bills that are as short and as simple as
possible. Matters that are entirely technical should be in secondary
legislation&#151;unless they are of significance&#151;and in rules
if they are of importance to practitioners but not to members of the
public. I would be grateful to know what led the Minister to make the
judgment that we need as much of the regulation of the process in
primary legislation, of which clearly this is
part.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031612000453"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> Amendment No. 65, which was moved by the hon.
Member for North-West Norfolk, adds an interest of justice test to the
list of principles that the tribunal procedure committee should keep in
mind when making rules. Lord Kingsland, the colleague of the hon.
Member for North-West Norfolk, moved an amendment with exactly the same
effect in Grand Committee in the House of Lords. The Government
accepted, as I do now on behalf of the Government in this House, its
general intention in principle. An 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 45</div>alternative more in keeping with the drafting of the Bill was offered to
Lord Kingsland and he tabled the draft on Report, which is now clause
22 (4) (a). It would be extraordinary to add to the Bill the
alternative which Lord Kingsland rejected in favour of 22 (4) (a).
Therefore, I do not think that we should entertain the prospect of
doing that.</div>
					<a name="07031612000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The hon.
Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey gave almost the same answer
that I have given to amendment No. 65, although he asked whether the
provision proposed by the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk was not
wider and therefore better. However, Lord Kingsland was satisfied that
the term &#147;ensure that justice is done&#148; was just as good
as &#147;acting always in the interests of justice&#148;. I am
inclined to agree.</div>
					<a name="07031612000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the further amendments to which the hon. Gentleman spoke, it is exactly
as he said. Of course, the tribunal system and the provisions of the
Bill have to be convention-compliant. As the hon. Gentleman said, all
Bills have to be considered in detail to ensure that they are
compliant, and they are considered in that way before the
Minister&#151;in this case, me&#151;signs to say that they are
compatible with the European convention. To add something saying that
the Bill shall comply with the European convention is pointless. As the
hon. Gentleman, who is an experienced Committee member, knows, if
something odd and unnecessary is included in a piece of legislation to
make things clearer, the next piece of legislation that does not
include it is always called into question. There is nothing to be
gained from adding such a thing to the Bill and it would add not one
iota to its human rights
calibre.</div>
					<a name="07031612000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Amendment
No. 66 would ensure that the rules are compliant with the ECHR. One
could say that they may have to be all the more compliant than the
legislation. The legislation could be declared incompatible if it were
not compliant and, anyway, hon. Members would not want to bring into
play legislation that was not convention-compliant. Subsidiary
legislation could be overturned by the judiciary if it were not
compliant, so the tribunal procedure committee will have to ensure that
it is
convention-compliant.</div>
					<a name="07031612000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is
there more detail about this matter in the Bill than is normal? There
is no intention that that should be so. We intend the level of primary
and secondary legislation to be broadly similar to that which is
customary. I invite the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk to ask leave
to withdraw his
amendment.</div>

							<a name="07031612000457"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:
						</b> The amendments, which both say basically the
same thing, would give the Minister a degree of choice. They would
introduce a provision whereby the tribunal procedure rules may allow
legal aid to be granted by a judge of the first-tier
tribunal.</div>
					<a name="07031612000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
having a wide-ranging and, at times, passionate debate about the way in
which the legal aid changes proposed by the Government are being
implemented. I do not want to go down that route. However, it has
struck me for a while as slightly bizarre and unfair that people cannot
get legal aid for cases in tribunals, except in a few circumstances.
There are a number of exceptions. I gather that in the Lands Tribunal,
for example, people can get legal aid. Perhaps the Minister will
comment on whether legal aid is available in other
tribunals.</div>
					<a name="07031612000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should
not like to include in the Bill the power to grant legal aid
automatically, because that would be a step too far. I am well aware,
as are other Opposition Members, of the pressures within the Department
for Constitutional Affairs. We realise that there are pressures on the
legal aid budget, which has increased from &#163;1.5 billion 10 years
ago to more than &#163;2 billion, and we understand why the
Government are now bringing in means-testing in magistrates courts and
the fixed-fee system for many civil cases. Although we have some
legitimate discussions and arguments with the Government about how that
is being implemented, we accept the thrust of what they are doing.
However, in respect of tribunals, I should imagine that it would be
appropriate for legal aid to be awarded only in a very small number of
cases.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07031612000387"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2
pm</div>
					<a name="07031612000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">A lot of the
time lawyers are not wanted in tribunals. We want people to take their
case to tribunal and feel that they are performing and presenting their
arguments in an informal and relaxed manner, and that they can put
their case without any pressure or undue sense of the occasion getting
on top of them or stifling their free expression and explanation of the
problem. I submit that lawyers often come along and make the matter a
whole lot worse. They can give the client a lot of ideas, stand up and
make boring speeches on points of law, whereas what we want is for the
public to go to those tribunals and feel that they can have their cases
heard sympathetically and understandingly by tribunal chairs who can
emphasise with the
public.</div>
					<a name="07031612000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would have
thought that, in the vast majority of cases, there would be no need for
the provision of such legal aid. However, there are going to be
tribunals&#151;I certainly came across a few during my time at the
Bar&#151;in which there are points of laws and complexities. There
may even be situations in which a particular case suddenly becomes
multi-faceted and unanticipated factors suddenly come into
play.</div>
					<a name="07031612000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">In those
circumstances, it might be in the applicant&#146;s interests to seek
legal advice. For example, there might be a fairly straightforward case
in the Employment Appeal Tribunal, or one of the other tribunals such
as the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal, where the case is proceeding
quite smoothly and it all looks straightforward, but complexities then
arise. At that stage, will the applicant be denied the ability to deal
with the matter on a roughly level playing field?</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 47</div>
					<a name="07031612000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">I submit that there will be
cases in which respondents might be a corporate entity or a Department.
One has only to look at those families in various cases involving the
Ministry of Defence. In one case, the MOD employed a host of lawyers
and QCs. I am thinking not about a coroner case, but about a tribunal
case for injuries caused not in the front line, but during training. I
read that the Department in question had a battery of lawyers and the
case went from being quite straightforward to being complicated. Yet,
the family were unable to get legal aid.</div>
					<a name="07031612000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the tribunal rules allowed
for the grant of legal aid by the judge in the first-tier tribunal, it
would at least mean that the applicant had a much fairer deal and would
not have to suddenly abandon the case. The applicant might be
completely overwhelmed by paperwork, legal points and legal statutes
that they have absolutely no idea how to handle, however sympathetic
the tribunal judge or its non-legal members might be to
them.</div>
					<a name="07031612000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">Despite the
expertise and the background of the people involved, and however much
they might try&#151;the Minister has made a great deal of their
attitude and their desire to help the public and be as open, flexible
and user-friendly as possible&#151;things might become very difficult
if one starts getting bogged down in technical legal matters.
Precedents might need to be looked at and other tribunal decisions
might need to come into play. It might be that such factors are not
always something that the tribunal judge can help the applicant
with.</div>
					<a name="07031612000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why
legal aid might be appropriate in a small number of cases. In that
small minority of cases, building such flexibility into the system
would bring significant relief to the applicant. It would make the
system fairer and more just for a very small number of applicants and
cases. I do not believe for one moment that it would have a significant
impact on the legal aid budget. When we look at that budget in the
round&#151;I might now be told off by our shadow Chief Secretary for
making a spending commitment&#151;it is clear that we are talking
about a small sum of money. I am a great believer, as are my hon.
Friends, not only in getting the best value possible, but in using
public money to make a difference to some of the more oppressed and
vulnerable people in society.</div>
					<a name="07031612000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of hon. Members have
spoken about how tribunals are very often the only point of contact
that members of the public have with the judicial system. The chances
are that the tribunal system is the only interface that many of our
constituents will ever have with the judicial system, unless they
happen to end up in a magistrates court for some minor criminal
offence. People who go to tribunals are not criminals; they are
applicants&#151;people pursuing their case to try to secure justice
for themselves and their families.</div>
					<a name="07031612000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have given the Minister a
choice of two amendments, which I hope fits in with the spirit of the
Committee. Both amendments are by definition broad and flexible. In
fact, amendment No. 69 is more flexible than amendment No. 67. I hope
that the Minister will accept the amendments not only in the interests
of providing extra assistance and making the system more open and
flexible, as the new structure will do, but to ensure that no one is in
any way excluded from putting their case.</div>

							<a name="07031612000458"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> This is probably the most important amendment that
we have debated so far. It has the support of the Liberal Democrats,
the Conservatives and, I hope, some on the Labour Benches. Even hon.
Members who are not lawyers, as some of us are, will have come across
in their constituency work cases in which the decision of a tribunal
cites legal cases. That goes for both the oral and subsequent written
tribunal decisions. In tribunal hearings in which lawyers are
present&#151;the system is not set up on the presumption that lawyers
will normally be present&#151;there is often quite robust debate
about the application of cited cases, which could be judgments from the
House of Lords, the European Court, the Court of Appeal and so on.
Judgments from the Employment Appeal Tribunal or a higher court that
dealt with an employment appeal case might also be cited. It is
therefore sometimes necessary for people to have legal assistance to be
able to put their arguments.</div>
					<a name="07031612000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some people go to tribunals
literally on their own, with no support, and some go with family
support, friends or non-legal support from their local advice centre or
citizens advice bureau or whatever. Normally, people will go with no
lawyers accompanying them, which is as it should be. The best person to
judge whether people should have an entitlement or need to receive
legal aid is the person running the tribunal&#151;the judge figure
whom we have discussed. I have signed my name to amendment No. 67,
would give such discretion to the judge, and amendment No. 69 would
have the same effect.</div>
					<a name="07031612000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister said that there
are provisions for Ministers to grant legal aid exceptionally, but that
is an exemptive decision. The Opposition are arguing that in the
interests of justice it is necessary, and would be better, for the
granting of legal aid sometimes to be a judicial decision. Such
decisions could be made on the spot, with the judge having assessed the
nature of the case and rated a person&#151;the lay
applicant&#151;and their ability to put their case against a
representative of the Department for Work and Pensions or whoever is on
the other side. There is often an official on the opposing side of a
tribunal who is fully versed in the legislation and regulations, and
who carries a double ring binder file. The tribunal itself will have
ring binder files, as will the clerks, and they will contain
information on the law, not only matters of fact.</div>
					<a name="07031612000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are strong arguments for
the amendments, and it is clear to us that a system of fair access to
justice must ensure that people are not disadvantaged. It is good that
we are to have a new, streamlined, expanded tribunal system. However,
if this area of administrative law is to be separate from the court
system, the possibility of people getting legal aid should not be less
than in the elements of the legal system that consider matters of
criminal, civil and other areas of administrative
law.</div>
					<a name="07031612000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the Minister
said, magistrates do not deal only with crime. They deal with
administrative and licensing matters, civilian disputes and family law,
in all of which there is an entitlement to legal aid. There is a strong
case in principle for such issues. The proposed approach would not be
an open door. We are not saying that we want legal aid as a matter of
right for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 49</div>
						tribunal cases, but arguing that it should be the
norm that the judge on the case has the power to make such a
judgment.</div>
					<a name="07031612000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Yes,
there is a financial implication, but justice always has financial
implications. I hope that the Minister will not resist the amendment on
the basis that it would have an unhelpful or harmful financial
implication. There have been debates elsewhere on legal aid and its
budget. I accept that it is larger than in some places and that it has
grown. However, it has not grown in the same way as much of the welfare
state has grown. It has grown less, and there is a strong case for
justice being done with legal aid when the judge thinks that that is
right. I hope that the hon. and learned Lady will be sympathetic to the
amendment. It is certainly something that we want to
pursue.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031612000459"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> I shall deal first with the latter two points made
by the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey. It is not the
case that the legal aid budget in the United Kingdom is larger than in
some places. It is larger by a very significant factor than anywhere
else in the world. I shall leave it there, having made that important
point.</div>
					<a name="07031612000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
sympathise enormously with the passion with which the hon. Gentleman
and the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk assert the right for
fairness in access to justice. It is a passion that I share and which
the Government accept entirely. It is a bit of an oddity that the hon.
Member for North-West Norfolk has sought to introduce such a provision
when an identical amendment was defeated resoundingly in the other
place, because the Tories did not vote for it. However, that does not
alter the merit in its being discussed
today.</div>
					<a name="07031612000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
reiterate the points made during the debate in the House of Lords. The
tribunal system is intended and designed so that people should not, as
a rule, need lawyers to pursue their points. As we have said in a
different context today, tribunals are not courts. Unlike courts, most
tribunals do not rely on the strict rules of evidence. They adopt a
much more inquisitorial approach, questioning the user to find out the
relevant information rather than expecting him to put his case or
present an argument. Granted the high level of skills that we have
acknowledged in tribunal chairs, the majority of tribunal users should
be able to, and can with experience, relay their evidence by answering
questions without the need for legal
representation.</div>
					<a name="07031612000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
those who qualify within the legal aid system anyway, legal help is
available across the whole gamut to give advice and assist the users to
prepare their cases and answers to questions that might be asked. Legal
advice can be obtained about points of law and help can be received to
pay for counsels&#146; advice. That does not present a problem. Aid
is readily available in that fashion and it can pay for everything up
to its limit to prepare a person for a tribunal, short of their
actually being
represented.</div>
					<a name="07031612000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Both
hon. Gentlemen argued strongly that we do not want lawyers to be in
tribunals as a matter of course. The right hon. Member for
Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith), the Chairman of the Select
Committee on Constitutional Affairs, said the same on Second Reading:
we do not want representation in tribunals as a matter of course. I am
glad that both Opposition spokesmen understand and share that
view.</div>

					<a name="07031612000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must ensure
that people have enough information as users, so that they understand
that they can get advice if they need it and understand what they need
to do to ensure that they put their best foot forward. We will work on
that.</div>
					<a name="07031612000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">We acknowledge
that legal aid for representation has a role in some tribunals. It is
not available in the Lands Tribunal now, but it is available in the
Asylum and Immigration Tribunal, the Employment Appeals Tribunal, the
Mental Health Review Tribunal and in cases of special difficulty in all
tribunals. If a case falls within the provision that I have mentioned
already&#151;section 6(8)(b) of the Access to Justice Act
1999&#151;legal aid can be granted exceptionally for representation.
That will apply in a minority of cases, because in most circumstances
tribunal users should not need representation for a just outcome. None
the less, legal aid is available in exceptional circumstances, as we
have already
discussed.</div>
					<a name="07031612000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
imagine that, if a case suddenly became more complex than anybody could
have predicted, one of two things would happen: either the inquisitor
judge would adjourn so that legal help could be obtained&#151;along
with counsel&#146;s advice or whatever were necessary to ensure that
the legal points that emerged were advanced in a proper fashion in the
applicant&#146;s interests&#151;or he would write, as many coroners
do, in support of an application for exceptional circumstances, so that
a Minister could consider granting legal aid. With those two fall-back
positions available, the situation is not immensely
troubling.</div>
					
					<a name="07031612000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031612000460"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> I hope that the Minister accepts that both
situations happen as a matter of practice
sometimes.</div>
					
					<a name="07031612000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031612000462"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> Both would require a delay, as the case would have
to be interrupted and the application would have to be considered, then
accepted or rejected. If a judge is able, at the beginning of a case or
at any stage, to assess whether a case would need legal aid, to make
the decision then and implement it would be much quicker for the
tribunal and much quicker and more certain for the individual in terms
of the remedy. It is the judge who can assess that. Experienced judges
will be able to make such assessments on the
spot.</div>
					
					<a name="07031612000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031612000463"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman slightly contradicts himself. If
it is obvious to the judge at the beginning that a case is complex, an
adjournment in the middle, with a consequent delay, will not be
necessary, because he can make it clear that legal aid should be made
available and he can either suggest that the applicant seeks legal help
or he can support an application for exceptional circumstances. Given
the experience and calibre of tribunal judges, it would be a rare case
that suddenly multiplied out of all recognition into a complex legal
issue, thereby meriting an application in the middle of it. However, if
that were so, everybody&#146;s view would surely be that it was
essential that the person had the opportunity to be represented. In
such an extremely rare case, it would undoubtedly be the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 51</div>norm for the inquisitor judge to adjourn and support an application for
full legal aid or advise the applicant to get legal help. We would like
to do more. I think that I said that clearly on Second
Reading.</div>
					<a name="07031612000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like the
hon. Member for North-West Norfolk, I do not want to stray into the
generality of legal aid reform at present, but it is well known that we
intend to put lawyers on to fixed fees for standard cases, starting
very soon this year, with only exceptional cases being paid for by the
hour thereafter. That should make the legal aid budget become more
predictable, which would strengthen our arm in respect of having
resources available to be moved
over.</div>
					<a name="07031612000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be our
intention, as I have said time and again&#151;and I have no
difficulty saying it once more&#151;that such resources should move
over into the welfare sector, with which the tribunals basically deal.
Whether representation in tribunals is the right place to put those
resources or whether they are put elsewhere would be a matter for
discussion at that point. I hope that Opposition Members will accept
that there is an adequacy of provision within the present system and
that when resources are made available by the reforms that we are
currently implementing, the intention is to put them into this sector.
I hope that the hon. Members will withdraw their amendment, which was,
as I have already said, resoundingly defeated in the House of Lords and
I fear will suffer the same fate in
Committee.</div>
					
					<a name="07031612000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031612000464"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> Has the Minister the figures&#151;either numbers
or costs&#151;that tell us how many cases under the present regime
are given legal aid through the exercise of ministerial discretion?
What sort of number is it for the past
year?</div>
					
					<a name="07031612000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031612000465"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> I cannot help with that. I know that I get one or
two cases a fortnight to determine. They are mostly coroners&#146;
inquisitions with the occasional tribunal case. I do not know whether
that is a fair representation, but we will look into it and give the
information to the hon. Gentleman if we
can.</div>
					
					<a name="07031612000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031612000466"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I was being generous and trying not to
divide the Opposition by not reminding the hon. Member for North-West
Norfolk that his party did not support the proposal in the other place.
However, I am glad that such enlightenment has come its way as the Bill
has moved down the Corridor. That is always to be welcomed. Progressive
conservatism often moves more quickly now than it did in the
past.</div>
					<a name="07031612000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am very clear
that this is right as a matter of principle and is something that we
should pursue. I heard what the Minister said on Second Reading and
accept her intention that this is an area of law in which practice will
feature and in which the Government hope there will be more resources
to assist with legal aid and advice as appropriate. I want to make one
comment on the practicality of the arrangements, which the Minister
cited as her explanation why we do not need the system at the moment.
If an issue was spotted on the papers by the judge at the very
beginning of a case, then it would require the hearing to stop and
start and be adjourned and start again. It 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 52</div>may even put back the date when a case is dealt with. When the papers
arrive at the tribunal in the normal way and an issue is spotted, there
will be a delay, even if it is not the interruption that we are talking
about. If a legal case arises during the hearing, then that is
interruption and delay.</div>
					<a name="07031612000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">In any event, it seems that
that process is one that takes away the discretion that judges could
properly have&#151;through hearing the argument and seeing the nature
of the applicant&#151;to determine a case. On paper, an applicant may
appear to be competent and able to represent themselves. However, they
may not be well; they may be mentally, physically or emotionally ill.
There are all sorts of circumstances that are not intrinsic to the
case, but may become evident. The person may become distressed. They
may have a poor attention span, not be very intelligent and not able to
understand things. It seems to me that those are the sorts of reasons
where the discretion should be given to the tribunal there and then. I
am very keen that we pursue the matter and I hope that the hon.
Gentleman will agree with
me.</div>
					
					<a name="07031612000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031612000467"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> It might be wise to rehearse the basis on which
exceptional funding is given because it will cover most of what the
hon. Gentleman is worried about. It is given, first, if there is a
significant wider public interest that the user be
represented&#151;that is rather aside from what he is
saying&#151;and, secondly, if the case is of overwhelming importance
to the user or if a lack of representation would lead to obvious
unfairness in the proceedings. Those two provisions are likely to cover
all the situations which would produce injustice if they were not
covered, as the hon. Gentleman has set out. Thirdly, it is given if it
would also be practically impossible for the user to bring or defend
the proceedings without representation. I think that he will find that
there is already provision for exactly what he is worrying about,
although not in the hands of a judge, but in the hands of the
executive.</div>
					
					<a name="07031612000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031612000468"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> I understand that. I have in mind a case involving
an allegation of unfair dismissal that I have been dealing with and
which I chose as the subject of an Adjournment debate on behalf of a
constituent. The case was clearly a matter of significance to the
individual, who had been summarily dismissed from the job that he had
been held for 25 years. The Minister is right that there are
exceptions, but as she rightly said, they are not granted at the
instigation of a judge. It seems that that is a good place for them to
be.</div>
					<a name="07031612000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">One could start
with the same set of criteria. Obviously, some cases are much more
likely to get ministerial certification, where a judge spots that it is
of prospective national interest, in that it will determine what the
law will be in future and will have wide-ranging implications, and
deals with a controversial issue. Such cases are likely to get through
the system but, from the perspective of the individual, cases in which
people lose their jobs or something happens that significantly affects
their finances might be another category.</div>
					<a name="07031612000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not arguing about whether
the criteria are more or less correct; I am arguing that the judge
should have the opportunity that has been outlined. That is not a
million miles away from what the Minister would like 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 53</div>to happen in future. Here is the legislation that gives us the
opportunity for that to happen. I hope that we have persuaded the
Committee that it should happen
now.</div>
					
					<a name="07031612000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031612000469"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:
						</b> If one considers the high-cost and highly
complex cases that receive legal aid, costing the legal aid budget
millions of pounds, it becomes clear that we are talking about a small
crumb in the trouser turn-ups of one or two High Court judges. It is a
small amount of money, but it would help a number of
people.</div>
					<a name="07031612000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
three points that I should like to raise with the Minister. She
mentioned the changes in the legal aid budget and the reforms that the
Government are introducing, the bulk of which we support. We can see
exactly where the Minister is coming from and we can see the need for
reform. If the reforms lead to significant savings, could Ministers
redeploy the legal aid in other directions&#151;including to
tribunals, for example&#151;simply by ministerial edict or would that
require a statutory instrument? Doing that would certainly not require
primary legislation, but would it require an order in the House? Could
Ministers simply take such redeployments on board? If so, we would feel
that we could push them on the issue.</div>
					<a name="07031612000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 67, to which the
hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey has added his name,
would not exactly put a huge amount of extra pressure on the legal aid
budget. We are talking about flexibility and the final decision being
in the hands of the tribunal judge. The first-tier tribunal judge would
make the decisions and the rules would allow legal aid to be granted in
rare
circumstances.</div>
					<a name="07031612000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister mentioned the rule on exceptional cases that enables the
tribunal chair to adjourn proceedings and recommend that legal aid be
granted. I would have thought that there would be an inevitable delay,
but she has not yet told the Committee what sort of delay there would
be. I take on board her point that if it becomes apparent before the
tribunal has started, or even on the first day, that exceptional
circumstances apply, it might make sense for the tribunal to be
adjourned and for a decision to be made on legal aid. However, if the
tribunal is adjourned halfway through because of the complexities that
the hon. Gentleman mentioned, how long would it take to get the legal
aid set up? I imagine that that would take at least three to four
weeks, in which time there would be a great deal of added uncertainty,
stress and worry.</div>
					<a name="07031612000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
want to make the tribunals as user-friendly as possible, but there will
always be stress and strain on the applicant. The amendment is modest
and does not ask for a great deal. Its public expenditure implications
are absolutely minimal. As I said, we are talking about a small
fraction of what is spent from the legal aid budget on the
high-complexity cases. We Conservatives would certainly want to
consider the issue in the context of our ideas for reorganising legal
aid. It would be a minor step forward.</div>
					<a name="07031612000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Minister answer those
points? If she does not do so in a way that we find satisfactory, we
may have to push the issue to a
Division.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031612000470"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is right in saying that primary
legislation would not be required to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 54</div>change the legal aid rules. The Lord Chancellor has a power to change
legal aid&#151;presumably the funding code. Legal aid is covered by a
funding code, so that could be done by the Lord Chancellor&#146;s
direction.</div>
					<a name="07031612000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">I pause to
thank the hon. Gentleman very warmly for saying that his party supports
the bulk of the legal aid reforms that we are implementing. I am most
grateful for that; his support is extremely
welcome.</div>
					<a name="07031612000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the budget
levels out and comes under control under the impact of the changes, we
will need a review of how best and earliest to start using that other
money in the welfare benefit sector. That is how we should consider the
use of that money; representation for certain tribunals in certain
circumstances might well be one way forward. However, there may be
other priorities to roll out first. To a large extent, that is why the
amendment is not
acceptable.</div>
					<a name="07031612000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
extremely rare situation conjured up by the hon. Gentleman, the judge
would have looked at his case file and considered how he would deal
with the tribunal hearing. He would do that well ahead of time. Perhaps
he would require information to be ready for it; perhaps, in writing or
some other way, a sort of informal pre-trial review would have to be
held to tee up the way forward. Such things all happen. If, having done
all that, he had failed to see that there was a complexity, we would be
in the territory conjured up by the hon. Gentleman. However, when I set
out the process, he can see that it is pretty unlikely that that would
happen, save once in what used to be called a blue moon.</div>
					<a name="07031612000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">If what the hon. Gentleman
envisages did happen, one of two things might occur. First, the
tribunal chair&#151;soon to be called a judge&#151;might adjourn so
that the individual can get legal help. The judge might think that the
person needs not representation, but advice on a particular point of
law. That adjournment would enable the individual to go to a supplier
of legal services&#151;a citizens advice bureau, legal centre or
solicitor&#151;that would already be available and empowered to grant
legal help, subject to a simple means test, which is done quickly. If
legal help were needed, that could be obtained
quickly.</div>
					<a name="07031612000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the
tribunal chair might think that actual representation is necessary.
That would require an adjournment while some communication&#151;a
letter or note from the judge or applicant&#151;was sent to the Legal
Services Commission, which would have to recommend that the exceptional
circumstances power be used by Ministers. As soon as it had considered
the issue and made the recommendation, the issue would come before
Ministers. Such applications are often urgent. There need be no very
significant delay, although I agree that it would be much better if
such a situation were avoided. In 99 per cent. of cases, I am sure that
it would be.</div>
					<a name="07031612000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope
that I have satisfied Opposition Members that there is adequate
provision and an intention to look again when our now well supported
legal aid reforms come to the fore. I hope that I can persuade the hon.
Member for North-West Norfolk to seek leave to withdraw the amendment,
which was abandoned by his party in the
Lords.</div>

							<a name="07031612000487"></a>Mr.
Newmark:
						</b> I shall try to be reasonably brief, because I
appreciate that we have more to do. I have always felt that one of the
benefits of coming into the House is that we can learn from each other.
One thing that I have learned from the hon. Member for Wolverhampton,
South-West (Rob Marris), who I am sorry to see is not a member of the
Committee, is to look at the explanatory notes, which I have done in
detail as the debate has gone on. Paragraph 124 on page 21 states that
the purpose of the &#147;overriding objective&#148; stated in
clause 22(4) is</div>
					<a name="07031612000357"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
ensure that the Tribunal Procedural Committee observes certain
fundamental principles when exercising its powers to make procedural
rules, such as, securing that justice is done in proceedings before a
tribunal and that the tribunal system is accessible and
fair.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07031612000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">The explanatory
notes stop there, but subsection (4) goes on. Paragraphs (a) and (b)
run in parallel with the construction of the explanatory notes,
stating</div>
					<a name="07031612000358"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that, in
proceedings before the First-tier Tribunal and Upper Tribunal, justice
is done...that the tribunal system is accessible and
fair&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07031612000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, another
phrase is then tagged on,
saying</div>
					<a name="07031612000359"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that proceedings
before the First-tier Tribunal or Upper Tribunal are handled quickly
and
efficiently&#148;.</div>

(e) also uses the phrase</div>

					<a name="07031612000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">How
do we square the concept of &#147;quickly and efficiently&#148;
with being &#147;accessible and fair&#148; in seeing that justice
is done? The words &#147;quickly and efficiently&#148; suggest to
me that there is not due care and consideration. I am trying to
understand the language in the Bill. Perhaps it will happen later, when
we have the further consultation that the Minister has talked 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 56</div>about, but how can we have inherent in that provision some concept of
due care and consideration that fits in with the concept of something
happening quickly and efficiently?</div>

Baird:
						</b> The explanatory notes make it clear&#151;and they
are right&#151;that the important underlying principle is that the
laws should be put together so that justice is done and the tribunal
system is accessible and fair. It is a curious idea that if it can also
be quick and efficient there is somehow a clash between the two.
Justice delayed is well known to be justice denied, so we intend to
deliver the process as speedily as is compatible with our obligations
under the first two rules. To equate efficiency with not giving due
care to justice seems an over-urgently arrived at elision. The word
&#147;and&#148; and not &#147;or&#148; appears in all the
provisions, which will need to be compatible with one another. There is
no clash between them, and they are all very
desirable.</div>

ask her officials to check that that is the case? I sense&#151;I have
not made the comparison&#151;that this is quite a detailed
legislative provision and it could be weeded out a little. I would be

Members will have observed that under subsections (4) and (5), the

the approval of the Lord Chancellor. In subsection (6), however, there
is no such qualification. As I mentioned, in subsection (6)(a), the
senior president of tribunals is entitled to give directions on

					<a name="07031612000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">With great respect,
Mr. Bercow, you were not at this morning&#146;s sitting
when the Opposition made a number of references to the Lord Chancellor
and the Constitutional Reform Act 2005. With reference to the
appointment of judges, we felt that the Lord 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 57</div>
						Chancellor should not have any additional powers
because those were effectively taken away from him in that 2005
legislation. It is another matter, however, when it comes to practice
directions. We wonder why the scope of the senior president is being
cast more widely in this case. That depends, to some extent, on the
statutory intention behind the power to give directions
on</div>
					<a name="07031612000366"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the application or

within their sole compass.</div>
					<a name="07031612000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment is an amalgam of
a probing and a genuine one. Will the Minister explain carefully why
the clause is drafted in this way? I am concerned that the current
draft introduces a blurring at the edges regarding a practice direction
on the one hand, indicating a methodology for applying or interpreting
the law, and on the other hand, a danger of trespassing on the
substance of the application or
interpretation.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031612000491"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> I want to make two brief points. I am also
slightly mystified by the inclusion of such a provision. If there are
to be practice directions about the application and interpretation of
the law, which are pretty important directions, logically they should
have the authority of the Lord Chancellor rather than not. Given that
the others do, it seems that we are taking out a group of practice
directions that are just as important. They are not about internal
workings, but about how the law should be interpreted. I am surprised
about that, but the Minister might enlighten us and we may discover
something that we did not spot. Subsection (6)(b) does not trouble me
nearly as
much.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07031612000390"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45
pm</div>
					<a name="07031612000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important
that people have access to the rules governing tribunals. When people
are seeking out planning law, they have to go down the waterfall of
decisions from regulations under the law that have been made nationally
to planning guidance that is set regionally and locally. They then
might know what is likely to happen to their application for their
extension. Where, at present, do people find consolidated up-to-date
practice directions? Can the Minister give an undertaking that, under
the new regime, there will be a place where politicians and anyone in
the country can see, in electronic form on a website or, more
importantly, in a paper-based form at their local library, the current
extant practice directions set out in chronological and numerical order
and in a way that is comprehensible and easy to understand? Such
directions are often important bits of the system and they should be
made clear for the lay person as well as
practitioners.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031612000492"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> I shall now deal with the substantive points of
clause 23 and return to the question of ensuring that the practice
directions are available. The point of directions in clause 23(1),
which cannot be made without the approval of the Lord Chancellor, is
that they are about practice and procedure respectively in the first
tier and in the upper tier. It is appropriate that the Lord Chancellor
should sanction them because they could have resource implications, for

<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 58</div>
						instance, if the practice and procedure became to
hold a pre-trial review of the sort that I have conjured up. It is
important that the Secretary of State, who is responsible for the
budget of the Department, has a say in that sort of practice
direction.</div>
					<a name="07031612000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">Surely the
opposite is the case&#151;this is the point of subsection
(6)&#151;on directions or guidance about the application or
interpretation of the law, let alone the making of decisions by members
of either tribunal. It is there that the Constitutional Reform Act
2005, which removed the Lord Chancellor as head of the judiciary, has
its bite. It is slightly surprising that the hon. Member for North-West
Norfolk, who has so far been championing its bite, now seems to have
gone into reverse.</div>
					<a name="07031612000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
a Minister, it would be inappropriate for the Lord Chancellor to be
involved at all in the making of practice directions about the
interpretation of the law, as that should be carried out by a tribunal
chair, or the making of decisions by tribunal members. Those matters
should rest firmly and clearly with the judiciary and, in this case,
with the senior president of tribunals. Otherwise, there will be a
danger of fouling the independence of the
judiciary.</div>
					<a name="07031612000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can tell
the hon. Members for North-West Norfolk and for North Southwark and
Bermondsey that, as far as I can see, the formulation in this part of
the Bill follows literally word for word the Lord Chief
Justice&#146;s direction-making power under schedule 2 of the
Constitutional Reform Act 2005. It requires the Lord Chief Justice only
to give directions, along the lines of clause 23(1) in the Bill, with
the Lord Chancellor&#146;s consent, but it excludes the need for the
Lord Chancellor&#146;s consent when he is making directions for the
application or interpretation of the law or the making of judicial
decisions. Both hon. Gentlemen were clearly satisfied by that wording
in the earlier statute, and I invite them to accept the same
here.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031612000493"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> I might have missed one thing, and perhaps I
should have asked a question about it when we discussed clause 2. I
take the Minister&#146;s point about the independence of the
judiciary; I was probably misrepresenting where the accountability
should be. Under the new system, will anyone in the hierarchy be senior
to the senior president of tribunals? Is the senior president not in
some way subject to the Lord Chief Justice as a more superior judge in
England and Wales? If that is the case, the Minister is implicitly
right that the Lord Chancellor should not, for the reasons she gave, be
the person holding the clearance on the interpretation of the law for
practice directions, and it should be the Lord Chief Justice. Perhaps
she will elucidate the matter. I had assumed&#151;I could be
completely wrong&#151;that if one looked at the judicial hierarchy
after the implementation of the Bill, one would still see the Lord
Chief Justice at the top and the president of the family division and
other people with specific responsibilities, including the senior
president of tribunals, under him. Perhaps she will tell me whether
that is correct.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07031612000494"></a>Vera
Baird:
						</b> No, the senior president of tribunals is not
accountable to the Lord Chief Justice. The senior president is separate
and independent, and also, therefore, not accountable to the other
chief justices whose jurisdictions his post will cover.</div>

					<a name="07031612000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I was asked
about publicity for practice directions. The practice directions will
be published on the web. There will be a tribunals
website&#151;indeed, I believe that there already is a Tribunals
Service website&#151;on which practice directions will be published.
Many tribunals publish practice directions on the web, such as those
relating to the special commissioners or civil procedure. The
commissioning policies of individual libraries will determine whether
they make hard copies available. We will look at the matter with every
intention of ensuring that people going unaccompanied to tribunals have
all the information that they need to fight a fair fight, as it

Hughes:
						</b> I have one question on the clause, which I
otherwise support. In some parts of the country, including my own
borough, there are well established, well used and respected mediation
services that deal with many of the issues that are covered by
tribunals. Do the Government envisage that either in the legislation or
subsequently, the mediation service provided by the Tribunals Service
as described in the Bill, will include, incorporate or link with well
established, recognised and respected mediation services? I understand
that the first step in the process might involve a mediator inviting
opposing parties to talk to one another before going to tribunal. If
Ministers or officials have not thought about that before, will they do
so now?</div>
					<a name="07031612000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is some
very good mediation practice out there. I was talking to my hon. Friend
the Member for Cardiff, Central, who said that as far as she knows
there is no such service in the middle of Cardiff. The mediation
service in Southwark is by repute one of the most long standing and
best regarded. Rather than creating new bodies, we ought to be folding
in existing provision for mediation. I would like there to be a link
between the tribunal and a mediation service. That way, a tribunal
could tell someone that it would like them first to talk to the
mediation service, which could subsequently report back when it had
done what it could. In such a situation, the mediation service would be
linked to and recognised by the tribunal.</div>

							<a name="07031612000497"></a>
								Vera
Baird:
						</b> The provisions in clause 24 are enabling
provisions, so they can embrace any kind of mediation. Most
immediately, the Government have in mind mediation by tribunal members
and staff, which seems to be a wise way forward, but there is
absolutely nothing to prevent the involvement of community mediators
such as the those to which the hon. Gentleman referred. I know of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 60</div>
						one such very good scheme in Wandsworth. The county
court in Manchester had an excellent scheme that is now being rolled
out in other areas and which might be included.</div>
					<a name="07031612000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">Essentially, mediation is
fairly high on our agenda. Clause 24 was added in the House of Lords by
the Opposition, not because we did not want mediation, but because we
did not think it necessary to include a clause to enable it. That is
exactly what it does; it will enable mediation and we will encourage it
in whatever form is best for the

will have been contacted by organisations such as the CBI and the
Institute of Directors, which are concerned about vexatious claims
being brought, particularly in employment tribunals. The vast majority
of cases are totally genuine, but some will be vexatious. Does the
clause enable the tribunal to award costs against the applicant if the
judge decides that the case was, in all circumstances, vexatious,
unreasonable and without any proper
merit?</div>
					<a name="07031612000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, I
should like to ask a question that is appropriate at this stage,
because we are talking about costs and expenses, albeit in the context
of applicants to the tribunal. The Minister will have seen the note
from the Association of Clerks to the General Commissioners of Taxes
for Great Britain. The role of the clerk will disappear and these
clerks will effectively be made redundant, because the tribunals will
be brought into the new Tribunals Service. There is concern that there
may not be proper provision for compensation for loss of office. I see
you nodding, Mr. Bercow. I hope that I am in order on this
matter. This is simply a query for the Minister to consider. Under the
changes to the rights of coroners, part-time coroners will be getting
compensation when they are made redundant. Why is there no provision
for these clerks in the Bill? Has the Minister got something up her
sleeve to ensure that they will, at some stage, receive proper

be a source of concern for the CBI, for instance, that lawyers should

						My
understanding is that clerks to the commissioners, for instance, are
office holders, not employees, so they would not fall within any
redundancy cover. There is the issue of the draft Coroners Bill, which
would not abolish the existing system, but terminate existing
coroners&#146; appointments. It would not abolish the role, so there
is no statutory provision for compensation in that case; there would be
no redundancies, in the sense that the role would not stop existing.
Provisions in the Coroners Bill provide a mechanism to pay
compensation, although no commitment has been made on the level of
compensation or the underlying principles that might be used to
establish that amount.</div>

The duty that subsection (3) places on the Lord Chancellor is identical
to that which he has in respect of the courts. The provisions mirror
section 1 of the Courts Act 2003. One would expect the format of the
report and the procedures that follow it to be exactly the same. Those
procedures have proved acceptable under the 2003 Act, which holds great

						</b> I should like to ask a question about clerks to
the General Commissioners of Taxes. I have received a letter from the
treasurer and secretary of the Association of Clerks to the General
Commissioners of Taxes, which other members of the Committee might also
have received. It
said:</div>
					<a name="07031612000372"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
General Commissioners of Income Tax are a Tribunal which deals with
appeals and other matters concerning income and corporation tax. We
have been operating since 1797 and our role has evolved to keep pace
with the changes in our taxation
system.</div>
					<a name="07031612000373"></a><div class="hs_brev">Our panels are
made up of lay members assisted by a suitably qualified Clerk who
attends to the correspondence before and after the hearing, arranges
for the hearing itself and advises the tribunal on matters of law. We
also deal with appeals against their decisions when this
happens.</div>
					<a name="07031612000374"></a><div class="hs_brev">Under the
Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Bill our existence disappears and the
tribunal becomes absorbed in the new Tribunals Service. The role of the
Clerk disappears completely. There are currently 244, mostly part time,
Clerks throughout the UK many of them are retired lawyers, Inspectors
of Taxes or businessmen. We are employed by the General Commissioners
but paid by the Department for Constitutional
Affairs.</div>
					<a name="07031612000375"></a><div class="hs_brev">In the new
Bill there is absolutely no provision for compensation for loss of
office. We are trying to negotiate for some compensation but, as things
stand, there is no provision at all for us to even negotiate...It
is natural justice that some form of compensation for loss of office is
made when a job disappears and the current legislation (The Clerks to
General Commissioners (Compensation) Regulations, 1973) provides for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column63" />Column number: 63</div>that, when Divisions are merged or boundaries are altered, thereby
making a Clerk redundant. Clearly it was thought appropriate then to
compensate a clerk for losing his Division. It follows that this should
apply when all Divisions are merged into one, as it were, and all
Clerks become
redundant.</div>
					<a name="07031612000376"></a><div class="hs_brev">If you
require any further information, please do not hesitate to ask.
However, we notice that the Committee stage of the Bill is scheduled to
conclude not later than 27 March. We have no time to
lose.</div>

a short postscript, hon. Members may have had occasion to be grateful
to the clerks to the commissioners of Revenue when they have been
summoned to appear before the commissioners to deal with their tax
affairs in this place. It would be invidious of me to ask whether you
had been, Mr. Bercow, and I would not expect you to reply,
but I certainly have and I know that other colleagues have, too. The
Revenue has always been particularly attentive, and its staff and the
clerks to the commissioners have in my experience always been helpful.
Twice during my life I have had to avail myself of their services.
Susan Balchin has made a good case on behalf of herself and her
colleagues. I should be grateful if the Minister could answer her
concerns. There are 244 people with an interest. I hope the Government
are minded to be helpful to them. If those people lose their jobs, I
hope that the Government will also be minded to ensure that they are
treated fairly, in the same way that others in similar positions have
been
treated.</div>

running drive promoted by Members from all parties to ensure that
courts remain local in all our communities&#151;in your county,
Mr. Bercow, in Norfolk, in Wales and in rural and urban
areas. What is the plan to ensure that the Tribunals Service, under the
new arrangements, is geographically accessible to people in each of the
counties of England and Wales and to ensure that that is done in a way
that minimises costs for attendance, travel and inconvenience? We are
talking about an administrative legal service, and it is not much good
if it takes a long time to get to, is a long way away and costs a lot
to travel to. I want to be reassured about the plan for the
geographical arrangements for the service throughout England and
Wales.</div>

						</b> It is intended that there should be a tribunal
location in every significant centre. It is clearly not practical to
have them in very small areas, when they have such diverse
jurisdiction. I hear what the hon. Gentleman says about courts being
closed, but other community courts are being opened in different
localities. I imagine we will see the use of technology increasing in
tribunals hereafter. Clearly, people might not be able to travel to a
centre, for example when disability is an issue. It seems inevitable
that there should be video provision. When we refer to the senior
president having a duty to consider innovative ways to ensure that the
tribunal functions, that is what he is likely to consider. That is the
plan at the moment. I suspect that there is likely to be some sharing
between the Courts Service and the Tribunals Service, but the intention
is to have an installation in every major
centre.</div>

that facilities are shared intelligently&#151;an example could be
found in Somerset, where hon. Friends have argued that the magistrates
court needs to be retained and where there would be an opportunity to
have the magistrates and county courts and the Tribunals Service in one
place&#151;but that innovative arrangements are made for both
tribunals and other offices that the public need to access to use those
services. I hope that the Minister will consult on and be responsive to
that, and that as the plans are drawn up they will be consulted on, not
least with parliamentary colleagues across the United Kingdom, so that
they can be as user-friendly and helpful as possible.</div>

Hughes:
						</b> I want to put it on the record that although there
was some controversy on Second Reading and elsewhere, I am very
positive about the
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column67" />Column number: 67</div>proposals in this part of the Bill. It is right that there should be
wider eligibility, which this part of the Bill and particularly this
clause provide. I welcome that, as I welcome the Government&#146;s
intention of widening by gender and ethnicity the pool of people from
which the judiciary is drawn. I am grateful to the Minister for giving
me the latest information that I asked for this morning.</div>
					<a name="07031612000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to share one amusing
thought with the Committee. There are some helpful tables that set out,
for example, the gender balance among the judiciary. I think we all
know that in March 2004, there were 11 male Lords of Appeal in Ordinary
and one female Lord of Appeal in Ordinary&#151;Lady Justice Hale was
the first woman law lord. However, it is amusing to discover that three
of them are of unknown ethnicity. It 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column68" />Column number: 68</div>seems to me that when people reach that level of seniority, they should
be asked about their ethnicity or it should be noted. I know they do
not have to fill in forms, which is understandable, but it does no harm
to know about ethnicity in the higher reaches of the judiciary. As it
happens, they are all white, but the day may come soon when they are
not all
white.</div>
