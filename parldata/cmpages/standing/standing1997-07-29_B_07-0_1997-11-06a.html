<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Waterson (Eastbourne):</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. Is the Minister now in a position to redeem his promise to let use see at least some of the draft regulations that it is proposed to make under the Bill? That matter has been debated more than once during the Committee's proceedings and the Minister gave a clear pledge. What progress has been made?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not strictly a point of order for the Chair, but if the Minister wishes to respond, he may do so.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security </B>(Mr. Keith Bradley): Good morning, Mr. Gale. For the sake of good relations in the Committee I am happy to make a brief contribution on that point. I assured the Committee that when regulations were available, the Committee would be able to scrutinise them. Clearly, as the hon. Gentleman has not received any such documents, they are not yet available, but I assure him that when they are ready, they will be made available.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Burns </B>(West Chelmsford): Further to that point of order, Mr. Gale.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have been generous in allowing a contribution that was not strictly a point of order, and a response. Unless the hon. Gentleman has a separate point, I am not minded to take any further points of order.
<H4><center>Schedule 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Decisions against which no appeal lies</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): I beg to move amendment No. 165, in page 51, leave out lines 14 to 16.
<P>
Before I speak to the amendment, and to further good relations in the Committee, I was surprised and grateful to receive a call yesterday evening from the Minister's private secretary relating to a point that I had made about a constituent's Christmas bonus. I thought that that was a generous and thoughtful gesture and I said that I hoped that the point would be resolved. By sheer coincidence, I discovered when I received this morning's mail that my constituent's situation has been remedied, which gives me considerable faith that we were not remiss in withdrawing the relevant amendments. I am grateful to the Minister for his consideration and also for that further reassurance.
<P>
This is a probing amendment. We understood from the notes on clauses that the apparently obscure statement in paragraph 4 of the schedule is meant to relate to cases in which it is not evident which person is entitled to child benefit; for example, a case in which two or more individuals might be the entitled person. We found that perplexing--but not necessarily objectionable--because we could not determine the circumstances in which such a query might arise, except in cases where there is doubt about the guardianship of the child or where there has been marital break-up.
<P>
As all members of the Committee must have experienced in their constituency work, grave doubts arise in such cases and the situation can become extraordinarily complex and sometimes litigious. We could not understand why it should be thought sensible to prevent an appeal in circumstances in which the claimants themselves may have doubts and hesitations about who deserves the child benefit and, presumably, therefore, officials--or even, dare I say, computers--might get confused in the absence of clarity about who is the mother of the child and is entitled to the benefit.
<P>
The amendment seeks to obtain some clarification and assurance on that point, which I hope that the Minister will be able to give us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Steve Webb </B>(Northavon): Good morning, Mr. Gale. I should like to reinforce the comments of the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) regarding the Opposition's concerns about the lack of scope for appeal on this issue. When I first became aware of the problem, I thought that it was obscure, that it did not arise very often and that it involved only &#163;10 a week. The Child Poverty Action Group has, however, told us that many things are contingent on who gets the child benefit, particularly in the case of a sole child. One example is entitlement to family credit, which could involve &#163;70 a week, rather than merely a tenner. The amount of money involved is a further reason for there to be leave to appeal and is why we support the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> The amendment would remove decisions on priority of title to child benefit from the list of decisions that are not appealable. That would introduce a right of appeal on such discretionary decisions.
<P>
It may help the Committee if I explain briefly the circumstances under which decisions are currently made on the priority of persons who are entitled to child benefit. As the hon. Member for West Dorset recognised, where a couple separate but continue to share care of a child or children, only one of the couple is entitled to child benefit for any one child. Those involved can agree between themselves which one will be entitled to payment but, in the absence of any agreement, the Secretary of State uses her discretion to make the decision. In practice, the decisions are made on behalf of the Secretary of State by officials at the child benefit centre. In reaching their decisions, those officials take into account the overall balance of caring and other responsibilities--for example, contributions in cash or kind that are made towards the child's upkeep. Where several children are involved and responsibilities are fairly evenly shared, child benefit may be paid for each child to one or the other parent. The Bill is not introducing a change in that area. There is currently no right of appeal against a decision on priority of title to child benefit.
<P>
The Secretary of State can, of course, reconsider any of her decisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Will the Minister clarify whether, under the current arrangements, problems have arisen vis-a-vis the Child Support Agency? Many hon. Members will have had--as I have had--considerable experience of disputes about the amount of care given by one parent or the other. Under circumstances in which the CSA often takes large sums from the father for maintenance, the situation could become especially vexed. It would help members of the Committee if the Minister could reassure us that, even under those circumstances, the interaction between the Department and the CSA will not cause trouble.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The hon. Gentleman has raised an important point. The introduction of the CSA has sharpened the focus on such matters, but it has not caused increased problems in terms of the way in which they are resolved.
<P>
It may help the hon. Gentleman to know that there are around 2,500 such cases each year. Because of the nature of the decision, one party will almost invariably be disappointed and about 2,000 go on to be reconsidered in the way that I have suggested. Introducing a right of appeal against those decisions would serve customers no better in terms of the speed of the case or the way in which it is decided. These are often difficult matters, which need sensitive handling; pushing them to an appeal would reinforce difficulties that would be better resolved by discussion in the discretionary way that we are considering. Usually, such cases are resolved by reconsideration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight (Arundel and South Downs):</B> Am I not correct in believing that the Secretary of State can take the decision to which the Minister referred only when parents fail to elect who is entitled to benefit? The problem is that parents can, in a practical sense, elect unwisely. There is no power to sort the problem out, which can involve enormous expense, particularly in cases where children spend time with both parents.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> When a decision is taken about who is entitled, the circumstances of the case are considered. The hon. Gentleman says that parents may elect unwisely. Officers would look carefully at caring responsibilities and shared care and come to a judgment, which is the best way to handle the matter--it has not caused a considerable problem in the past. Introducing a right of appeal might add to the problems. I hope that, in that context, the hon. Member for West Dorset will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for those clarifications. While there may be continuing problems in such delicate circumstances, we must accept that a flexible review procedure is more likely to succeed than a formal appeal procedure when, as the Minister assures us, it is well co-ordinated with the CSA and other bodies, and when individuals rather than systems and machines engage in the review. I take the Minister's point that there could be cases in which a formal appeal would exacerbate an already difficult situation, so, with good conscience, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 93, in page 51, leave out lines 17 to 21.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendment No. 96.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The amendment is purely a drafting change which moves a provision relating to appeals against penalties applied to national insurance contributions from schedule 2 to schedule 3. It sits more sensibly in schedule 3 part II with the other contributions provisions rather than in schedule 2, which deals with benefits. There is no change of effect. I hope that, following that explanation, the amendment can be accepted.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 166, in page 51, line 38, at end insert--
<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 170 in schedule 3, page 52, leave out lines 19 to 22.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> The amendment is probing. I should like to apologise to the Committee because, after looking at it again last night, I fear that we have suffered a pitfall of opposition--we do not have a civil service behind us. [Hon. Members: ``Ah.''] I am grateful for the Committee's sympathy. I am beginning to understand what Labour Members had to put up with over the past 18 years.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. David Rendel </B>(Newbury): The past 50 years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Indeed, and I suspect the next 50 years as well.
<P>
On a more serious note, I apologise, because if the amendment was redrafted we would place it at line 41, as paragraph 9A, rather than at line 38, as paragraph 8A. The purpose of the schedule is to define those areas where no appeal against a decision will be allowed. Paragraph 9 consists of an all-embracing, wrap-up sentence about
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Such other decisions as may be prescribed''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
at a later date which will be exempt from the appeal process.
<P>
The purpose of this inadequately drafted but eminently sensible amendment is to strengthen the Government's hand, which the Minister will find appealing, so that there can be no doubt that, as in those areas specified in paragraphs 1 to 8, there cannot be an appeal on benefits which may be paid, in certain circumstances, to a third party. An example is benefit paid to a pensioner who may be too frail or ill to collect the old age pension at the local post office, so a designated third party has been empowered to collect it. It is also conceivable, though I accept that this will not happen often, that a person in receipt of a benefit may be abroad when it is being paid and a third party may be designated to collect the money on behalf of that indiviudal. Despite the drafting of the amendment, I hope that the Minister will view it as an important and sensible way of dealing with any potential confusions or loopholes that would undermine the schedule's purpose.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> The effect of the amendments, taken together would be to remove existing appeal rights from decisions on payments to third parties. At present, most decisions to make payments to third parties--or to refuse to make them--carry a right of appeal. The amendments would take away the right of appeal against such decisions. There are sound reasons for allowing rights of appeal against decisions on payments to third parties. Where a deduction is made from claimant's benefit, they should have a right to challenge the decision if they think that it is incorrect.
<P>
I recognise the helpful nature of the contribution by the hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns)--in that he acknowledged that his amendment should apply to a different part of the schedule--but I hope that in the light of my explanation he will accept that the schedule already covers what he is trying to achieve. The amendments are therefore unnecessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am grateful to the Minister, but I would like further clarification. A potential loophole will be created. In certain circumstances, third parties could be designated recipients or collectors of benefit; there may already be no right of appeal with respect to that benefit but, in accordance with the schedule, the third party could then have a right of appeal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I am sorry if I did not make myself clear. I did say ``some'' decisions. I was trying to tell the hon. Gentleman that the examples he cited would not be included in cases suitable for appeals. Payments to third parties when the person entitled to benefit is mentally incompetent are covered, but the examples that the hon. Gentleman cited could not be appealed against.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Will the Minister provide the Committee with some examples of payments that would be appealable?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> One example would arise where a payment is made to a utility--a direct deduction for water or gas--and the person believes that the amount deducted was unreasonable. In those circumstances, an appeal could be made against payments to third parties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am grateful to the Minister, and in that light I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 44, in page 51, leave out lines 39 and 40.
<P>
I have a slight feeling that we have been here before. Paragraph 9 of schedule 2 allows the Secretary of State to include anything in the list of cases on which no appeal may be allowed. That is a tad wide. We have debated whether a happy medium would be to allow the Department flexibility but also to require any regulations falling under the schedule to be subject to an affirmative resolution by both Houses. I am sympathetic to that approach, which is also embodied in amendment No. 167, but the Government have previously rejected it.
<P>
We are therefore faced with a stark choice. The Government will not allow the safeguard of an affirmative resolution by both Houses, so we must either give them the opportunity to make any regulations they like, or remove this provision. We are not happy for the Bill to contain such sweeping powers. We may trust the Secretary of State or we may not, but we certainly cannot be sure that we will trust a future Secretary of State. The amendment would therefore remove the provision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am delighted to have the chance to support my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb). He is right to point out that the schedule places enormous trust in the Secretary of State. While we might accept that the current Secretary of State has the best possible intentions, Labour Members should rememeber that, despite the huge majority of the current Government, Governments change. Unfortunately, it is not certain that the next Government will be Liberal Democrat so we cannot guarantee the party of the next Secretary of State, or to what extent he or she will choose to use the powers being laid down in paragraph 9.
<P>
We should recognise the fact that were the Government to run into trouble--as they might, either in this or in a future term, were they to be re-elected--it is possible that some right-wing extremist party could enjoy a revival. I am not necessarily saying that the Conservative party will become a right-wing extremist party, but a split-off or some other group could gradually come to power. We must ensure that we remove from the Bill a schedule that would allow a Government with rather less good will than the current Government may have, to take advantage of it in a way that the current Government certainly would not want. I feel confident in saying that the Minister and the Government would not want to see a Portillo-ite Government take advantage of the provision, for example.
<P>
The Government should be sensible and think ahead. They should not assume that they will remain in power for ever, because they will not; nor should they assume that their successors will share their way of thinking. They should consider the possibilities that will inevitably arise in the future, and be rather more cautious than to allow that wide power to remain in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> When we debated clause 13, I asked what items were not covered by schedules 2 or 3--I think we can be certain that there are such items. The Minister's response was, in essence, that paragraph 9 of schedule 2 was the practical answer to that, in that it gave the Government the power to decide.
<P>
Party political nonsenses are not important, but such a power is too wide. If members of the Committee are to do their duty and examine the Bill, we ought to know what items have not been specified as appealable or not appealable, and the Minister ought to detail the matters on which the Secretary of State may take future decisions. At the moment, there is a complete void. If we are not to legislate for regulations that require the approval of the House, we ought at least to know how the Minister is thinking of using the power. A list would be ideal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> Unfortunately, despite the warm words for the Government from Liberal Democrat Members, I cannot accept the amendment. It would prevent any other decisions being added by regulation to the list of decisions.
<P>
It may be helpful if I start by explaining what the schedule does. It sets out the list of substantive decisions which currently have no right of appeal. This is not a complete list; some other decisions will be covered in regulations. None of the decisions in schedule 2, nor those to be added by regulations, has appeal rights now, nor do we intend that they should have in the future. A great many of them are administrative or of such an automatic nature that a right of appeal would not be appropriate. They would just clog up the system. Examples might be decisions on which pay day has been allocated for benefit purposes or the method of payment that is applied to a particular customer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> The Minister is obviously speaking with great authority on what is to be in the regulations. Why has he not provided us with draft regulations, given that he clearly knows what they will contain?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> When one is trying to be helpful to members of the Committee by giving them the flavour of what the regulations might contain, Conservative Members are not satisfied, and try to push the matter to a degree of certainty that is unreasonable at this stage. I assure the Committee that when we have that information and I am able to give it to the Committee, I shall do so immediately, as I did just a few moments ago. I should have thought that Conservative Members would have welcomed the open way in which we are debating these provisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns Rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I will not give way. Opposition Members have expressed their views about the regulations ad nauseam, and I do not think that we should waste the time of the Committee further.
<P>
I should like to make it clear that it is not our intention to use this regulation-making power to remove current appeal rights. However, we must also take account of future changes to the social security benefits or contributions system which may introduce new decisions that should not have a right of appeal. I hope that now he has heard that explanation, the hon. Member for Northavon will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I am not sure whether the Minister's remarks contained any reassurance at all. He has told us of his own intentions with regard to these powers, but of course that does not bind anyone in the future. He has outlined some of the matters that might be covered in regulations, but we would like to see them.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Burns:</B> The Minister has said on numerous occasions that he will be helpful and let us know what will be in the regulations. Although we do not doubt his sincerity, does the hon. Member for Northavon agree that it would be more helpful to members of the Committee if the Government gave us such information in advance of our debates on the areas covered by regulations rather than during the debate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Just like you did.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) for that observation. Although he was heckled from a sedentary position by the Minister, the same argument does not apply to the Liberal Democrats. So it is not unreasonable of us, whatever previous practice might have been, to expect more detail than we have been given. I have a good deal of sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The hon. Member for Northavon is obviously in a witty mood this morning. On a more serious note, would he agree that the current reassurances that the Minister claims to have been giving are particularly unreassuring because the area between schedules 2 and 3--which I referred to in our previous sitting as a platonic limbo between decisions against which an appeal lies and those against which there is no appeal--is so very wide? Does he also agree that we would take a great deal more comfort from the Minister's request for flexibility in regulation making if schedules 2 and 3 had been expanded to the point where it became clear that such flexibility applied only to future circumstances, not at present foreseeable, regarding the use of these wide powers?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is sometimes helpful to the Committee to allow slightly lengthy interventions instead of long speeches, as that speeds up debate. However, interventions are interventions, so will hon. Members please try and keep them brief?
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I have a good deal of sympathy with the point made by the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin)--that a more comprehensive schedule 2 and schedule 3 would leave less room for doubt.
<P>
We do not, however, even have that; we have only this rather sweeping power.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
All Opposition Members would be reassured if the Government had given ground and acknowledged that any of those powers had to be subject to a positive resolution of both Houses. The Government have not given ground; we are therefore not reassured. The entire Bill has about it the odour of smoke-filled rooms. Given that lack of reassurance, we should like to pursue the amendment to a vote.

</FONT>Question accordingly negatived.
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule, as amended, be the Second schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I should like to return to an important point that I raised in the debate on clause 13. The schedule sets out decisions against which no appeal can be made. There have already been cases in which the different instrument of judicial review in the High Court has been used when rights of appeal have been otherwise blocked. Is the Minister considering proposals to reinforce the intent of the schedule by eliminating the right of appeal through judicial reviews? Otherwise, a coach and horses could be driven through the schedule.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> There is absolutely no intention to limit the right of appeal through judicial review.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I should like to point out that the drafting of paragraph 9 of schedule 2 and paragraph 10 of schedule 3 continues the trend of establishing a precedent in administrative law for wide powers of regulation, and for defining in regulation areas that are not covered by statute. That development runs contrary to the conception of regulation that seems to the Opposition more proper: regulation used to amplify or expand powers that have already been well defined in primary legislation.
<P>
Opposition Members believe that the use of regulation to cover contingencies left explicitly vague in primary legislation is especially obnoxious under circumstances in which regulation is not governed by the affirmative resolution procedure. There is no merit in the debating-point retort that the previous Conservative Administration were guilty in that respect. It is better to see the light late than not to see it at all. As I have repeatedly observed to the Committee, many Conservative Members pointed out that development with increasing alarm. The trend has been observable in English legislation since the war; it began with the Attlee Administration--for which the Minister presumably does not have the same disdain that he exhibits towards the Administration of the past 18 years, and of which he was not a member due to the deficiencies of age. The Bill creates a new set of precedents by strengthening that tendency to a degree that has not been observable elsewhere.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman's thesis is interesting, but it would help the Committee if he could relate it to the question that schedule 2 should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am grateful for that admonition. Schedule 2, and especially paragraph 9, extends that trend. We have considered no other clauses or paragraphs that are quite so beautifully wide--although we have seen many that are of considerable width--as the crystalline seven words:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Such other decisions as may be prescribed.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> Positively epigrammatic.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Indeed. It is positively epigrammatic, as the hon. Gentleman said from a sedentary position. I fear that that epigram will have many knock-on effects in subsequent legislation. For that reason, Conservative Members want to register their anxiety about that tendency. We would prefer that the schedule had been drafted differently, to make clearer, in the primary legislation, which cases would be prevented from going to appeal. We shall make similar points in relation to schedule 3, although I hope to be able to do so at shorter length because I have already made such points about schedule 2.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's statement that he and the Opposition would not wish to continue down the route that was followed by the previous Administration during the past 18 years. Should there ever be a day--and that is doubtful--when the Tory party returns to government, we shall read such words with interest, as a Conservative Government pursue their legislative programme without recourse to regulatory powers, and with everything included in primary legislation. We look forward to that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Would the Minister accept that, agreeable as these pleasantries are, I was careful to distinguish between two cases for the use of regulation: the first, which is perfectly proper, is to expand pieces of primary legislation and to give specific powers under general powers; the second uses regulation to create a whole new realm that is not specified in primary legislation, and is left vague in that legislation.

<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> The arguments behind the amendments are similar, and that is why I suggested that they should be taken together. I am glad that you have agreed to that, Mr. Gale.
<P>
We might not have needed to consider amendment No. 176 today, if--as I observed on Tuesday evening--the Government had accepted amendment No. 175. Unfortunately, they were unwilling to do so.
<P>
Amendment No. 176 seeks to ensure that appeals will be possible against the Secretary of State's decision either to suspend or to terminate payment, in the first case because of pending appeals, and in the second case because of failure to provide information or to submit to a medical examination. The suspension or termination of payment by the Secretary of State because of pending appeals makes the argument for the amendment similar to that for amendment No. 177 in some respects.
<P>
Amendment No. 177 seeks to add a further two cases in which there would be a right of appeal. First, it would allow appeals to be made against a decision by the Secretary of State not to take a decision where another relevant appeal was pending. Secondly, in paragraph (9B), an appeal would be allowed against a decision by the Secretary of State to call in a decision to be taken by an appeal tribunal or commissioner, where the grounds for the calling-in were that a relevant appeal was pending in another case.
<P>
Where relevant appeals pending is the reason for termination, suspension or calling-in, the Secretary of State's grounds would be that a relevant appeal would affect, in some way, the case being heard. The problem is that the Secretary of State might have misunderstood the grounds of the original case, so the case currently under appeal might not be genuinely relevant to the case being brought. If applicants cannot appeal, they will not even be allowed to argue that the Secretary of State has been mistaken in deciding what was at issue in their case. That seems rather unfair, and it could leave applicants in limbo for entirely irrelevant reasons. They might have to wait for their case to be heard, their payment might be suspended--even if it has been decided in their favour--or payment could be terminated. I hope that the Government will allow these further cases to be included, so that applicants have a right of appeal to argue that the case pending does not have the relevance to their own case that the Secretary of State believes it to have.
<P>
Amendment No. 176 deals with the failure to provide information and the failure to submit to a medical examination, as well as dealing with the issue of pending appeals. In this respect, the argument lying behind it is rather different, and does not apply to amendment No. 177. There might be very good reasons for the failure to provide information or to submit to a medical examination. It is possible that the information had been provided, and that the Secretary of State had either not realised or not accepted that it had been provided. We have all heard of cases in which files are lost, and in which information goes astray for a number of reasons. If applicants know that the information has been provided, and they are being prevented from receiving benefit because the Secretary of State believes that the information has not been provided, it seems unfair that the applicant is not able to make that point in an appeal. Family emergencies or delays in an over-bureaucratic part of the system could also prevent applicants from being able to pass on the necessary information sufficiently quickly to the officials who require it. Many things that are not the fault of applicants could make them unable to provide information quickly enough. It is therefore wrong that applicants cannot appeal against a decision that information has not been provided in the way requested.
<P>
Similar arguments apply to people who do not submit to medical examination in the expected period. Such people may have done their best to fulfil the requirement, but it is possible for doctors to be ill or unavailable on the relevant day. Some people have disabilities: that disability could worsen suddenly, making keeping an appointment difficult. Other emergencies could occur, or a bureaucratic slip-up could mean that people are not sent the necessary information.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
All those are examples of how the errors of people other than the applicant can cause requirements under the Bill not to be complied with. My list is not exhaustive, and all hon. Members can think of other examples. The crucial point is that, for various reasons and through no fault of their own, applicants may not be able to fulfil all the conditions laid down.
<P>
It is therefore only right and fair that applicants should have the right of appeal against termination or suspension of benefit. Applicants should not be left without benefits, possibly for some time, if they can show that it was not their fault that claims did not proceed in a timely manner.
<P>
Termination or suspension of benefit may have serious consequences for people. Not all cases involve fraudulent attempts to claim benefit: some people desperately need the money, and suspension or termination of benefit could leave them in real poverty.
<P>
It should be possible to establish a system that allows appeals to be dealt with quickly and expeditiously. Applicants who are not to blame for whatever might have gone wrong with an application could then get the benefit to which they are entitled.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I have just been handed a letter that I wrote to the Law Society about the point. I will quote the appropriate part of that letter:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I can assure you that the intention behind clause 22(2)(d) of the Bill is that it will only apply to genuine lookalike cases. In other words, where a specific point of law arises on a lead case, the question of suspending payment of benefit will only arise in secondary cases where that same point of law arises. This will be set out more clearly in regulations.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
	This will be made explicit in the guidance given to officers within the Benefits Agency which we shall publish. In cases of doubt, officers will have recourse to expert and legal advice within the Department. Specific guidance will also be issued containing information relating to the express point of law identified in the lead case.''
<P>
What constitutes a genuine lookalike case will be readily apparent from the guidance. Experience has shown that defining lookalike cases has not proved difficult in the past: if customers are unhappy they will be able to go back to the agency to explain why they do not agree that the lookalike case applies to them. The matter can be examined again at that time if the condition that there must be a genuine point of law, about which I have given the Committee an assurance, has not been applied.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am a little happier as the Minister has now said that there will be an unofficial form of appeal; at least an applicant will be able to explain to the agency why he does not think that the appeal case is relevant to the suspension of his benefit. However, the Minister appears to be relying on his officials to take the right decision and be sensible about whether the two cases are relevant to each other.
<P>
Is not the reason for an appeal system the fact that sometimes officials get it wrong? I do not see why in this case we have to rely purely on the good sense and good will of officials to spot a lookalike case: there seems to be a strong case for an appeal as well. I am partly satisfied, after hearing the extract from the Minister's letter, that there is some hope of at least an unofficial appeal. However, I hope that he will give the matter further thought. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 94, in page 52, leave out lines 34 to 36.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 194 to 198.
<P>
<B>Mr Bradley:</B> These are technical amendments which clarify the way in which the Bill's provisions will apply to the recovery of benefit scheme. I do not think that it is necessary to go into the detail--
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Oh, the hon. Gentleman wishes the detail to be put on record. I am happy to do that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> It is not simply to put it on record, as the Minister rather disparagingly said; members of the Committee are genuinely interested in knowing the details.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Amendment No. 94 removes from schedule 3 any unnecessary reference to the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act 1997. This is because the right of appeal is provided for in the 1997 Act.
<P>
Amendment No. 194 is the most substantial, and has a number of effects. It replaces the current requirement for grounds for review with a wider regulation-making power on the same lines as that in clause 10(1)--within a prescribed period or in prescribed cases or circumstances. The power to prescribe the period of review will put beyond doubt the fact that a benefit recovery question cannot be reviewed once the compensation claim has been settled and the time for appeal has elapsed. This must be in the interest of both the injured and the compensators, all of whom will be able to regard the matter as settled. Subsection (2) is a technical amendment to section 10(2) of the 1997 Act, which permits the Secretary of State to revoke a certificate, or recover a benefit, if it is determined on review that one should not have been issued.
<P>
Subsection (2) also amends section 11 of the 1997 Act to expand the grounds on which an appeal can be made against a certificate of recoverable benefits. This is so as to include a situation in which it is contended that benefits have been included that have not been, or are not likely to be, paid during the relevant period, or when a certificate has been issued in respect of a compensation payment which does not fall within the provisions of the Act. It also clarifies the fact that, where a compensator has failed to apply for a certificate of recoverable benefits, and the Secretary of State issues one under her powers in section 7 of that Act, the compensator has a right of appeal.
<P>
Subsection (2) also replaces subsection (5) of clause 11 to remove unnecessary regulation-making powers relating to the manner and time within which appeals may be made and as to procedure. Those are covered in clause 13, which we have already debated. However, it retains the current provision to allow the Secretary of State to treat an appeal as a request for a review. This will enable the Secretary of State to review a certificate of recoverable benefits when it is clear that the issues raised in an appeal can be cleared without the need for an appeal hearing. Finally, the amendment removes a provision about treating an appeal as a review, which is no longer needed, as grounds for a review are no longer set out in the Act.
<P>
Amendment No. 195 amends section 12 of the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act so that appeals against certificates of recoverable benefits are heard by the new appeal tribunals. It also requires the Secretary of State to revoke a certificate, where appropriate, in accordance with an appeal tribunal's decision.
<P>
Amendment No. 196 is consequential on amendment No. 194. It clarifies the fact that a compensator who has not applied for a certificate of recoverable benefits, but who has nevertheless been issued with one by the Secretary of State under section 7 of the 1997 Act, has a right of appeal against that certificate. This amendment extends that right to an appeal from a tribunal to a Commissioner.
<P>
Amendment No. 197 is a purely technical amendment which corrects a paragraph reference from ``11'' to ``12'' in schedule 6, paragraph 118. Finally, amendment No. 198 removes paragraph 119, which has been included in error, from schedule 6. I apologise to the Committee for the error. Clause 19, relating to matters arising as respects decisions and appeals, covers the regulations needed for recovery of benefits. Paragraph 119 is therefore not needed.
<P>
I commend the amendments to the Committee.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 178, in page 52, line 36, at end add--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Interim payments. (9A) A decision made under regulations made under section 5(1)(r) of the Administration Act not to award a payment on account of a relevant benefit as there defined.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am afraid that my remarks will not be as legally precise as those which have just gone before. The amendment would introduce an additional or explicit category of decisions against which an appeal could be entered. The amendment refers to a decision whether to pay interim payments while a decision about benefit is being decided, especially when that decision has been delayed for some reason.
<P>
A typical case would be a claim for income support when there is a delay in deciding the claim--for example, the claimant has filled in the wrong form or filled in the form incorrectly, or his circumstances cannot be decided immediately. Income support is the safety net benefit, and without income support an individual could become destitute. Interim payments therefore play an important part in preventing that from happening. An individual who has been refused a discretionary interim payment should have the right to appeal--first, about whether the circumstances in which in interim payment could be made have arisen, if it is suggested that they have not. Secondly, a person should be able to appeal against the exercise of discretion when it is clear that he or she could have been entitled to an interim payment but discretion was used to turn the claim down. Potentially, that could leave someone destitute and without a right of appeal, which is unsatisfactory. That is the reason for the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I listened with interest to the explanation advanced by the hon. Member for Northavon of the reasoning behind the amendment. I understand that he has a logical case, but I have a problem with the amendment, and I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would elaborate on it and give us greater clarification.
<P>
I understand from the hon. Gentleman's remarks that an interim payment should be possible pending a decision in certain discretionary awards. What would happen, and what would be the implications of the amendment, if an interim payment were made to someone prior to a final decision, and the decision eventually went against the individual who had already received an interim payment? Would that individual, who would probably have spent the money that he had received, then be expected to return it to the DSS or the Treasury, or would it be written off? If the latter, have any cost implications to the Treasury been calculated? What is the scale of the potential problem?
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his questions about clarification. We are referring to an existing situation; we are not introducing a new provision for interim payments to be made. I understand that if the subsequent decision should be that income support is not granted, there are existing provisions for recovery. Although I am not an authority on the details, I believe that there are such provisions. I do not believe that the payments are made in the first place unless it is expected that the claimant will be successful, so I do not think that the recovery is activated very frequently.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his last comment, which slightly puzzles me. How can anyone be confident of anticipating a decision?
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> My understanding of the rules is that an interim payment is made when, for example, the wrong form has been filled in and the claim cannot be processed correctly, but the information that has been put on the wrong form shows that when the right form is filled in the claim will be successful. That is a fairly simple example. In anticipation of the outcome, interim payments are made in such circumstances at present. The Minister may want to give specific examples, as he knows more about the matter than I do.
<P>
I stress to the hon. Gentleman that I am not introducing a new provision for interim payments, simply saying that when they are turned down, we want a right of appeal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I hope that if I explain the background to interim payments and their purpose, it will become self-evident why they have never been appealable, and why it is not appropriate to extend appeal rights now.
<P>
There has always been a need for a mechanism to sidestep the normal administrative purposes when circumstances demand it. For example, a woman may turn up late on a Friday afternoon with a crying baby; her partner has left them, she has no money and urgently need some for the weekend, until the benefits office, where the matter can be properly dealt with, opens on Monday morning.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am interested in what the Minister says because I understood from an earlier debate on the matter that officers at the benefits agency would be working until early Friday evening to reach a decision before they went home.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> We are considering emergency circumstances. The amendment is about interim payments. I can explain why appeal rights are not needed; in practice only a minority of cases will be involved.
<P>
I shall give another example which may help the hon. Member for Northavon. Let us suppose that the computer breaks down; the staff are working but they cannot pay out the money. In such circumstances we need to ensure that money can be paid even though the necessary details cannot be processed, or are not available. Therefore the arrangement must be in place.
<P>
The provisions allow an interim payment of a reasonable sum to be paid until the situation can be rectified. Decisions on whether an interim payment is appropriate are necessarily discretionary. They belong in the arena of quick judgments and common sense. The system of administering benefits is principally one of detailed and precise rules on entitlement, but it is necessary to retain a degree of flexibility to deal with situations that might cause hardship when normal administrative processes do not pertain.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman talked about the income support case. There would clearly be a right of appeal against the decision on entitlement to income support. In this case, however, we are dealing with the need for immediate decisions, made because of hardship, that fall outside normal procedures. It would, therefore, be totally impractical and unnecessary to have an appeal against such decisions. Clearly, if the entitlement is denied after the emergency has arisen, the right of appeal will flow through in the usual way.
<P>
After that explanation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation and reassurance. I have some residual concerns that the person who makes the decision might, for example, display racial or some other sort of prejudice and turn someone down for an interim payment. That person would then be left in limbo, with no money or redress. I appreciate, however, that we need flexibility at this stage of the decision-making process and that to allow an appeal against a situation that may last for only a few days may be over-elaborate. Although I have some concerns, therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 179, in page 52, line 36, at end add--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Miscellaneous decisions. (9A) Any decision made under regulations made under section 5 of the Administration Act which relate to a claim for, or the payability of, a relevant benefit.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 179 contains a slightly more general list, to be included in schedule 3, of items against which an appeal can be made. For example, one of the crucial issues in the Bill is the date on which a valid claim is made. The Bill contains requirements for minimum evidence standards, and the date of claim has become more crucial than it has ever been before--at least, the ability to treat a claim as having been made earlier rather than later has become more important. A decision could be made and a person could be told, ``No, you may have filled in the form on 1 November, but we will not treat you as having made the claim until the middle of December because you did not get the form in.'' That could affect his living standard over that period and substantial sums could be involved. There should therefore be a right of appeal against such decisions.
<P>
Amendment No. 179 deals with a category of decision that should be appealable. We are not necessarily talking about emergency provisions; many weeks' benefit could depend on the date of a claim. Given the importance of such issues, there should be a right of appeal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> The amendment seeks to add to the list of appealable decisions a whole raft of decisions that are primarily about the administration of benefits.
<P>
Decisions are made on, for example, paydays and methods of payment, or relate to a change in rates of benefit as a result of an annual uprating exercise. None of those types of decision have appeal rights now, nor do we intend that they should have in the future. Such matters are generally regarded as administrative. A right of appeal on them would not be appropriate. Decisions to enable one person to act for another in relation to a claim to benefit, and decisions on the calculation of an amount of benefit so as to avoid a fractional amount, are examples of cases in which no right of appeal to a tribunal is appropriate.
<P>
Some of the decisions made under section 5 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 concern the decisions that arise when the Secretary of State seeks to suspend payment of benefit. We have already discussed those issues at length, and I shall not return to them.
<P>
The amendment could lead to a substantial increase in the number of appeals made. That would be detrimental to the speedy resolution of appeals; it would also be expensive, and would happen at the expense of a better service for customers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I hear what the Minister says about the raft of decisions against which it would not necessarily be desirable to have appeal rights. I did, however, raise the specific example of the date of the claim, which has become very important. Will he briefly deal with that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I assure the hon. Gentleman that there is a right of appeal on decisions to award benefit from a particular date. That is already dealt with in the Bill. In the light of that assurance, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that assurance, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 159, in page 54, leave out lines 1 to 3.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendment No. 160.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Amendment No. 159 is a technical amendment, which simply removes a superfluous reference from schedule 3 to decisions made under the Pension Schemes Act 1993. Amendment 160 simplifies the wording to be substituted for the existing section 170 of the Pension Schemes Act. While it still enables all the relevant provisions of the Bill to apply, it does so in a more clear and concise manner.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I suppose I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation, but I would be more grateful if he could explain more fully the technical detail regarding amendment No. 159 in the context of the Pension Schemes Act 1993. It is one thing to state that the amendments are technical but another to explain exactly why and in what sense.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I am happy to help. The amendment will ensure that the new arrangements for decision making and appeals will apply to the aspects of occupational pension regulation relating to contracting-out of the state earnings-related pension scheme. This is achieved through an amendment, contained in schedule 6, to section 170 of the Pension Schemes Act 1993. That makes the references in schedule 3 unnecessary.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 95, in page 54, line 6, after `7B(2)(e)', insert `or (i)'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendment No. 83.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Clauses 53 to 59, which the Committee will debate in due course, introduce the package of new financial penalties that we are proposing for national insurance contributions debts and other offences. What we have before us today are technical amendments to clause 54 and to paragraph 29 of schedule 3.
<P>
Amendment No. 83 provides that where a penalty is levied in respect of an unpaid contributions debt, the penalty itself should be subject to payment of interest as well as the debt on which it is imposed. Interest will run until the debt and penalty are paid.
<P>
That will ensure that the national insurance system mirrors the provisions in the Taxes Management Act 1970. The provisions of that Act mean that interest will be charged on any penalties levied in cases where contributions are collected through the PAYE scheme. The amendment would ensure equal treatment in cases where contributions are paid direct to the Contributions Agency.
<P>
Amendment No. 95 is consequential on that, and simply includes the imposition of interest in such cases to be included in the list of matters that can be appealed under the new appeals arrangements introduced by the Bill.
<P>
We shall deal with those matters later, but because the changes are the schedule, we must move these technical amendments now. With my assurance, I hope that the Committee will accept the amendments, and we can return to the substantive issues for debate later in our proceedings.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 219, in page 8, line 9, leave out `shall' and insert `may'.
<P>
Government amendment No. 65.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> Of all the amendments that we have tabled so far, this is the one that I most hope the Government will support because Government amendment No. 65 is in some ways very similar--
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> Better.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> It is very similar to amendments Nos. 218 and 219, but it does not cover the same cases. I am trying to help the Government to achieve their aim, which they have often made explicit, to speed up and simplify the appeal process. We share that aim but we have some doubts about the means, such as Government amendment No. 65, by which the Government are trying to achieve it. Amendments Nos. 218 and 219 would do little more than continue the principle of the Government amendment and apply it to a slightly different case.
<P>
Whereas Government amendment No. 65, which refers to clause 15, concerns cases dealt with by the commissioner, clause 14 concerns cases in which the person who will take the decision is specified in clause 15(10)(a), and who, of course, is not necessarily the commissioner. It therefore gives such a person powers that the Government are already offering to give to the commissioner.
<P>
On amendments Nos. 218 and 219--as I suspect the Minister is about to say in relation to Government amendment No. 65--the reason for changing ``shall'' to ``may'' is to ensure that cases proceed speedily when it is sensible for them to do so; otherwise, there is a danger that cases may be referred back to a tribunal rather than going to the commissioner when that would be more helpful.
<P>
I can think of two examples of such cases. First, it would seem silly to refer a highly technical matter back to a second tribunal, and perhaps wait six months for that tribunal to meet, when the case will probably need to be sent back to the commissioner anyway. It would be more sensible, if one could foresee that that was likely, to have discretion to send the case straight to the commissioner.
<P>
Secondly, there might be a test case in which there is clearly a need to make a final decision. We have just been discussing examples of people being held up because test cases are taking a long time. Because the Government were unable to accept our earlier amendments on appealing in such cases, it is particularly important that decisions in test cases should be made with the maximum speed. Again, to send a case back to a tribunal might hold up the process when everybody accepts that it will have to be sent to the commissioner at some point anyway.
<P>
As we have said when referring to earlier amendments, when a number of cases are dependent on a test case, there are difficulties relating to people having their benefits suspended while they are waiting for the test case to go through all the processes, which can take some considerable time.
<P>
Will the Minister tell us how often he thinks cases might be referred back to a tribunal? If the amendments are not made--and, indeed, perhaps if they are--it would be possible for cases to be returned to a tribunal several times. As far as we can tell, there is no limit on the number of times that a case could be referred back to a tribunal rather than going to the commissioner for a final decision. If we at least provide the option for a case to be taken straight to the commissioner, that might encourage final decisions to be made rather sooner.
<P>
There is a spirit of co-operation with the Government--few official Opposition Members are here and no doubt they would not want to oppose us--because of the way in which they tabled amendment No. 65. We want to extend that spirit to the cases covered by amendments No. 218 and 219.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I do not think that there is much between us--it is a question which amendment would speed up and simplify the process, which we are both trying to achieve. I would argue that our amendment is best and hope that Liberal Democrat Members will accept that when I have explained my reasoning.
<P>
Currently, even if it is patently clear to all the principal parties to an appeal that a tribunal has made an error of law, the only way to correct that mistake is to apply for leave to appeal to the commissioners. There are very limited exceptions to that rule. Many mistakes are procedural, for example failure by a tribunal properly to record the reasons for a decision.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Office of Social Security and Child Support Commissioners is clogged up with hundreds of cases each year which could be quickly and easily dealt with by a tribunal rehearing. In fact, almost half of all appeals to commissioners concern procedural errors by tribunals. It can take up to a year for a commissioner's decision to be given, the outcome of which is often to return the case to a tribunal for rehearing. There is a huge waste of time and resources involved in putting matters right. Appellants would be better served if that effort were spent on consideration of cases which raise an issue of substance, and in dealing with them more quickly. We would all support that view.
<P>
The intention of the clause is that tribunal chairmen should not have discretion in those cases. It requires them to set aside tribunal decisions in specific instances where there is, or where the principal parties agree that there is, an error of law and to refer cases back to appeal tribunals for redetermination. That would speed up the resolution of such cases by tribunals and reduce the number of unnecessary cases proceeding to the commissioners.
<P>
Government amendment No. 65 will give commissioners the discretion to return cases to tribunals for determination or to determine the cases themselves where the decision is wrong in law. I should point out, however, that we will be returning to the issue when we discuss new clause 6, with which the amendment is closely tied.
<P>
New clause 6--this should help the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel)--will allow introduction at royal assent of the provisions in Clause 15(7) whereby an appeal against the tribunal's decision that is supported by the decision maker shall be returned by the commissioners to be redetermined by a tribunal. In other words, commissioners will have no discretion to act otherwise. That will have an immediate beneficial effect both for customers and the administration of commissioners' appeals by reducing the backlog. Government amendment No. 65, which will come into force with the main provisions of the Bill, will, however, give discretion to the commissioners on the return of such cases.
<P>
The clause will reduce the backlog of cases at the commissioner stage of the appeal process. That will lead to a quicker and more efficient appeals service where decisions can be made at the appropriate level. We are committed to improving the service to appellants by speeding up the resolution of appeals. Amendments Nos. 218 and 219 would build unnecessary delays into the system. Government amendment No. 65 and new clause 6 address the matter more effectively.
<P>
Following those assurances and because we can debate new clause 6 in due course, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will acknowledge that Government amendment No. 65 is the one that he really wanted to sign up to and withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am not sure why the Minister thought that his amendment dealt with the same cases as ours. I understood his argument about certain matters being taken to the commissioners. However, he did not entirely answer the point about whether the decision on where certain cases should go would be taken by the chairman of the first tribunal or an appointed person, and whether that person should have the right to decide whether a case was so important that it should go to the commissioners. The Minister's only argument against that seemed to be that it might mean inappropriate cases being sent forward to the commissioners, which would clog up their work load. In fact, if the chairman of the tribunal were forced always to send a case back to an appeal tribunal, that would mean fewer cases being sent to the commissioners.
<P>
I understand that we do not want cases going to the commissioners unnecessarily. As I said before, however, there is an argument for tribunal chairmen having the discretion to send critical cases--perhaps a test case on some technical matter which was bound to go to the commissioners eventually anyway--to the commissioners straight away. I am not sure whether the Minister answered that. If he did, will he clarify his answer? I do not know whether he can give a better explanation, but if he can, I should welcome it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I shall try to be helpful. If a customer loses at a tribunal, the law has been decided and the customer can appeal against it. In such situations, clearly the Department would not support the appeal, which would therefore have to go to a commissioner for a decision. Thus, there would be no discretion, because the matter would have to be resolved at commissioner level and not at tribunal level.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am still not sure whether that answers my question or how it affects the point that I was making. We are getting confused and I suspect that I will have to read the transcript of today's sitting to be clear on whether the Minister has answered my point. Although I am sure that we are trying to work in the same direction, I am not clear that we have come to the right conclusion. For the time being, I would be happy to withdraw the amendment, but if the Minister wants to give any further explanation, I should be grateful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying. We will be tabling new clause 6, which deals with this issue. If my remarks have not dealt with the situation that the hon. Gentleman has identified, I assure him that I will provide further clarification under new clause 6.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment made: No. 65, in page 9, line 22, leave out `shall' and insert `may'.--[Mr. Keith Bradley.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 220, in page 9, line 47, at end, insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (11A) The Lord Chancellor shall by regulations make provision for the expedition of an appeal where a Commissioner, whether on an application made by a person bringing it or on his own initiative, believes that the appeal raises a point of general importance or that expedition is otherwise in the interests of justice.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 15 deals with appeals from tribunals to commissioners. The purpose of the amendment is relatively straightforward. It would mean that where a case was due to come before a commissioner and either it raised an issue of general importance which would, for example, facilitate the processing of other benefit claims, or its delay would otherwise not be in the interests of justice, the Lord Chancellor should have the power to expedite that appeal and thus avoid the appellant having to wait three months, six months or whatever.
<P>
The Bill is about getting things done quickly and getting them right, so surely it is reasonable to give the Lord Chancellor the power to expedite cases where that would help in processing of other claims or was in the general interests of justice. The amendment is straightforward and accords with the spirit of the Bill. I therefore hope that the Minister will accept it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The Opposition support amendment No. 220, particularly in light of the fact that, in response to a point that my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) raised a few days ago, the Minister made it clear that it was the commissioner rather than the Secretary of State whose decisions constituted the basis of precedent. It is of the utmost importance that that precedent be established expeditiously, rather than waiting for months or years before the precedent is set and subsequent decisions are altered or reversed. In line with the spirit of the Bill as a whole, such expeditiousness should be the order of the day.
<P>
We see no reason why the Minister should object to this helpful amendment. There was one occasion when the hon. Gentleman agreed to change three words in a previous clause, and we hope that--almost uniquely in our experience--he will be willing to accpet this helpful and constructive amendment in the spirit in which it is intended.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I join my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) in saying that this is an attractive amendment. The whole ethos of the Bill is to expedite the decision-making process so that customers receive decisions quickly, with the minimal amount of disruption to their lives and personal circumstances. As the hon. Member for Northavon said, it is a reasonable amendment designed in a helpful way to improve the operation of the Bill when it becomes an Act. Given the cross-party support for the amendment, I hope that the Minister will feel able to accept this constructive proposal to improve the Bill and help achieve its objectives.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> All hon. Members will be pleased to hear that I entirely agree with the sentiments behind the amendment. Cases before the commissioners that raise points of genuine importance should be expedited. Likewise, I share Opposition Members' concerns that appellants to the commissioners often have to wait a very long time for a decision to be made.
<P>
Nevertheless, the amendment is not necessary to achieve those objectives. The commissioners already have complete discretion to expedite appeals and to shorten any of the existing time limits to achieve their objectives. We intend that they will continue to have complete discretion in the future. The powers for this are already laid down in S.I. 1987/214, regulation 27. I am sure that all members of the Committee have read it, and will recognise that the amendment merely repeats provisions already in regulations to achieve our common aim. That being so, I hope that the hon. Member for Northavon will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am relieved to hear that the Minister agrees with the hon. Member for Northavon and with other Opposition Members. The only flaw in the Minister's argument for not accepting the amendment is his point that the commissioners already have the discretion to take that course of action if they wish. The hon. Gentleman will appreciate that discretion means that there is a choice, whereas the strength of the amendment is that it would give the Lord Chancellor the power to make regulations--if there is any criticism of the amendment, it is that it does not provide for regulations using the affirmative resolution procedure--instructing the commissioners to take a course of action. What happens if a commissioner decides, from the best of motives, not to use that discretion? This is a loophole which will not help to expedite the process, because commissioners could use the discretion in a way that the Minister may not have anticipated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give me an example of a commissioner not wishing to expedite business in important cases?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I can see what the Minister is trying to do, and I will not fall into that trap. By definition, we cannot anticipate how discretionary powers will be used. Each decision will be taken by a commissioner on the case in question. It is therefore impossible to answer the Minister's question in any meaningful way, as I am sure he will understand. I fear that for one brief moment he slipped into Opposition mode. He is now in government, and, much as I would like to be, I will not be tempted by him. My point about discretion is valid.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Without wishing to suggest the slightest imperfection in the statement of my hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford, I think that he fell into error when he said that the one deficiency was the continuing discretion. There is a further deficiency, as the Minister explained when referring ironically to a statutory instrument, the existence of which I suspect only the greatest experts in the land would have realised. Indeed, the Minister may not have been aware of it until apprised by the experts--
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Scurrilous!
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> May I rephrase that? The Minister may or may not have been aware of it until apprised by the great experts whom the taxpayer employs on his behalf. In referring to a statutory instrument, I fear that the Minister gave the game away, because he made it clear that the discretion is--to our astonishment--encoded in a regulation and not in statute.
<P>
As we understand it, the intent of this admirable tidying amendment is to incorporate in a statute whose purpose is to make the administration of social security more effective, a statutory requirement that it be made more effective. I cannot see why the Minister should resist such a move: even if he regards the case as already dealt with by a regulation, it must be an improvement to deal with it in statute. The amendment is not long; its insertion will increase the bulk of the Bill by less than a quarter of 1 per cent.--
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Less than the Minister's amendments!
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Certainly less than many of the Minister's amendments. I cannot see why he should object to its inclusion unless he has an ulterior motive, which I doubt.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I am grateful for all the support that the amendment has received, and for the Minister's heartfelt welcome to the thinking behind it. I echo the words of the hon. Member for West Dorset that we would like the provision in the Bill, rather than merely in an obscure regulation. As the amendment is in the spirit of the Bill, we would like to pursue it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman join us in welcoming contributions from Labour Members other than the Minister, who may be fully aware of the statutory instrument, and cognisant of its force, to prove that it is not obscure?
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I am sure that there is a good deal of expertise of which we have not yet had the benefit. I hope that in the remaining stages of the Bill we might have some such interventions. I confirm that we should like to pursue the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 97, in page 54, line 41, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `--(1) The Lord Chancellor or, in Scotland, the Secretary of State may pay to any person who attends any proceedings under section 15 of this Act such travelling and other allowances as he may determine.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (2) In this paragraph the reference to travelling and other allowances include a reference to compensation for loss of remunerative time.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment ensures that people who attend oral hearings of appeals with social security commissioners will have their expenses paid by the Lord Chancellor's Department. It also provides that, after devolution, the Secretary of State for Scotland will be responsible for those payments in Scotland.
<P>
The amendment is technical. It has always been the practice to pay such expenses: we are simply ensuring that the appropriate statutory basis exists in the future. It is entirely right that people attending those hearings should have their expenses paid, and the amendment makes appropriate provision in schedule 4 to complement the provision in schedule 1 for appeals tribunals.
<P>
I commend the amendment to the Committee.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule, as amended, be the Fourth schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I shall not detain the Committee, but I wish to raise a technical matter.
<P>
The schedule perfectly reasonably proposes remuneration for people attending oral hearings by the social security commissioners. It does not mention gratuities, however, which were covered in schedule 3. Why is that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> As the hon. Gentleman may remember, I promised to examine why gratuities were included in schedule 3. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will take comfort from the fact that that inclusion has not flowed through into schedule 4. I hope that the answer that I shall give him as to whether schedule 3 does not need to cover gratuities will satisfy him that schedule 4 does not need to do so either.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. I can only assume that the Opposition can look forward to a victory of sorts and that, when he has finished considering the matter, the Minister will accept some of our later amendments.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Schedule 4, as amended, agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 16</center></H4>
<H4><center>Appeal from Commissioners on point of law</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 223, in page 10, line 22, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`|so however that the time within which an application is to be brought shall be not less than three months from the notification of the Commissioner's decision.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The phrase ``three months'' seems to crop up regularly in Liberal Democrat amendments, and it does so again in this one, which deals with appeals against the commissioners. Such appeals could involve some pretty obscure, technical and complex case law. It may be neither possible nor practical for such an appeal to be lodged within a few weeks of the commissioners' decision, as reference may have to be made to other items of case law.
<P>
The amendment would allow people a reasonable period--we think that three months would be appropriate--in which to mount an appeal against a decision by the commissioners.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> The clause re-enacts provision already made by the Lord Chancellor, through regulations, for the time within which applications must be made. The social security commissioners procedures regulations already provide for
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``applications to be made within three months from the date on which the applicant was given notice of the date of decision''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Lord Chancellor has no plans to change that regulation.

In light of that assurance, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(4A) Where conditions equivalent to those contained in section 12 of the Administration of Justice Act 1969 apply, the Commissioner may specify as the appropriate court the House of Lords.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> With this amendment, we revisit arguments similar to earlier ones about attempts to leapfrog cases more quickly up the tree so that the process can be rendered simpler and quicker. Those earlier debates concerned what happened when an appeal decision had to be overturned, either by referral to a further appeal tribunal or a commissioner. Here, the issue is what happens when a real point of law has to be decided. Should we not allow some important cases to leapfrog the Court of Appeal to go straight to the House of Lords? The aim is the same as that that the Minister had with Government amendment No. 65--to speed up cases when it is inevitable that they will go to a higher place. Such cases should go to the Lords straight away, enabling a final decision to be taken as quickly as possible. Clearly, there may be instances in which all sides agree that a particular case is bound to go to the House of Lords, as it concerns an important point of law.
<P>
The Government also might believe that a particular case might be a test case. Whenever there is a test case, it is important that it is brought to the earliest possible conclusion, as such cases have many others in which benefit has been suspended or terminated depending on them. It can take a very long time for cases to get to the House of Lords, which is not always ready to hear them at short notice. I am certain that the Government, and all right-thinking people, would want to avoid a situation in which test cases have to wait three or four years for a final decision. Ensuring that such cases are dealt with as quickly as possible does not only simplify matters, reduce bureaucracy and reduce expense; it assists the people awaiting that decision, who might be unable to receive any benefit in the intervening period. The amendment is very much in the spirit of the Bill, and in the spirit of what the Government were arguing a few moments ago, and I hope that they accept it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> We find the hon. Government's argument persuasive. Learning from precedent, we should expect the Minister to tell us in a moment about some widely known statutory instrument--which is discussed on the Clapham omnibus--that immediately informs us of the ready availability of the House of Lords. Notwithstanding that precedent, I doubt that that can be achieved by statutory instrument, although I await clarification. The Minister might tell us that even statute cannot achieve that, but if it can be achieved by statute, and if it is not being achieved by statutory instrument, the expedition that the hon. Member for Newbury seeks is thoroughly reasonable. It is surely in the public interest--and in the interests of the claimants--that matters that are of such great significance that they are bound to come to the House of Lords should be decided as quickly as possible and at the highest possible level. I suspect that, otherwise, such cases might progress through the elaborations of the courts at a rate of years rather than months.
<P>
In addition, as we understand it, one of the major aims of this legislation is to reduce the costs of administering social security, as well as making it more effective. Clearly, costs would be reduced if a case that was bound to come to the House of Lords came immediately, and we therefore support the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> While it is always our intention to speed up and simplify procedures, in this case, unfortunately, I cannot accept the amendment.
<P>
The amendment attempts to build on the existing leapfrog procedures in the High Court in England and Wales. The effect of the amendments, however, would be to allow social security commissioners to do something which High Court judges cannot do. Under the leapfrog procedure a High Court judge can certify only that the necessary statutory conditions have been met, and that entitles the party who wishes to appeal to the House of Lords to petition the House of Lords for leave to appeal. It does not confer an automatic right of appeal; in 1996 one of the five petitions in leapfrog cases was rejected by the Lords. It is, therefore, a little-used power. The amendments would give commissioners the final say, however, about who can appeal to the House of Lords and they would also extend the leapfrog procedure to Scotland, where no such provision now exists for any type of case.
<P>
The amendments should be considered in relation to the role of the House of Lords as an appellate court. It is the highest court in the United Kingdom and deals with all kinds of cases. Its fundamental role is to give authoritative judgments on the most important and complex cases. Last year it dealt with only 43 civil appeals, of which just four related to social security law. Almost all types of appeal to the House of Lords require the leave of the House. Last year more than 80 per cent. of petitions for leave were refused.
<P>
It is an important feature of the House of Lords, as the supreme appeal court for the United Kingdom, that it is able to keep control over the cases that come to it, so that it deals only with those cases that are of genuine importance. The amendments would cut across that principle and would mean that the House of Lords' work load and priorities would be determined by others.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is true that there are very few social security appeals to the Court of Appeal and that a significant proportion of such cases go on to the House of Lords. The amendments cannot be considered in the context of social security law alone, however. If the principle is conceded that a leapfrog appeal is possible from a judicial body, other than the High Court, directly to the House of Lords, it would be difficult to argue that similar provisions should not be made, for example, for the immigration appeal tribunal, the employment appeal tribunal, the lands tribunal and even the county court. The impact on the House of Lords would be serious and would fundamentally alter its role in the judicial system.
<P>
I therefore ask the hon. Member to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The Minister has not said that such matters cannot be covered by statute, but he has come close to explaining why he does not think that they can be covered by statute. Unfortunately, what he has come close to explaining is why the amendment, as drafted, should not be incorporated in statute. If I have understood him correctly, he has made an argument against a form of leapfrogging that would compel the House of Lords to accept such a case. That point is understood.
<P>
If the Minister continues to explore that chain of logic, surely its conclusion would be that the Government could introduce a similar amendment, but with the intention of making it clear that the House of Lords should be able to decide to take such a case directly, without the case having proceeded through the Court of Appeal.
<P>
The Minister shakes his head in utter disdain at that suggestion. Will he explain to the Committee why that would not be the logical conclusion of his argument?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I do not always find myself in agreement with the hon. Member for West Dorset, but on this occasion I do. The Minister's statement implied that there were some cases, in other areas of law, in which an applicant who might be considering taking a case to the House of Lords might be told that it was sensible to do so. The applicant could then ask that the case be heard by the House of Lords. If the House of Lords then decided to hear the matter because it would inevitably do so eventually, that would enable the House to accept the procedure to speed up the matter. That would not impose any duty upon the House of Lords, as the amendments might do.
<P>
The Minister implied that it might be possible to speed up the procedures for everyone's benefit--the Government, taxpayers and applicants--so that cases that would inevitably go to the House of Lords could go there faster, without restricting the House of Lords' rights to determine those matters it should decide on. The Minister said that many cases that go to the Court of Appeal go on to the House of Lords anyway; it must therefore be a relatively common occurrence.
<P>
I am happy to withdraw the amendment for the moment, but I hope the Government will look again at what they were saying, because they were implying that there might be a better way of proceeding than the way in the Bill. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 224 in page 11, line 11, after `not', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and the power to make provision for such representatives to be sent all documentation relevant to an appeal hearing, including any submission by the Secretary of State, as soon as it becomes available, for account to be taken of the availability of an appellant's representative when the date for a tribunal hearing is fixed, and for such representatives to be notified directly of the date of a tribunal hearing.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is an important amendment. We are dealing here with the rights of people to be properly represented by others. We all know from our constituency work that sometimes those who need representation have not been able to be properly represented because their chosen representatives could not get hold of all the documentation or could not appear on the day for which the hearing was set.
<P>
The amendment seeks to ensure that where people appoint representatives to look after their interests, those representatives are themselves given all the relevant documentation as soon as possible so that, like the appellants, they can prepare themselves properly for the appeal hearing. The representative should also have a say in when the date of the tribunal hearing should be, because there is not much point in appointing a representative to look after one's interests if he or she cannot be there on the right day.
<P>
It is just as important that the day should be suitable for the representative as for the appellant. That is only natural justice. It is particularly important because of the short time in which some of these appeal hearings are set up. There is therefore a chance that the appeal hearing may be set on a day for which the representative cannot make himself available.
<P>
It is also true that quite a number of those who apply for benefit and who appeal as a result of being turned down are not necessarily the most articulate of people. To have a representative there to argue their case is very important. It is also a question of expertise. Their representative will know about the laws involved, about the details of the case, and about, for example, disabilities if it is a disability case; he will therefore be much more able to present the appeal than the appellant himself.
<P>
The needs of representatives are very important. It is only fair and reasonable that representatives should be able to be there. There is perhaps one final point that is worth making. While those who are appealing for some form of benefit may often find it relatively easy to attend tribunals on a given day--they may not be particularly busy and may unfortunately not have jobs themselves--their representatives are often very busy people who may find it particularly difficult to make themselves available at short notice for an appeal hearing. If anything, representatives will require more notice and more rights to say when they can and cannot appear than the appellants.
<P>
I hope that the Government will accept that in the interests of fairness and justice the representatives should be given at least as much say, both in getting the information and in saying when the date of the tribunal should be, as the appellants.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's wish to ensure that the appeals procedure works well and efficiently. Three points are raised in the amendment about the current arrangement. First, the Independent Tribunal Service takes account of the availability of representatives. Secondly, arrangements for representatives to be notified of the date of the hearing take place.
<P>
Thirdly, the ITS sends out documents to representatives and the appellant only when the hearing date has been fixed, not when they become available.
<P>
The amendment is designed to ensure that, under the new arrangements for appeals, those processes work as quickly and effectively as possible--and that is our intention, too. The provisions in the Bill will not change the framework for those arrangements. The thrust behind them is to improve the service.
<P>
The Secretary of State will set demanding targets for the appeals administration, as she made clear on Second Reading. We expect the new appeals service to continue to take account of the availability of representatives and to notify them directly of the dates of hearings. Clearly, sending documents out at the earliest opportunity is a matter of good administration, and that will form part of the monitoring process.
<P>
The setting of targets will ensure that we have an efficient service. I assure the hon. Member for Newbury that all key procedures will be part of the process that is implemented when the Bill becomes law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> The Minister appears to be accepting the amendment, in that he has suggested that it would do what will happen anyway. Will he, therefore, explain whey he is not prepared to accept the amendment itself?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I am not accepting the amendment because, as I have explained, the process for appeals procedures is already in place. We do not need amendments to create it.
<P>
The hon. Member for Newbury asked about appeals that are called at short notice, which result in representatives not being available. I assure him that the minimum notice for an appeal is seven days, but in practice three to four weeks' notice is usually given before an appeal is heard. The problem that he envisaged should thus not arise. Certainly, not less than seven days' notice should be given.
<P>
It is in all our interests to ensure much better administration of the appeals system. That involves taking into account the views of representatives and customers and ensuring that documents are sent out at the appropriate time, and not so far in advance that the appeal has not even been set up.
<P>
I hope that with that assurance the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment. The targets and monitoring that the Secretary of State described on Second Reading will lead to better administration, and the amendment is not necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I am sure that the Minister assures us in good faith that things are all as they should be. However, I must tell him that they are not. I have already referred to my meeting with the Stockport welfare rights unit, which told me that it faces increasing problems with the availability of representatives. For example, the same person may be required to be in two different places on the same day and may not find that out until late in the proceedings. In practice, the system is not working as well as the Minister would wish. Provisions for streamlining it should appear in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his further comments. I know Stockport welfare rights service very well, because I used to work in Stockport and helped the service when it was set up. I will consider carefully the case that he has described, and the hon. Gentleman or the service itself may want to write to me about the problems being experienced. Clearly, such difficulties are not in anyone's interests. The new executive agency will separate administration from the appeals process, and the purpose of that is to ensure that customers receive a more streamlined, efficient and appropriate service.
<P>
The ad hoc committee that we set up with representatives of welfare rights groups will consider the details of implementation, which is the key to the Bill's success. We want to ensure that the service is practical, relevant and meets the needs of customers. Any information that the hon. Gentleman can provide will guide our thinking on implementation. With those further reassurances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I do not intend to press the amendment to a vote. However, I am disappointed that although the Minister seemed to accept that our aim should be met, and claimed that he intended meeting it, he has not provided for it in the Bill. There would be no harm in doing so.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I support the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon. I had a meeting with members of my local CAB in Newbury, at their request--after they heard that I would be a member of the Committee--to discuss various aspects of the Bill. One complaint focused on the bureau's difficulty, when it represents someone at an appeal tribunal, at not being told when a tribunal will sit until about seven days before it does so. It often does not know details of the case against an appellant until the day of the hearing because it is not given documents in advance. Sadly, its experience so far is that matters have not been managed in the way that Minister rightly thinks they should.
<P>
We can hope that things will get better, but I am not sure that the Minister explaining what he wishes to happen will necessarily help them to. Were he all powerful, perhaps it would. I am disappointed that he has not felt able to include in the Bill a provision that would at least give appellants some chance of recourse if they are denied prior information and their representatives fail to attend tribunals in time to help them properly. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 216, in page 11, line 39, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(but the Commissioner alone shall determine the application or appeal'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This amendment will not take much time because I suspect that we are asking for something that the Government expect to happen. The Government have sensibly and properly included in the Bill the right for a commissioner to seek expertise where necessary. Our amendment would make it clear where responsibility for the final judgment lay. We would not want experts to be responsible for taking the decision; the commissioner would do that. Our amendment would make that plain so as to avoid later legal cases being brought on the ground that the commissioner did not take a proper decision. It would help the Government, and save time and trouble.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> We believe that the amendment is unnecessary. Clause 17 limits the role of experts to assisting commissioners in determining questions of fact of special difficulty. Information and reports from experts form part of the evidence to be considered by commissioners in determining appeals, but experts do not participate in determining applications for leave to appeal, or in determining appeals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's explanation. We all agree that that should happen. I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman is correct to say that the Bill makes it clear that that is the sole role of experts. Subsection (6) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If it appears to a Commissioner that a matter before him involves a question of fact of special difficulty, he may direct that in dealing with that matter he shall have the assistance of one or more experts.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I would have thought that ``assistance'' in that sense would not rule out giving assistance in making the decision. That is the point that we have attempted to get across. We should rule out ``assistance'' meaning assitance in making the decision as opposed to merely assisting the commissioner to reach his own decision. I wonder whether there is not a lacuna in the Bill that ought to be filled.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I do not think that there is a lacuna--I thought that was a type of car anyway.
<P>
I hope that I explained that the commissioner would be alone in determining the outcome, and that the expert was not part of that process. The provisons are not new; they are the same as those that have previously applied in legislation, and there has never been a challenge to them in the way that the hon. Gentleman envisaged. With that assurance, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> With that assurance, I am happy to withdraw the amendment. I only hope that what I said does not cause a legal argument. Perhaps I have put an idea into someone's head. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Bradley:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 66, in page 11, line 48, after `three', insert 'or more'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we shall take Government amendments Nos. 77 and 185.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> The amendments will enable the chief commissioner to appoint a tribunal of three or more commissioners to decide appeals in exceptionally complex cases or where decisions of single commissioners have conflicted and a more authoritative decision is required to settle the matter. Current law, which authorises that a tribunal should consist of just three commissioners, dates back almost 50 years to a time when three represented a majority of the commissioners. Now there are more than 20 commissioners, so that is no longer the case.
<P>
A tribunal of commissioners gives weight to a decision and that can often be sufficient to avoid the need to involve the courts. Allowing tribunals to have more than three commissioners will enable all necessary legal expertise to be included in a tribunal, and that will help in exceptionally complex cases. Reducing the potential for cases to go before the courts is better for the Department and for customers. I commend the amendment to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I have no problems with an amendment that will allow for an increase in the number of commissioners who can sit. However, it is interesting that the Minister takes that view on this matter when he was so adamant earlier that we could have single member appeal tribunal panels.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I take a different view on this matter because--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Because?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Any note that may have changed hands was just a sandwich order--it is getting near lunch time.
<P>
I have taken a different view because of the complexity of the issues that come before commissioners. Tribunals deal with simple matters that can be dealt with expeditiously by one person. They are therefore not comparable--that is why the two clauses are different.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Is the Minister saying that no matters of complexity come before appeals tribunals?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> We have debated these matters and I made it clear that, when tribunals have to deal with complex matters, they will be appropriately formed and have the necessary range of expertise. When a complex matter comes before a tribunal, it is likely to be made up of three people.
<P>
There is another difference between appeals tribunals and the commissioners. Commissioners set precedent, which is relied upon in later cases. That is why we want to ensure that the range of expertise needed to deal with complex cases is available at commissioner level. I do not need to repeat my earlier arguments about the composition of tribunals.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Clause 17, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

Further consideration adjourned.--[Mr. Kevin Hughes.]
