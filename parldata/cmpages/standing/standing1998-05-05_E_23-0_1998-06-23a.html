<P>
<B>Mr. John Whittingdale (Maldon and East Chelmsford): </b>When we adjourned, I was arguing that bingo differs greatly from other forms of gambling 
although it is taxed in the same way. It is almost 
impossible to lose a large quantity of money by playing 
bingo. However, other forms of gambling, such as the 
national lottery, set no limit on the number of tickets that 
punters can purchase. They may spend their entire life 
savings on national lottery tickets if they so wish. 
Similarly, those who bet on horses or on greyhounds may 
also stake sums that greatly exceed what they can afford. 
In casinos, the potential to lose very large sums of money 
is of course considerable. That is not the case with bingo.
<P>
Committee members who have attended a bingo session 
will know that there is a physical limit on the number of 
bingo cards that one can play in a single game. Regular 
players of bingo are extremely professional, and can play 
as many as six cards simultaneously. Personal experience 
has shown me that it is very difficult to keep up with just 
one card. I was indebted to the lady who sat next to me 
during that game, who managed to study my card as well 
as her own four, and to point out when I had made a 
mistake.
<P>
It is therefore virtually impossible to run more than six 
cards in one game. Given that each card costs no more 
than 50p, the maximum amount of money that can be 
staked in a single game is extremely low. For that reason 
it is impossible to chase one's losses. The financial risk 
attached to playing bingo is therefore wholly unlike that 
associated with other forms of gambling. Nevertheless, 
bingo has traditionally been treated as a form of gambling, 
and is subject to many of the same controls to which 
casinos and betting, for example, are subject.
<P>
Since the introduction of the national lottery, the
bingo industry has been under considerable pressure.
A monthly survey conducted during a two-year period 
showed that bingo players' propensity to play the national 
lottery is twice the national average. Attendances at bingo 
halls have therefore fallen quite substantially since the 
national lottery's inception. Attendances during 1997 
were 8 per cent. lower than those for 1994. As a result, a 
number of bingo halls have gone out of business 
altogether. Since November 1994, 158 bingo clubs have 
closed down. In 1997 alone, 66 clubs closed. Attendant 
on that figure was the loss of 3,500 jobs.
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis Moonie (Kirkcaldy):</B> I have a great deal of 
sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's points. My own 
constituency has two large bingo clubs, and I therefore 
listen to his comments with great interest. However, 
during the speech that he made before lunch, he made 
much of the fact that many large and wonderful bingo 
halls are being set up. Here there seems to be a 
contradiction, because that image fails to resonate with the 
one he now conveys of the closure of many bingo clubs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid 
point. Some of the closures have been of older and smaller 
halls, which have been replaced by much larger and newer 
halls. That is to be welcomed; but it is not the whole story.
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond (Runnymede and Weybridge):</B> 
Is it not also correct that restrictions on the advertising of 
bingo halls mean that those that are not well positioned 
have tended to close down and be replaced by halls in 
prominent locations, where they can overcome the tight 
restrictions on advertising that have prevailed until 
recently?
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> That is correct. The controls 
governing the advertising of bingo halls and the 
restrictions on membership and on playing the game are 
another subject, about which I feel equally strongly. 
Perhaps now is not the time to show that, but my hon. 
Friend is right.
<P>
New halls have been set up and the larger halls are still 
making a profit. Nevertheless, the fall in attendances has 
put great pressure on the industry. A number of the halls 
that have gone out of business have undoubtedly done so 
as a result of no longer being economically viable.
<P>
The effect of bingo duty on the industry is determined 
by its structure: as it is not linked directly to the number 
of people attending, the amount of duty raised has not 
decreased at the same time. To maintain the attraction of 
playing bingo, proprietors of bingo halls have been adding 
their own money to the prize pot to make up for the fact 
that fewer people are paying for tickets. Bingo duty is 
levied not only on the stake the amount of money put 
up by those playing the game but on the additional 
money put in by the proprietor. Therefore, while takings 
have fallen, the amount of tax that the industry has had to 
pay has not fallen proportionately. The burden of the tax 
has been greater and proprietors have been subjected to 
an ever increasing squeeze.
<P>
It is worth comparing the impact of tax on bingo with 
the impact of tax on other forms of gambling. Those other 
forms are much more dangerous to the punter, who has a 
much greater chance of losing a lot of money, but bingo 
bears the heaviest tax burden. The best way to show that 
is to take the combined amount of duty and VAT as a 
proportion of net consumer spend the aggregate of the 
amount of money spent by those gambling in whichever 
form minus the amount of money returned to them as 
prizes. On that basis, the duty rate on the national lottery 
is 24 per cent., the duty rate on betting is 30.3 per cent. 
and the duty rate on bingo is 37.2 per cent. The figure for 
bingo increases to more than 40 per cent. if the effects of 
the additional tax on added prize money are included. 
Those figures show that bingo is being taxed 
disproportionately in comparison to other forms of 
gambling.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy (Dr. Moonie) said, 
I spoke this morning about the importance of halls in local 
communities. Given that 66 clubs closed down in 1997 
alone, it is important to be fully aware of the impact that 
each of those closures has on the local community. I draw 
the Committee's attention to a recent study, carried out 
by Faith Freestone of the Worcester college of higher 
education, called "Four Towns Study". She picked four 
locations where clubs closed last year: Keynsham, 
Fareham, Hartlepool and Paisley. I am glad to see that the 
hon. Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Alexander) is in his 
place. I am sure he would agree that the closure of a bingo 
club is damaging to a local community.
<P>
The study consulted 200 people who were either 
regular players at the clubs or employed by them. The 
overwhelming majority 96.6 per cent. of players said 
that the prime reason they played bingo was social. The 
study found that almost two thirds of the total sample 
stated that the closure of the clubs had made a difference 
to their existence. There are many quotes to illustrate that. 
A 72-year-old lady said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I don't have anywhere else to go now. I miss my bingo so 
much."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A 58-year-old lady said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It has made a lot of difference to my social life. I have lost touch 
with all my friends. I am just a small fish in a big pond now."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Some 70 per cent. of employees found that they faced the 
prospect of unemployment after the club closed.
<P>
It was readily apparent from the players' comments that 
there was a sense of loss of community, companionship 
and friendship coupled with growing feelings of social 
isolation. It is important to bear in mind that we are not 
just talking about a commercial enterprise; the loss of a 
bingo club will have a damaging effect on the local 
community.
<P>
The Henley Centre's recent major study of the bingo 
industry shows that profitability varies according to the 
type of club, but that profitability in the industry as a 
whole has fallen by 33 per cent. since 1994. The Henley 
Centre concentrated on 600 clubs which it divided into 
six categories. Two categories of clubs those in new 
buildings with medium attendance levels and those in 
traditional buildings with smaller attendance levels are 
loss making. Those two categories comprise more than 
300 of the 600 clubs. It is fair to say that more than half 
the clubs are now operating at a loss. Indeed, since that 
study was carried out a few months ago, a further eight 
clubs have closed.
<P>
If all the clubs in those two categories were to close 
they are operating at a loss and some are in the process 
of closing the cost to the Exchequer would be
£37 million in lost duty and VAT. We must also take 
account of additional losses the loss of VAT on the 
various activities that take place in a big club, the loss of 
corporation tax, and the loss of up to 5,000 jobs.
<P>
To amendment would address the loss of profitability 
in the industry by implementing a 5 per cent. cut in 
bingo duty. The Henley Centre used its industry model 
to simulate the effect of that 5 per cent. cut. In carrying 
out the analysis, it assumed that half the benefit from 
the cut would go towards the participation fee and half 
would be added to the prize money. The effect of the 
cut would be to make both the categories of clubs that 
are currently loss making profitable. The effective tax 
rate on the industry, which I mentioned earlier, would 
decrease from 40.8 per cent. to about 28.9 per cent., 
which is roughly on a par with other forms of gambling.
<P>
The industry put up a powerful case to justify why it 
needs help, but of course the Chancellor in his Budget 
ignored its pleas. Not only did he pay no attention to the 
industry's requests for relief through reduced bingo duty, 
but he made the position far worse by increasing duty on 
amusement with prizes machines by 20 per cent., which 
we debated earlier. Many of those clubs also rely on 
those machines.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that that measure will cost bingo club 
owners another £3 million. Our measure would cost 
around £40 million, but failure to act could cost the 
Exchequer much more. If action is not taken more clubs 
could close, which would lead, in the long term, to a 
decline in the revenue raised from bingo duty.
<P>
The previous Government recognised the effect of the 
lottery on other forms of gambling and they cut betting 
duty. Unfortunately I am quite open about this they 
did not feel able to permit a cut in bingo duty, or perhaps 
they did not have the resources to do so. A powerful case 
for introducing that cut was made during the passage of 
the Finance Bill in 1996, and I draw the Committee's 
attention to a persuasive speech made in that debate.
A participant said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Bingo clubs deserve treatment and assistance similar to that 
given to other parts of the betting industry... We must press the 
Government on why they felt unable to extend the cut in betting 
duty to the bingo industry... The loss in duty to the Treasury from 
bingo alone must be balanced against the possible long-term decline 
in revenue as more clubs face the prospect of closure." [Official 
Report, Standing Committee E, 1 February 1996; c. 58-9.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Committee members will have realised by now that the 
advocate of that powerful case has now become the 
Financial Secretary to the Treasury.
<P>
It is a matter of great regret but not of great surprise 
that the Financial Secretary is not in her place this 
afternoon. It is her responsibility to oversee this area of 
policy. She should be here, but she is not the Paymaster 
General is in her place instead. I hope that she has at least 
whispered in his ear and reminded him of the very 
powerful case that she advanced just a couple of years 
ago for a cut in bingo duty.
<P>
As I explained, the bingo industry is facing great 
problems. Unless measures are taken now more clubs will 
close and the Revenue may find, in the long term, that the 
amount of money raised from that duty will decline. 
Social and economic cases are involved, and I hope that 
the Paymaster General will recognise their force.

<P>

<B>Mr. Geraint Davies (Croydon, Central):</B> rose 
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I was about to finish, but I cannot 
resist giving way to the hon. Gentleman first.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> What was the then Government's response 
to the plea that my hon. Friend, who is now the Financial 
Secretary, made on behalf of the bingo industry?
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdfale:</B> I thought that I had already 
explained the previous Government's response I said 
that unfortunately they were not able to reduce bingo duty. 
Since then, the evidence has dramatically increased and 
the case now is even stronger than it was a couple of 
years ago.
<P>
<B>The Paymaster General (Mr. Geoffrey Robinson):</B> 
The hon. Gentleman moved the new clause with 
moderation and he obviously thinks that there is a case to 
be answered.
<P>
As the hon. Gentleman said, the new clause
would reduce the duty burden on bingo operators by
50 per cent. it would cut from 10 per cent. to 5 per cent. 
the duty paid in respect of bingo cards, and from one ninth 
to one eighteenth the duty paid in respect of added prize 
money. His proposed 5 per cent. reduction does not seem 
to be very much, but he knows that it would involve a
50 per cent. reduction in real terms, which would cost the 
Exchequer much money. The figures that I have suggest 
that it would cost £35 million this year, which is broadly 
in line with his suggested cost of £40 million, but that the 
cost would rise to £65 million in 1999-2000 and to
£70 million in 2001.
<P>
I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will concede that a 
fairly strong case would have to be made before we 
considered accepting such revenue losses. Before the 
Budget, we received representations from bingo operators. 
Indeed, Customs and Excise met industry representatives 
in December 1997 to set out the case for a cut in bingo 
duty. I have looked at the representations and 
considerations that were put to us, and I am reluctant to 
say that I do not think that a reduction in duty is justified. 
I say that because I find bingo clubs pleasurable places 
and excellent canvassing locations during general 
elections.
<P>
However, bingo duty receipts have been increasing 
steadily since 1992, despite the influence of the national 
lottery. Since the introduction of the lottery in 1994, 
annual receipts have climbed from just below £78 million 
to £101 million in 1997 30 per cent. in three years. That 
is a creditable performance given the competition posed 
by the lottery. Clearly, it is posing much more of a threat 
to another area which we shall consider in the context of 
a separate new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Can the Paymaster General confirm 
that, historically, receipts from bingo duty have shown a 
tendency to mirror the cycles of the economy, and that 
much of the rise between 1994 and the present time is 
merely a reflection of the improvement in the economy 
over that period?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Well. We do not make the case for that; 
it can go the other way. For example, the pools clearly do 
not mirror that. The relevant fact is that bingo has done 
extremely well. On the other hand, I am aware that the 
number of bingo clubs has fallen in the past few years, 
but that seems to be part of a long-term trend as the 
industry moves to larger purpose-built premises. The 
up-marketing of many places of entertainment, such as 
cinemas and betting shops, can be seen everywhere. That 
is a natural secular trend.
<P>
The industry has responded to the challenge of the 
lottery by enhancing the environment for the customer 
through the introduction of state-of-the-art facilities. It has 
also benefited from several deregulatory measures since 
1996, which were introduced, to their credit, by the 
Opposition when they were in Government. Those 
measures include the removal of all restrictions on the 
advertising of bingo and permitting the use of debit cards 
to play bingo. The hon. Member for Maldon and East 
Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale) referred to at least one of 
those measures.
<P>
Thus the continuing investment in the industry, in terms 
of both added prizes and infrastructure, coupled with 
increased opportunities for greater profitability afforded 
by deregulation, is a clear sign that the industry is fairly 
taxed and can compete successfully with other operators 
in the betting industry. Therefore, I regret that I cannot 
accept the new clause, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman 
will not press it to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Fallon (Sevenoaks):</B> We regret the 
absence of the Financial Secretary, who might have been 
able better to explain why the words that were appropriate 
in 1996 are somehow inappropriate in 1998. But I am sure 
that the Paymaster General will draw our debate to her 
attention to enable her to read the words that were spoken 
and to re-read the words that she spoke two years ago.
<P>
The Paymaster General mentioned deregulation, but the 
deregulation programme for gaming, gambling and bingo 
has virtually come to a halt, and very few orders are now 
being laid. Those industries have said that they would be 
prepared, to some extent, to put up with being messed 
about as regards duty if they could see a continuing 
programme of deregulation. I had hoped that the 
Paymaster General would be able to give the industry a 
little more assurance about that. His colleagues at the 
Home Office are at least keeping licensing provisions 
under review and continuing the various deregulation 
measures that were proposed by the previous 
Government. However, there seems to be little progress 
in relation to amusement machines, gaming and bingo.
<P>
My final point is that it is precisely because of 
up-marketing and changing social trends that the industry 
requires some stability, and it looks to the Government to 
provide a little more certainty than it has enjoyed in recent 
years. When we debated gaming duty on the Floor of the 
House, that argument was accepted. Indeed, the Financial 
Secretary acknowledged the damage that she had done in 
the Budget by offering to index gaming duties for the rest 
of the Parliament, almost protecting the industry against 
the Government. So I do not know why, in this case,
the Paymaster General cannot sketch out for us the 
Government's medium-term policy for the remainder of 
this Parliament. Are duties likely to be changed further?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I would not wish to assist the hon. 
Gentleman on that particular point at this particular time. 
Of course, my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary 
apologises for not being able to speak in Committee 
today.
<P>
Of all the areas of betting that have been impacted by 
the lottery, it is bingo that is holding its own and doing 
quite well. If special measures were to be taken, I cannot 
see why they should be taken in relation to the bingo 
industry. Therefore, I resist the new clause.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Whittingdale: I find that answer somewhat 
disappointing. The Paymaster General sought to give the 
impression that everything in the bingo garden is rosy and 
there is no cause for concern. However, while he cites the 
fact that the amount of money raised from bingo duty has 
been increasing, as I tried to explain earlier, that is not a 
proper reflection of the state of the industry. The reason 
is that proprietors are having to dip into their own 
resources to make up the prize money in order to maintain 
the attraction of their clubs to their customers, and they 
are being taxed on that money as well.
<P>
However, I hope that, at the very least, the Paymaster 
General will keep an eye on the matter because I believe 
that the situation is deteriorating. I fear that when we 
return to the subject, as I am sure we will, in future 
Finance Bills, we shall learn that more bingo clubs have 
closed. If that happens, I assure him that we will make 
this case again.
<P>
Although I am not satisfied with the Paymaster 
General's response, I do not wish to press the matter to a 
vote, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>

<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> I want to discuss the impact of the 
Government's tax reforms especially the taxation of 
savings on friendly societies.
<P>
I am sure that all Committee members know that 
friendly societies are mutually owned institutions, and 
there is a good grounding in the Committee about what 
mutuality means. I believe that you, Mr. Butterfill, are 
one of the leading lights in the all-party group on building 
societies, and the chairman of that group earlier made an 
effective contribution to the debate on demutualisation.
<P>
The principle of mutuality is well understood. Friendly 
societies occupy a particular niche in society: they provide 
a vehicle for long-term savings, usually in the form of 
10-year insurance policies, which are savings rather than 
life policies. Traditionally, their purpose has been to 
attract low-income savings in traditional working-class 
communities. They have relied over the years on the spirit 
of mutual self-help and they are especially attractive in 
that context. They have very low overheads and relatively 
low management costs, and they embrace the traditional 
values of the society in which they grow.
<P>
It has been recognised for some years that there should 
be some tax exemption for such long-term savings. The 
previous Government granted, perhaps rather grudgingly, 
a limited amount of tax relief initially up to £100 a year 
in 1984, and the figure gradually increased to, I believe, 
£275 in 1994. That was a useful but modest tax 
concession to that method of saving.
<P>
I have moved the new clause because the situation has 
changed under the Labour Government in two significant 
ways. The first change involves the introduction of 
individual savings accounts. The philosophy behind ISAs 
is to attract low-income savers, and the scheme may be a 
considerable success when it is launched. However, one 
of its main features is that it will encourage instant 
access it will encourage liquidity rather than long-term 
savings.
<P>
I should remind Labour Members of their election 
manifesto commitments on the subject they are highly 
germane to our discussion. The election manifesto said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We will introduce a new individual savings account and extend 
the principle of TESSAs and Peps to promote long-term saving."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Whatever the scheme does it will promote not long-term 
savings but instant access and liquidity a very different 
principle is in operation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Love (Edmonton):</B> Will the hon. 
Gentleman accept that instant access is necessary for the 
scheme to attract the low-income savers for whom it is 
designed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cable:</B> Yes, I accept that. I do not intend to 
criticise the principle of instant access to ISAs. It is 
desirable to attract a particular class of saver but, in 
attracting that class of saver, one needs to be mindful
of those people who have committed themselves to 
long-term savings and the effect that ISAs will have on 
them. For example, if someone invests a £1,000 a year 
premium in a friendly society, about three quarters of the 
profits on that will be taxed, but an investment of the 
equivalent sum in an ISA will be tax exempt. It is almost 
certain that the friendly society product will become 
virtually unsaleable. Our proposal would correct the 
imbalance that the Government have inadvertently 
created.
<P>
The second reason that this is an important and topical 
issue on which the Government should reflect seriously is 
that friendly societies appear to play a key role in the 
Government's thinking on stakeholder pensions. The 
Minister for Welfare Reform, the right hon. Member for 
Birkenhead (Mr. Field), who is the driving force behind 
many reforms, has said several times that he envisages 
mutual institutions performing the key role in mobilising 
pensions. That role may be exclusive; at the very least, 
they will have a special status. I am not sure that the 
Treasury has thought through the implications of creating 
serious difficulties for the friendly societies in attracting 
their normal savers, especially when other parts of the 
Government regard the institutions as the principal vehicle 
for welfare reform.
<P>
The Association of Friendly Societies worked hard on 
the new clause and new schedule. It tried to ensure that 
they are technically compatible with the requirements of 
tax legislation. For example, they are designed to 
accommodate the requirement that there should be regular 
premiums throughout the year.
<P>
I am specifically asking the Paymaster General to give 
the matter careful thought. I am sure that the Government 
will argue that friendly societies could simply float their 
own ISAs. However, many smaller friendly societies are 
not in a position to meet the regulatory requirements,
in particular the stipulation that they must give best 
advice. Many of the larger friendly societies will be 
disadvantaged because they will no longer offer a distinct 
product. The purpose of the friendly societies is to offer 
one major distinct product a long-term savings account 
which is linked to insurance. By competing with a large 
number of other financial institutions that offer ISAs, their 
distinctiveness as mutual institutions will be lost.
<P>
I hope that the Paymaster General will recognise that 
the situation has changed since the previous Government 
were in office. It requires a fresh look at tax exemption.
I also hope that he will raise the limit from £270 to £1,000 
because that would make friendly society tax treatment 
compatible and competitive with ISA provision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> Let me start by saying that 
the Government strongly support the ideals of the friendly 
society movement. The encouragement of thrift and 
providing protection of savings for those on modest 
incomes is worth while. To reflect that, the Government 
have done much in the Bill to help friendly societies. The 
hon. Gentleman will be aware that clause 88, for example, 
allows payment of tax credits on exempted business for a 
further five years. Friendly societies are among those 
allowed to write ISA business.
<P>
I assure him that during the consultation period we 
listened carefully to what the industry had to say. 
Although there was no unanimous opinion among other 
financial organisations, we felt that it was right for the 
friendly societies to be in the ISA scheme. That 
effectively increases the level of tax-exempt business that 
a friendly society can write from £270 per person per year 
to £1,270 per person per year.
<P>
Through subsidiaries, incorporated societies will be 
able to offer the non-insurance component of ISA 
business, which is up to £5,000 per person per year, 
except for the first year, when an additional £2,000 in 
cash was added to get the scheme off to a good start.
<P>
Increasing the limit on friendly societies' existing 
tax-exempt business could have been regarded as an 
alternative to allowing them into the ISA policy. 
However, ISAs are the Government's strategic vehicle for 
targeting tax relief to encourage savings through the 
flexibility and accessibility that they offer to savers. In 
agreeing with the principle of ISAs, the hon. Member for 
Twickenham (Dr. Cable) was right to focus on that 
particular aspect. Indeed, I believe that his party has 
supported ISAs.
<P>
It would be excessive and unjustifiable both to increase 
friendly societies' exempt limit and to give them ISA 
business. I see no reason why friendly societies in 
particular should receive that double benefit. The total 
exemption would then be £2,000 a far cry from the 
current level of £270, which we have effectively increased 
to £1,270. That exemption would enable friendly societies 
to compete on unfair terms with insurance companies, 
especially with some of the smaller mutual companies, 
which are smaller than the largest friendly societies.
<P>
The present exemption for non-ISA business was 
intended to make viable the friendly society's traditional 
business of offering small policies to the less well off. 
An increase to £1,000 would bring the societies into the 
mainstream of mortgage endowment business an 
outcome that was never intended. I see no reason to 
encourage them in that direction. Such an annual premium 
could easily fund the capital element of a £60,000 
mortgage over 25 years, for example, which would 
compete directly with many others in the insurance 
industry.
<P>
Friendly societies are welcome to compete in this field, 
but the Government should not enable them to do so 
unfairly by offering a substantial subsidy. The cost of 
increasing limits could be considerable up to 
approximately £100 million a year after 15 years. Given 
the already significant tax reliefs in the Bill to encourage 
savings, such additional relief for friendly societies and 
financial institutions is unnecessary and imprudent.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not inclined to press 
the new clause and the new schedule to a vote, because 
we would resist them.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dr. Cable:</B> I would like to respond by raising some 
questions.
<P>
First, I am surprised that the Government continue to 
regard tax relief as a subsidy. That is something of a 
theological argument; however, there is a clear difference 
between the two. A degree of tax relief was introduced 
by the previous Government. It was seen not as a subsidy 
to the friendly society but as a way of encouraging saving 
on the basis of parity with other institutions.
<P>
Secondly, does the Paymaster General recognise the 
product offered by friendly societies which is a 
particular form of long-term savings as a distinctive 
product? He described ISAs as the Government's strategic 
vehicle. However, is there not a danger that forcing all 
forms of saving into the ISA straitjacket will result in 
the loss of a particularly useful and distinctive savings 
instrument? The long-term nature of the friendly societies' 
savings vehicle has a merit in itself.
<P>
Will the Paymaster General tell us the outcome of his 
consultation with the Association of Friendly Societies?
I understood that it was unhappy to be told that the answer 
to the problem is simply to write ISA business. Many 
friendly societies will be unable to meet that requirement, 
which is much inferior to the maintenance of a 
competitive tax status through the treatment that I have 
outlined. I would be grateful if he would give us some 
feedback on that.
<P>
The Paymaster General also made the point that there 
is a possibility of friendly societies having an unfair 
competitive advantage over other mutual institutions. 
Clearly, that could be remedied if they were brought 
within the net of tax treatment for mutual institutions in 
general. I was not meaning to be narrowly prescriptive as 
regards friendly societies.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I was hopping that the hon. Member for 
Twickenham would deal with the Government's point 
about cost. It is true that the previous Government 
encouraged the friendly societies, as the hon. Gentleman 
said, but he seems to be proposing a new clause that 
would amount to a cost of about £100 million a year. That 
is a substantial price tag for any amendment. I wonder 
which parts of the Liberal Democrat programme will have 
to be sacrificed to accommodate it. Is the hon. Gentleman 
suggesting that it could be paid for by some other means, 
or does he dispute the £100 million price tag?
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> I am happy to respond. If I understand the 
Government's logic, they are saying that friendly societies 
will be able to write the equivalent amount of ISA 
business. They simply assume a switching of accounts. If 
that were the case and all the accounts were simply 
switched into ISA business, they would be tax credited 
anyway and there would be no revenue implications.
I was emphasising the difficulties that institutions would 
experience in operating through the ISA route and 
offering an inferior product. We are not talking about 
additional tax cost.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I should not think that the hon. Member 
for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon) need worry himself too much 
about where another £100 million would come from in 
the Liberal spending plan. It would be added on as a 
further cost to the public purse, no doubt with the support 
of the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham 
(Mr. Loughton).
<P>
If the hon. Gentleman is interested, I can make 
available to him the notes of our consultations with the 
industry. However, both the traditional structure of the 
friendly society policies and their tax treatment pose 
significant financial penalties on the individual who 
cannot keep up the premiums for eight to 10 years. That 
is the problem. While for some the sanctions may be an 
incentive to keep saving, for others they must rule against 
taking out a tax exempt policy in the first place. By 
contrast, the ISA scheme presents an opportunity for the 
friendly society movement to design more flexible 
products that will meet the needs of a wider range of 
savers and enable societies to attract and retain a higher 
level of savings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton (East Worthing and Shoreham):</B> 
Will the Paymaster General give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I will not. We are grateful for the 
support of the Liberal Democrats on ISAs in general. 
When the hon. Member for Twickenham sees the details 
of our consultations, he will understand that we went to a 
great deal of trouble to accommodate the views of the 
industry.
<P>

<H4><center>New Clause 12</center></H4>
<H4><center>Income tax losses and Lloyd's underwriters</center></H4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`. Schedule D losses carried forward by a Lloyd's underwriter 
who ceased to underwrite prior to 12th September 1996 and who 
did not accept the Lloyd's reconstruction agreement may be offset 
against his Lloyd's underwriting profits during any year since
1979 and his Schedule D tax liability shall be recalculated 
accordingly.'. [Mr. Hammond.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read 
a Second time.
<P>
Before the Paymaster General beats me to the draw,
I shall say that I have no particular pride in the drafting 
of the clause, and I hope that he will accept it as it was 
intended  as an opportunity to raise, before debate on 
the Finance Bill finally comes to an end, the question of 
the goings-on at Lloyd's of London.
<P>
To put the new clause in context, Lloyd's losses may 
currently be offset against other income in the year in 
which they arise and may be carried forward only against 
underwriting losses. The new clause would, for certain 
categories of underwriters, allow a carry back of 
underwriting losses against underwriting income from 
earlier years.
<P>
The precise terms of the new clause are of less 
importance than the opportunity to air with Treasury 
Ministers one of the several issues surrounding the recent 
history of Lloyd's of London, and one that touches 
directly on the role of Government. I am a little 
disappointed that the Economic Secretary is not present 
this afternoon, as I have sought to extract answers from 
her over the past few months. it was a tedious process of 
question and non answer followed by further question and 
further non answer. I have not made much progress 
through written questions, and I hoped that a little more 
progress might be made this afternoon.
<P>
In case anyone should think differently, Mr. Butterfill, 
I am not seeking to make a political point this afternoon. 
The problems at Lloyd's of London began during the 
1970s, when there was a Labour Government. Those 
problems continued through the 1980s and into the 1990s, 
when there was a Conservative Government. I half 
expected, when I started asking questions of the
incoming Government last year, to hear the familiar 
refrain, "This is a problem created by the previous 
Administration; we will change tack". But Labour 
Members may be interested to learn that I have heard that 
it is business as usual. The Treasury intends to continue 
along the same track as before.
<P>
I should also say that I have no personal interest in this 
issue. I have never been a member of Lloyd's. When I 
thought it might be a good idea to be a member of 
Lloyd's, I did not have any money. By the time I had 
enough money to think about it, I decided that it no longer 
looked like a good idea. I know that many hon. Members 
have personal knowledge and experience of Lloyd's and 
that those experiences have not always been happy. Many 
of those who have lost money in the Lloyd's fiasco are 
people who have been relatively wealthy. I say "have 
been" advisedly. Many of those to whom I have spoken 
had considerable wealth but, as a result of the Lloyd's 
fiasco, have been ruined or are facing imminent ruin.
I recognise that perhaps that makes this a politically 
unsexy cause because the victims are those who have 
enjoyed comfortable lifestyles. However, it is an 
important principle in this country that the rule of law 
applies across the board and that the wealthy are entitled 
to access to the law in the same way as the poor.
<P>
I have become aware, through contact with my 
constituents and the constituents of other hon. Members, 
of people who became underwriters relatively recently 
not those who have been underwriters for 20 or 30 years, 
but those who became underwriters in the past 10 years 
and subsequently found that the organisation that they had 
joined was not at all as it had been presented. They feel 
genuinely aggrieved and seem to have a legitimate 
grievance that should be addressed.
<P>
I shall outline the nub of the problem. The Insurance 
Companies Act 1982 and European regulations 
surrounding the insurance market make it clear that 
insurance companies a definition that includes the 
insurance operations of Lloyd's of London need to be 
independently audited. The 1982 Act requires that a 
certificate be furnished by the auditor to the Secretary of 
State for Trade and Industry, stating that the requirements 
of the audit have been met and, in particular, that the 
auditor has made an independent assessment of the assets 
and liabilities of the syndicate and that he is satisfied that 
the assets are adequate to cover the liabilities. That is 
important, as it is the Secretary of State who must be 
satisfied that those requirements have been met. However, 
certificates in accordance with the 1982 Act have not 
been issued.



<P>
It became apparent early on that auditors were unable 
or unwilling to fulfil the obligations placed on them by 
the 1982 Act. A famous letter I believe it is known in 
legal circles as the Neville Russell letter was written to 
Lloyd's making it clear that the auditors were concerned 
about the vast scale of potential liabilities overhanging 
Lloyd's and about their unquantifiable nature. It drew 
attention to the fact that on a strict interpretation of the 
obligations that the 1982 Act placed on them, they would 
have to qualify the accounts of, in effect, the entire 
market.
<P>
As a result of discussions in response to that letter, 
Lloyd's auditors were required, by guidance that the 
society issued, to rely on underwriters' assessment of the 
liabilities that the syndicates faced. The certificates that 
were furnished to the Secretary of State under the guise 
of the certificates that were required by the 1982 Act were 
not based on an independent audit of the assets and 
liabilities of the syndicates. By virtue of the guidance that 
Lloyd's issued, the auditors simply accepted the estimates 
of liability that were provided by the underwriters.
<P>
The problem is that members who joined the society 
during the later 1980s saw sets of accounts that suggested 
that the syndicates were profitable. It does not take a 
genius to work out that the profitability or otherwise 
of a syndicate depends on an assessment of the provision 
for losses that will occur in what I understand is called 
long-tailed business. That involves business that, by its 
very nature, may give rise to claims many years after the 
premiums have been paid. That class of business involves, 
in particular, asbestosis, which has greatly affected 
Lloyd's of London.



<P>
From the early 1980s, underwriting profits were 
consistently overstated and tax was paid to the Inland 
Revenue by underwriters on the basis of profits that were 
overstated. The accounts were supplied to outsiders who 
were thinking of joining the market. In its prospectus 
recruiting new members to the market, Lloyd's 
emphasised the extremely high quality and standards of 
its independent audit requirements. Many people joined 
the market during that period expecting that the accounts 
that they had seen and which had been certified by the 
Secretary of State were true and fair representations of the 
position of the syndicates that they were joining.
<P>
An underwriter who joined the market in 1991 told me, "As events subsequently unfolded, I was bankrupt the day 
that I joined, but I thought that I was joining a profitable 
and successful syndicate."
<P>
Members who joined under those circumstances feel 
that the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry failed 
in respectively over the years his or her duty to protect 
investors and to ensure that the Insurance Companies Act 
1982 was enforced in relation to certificates that were 
submitted to the Secretary of State by auditors.
<P>
I have previously raised this matter with the Economic 
Secretary and the Department of Trade and Industry, but 
all matters relating to Lloyd's are now referred to the 
Treasury for answer. The Economic Secretary told me that 
in January 1998 she had
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"announced proposals for the Financial Services Authority...to take 
statutory responsibility for the regulation of Lloyd's...Our proposals 
would provide the FSA with extensive supervisory powers and 
powers of intervention in relation to Lloyd's." [Official Report,
2 March 1998; Vol. 307, c. 454.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
She did not tell me how those powers would be used 
to address the legitimate concerns of those underwriting 
members of the society who joined during the late 
1980s or early 1990s. She also told me that she did 
not intend to initiate a review, of the kind recommended 
by the Treasury Committee in the 1995-96 Session, of 
the Lloyd's market. A former Minister of State in the 
Department of Trade and Industry indicated, through 
written answers, that the previous Government expected 
to initiate such a review once the reconstruction process 
at Lloyd's of London had been completed.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
This Government came into office in May 1997 with 
an opportunity to open the doors to the world on what had 
happened in relation to Lloyd's of London and on the 
Secretary of State's role in receiving and approving 
certificates issued by auditors. But they have set their face 
against such an opportunity to draw a line under the affair 
and open it up, and have continued the policy followed 
by previous Administrations of defending Lloyd's of 
London. They have not pursued the route that the former 
Minister of State in the Department of Trade and Industry 
indicated would be followed once the reconstruction
was completed the initiation of a review of the 
self-regulation mechanisms at Lloyd's, as recommended 
by the Treasury Committee during the last Session of the 
previous Parliament.
<P>
There is a deep feeling of bitterness among ruined and 
about-to-be-ruined names. They feel that Governments 
have failed in their duty to protect them as citizens and 
that Secretaries of State have failed in one of the clear 
regulatory responsibilities allocated to them by statute. 
The affair has also had a significant effect on the United 
Kingdom's reputation as a place to do business among 
people in the United States. Many underwriting members 
of the society based in the United States have also found 
themselves in difficulty; the Paymaster General will know 
that litigation is currently under way in the United States, 
as it is in the United Kingdom, in relation to this matter. 
I suggest to the Paymaster General that this country's 
reputation as a reliable place to do business, with a clear, 
structured framework of regulation, has taken a battering 
as a result.
<P>
The new clause would offer some redress to those most 
severely affected by the acceptance which still 
continues by UK Governments over a long period of 
time of certificates that were defective in terms of the 
requirements of the Insurance Companies Act 1982.
<P>
My main purpose in raising this issue was to see 
whether the Paymaster General could give an indication 
of the Government's current policy or intentions with 
regard to this matter. Can he give a glimmer of hope to 
those who have refused to accept the reconstruction 
settlement offered by Lloyd's, and who are clinging on in 
the hope that they will be able to avoid bankruptcy and 
ruin due to a sequence of events that they feel has unfairly 
been visited on them by Governments?

<P>

<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I have a good deal of 
sympathy for many of those who came badly unstuck in 
the Lloyd's scandal. It is one of those incidents from 
which the reputation of the City which is of great 
importance to all members of the Committee has taken 
a knock and will take some time to recover. He is right 
to say that London is one of the best places in which 
to do business, not least because we have such a highly 
competent, highly regarded and highly ethical legal 
system. Those companies that carry out assessments of 
different criteria, which include the legal system, language 
and environment, consistently place London top or 
second.
<P>
It is important that we take the hon. Gentleman's points 
seriously, but he will appreciate that they apply to the 
wider issue of the regulation of Lloyd's which, as he said, 
will be undertaken by the FSA. Those are not immediate 
problems that we can deal with in the Finance Bill.
<P>
The new clause would not work, but that does not 
matter because we cannot concede the principle. The new 
clause would extend the tax relief for losses that are 
available to underwriters at Lloyd's. The relief would be 
given against trading profits for any year back to 1979. It 
appears to allow the underwriter who is claiming relief to 
do so for any year out of the 20 available. The new clause 
would benefit only the minority of underwriters who did 
not accept the settlement offered by Lloyd's as part of its 
reconstruction and renewal proposals.
<P>
The new clause would be manifestly unfair. There is 
no reason why a small proportion of Lloyd's underwriters 
should have access to releif for losses that is more 
generous than the relief available to ordinary traders, who 
can carry back losses for one specified year only. The new 
clause would permit Lloyd's underwriters to choose to 
have their losses relieved against profits in any year out 
of 20. Lloyd's underwriters would be able to choose the 
years in which to pay tax on their profits at the most 
advantageous rates. As a matter of self-interest, it would 
be normal, legitimate and correct for the underwriter to 
do that. Indeed, he would have to be certified if he did 
not. It is not our job to include such a provision in a 
serious Finance Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The point is that the profits on which 
taxes were paid during that period turned out to be 
spurious. They were wrongly computed because the 
Secretary of State an officer of Her Majesty's 
Government accepted certificates that were issued by 
auditors which did not comply with the requirements of 
the Insurance Companies Act 1982. Tax was paid on 
profits that did not really arise. When the losses caught 
up with the underwriters, they had nothing against which 
they could offset the losses and compensate themselves.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> In fairness, the hon. Gentleman did 
raise the issue of the certificates in his opening remarks. 
I assure him that the Treasury is satisfied that they were 
received in the prescribed form and met the requirements 
of prevailing legislation. I cannot accept his point. I see 
no purpose in prolonging the debate. We cannot under 
any circumstances contemplate accepting the new clause. 
If he pushes it to a vote, we will resist it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Paymaster General said that the 
certificates complied with the legislation at the time. Is he 
saying that those certificates were subject to an 
independent audit of assets and liabilities in compliance 
with the Insurance Companies Act 1982? I understand 
that that is not the case. If he can clarify the Treasury's 
position, we will have at least moved my cause forward.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman allow me to 
write to him?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful to the Paymaster 
General for that offer. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the 
motion.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move, That the clause 
be read a Second time.
<P>
New clause 13 would require the Government 
continually to review the effect of the national lottery on 
a number of other betting and gaming industries. In 
particular, it would require the Treasury to consider cuts 
in duty for those industries that have been disadvantaged 
by the national lottery. That is a worthwhile way to 
approach what is a complex matter. I would not at this 
stage wish the Government to cut a particular duty 
without the Treasury having first undertaken relevant 
research.
<P>
A study by Coopers and Lybrand, conducted on behalf 
of the Pool Promoters Association, explored the impact 
that the national lottery has had on the pool betting 
industry in particular. All Committee members are 
doubtless familiar with Littlewoods. Vernons and 
Zetters three pool betting companies that featured in my 
youth, although I never managed to win more than a few 
shillings. Those companies are part of British betting 
culture. Moreover, they provide a good deal of 
employment, particularly in the big cities where 
unemployment remains a problem. The demise if it 
came to that of any of those companies would therefore 
be a serious matter.
<P>
The Coopers and Lybrand study demonstrated beyond 
dispute that, prior to the national lottery's introduction in 
November 1994, the turnover of those companies has 
been increasing roughly in line with consumer 
expenditure. Upon the lottery's introduction, turnover 
went into a steep decline which has yet to stabilise.
<P>
We are all delighted by the success of the national 
lottery. It has contributed massively to the Exchequer and 
to good causes in all of our constituencies. However, it 
has become something of a juggernaut. Its very success 
has trampled on a number associated private undertakings 
in a way that was not fully predicted at the time.
<P>
Most startlingly, the pool betting companies have 
suffered greatly. Coopers and Lybrand has estimated that 
turnover has declined by some 53 per cent. since the 
lottery's introduction. Those figures do not take into 
account last year's further deterioration. The turnover for 
1996 is estimated to be £500 million lower than it would 
have been but for the national lottery's introduction.
<P>
The decline in turnover has affected employment in the 
industry, which has fallen from some 5,700 people in 
mid-1994 to about 1,650 in October 1997. Neither I nor 
the pool betting companies would claim that that decline 
can be attributed solely to the national lottery's impact. 
Efficiency gains were in any case in train, which 
undoubtedly proved labour saving. However, the figures 
exclude the many part-time collectors who we all 
remember who continue to collect money on a weekly 
basis. That job provides money for many people, 
particularly those who live in unemployment blackspots.
<P>
The Paymaster General may blame all of that on the 
previous Government, as he usually does. He might ask, 
"What did you do about it?" I remind him that we and, 
specifically, I responded to the situation as best I could. 
We were short of tax revenue but we cut pool betting duty 
from 37.5 per cent. in 1994 to 26.5 per cent. from May 
1996, which was a big reduction. We also cut general 
betting duty, which was of assistance to the horse-racing 
industry and to the betting industry generally. We 
considered that those industries had been hit by the 
introduction of the national lottery.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Since that duty cut, those industries have been hit 
further by the midweek lottery draw which began 
recently, and there is a continuing trend downwards. 
There are many reasons why that is serious, including the 
fact that the Foundation for Sports and the Arts and the 
Football Trust, which are charities, receive large sums of 
money from those pools companies. I have attended 
presentations in my constituency at which sums of money 
have been given to local good causes in sports and the 
arts, but such activities could be put at risk if the 
companies have to withdraw from charitable funding.
<P>
I am afraid that Labour Members have shown little 
interest in the employment or social consequences of 
some of the Bill's provisions. That is all the odder because 
many Labour Members represent constituencies that have 
been hit hard. Those who have connections with northern 
industrial towns, such as Manchester and Glasgow, and 
Merseyside, should be worried abut what happens to those 
large companies. London is not exempt because Zetters, 
which is, admittedly, the smallest of the companies, is 
based there.
<P>
This is another situation in which our proposals could 
assist the Government. Labour Members have presided 
over the introduction of damaging and highly regressive 
measures. They were apparently happy about the fact that 
the changes in retirement relief would hit the small 
entrepreneur and assist the big business man; and it is the 
lower paid employees, such as aid workers, who will be 
hit by changes in foreign earnings deductions, rather than 
the pop stars and the multinational tycoons. Even at this 
late stage, I appeal to the Government to show some 
interest in a home-grown industry which, it has been 
shown beyond doubt by an authoritative study, is 
suffering.
<P>
Our new clause will not solve the problem immediately 
or overnight, but it will at least require the Government 
to study the matter and to take consequential measures to 
offset the damage that is being caused. I commend it to 
the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. John Burnett (Torridge and West Devon):</B> New 
clause 13 is a highlighting clause or, in modern parlance, 
a reviewing clause.
<P>
The lottery has been successful and the new clause 
provides an opportunity to gauge some of its 
consequences, especially its impact on other gaming 
activities, such as the pools. That impact will be regularly 
brought to the attention of Ministers and of Members of 
Parliament. Minister will change the tax regime for other 
gaming activities to the extent that they consider to be 
appropriate.
<P>
To be accepted, taxation must be fair. Since the advent 
of the lottery, the profitability of pools companies and 
other gaming activities has fallen. The new clause would 
enable Ministers and Members of Parliament to gauge 
whether such loss of profitability should be balanced by 
a mitigation in the levels of taxation of those companies 
that run other gaming activities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I endorse the comments of my right hon. 
Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) in 
introducing the new clause. We welcome the outstanding 
success of the lottery, which exceeded the expectations of 
the previous Government who introduced it. However, 
other areas of the gaming business are in dire straits. The 
full figures, touched on by my right hon. Friend, are that 
since 1994, when the lottery was introduced, turnover in 
pools business has fallen by at least 60 per cent. in nominal 
terms and, in terms of employment, it has fallen by more 
than 70 per cent. Those are big figures but, worse still, there 
is evidence that the fall and decline has not yet bottomed 
out. In 1997, a further decline of 20 per cent. came about 
largely as a result of the introduction of the midweek lottery 
in February 1997.
<P>
With the introduction of the television-based 
scratchcard lottery this year, yet more pressures on the 
pools industry and the ratchet effect will continue to cause 
pain. So reduced profits for the pools industry means 
reduced investment in new products and marketing 
initiatives, but perhaps more seriously, as my right hon. 
Friend mentioned, a great reduction in the amount of 
money available for the Foundation for Sports and the 
Arts and the Football Trust.
<P>
The industry is in poor shape. The profits of 
Littlewoods, the biggest of the three firms mentioned by 
my right hon. Friend, have fallen by two thirds during the 
past four years, and its centres in Merseyside, Cardiff and 
Glasgow have been closed down. So, of the five sites from 
which it operated in 1994, only one remains. In the case 
of Vernons, two thirds of the work force have lost their 
jobs in Merseyside. Those are all areas about which the 
Government should be concerned, as we are.
<P>
At their peak in 1993-94, contributions to good 
causes to the Foundation for Sports and the Arts and the 
Football Trust amounted to some £94 million. Last year, 
that figure was down to £22 million, so less than a quarter 
is being contributed to good causes. As a direct 
consequence of that, in January of last year, the 
Foundation for Sports and the Arts ended its funding of 
the Sports Ground initiative, which has caused a large gap 
in the funding of that important scheme. That also comes 
at a time when the Government are raiding the lottery 
fund. The sports allocation from the lottery fund will 
suffer most on initial indication, well in excess of
£40 million to £50 million. Apart from employees who 
have lost their jobs, the biggest victim is the sports 
business as a whole, especially the voluntary and 
amateur sector.
<P>
The pools companies are having to compete with one 
arm tied behind their backs. They compete with the lottery 
for similar interests. Both the lottery and the pools have 
low average stakes; they both have high value prizes and 
long odds; they both operate on a regular weekly cycle 
and involve people tuning into the television or radio in 
order to find out the results.
<P>
So they are similar, but the lottery has become a higher 
profile business. Indeed if one considers the experience of 
overseas countries, the thriving pools business in 
Australia, for example, has all but disappeared following 
the introduction of a lottery there. I am not trying to 
denigrate the success of the lottery, but one must have 
regard to the downside effect on other areas of gaming.
<P>
As my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells said, 
gaming duty levels for pools have been reduced to
26.5 per cent. from the original rate of 42.5 per cent. But 
that is still on the high side when compared to other forms 
of gaming duty such as the 12 per cent. lottery duty rate 
what my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and East 
Chelmsford described in his eulogy to the bingo industry 
as "just 10 per cent." and the general betting duty rate 
of 6.75 per cent. Value added tax is 17.5 per cent. so
26.5 per cent. is still very high.
<P>
In Germany there is a common gaming duty rate 
between the pools and the lottery equivalent which is just 
16.66 per cent. France has a tax on winnings rather than on 
the stakes made.
<P>
There can be no sound economic or public rationale for 
continuing to impose such a high tax rate on the pools 
business alone. With the introduction of the national 
lottery, the previous Government, and, by their 
continuance, the present Government, have given their 
countenance to this harmless form of betting. I think that we 
all agree on that. Since the decline of the pools companies, 
the market share of Littlewoods, the market leader, has 
dropped from 80 per cent. to just 7 or 8 per cent., so there 
is no longer monopoly dominance either. The Government 
would be hard pressed to justify discriminating against the 
pools industry with such a high rate of duty.
<P>
Other restrictions apply to the pools industry. Its 
advertising in the broadcast media is greatly restricted, 
whereas the lottery has a high profile on television. The 
industry does not have the freedom for high-profile 
rollovers, as the lottery does, and it cannot have midweek 
competitions because the football league is not set up for 
that. The lottery pays out small winnings through an 
extensive retail outlet network, which the pools industry 
cannot do, and the lottery now has many multi-million 
pound prizes.
<P>
The effective rate of lottery duty works out at 
approximately 24 per cent. because it pays out 50 per cent. 
of its takings in prizes. The pools returns about
27 per cent. of its turnover in prizes. The pools duty 
should be reduced to some 17.5 per cent. to bring it down 
to an equivalent rate to the lottery and, essentially, bring 
it into line with VAT. There is clearly an enormous 
difference in the margin. The amendment would ensure 
that the Government monitored these discrepancies in 
what is a still volatile situation that stems from the demise 
of the pools against the continued incline in the lottery.
<P>
The Paymaster General will no doubt ask where the 
revenue that is lost to the Government can be made up if 
the duty levied against the pools is reduced. The law of 
diminishing returns applies here as ever more people are 
put off doing the pools, but the national lottery already 
brings in between £200 million and £300 million in extra 
duty anyway. The new TV scratch cards are expected to 
increase the scratch card market by about 25 per cent., 
which will bring in £23-odd million in duty to the 
Government. An increase of only 0.7 per cent. would 
compensate for the £35 million that would be allowed to 
remain with the pools industry, so there are many ways 
of addressing this matter without bringing about a net loss 
of revenue to the Treasury.
<P>
The pools industry is my major concern, but obviously 
there will be effects on other forms of gaming, including 
the British horse-racing business, which arguably is in an 
equally parlous state. Its present problem is that the prize 
money in this country is the lowest of any of the major 
racing nations in the world, with the exception of Ireland. 
Some major horse owners and trainers are leaving the 
British horse-racing circuit for more attractive prizes 
elsewhere. Doing the sums, one realises that the British 
horse-racing industry continues to survive only because 
of the preparedness of owners and trainers to subsidise it 
by paying in enormous amounts of costs as losses. It 
really does depend on owners. The industry here would, 
if approached, ask for a fairer share of the duty that 
bookies pay. If the amount that it claws back was 
increased to just 3 per cent., it would have a much more 
attractive and secure future in this country.
<P>
There are many sensible facets to the new clause. The 
gaming industry is in a great state of flux. The success of 
certain parts of it inevitably has a downside.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown (Cotswold):</B> Does my 
hon. Friend agree that the whole matter of the horse-race 
betting tax will have to be examined by the Government 
because of the advent of the internet, and that it will be 
possible to place bets on horses in any part of the world 
which will not be subject to United Kingdom tax?
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> My hon. Friend makes a fair point and 
brings us back to the subject of the internet, which I shall 
not go into now other than to remind the Committee of 
how many facets of people's lives it will affect. The 
primary duty review on the horse-racing industry will be 
undertaken next year as well, so there are many sides to 
the issue. The new clause merely requires the Government 
to examine it in the round rather than consider various 
gaming businesses individually.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gefforey Robinson:</B> We have had a fairly 
wide-ranging debate on new clause 13. It appears that it 
would allow reductions in the burden from general betting 
duty, full betting duty, bingo duty and amusement 
machine licence duty on the basis that these sectors have 
been adversely affected by the national lottery. Members 
of the Committee will agree that while the lottery has 
been a fantastic success, it has had an impact on at least 
one betting industry the pools.
<P>
During our Budget considerations, we looked most 
carefully at each of these sectors and at the respective 
cases for a reduction in the duty burden. We concluded 
that a duty cut was not justified for any of them. In 
particular, revenue receipts from bingo duty have 
increased, and general betting duty and amusement 
machine licence duty indicate that their sectors more than 
hold their own in the face of lottery competition and 
competition from many other areas of discretionary 
consumer expenditure. Equally, general betting duty has 
recovered its position with the help of a duty cut and 
significant deregulation.
<P>
We decided that the more profitable end of the 
amusement machine industry gaining machines, the 
very machines that the hon. member for East Worthing 
and Shoreham suggested should benefit from a reduction 
in duty could afford to pay more, so the applicable 
amusement machine duty was increased. In answer to the 
hon. Gentleman, I doubt whether there is a case for 
looking at these items in the round; we have to take them 
independently, on their merits.
<P>
However, I accept that the pools industry has suffered 
a decline in turnover since the introduction of the lottery. 
The industry has already received a great deal of 
assistance from cuts in pools betting duty from the 
pre-lottery rate of 37.5 per cent. to the current rate of
26.5 per cent. I am not convinced that a further cut would 
have a positive impact on pools turnover: I doubt whether 
it would help.
<P>
New clause 13 is unworkable, as I am sure the right 
hon. Member for Wells realises. It is technically flawed, 
and would not achieve its aim. More importantly, it would 
create an onerous and bureaucratic system of data 
collection for both the trade and officials. It would be 
impossible for the Treasury to satisfy itself through this 
form of monitoring that reductions in turnover related 
solely to competition from the lottery. How could we be 
sure of that? Any number of factors including the 
weather or the world cup could have their influence. The 
Opposition have not produced a very cleverly crafted new 
clause. They might like to reflect on the rather unusual 
course they propose of introducing important taxation 
changes through secondary legislation, rather than 
through the full parliamentary scrutiny achieved under 
primary legislation a process that the Opposition have 
urged at each of our sittings. If the turnover in those 
industries increased, would the Opposition be content for 
the duty rate to be increased by that method?
<P>
I assure the Committee that as part of the Budget 
considerations, we shall continue to consider carefully 
those duties and the ability of industries, particularly the 
pools industry, to bear them. We shall also keep in mind 
the significant impact of the lottery on that industry, 
which is an important part of our sporting and gambling 
life. I hope that that assurance will enable the right hon. 
Gentleman to withdraw his unworkable new clause.

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am grateful to the Paymaster 
General for acknowledging that the industries are affected 
in the way that we have detailed, although I have to say 
that when he takes refuge in the technical deficiencies,

We have sought to highlight the issue and to ask the 
Government to make their own assessment which can 
never be scientifically precise of the effect of the 
national lottery on the turnover of other industries. Such

degree of speculation and assessment, as is made clear in

the Government have a copy.

Mrs. Dunwoody and Mr. Gale, for the skill and patience 
with which you have presided over and guided our 
deliberations. We are flattered that you have dressed 
appropriately for our final sitting. By this stage, members 
of the Committee feel like a somewhat ragged army, but 
we have enjoyed your chairmanship, and that of your 
co-Chairmen. We thank Mrs. Dunwoody for her general 
invitation to members of the Committee to a celebratory 
drink with her later in the week. I also thank others who 
have attended us, especially the Clerks, and staff of the 
Official Report, who have, as usual, done us the service 
of translating our garbled contributions into limpid prose.
<P>
This is not the end of proceedings on the Bill and we 
shall re-engage in combat next week, on Report. We are 
grateful for the occasions on which the Government have 
listened to our points and criticisms. They have made 
several concessions and will, I am sure, make more in 
response to the impact of events and to the inevitable 
flaws and deficiencies in the Bill, which will continue to 
be unravelled. I end, Mr. Butterfill, by reaffirming my 
gratitude to you and your co-Chairmen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> On behalf of Government 
Members, I add my thanks to those of the right hon. 
Gentleman. As the Minister, it is also appropriate for me 
to thank the Clerks, the staff of the Official Report, the 
police, staff of the Serjeant at Arms and all the other staff 
and advisers who have served Government Members with 
such attention and speed.
<P>
Two Opposition promotions only two, I am sorry to 
say took place during our deliberations. First, of the hon. 
Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) 
whose services we shall lose as he has been appointed to 
the shadow health team, and, secondly, of the hon. 
Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford, of whose 
services we are in even greater need, who has joined the 
distinguished Front-Bench team. We have had engaging 
encounters with that team over the past few weeks. I also 
extend warm thanks to my Inland Revenue, Customs and 
Excise and Treasury officials.
<P>
Finally, Mr. Butterfill, I cannot find words to express 
my gratitude for your good humour, charm and readiness 
to accommodate members of the Committee, other than 
to say that they have been of the highest quality.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I should like to associate my party and 
my colleagues with the thanks offered by the right hon.
