<H4><center>Clause 149</center></H4>
<H4><center>Exchange Equalisation Account. 1979 c. 30</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): I beg to move amendment No. 454, in page 114, line 40, leave out from ``in'' to ``accounts'' in line 41 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`accordance with generally accepted principles of accounting'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 454 and some aspects of the next amendment might be better dealt with under the Government Resources and Accounts Bill. The point of the amendment is simple. If the Treasury wants transparency and accountability in drawing up the equalisation accounts, it must prepare them on the same basis as companies engaged in currency transactions do and according to standard accounting practices. Surely it is unhelpful for the provision to say that the Treasury can prepare those accounts on whatever basis it chooses.

<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): In another place, amendments are about to be considered to the Government Resources and Accounts Bill, which the Economic Secretary and I spent a long while debating in this House. That would allow the Financial Reporting Advisory Board to be the body that determines which accounting principles apply to Government accounts. I hope that the Economic Secretary will tell us that, if that amendment is accepted in the Lords, the same body will define standards for the exchange equalisation account. I understand that there is some possibility of the Government's accepting that amendment. As my hon. Friend says, we want to achieve some equilibration between the general principles that apply to Government accounts and those that apply to the EEA.

<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson)</b> I hesitate to introduce into our proceedings anything that the Lords are doing. We shall doubtless have a further opportunity to debate the Government Resources and Accounts Bill when it returns to this House in the fullness of time.</B><P>

<P>
It is not appropriate at the moment to make a general commitment to accounting principles that apply to private companies, because Parliament has already accepted in the context of the Government Resources and Accounts Bill that those principles require adapting for public sector accounts. That general requirement does not apply elsewhere in Government accounts.

<P>
The amendment is too inflexible. There cannot be any doubt about moving the EEA on to an accruals basis. I can reassure Opposition Members that monthly figures for 2000 to 2001 are being published on that basis. However, we want to ensure that we can compile the EEA in line with the best accounting practice, without continually amending the legislation as accounting standards change and develop. It would therefore be a problem to accept the amendment.

<P>
In any case, annual reporting and annual publication will take place, and that will include publication of the accounting policies, to ensure that the basis of the accounting is clear. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is reassured and that he will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I shall press the Economic Secretary a little further If the arrangements to which my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) alluded were adopted as the result of a Lords amendment or further consideration by the Commons of the Government Resources and Accounts Bill, it would be appropriate to apply the same principles to the exchange equalisation account. That is a conditional point, but I would like to hear some confirmation that the Government have such an intent.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The hon. Gentleman talks about what might happen. As it is so early in the morning, I am not tempted to follow the path of ``might'' and ``what if''. However, it is worth pointing out that the amendment does not make sense, because it does not refer to a recognised framework such as the generally accepted accounting practice framework. As I said, it is inappropriate to apply a private sector framework to the public sector, unmodified. The situation is not as simple as the hon. Gentleman suggests.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I shall not dwell on the issue for long, because I am sure that the Economic Secretary is right to say that they will be discussed again when we consider Lords amendments to the Government Resources and Accounts Bill. Although we are not discussing the biggest issue in Government accounting, the exchange equalisation account is nevertheless important and tricky. As the Economic Secretary will be aware, the proper level of foreign exchange reserves has been discussed for the better part of a decade. It is difficult to know to what extent there is an implicit lien on the reserves. A predecessor to the Financial Secretary tried for a long time to find a means of liberating some of the reserves. That would have had interesting accounting effects on the EEA.

<P>
We need to know that the measure will not be used as the Government's Bermuda cash box-to hark back to our discussions on double tax relief-in and out of which resources will be shifted, not for personal gain or shareholder gain but for political purposes, to disguise the movements that transparent resource accounts would otherwise reveal. That is not in the spirit of resource accounting.

<P>
We shall not press the amendment or lock the Economic Secretary into some assurance for the sake of a hypothetical situation. We simply want her to tell us that once the standards and definitions for Government accounts have been resolved, the EEA will not be a special exempt entity, to be used as a subterfuge for distorting the otherwise transparent accounts. If she told us that, we could rest easy.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will rest easy. First, I shall re-emphasise the first point that I made earlier. We shall report and publish annually. I remind the hon. Gentleman that it was this Government and not previous Governments who decided to publish the EEA. That is now in the public domain, so we have everything to be proud of in terms of improved practice.

<P>
On 28 April, we announced our commitment to preparing United Kingdom gap accounts for EEA for 2000–01. To meet that commitment, we have put in place an accounting system that observes UK gap from the start of the financial year. We have also satisfied International Monetary Fund requirements, so we are meeting all national and international demands.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We are delighted with the Economic Secretary's final response on the matter. As it meets our objectives, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move, in page 114, line 43, leave out from beginning to end of line 7 on page 115 and insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2) Following the relevant account date and no later than the relevant publication date the following steps are to take place:

<P>
(a) the Treasury shall send the accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General;

<P>
(b) the Comptroller and Auditor General shall examine and certify the accounts, issue a report on them and return the certified accounts and report to the Treasury; and

<P>
(c) the Treasury shall lay the certified accounts and the report before each House of Parliament.

<P>
(3) In subsection (2) above ``the relevant account date'' is the last day of the financial year to which the accounts in question relate and the ``relevant publication date'' is the date by which a company would be required to file its accounts with Companies House in respect of an accounting period which ended on the relevant account date.

<P>
(4) The Treasury shall also publish the certified accounts and report in an electronic form capable of access by members of the public.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Most of the amendment refers to the point previously discussed. If the Comptroller and Auditor General is required to audit the account in the interests of transparency and accountability, the Government could apply the same principles and processes as pertain in the corporate sector. We also suggest that the accounts might be put straight on to the net.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The amendment would tie the audit and publication of accounts to a timetable laid down for companies in the Companies Act 1985. It would also make electronic publication compulsory.

<P>
It is unnecessary to manufacture a link to the timetable for companies' publication of accounts, because the clause follows a well established and generally accepted timetable for audit and publication of Government accounts. In particular, the clause follows the timetable for other main central Government accounts, namely the consolidated fund, national loans fund and the debt management account timetables. There is no case for treating the EEA differently. For consistency's sake, we would have to change the timetable in the same way for other Government accounts, which would be a waste of time.

<P>
The publication date for EEA accounts would be only one month later than a private sector account, and scope has been made in the clause to tighten the timetable by statutory instrument. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) for suggesting compulsory electronic publication. However, EEA accounts are already published on the Treasury's website, and monthly EEA figures have been published on the Bank of England's website for the past 12 months, so the public have access to the figures. There is no question of dropping such publication. The Government's commitment to electronic publishing in general and to openness for EEA accounts is well known.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I congratulate the Government on the extent to which accounts are being published on the net. I am satisfied with the Economic Secretary's response about the timetable. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>The Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo) </b>I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.</B><P>

<P>
New clause 3 implements one of the recommendations of the Grabiner report, by making income tax fraud a specific criminal offence. The clause will not make income tax a criminal offence for the first time, as the Inland Revenue has had investigative and prosecuting powers for tax fraud under general criminal law for years. It does not break any new ground in its drafting, as it closely follows legislation enacted in 1998, concerned with fraud relating to national insurance contributions. There are also precedents in indirect tax legislation, such as that concerning value added tax.

<P>
The new clause has its roots in the Government's concern about what is called the informal, hidden, shadow or illegitimate economy. In the Chancellor's pre-Budget statement in November, he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the informal or hidden economy is draining billions of pounds in fraudulent benefit claims and unpaid taxes. That loss of revenue  the waste of resources, cannot be allowed to continue.-[Official Report, 9 November 1999; Vol. 337, c. 888.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Chancellor therefore asked Lord Grabiner QC, a leading commercial barrister, to carry out a review of the informal economy and to examine ways to move the economic activity into legitimate business practice. His report was published in March, and the Chancellor announced in the Budget that he would implement his recommendations.

<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The report recommended several new incentives for people wanting to leave the informal economy. We believe that some people who run their businesses in that way want to engage in the legitimate economy. The informal economy can prevent the growth of such businesses because they can try to conceal cash flow by not completing their PAYE and VAT returns properly. That causes difficulties. The Government want to consider strategies to give businesses the opportunity to move.

<P>
One initiative recommended by the report is the tax and benefit confidential helpline, which was launched this week. It allows people in the informal economy to receive advice on a no-names basis on how to leave it, and describes incentives for them to do so. It explains to them what their tax position would be. Many one-person and other small companies in the informal economy are not properly aware of their rights. Although they may not pay one set of taxes, they might be entitled to other reliefs and proper advice can help them discover a balance.

<P>
Lord Grabiner also recommended new measures to take action against those who pass up incentives to move into the formal economy and who persist in concealing transactions. The new measures, including the new clause, will take effect from next year. The new clause creates a specific criminal offence of being
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>knowingly concerned in the fraudulent evasion of income tax.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Specifically, that means collusion between an employer and employee to pay the employee cash that is not shown for the purposes of PAYE or national insurance. It also means that the employee has to make benefit claims because he has concealed the cash. A chain of events is created. There were no powers for us to deal with that, and Lord Grabiner considered that we needed to concentrate on such incidents.

<P>
The Inland Revenue already prosecutes some of the most serious tax frauds in the Crown court, usually for the common law offence of cheating the public revenue. However, Lord Grabiner considered that the Inland Revenue centred too much on prosecuting the largest frauds, to the exclusion of smaller but no less serious tax frauds committed by participants in the informal economy. As he noted, the difficulty in changing the emphasis is that there is sometimes no appropriate charge that can be used for trials in magistrates courts. Lord Grabiner believed that we needed to concentrate lesser charges in magistrates courts, which is what the power in the new clause enables us to do. The Government accept that magistrates courts should consider lesser charges than those that would be taken to a Crown court. Such offences are none the less serious; because such offences are criminal offences, they will be publicised and there will therefore be a deterrence effect. It is important to encourage people not to go down that route.

<P>
In England and Wales, the new offence will be tried in the magistrates court but that does not mean that the Inland Revenue can insist that a case is tried before the magistrates. There remains an option of trial by jury in the Crown court and magistrates may direct, without reference to the Revenue, that a case should be tried in a Crown court, if they take the view that that is warranted by the seriousness of the crime. All defendants have an unconditional right to elect to be tried in the Crown court.

<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): Is that power of the magistrate to direct a case to the Crown court the reason behind subsection (2)(b), which provides for an offence, on conviction on indictment, that Lord Grabiner did not suggest in his report?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. That provision gives the offence a proper place within the rights for election to the Crown court, although Lord Grabiner's view was that we should make such offences exclusively a matter for trial in magistrates courts. However, magistrates themselves have the power, and there is nothing that we can or should do to take it from them-to say without reference to the prosecuting authorities that a case is too serious to be tried in the magistrates court. The penalties available to the Crown court are different. Although Lord Grabiner focused on having an appropriate charge and a magistrates offence, which is what the new clause provides, we had to fit that within the criminal justice system. I am sure that members of the Committee would not expect otherwise.

<P>
The Inland Revenue will deploy an extra 50 members of staff to conduct the criminal investigation of such fraud, who will work as part of a special criminal investigation team in the Inland Revenue special compliance office. As at present, local tax offices will not carry out criminal investigations; that will be done by those who have the authority and sufficient seniority to decide whether a case should proceed to prosecution. Some of the investigations will also be carried out jointly with the Benefits Agency and sometimes with Customs and Excise, as Lord Grabiner recommended. That would lead to joint prosecutions and covers the point that I made earlier, particularly in relation to a company seeking to conceal a large amount of cash within the business; it is likely that in order to do that it would commit a number of offences.

<P>
The new clause puts the measure to combat tax evasion on a sounder footing, enabling us to deal appropriately with the offence. Anyone defrauding tax can no longer feel safe in the knowledge that our system of taking cases against them is cumbersome. We now have a direct route to the magistrates courts. It facilitates co-ordinated action across Departments against those who seek to defraud the tax and benefits systems simultaneously. I hope that the Committee will support the new clause.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I should like to make a few observations in the light of the Paymaster General's helpful exposition of the thinking behind the new clause. The Opposition also believe that the informal economy often represents an evasion of tax that represents an unfair burden on the law-abiding public. We, too, look sympathetically on constructive and workable moves to bring more people within the proper tax system and to spread the burden of taxes as widely as possible. However, we are alert to the underlying philosophy of tax, which is that Governments should aim to create taxes that are low, simple and properly enforced. The Government are drifting into a situation in which taxes are rising. That is certainly true of the overall burden. Taxes are also getting more complicated. The Government are therefore ignoring the first two principles and putting increasing emphasis on the third-enforcement. I urge them to bear in mind the need to-to use a popular phrase-tackle the cause of the crime as well as the consequence.

<P>
The Paymaster General outlined the reason for giving the power in the first instance to the magistrates courts. We are dealing, almost by definition, with complicated matters. I have listened to the conditions carefully and I note that there will be provisions for transferring a case to the Crown court. I have a modest acquaintance with the magistrates courts-as an observer, I hasten to add-and although justices of the peace are a splendid and irreplaceable part of our court system, there are limits to their expertise and training in dealing with these matters.

<P>
How many extra cases does the Paymaster General envisage going before the magistrates courts system? How many extra cases might go to the higher courts? She mentioned the 50 extra staff for the Inland Revenue. That is a considerable extra effort. I was pleased to hear that there would be a separation of the prosecution and investigation functions within the Inland Revenue. That is most important, although she did not say exactly how the structure would give effect to that, whether the two sections would report separately or whether the separation would be more than just informal Chinese walls. However, I accept the hon. Lady's assurance that people investigating tax affairs should not also be involved in prosecution.

<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The main issue, which other hon. Members will also pursue, is the breadth of the new clause. The offence will be committed by those who are ``knowingly concerned'' in the fraudulent evasion of income tax. Such a case may involve a pensioner who asks the youngster next door to paint her garden fence and gives him a fiver at the end of the day. When challenged, she may say that it is up to him to pay any tax due, but that as he is young, has a personal allowance and a low tax liability, he is probably not liable to pay tax. Surely, it is not her job, as the customer in such a small transaction, to ask questions about whether the person to whom she gives cash has an income tax liability. Is not a £5 note legal tender? What crime is she committing? What is wrong with her settling her debt in cash?

<P>
As drafted, and if it is widely interpreted, the proposal would mean that that pensioner would be knowingly concerned. We all know about the cash economy and it is inconceivable to a reasonable person that any percentage of the £5 should end up with the Inland Revenue. Therefore, it could be judged that the pensioner was knowingly concerned. How far we have come from the traditional view that it is up to the taxpayer to settle his or her affairs and that the person settling the debt or paying for the service is not involved in the tax transaction between the taxpayer and the Revenue.

<P>
I hope and expect that the Paymaster General will say that the Government have no intention of tracking down trivial sums of money and persecuting the people involved, which would upset the relationship between the tax authorities and the taxpaying public. Nevertheless, there is no de minimis suggestion in the new clause, so we need to know what the Paymaster General understands by the phrase ``knowingly concerned'', which could affect not only people who pay or receive cash but even those who watch the transaction or who know about it.

<P>
For example, if I see my wife leaving money on the kitchen table for someone who has painted our garden gate, am I ``knowingly concerned'' in the fraudulent evasion of income tax? The net gets wider; perhaps all three of us will go to prison if some officious local Inland Revenue official happens to be watching a member of the informal economy doing odd-job work in my household. He may suppose that we are involved in some sort of racket, especially if he hears us say, ``That was a wonderful piece of work; I shall suggest that my neighbour also has his gate painted. Why don't you do the whole row and we'll all get together on it?''

<P>
The hon. Lady should tell us more about the phrase, which is worryingly imprecise, and which the courts could interpret very widely.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Roger Casale </B>(Wimbledon): The right hon. Gentleman said that he wanted the Government to be tough on tax evasion and tough on the causes of tax evasion. Although we have to be careful that the net is not spread too widely, will the right hon. Gentleman go on the record to congratulate the Government on seeking to tackle the tax evasion of the many, not of the few?

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The hon. Gentleman is on tender ground on the issue of tax avoidance, which has backfired on the Government recently. There are scores of pages in the Bill about tax avoidance, but a prominent Labour supporter has been avoiding tax on an epic scale. That is another example of the Government telling the many to do one thing, when the few who support the Labour party, are quietly doing another. I can see you shifting menacingly in your chair, Mr. Cook, so I shall return to the new clause-

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I assure right hon. and hon. Members that my menacing shift was of an impartial nature.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> You have established that reputation over many weeks, Mr. Cook, and I do not doubt what you say for a minute.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Dorrell </B>(Charnwood): I have been listening carefully to my right hon. Friend and I agree with him that the phrase ``knowingly concerned'' is imprecise. Indeed, it may be worse than he describes. I may be at risk of being guilty of an offence if I am knowingly concerned with something that is called fraudulent evasion of income tax. To take my right hon. Friend's example, not only must I concern myself with the tax affairs of the young chap who mows the lawn but I must ask myself whether any evasion of tax is not merely evasion but fraudulent evasion. The word ``fraudulent'' implies that there is a distinction, which the taxpayer is obliged to make, between evasion-in which case the onlooker paying for the service is not committing an offence-and the new concept of fraudulent evasion, in which case he is committing an offence. That would be an unreasonable burden for an ordinary member of the public to bear.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My right hon. Friend's point was predictably subtle and telling. There is a new distinction between evasion of income tax which, by implication, would not incur penalties, and fraudulent evasion, which would. How the little old lady in my story, or, indeed, my wife and I, are to make such a subtle distinction is a question that the Paymaster General may wish to answer in due course.

<P>
What will be the position of tax advisers? Clearly, if their advice is sought about a tax scheme, they are knowingly involved in the matter. If it is subsequently found, perhaps by a court, that a tax plan or scheme falls on the wrong side of the divide between avoidance and evasion, the tax adviser could fall foul of the clause, even though he is innocently engaged in a scheme to mitigate tax-an activity that the Government judge acceptable. Tax avoidance is not a crime; many judges have famously ruled that it is the right of any citizen to organise his tax affairs to minimise the amount that he has to pay to the state. In advancing savings schemes which include tax exemption, the Government encourage us to avoid tax.

<P>
To draw out the threads of the proposal, I suggest that if it is subsequently judged by the Inland Revenue that a scheme amounts to evasion, all those who were involved in suggesting or investigating it, right down to the junior manager in the accountancy firm, could be deemed to be knowingly concerned in the fraudulent evasion of income tax.

<P>
I repeat that I am questioning the new clause in a constructive vein because it is unwise to put wide powers on the statute book in the hope that they will do the job. In fact, they will tie up the courts, especially magistrates courts, in detailed consideration of what is fraudulent evasion and what is simply evasion or avoidance. Clarity and precision are as important as intention in proposals to tackle the informal economy.

<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Cook, for the last day of the Committee's proceedings.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman has a crystal ball, which has not been bequeathed to me.

<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> That is a good point; I was making a prophesy.

<P>
I welcome the Paymaster General's helpful introductory remarks, but I want to know why the new clause was tabled only this week. Lord Grabiner's report, ``The Informal Economy'', was published in March. He stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>this report is rushed and necessarily something of a bird's eye view.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Paymaster General explain why the new clause was rushed before the Committee? Lord Grabiner's report was available in March and the Chancellor accepted his recommendations. The proposal should have been in the Bill at the outset to allow time for wider consultation.

<P>
I seek clarification of the Inland Revenue's use of what I am told is called the Hansard procedure-the ability to discuss what may be been fraud with a company or an individual, but to use civil or out-of-court settlements to encourage the taxpayer's full disclosure and co-operation. Can the Minister assure me that that procedure will remain in place, as Lord Grabiner suggested? If so, it is unlikely that there will be a huge increase in the number of prosecutions.

<P>
Why does new clause 3 refer only to income tax fraud? Lord Grabiner's report did not refer to capital gains tax fraud, but I thought that the Government might take the opportunity to extend the powers to capital gains tax.

<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) criticised the phraseology of the new clause, which gives powers that the Government appear to have borrowed from other legislation, especially that on value added tax. I am anxious about the application of the proposal to some types of employment. How will it affect the person who pays for a service, or the self-employed person who provides it?

<P>
The right hon. Gentleman referred to a payment that he or his wife might make to an odd-job person, but there is a sliding scale. It may not be a one-off relationship; a cleaner or a gardener may come to a person's home every week; a plumber may visit periodically. Will a person who pays for those services have to find out whether the person giving them is meeting his tax obligations? Will a straightforward payment, with or without a receipt, be caught by the new clause? If so, that would be very worrying because it would bring people receiving services into the criminal sphere, which may not be what Parliament intends. I hope that the Paymaster General will confirm that people who employ gardeners and others in an informal way will not be caught by the new clause.

<P>
I state for the record that we welcome the Government's approach to Lord Grabiner's report. It is important to tighten up on tax evasion and the new clause will help in that respect, provided that the hon. Lady can clarify its intentions.

<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I shall not repeat the points made by hon. Gentlemen, but I echo them. How will the new clause operate in respect of other measures? Under the all-crimes, money-laundering legislation it is a criminal offence not just to be knowingly concerned in the fraudulent evasion of tax but to have a suspicion of it. The latter relates essentially to professionals, but in principle it can relate to anyone. At the very least, we want standardised measures on the matter.

<P>
Secondly, I put on record my strong criticism of the Grabiner report. The chairman of the tax faculty at the Institute of Chartered Accountants was highly critical of it. He referred to the report as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>shoddy, hurried and untroubled by lack of evidence for its proposals<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The institute had six objections to the report. The first was that, in allowing tax authorities access to information from banks, credit reference agencies, suppliers and customers, it was letting the state compile dossiers on business and people. The second was that the Government were allowing magistrates to try the new offence of fraudulently avoiding income tax, which is particularly relevant to the new clause, because the Inland Revenue assumed that it would be easier to convince lay magistrates than a High Court judge or jury. The third was that the infamous construction industry sub-contractor's scheme would effectively make it illegal to be self-employed in the building industry and that such draconian powers should not be extended to other areas. The fourth was that making new companies register with the Revenue immediately, rather than after 18 months, would set additional obstacles in the path of start-ups, and, if overlooked, could criminalise innocent people. The fifth was that the institute felt that it was not for officials to waive penalties for tax evasion on an ad hoc basis, but it was for Parliament to set the rules. The sixth was a point that I raised in a different context. The report failed to distinguish between fraud and negligence, which would, if anything, draw people into the black economy.

<P>
The Grabiner report was not adequately considered by the Treasury, nor has it been adequately debated. I do not say that what comes out of it will not be adequately considered, but hon. Members should know that the report was poorly received by professionals.

<P>
The phrase ``knowingly concerned'' should provide the protections that we discussed. A High court judge would probably interpret the phrase to be essentially about being party to an organised fraud and not, as the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells, described, people paying modest amounts of cash to cleaning ladies and children doing a bit of gardening. We all know what is meant in that context.

<P>
Like my right hon. Friend, I hope that the Paymaster General will use this occasion to make it absolutely clear that the intent of the new clause is limited. I am particularly concerned about lawyers and acountants falling foul of this if there are increasing areas of greyness in tax law and something that they advised their clients to do is ruled to be tax evasion. It would be wrong for them to be found guilty retrospectively under the new clause.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I want to add a precise point to the general points that have been made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells, my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs and the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton, with all of which I concur. I hope that the Paymaster General can allay our fears by doing something that I shall ask her to do.

<P>
The first danger here is that we may be about to accept a new clause that contains a set of terms that could go wider than is intended by either the Government or us. The second is that the Paymaster General will simply tell us how she thinks the courts will interpret it and how she thinks the Inland Revenue will enforce it. I do not doubt her good faith about that, but it is not enough and will not solve the problem. The fact is that she does not know and cannot control how the many departments of the Inland Revenue will enforce the clause. She may do her best, but she cannot guarantee that she will succeed in directing that vast army of conscientious officials.

<P>
Much more worrying, neither she nor we, quite properly, have the slightest control over how the courts will interpret a phrase. The fact that the courts have so far interpreted it in one way is, alas, not much guide to how they will interpret it in future. We are dealing here with statutory construction, and these things alter over time. Therefore, pleasant and illuminating as it will no doubt be to hear the Paymaster General tell us how she thinks the Inland Revenue will apply the new clause or the courts will interpret it, it will not do.

<P>
Before we accept the clause, we want to be sure that it will catch companies such as illegitimate sweatshops that are paying large numbers of employees in cash, conspiring with their employees to claim benefits so that they can underpay them and engaging in all sorts of other nefarious acts. We are all agreed that such evil people-their actions are genuinely evil-should be caught as quickly as possible and sent to jail or given a swingeing fine. We also want to be sure that the clause cannot catch the sorts of cases that my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells, my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell), the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton and my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs described.

<P>
We are dealing with something of the utmost seriousness. We could be dealing with millions of people. Cases such as these that have been adduced take place daily. I do not say for a moment that until now the Inland Revenue has been rushing around trying to prosecute individuals who have paid £5 to have their gate painted. Of course it has not, but we are legislators and we are being asked to look at a piece of legislation that will affect the lives of those clobbered by it and could substantially affect an important element of our economy. There are perfectly legitimate operators who do not earn above the earnings threshold or the VAT threshold, and who collect money in small quantities for providing a range of services to hundreds of thousands, perhaps even millions of people.

<P>
If such people are operating fraudulently, they should be clobbered. There is no question about that. But if the people who pay those supposedly legitimate operators are to be imprisoned when the operators turn out to be fraudulent, such payments will no longer be made. My right hon. Friend will not ask his wife to conduct an investigation into the tax affairs of the person who is coming to clean the house or paint the gate. People will collectively decide not to employ such a person. They will go to a larger firm that can issue a VAT invoice so that they have cast-iron protection against being chucked in the jug. My right hon. Friend and his wife have far too much at stake to put themselves in a position in which they could be hauled up. Millions of others are in the same position.

<P>
The critical point here is to know that the courts will not be able to interpret the new clause in such a way that it would catch people making such payments. There is only one way to do that. I suspect that we will not find a turn of phrase that would eliminate the possibility of catching such people without vast acres of inoperative drafting. The only way is for the Minister to make a statement that has a clear effect in Pepper v. Hart terms. We want not guidance on how things may be interpreted or applied but an absolutely clear Pepper v.  Hart statement. I am vastly reassured to see the Minister nodding. I look forward to hearing it.

<P>
I apologise for labouring the point. I want to be absolutely clear about what we need. We need a statement that in passing this new clause, Parliament intends to catch only those individuals who engage in something that they have extremely good reason to suspect involves a fraudulent evasion of income tax. We need to have on the record something to say that Parliament does not intend to place a responsibility on ordinary citizens to conduct an investigation into whether a payment, which in itself is no fraudulent evasion of anything, might be, when aggregated with another series of payments of which they have no knowledge, a case of fraudulent evasion.

<P>
This is tedious but incredibly important. The courts will look back to the record of this debate to guide their decisions. If the Minister says the right things today, the clause will do good. If not, it may do good but it may also do incalculable harm. For once, we are in real time. What the Paymaster General says now is not just a matter of happy party politics or the badinage of parliamentary debate. Her words will have an effect on the lives of ordinary people.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The contributions on new clause 3 have raised a number of important points. As the Minister responsible for the Inland Revenue and Customs, I always take extremely seriously the question of their powers and how they can be used. People expect that. Those departments are charged by Parliament with the responsibility of collecting the tax that Parliament deems must be collected. However, they must discharge their powers in a way that is balanced with citizens' rights in a civilised society. The Government have always couched debates in terms of rights and responsibilities. Taxpayers have a right to the correct advice and a responsibility to pay the correct amount of tax.

<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
All members of the Committee have made helpful comments. Before I deal with what we mean by someone who knowingly fraudulently evaded tax, I will respond to the important points made by the right hon. Member for Wells. The level or complexity of tax is a separate argument from that of evasion. The new clause is primarily concerned with PAYE. It has a sister support power in the national insurance provisions, but that is not a matter for this Committee. We are discussing what all members of the Committee have described as the serious cases, in which the owners of companies systematically collude with their employees to pay them in such a way that it does not show in the books and PAYE is not paid.

<P>
I will deal with the important point about the words ``knowingly'' and ``fraudulent evasion''. I must be honest with the Committee. My officials will smile when they hear this, but initially I said to them, ``Surely evasion is fraud'', and asked why it needed to be qualified as ``fraudulent evasion''. I have received assurances, which I will pass on to the Committee. The juxtaposition of the words ``knowingly'' and ``fraudulent evasion'' reinforces exactly which offences the provision is aimed at.

<P>
Let us take the question of someone who is knowingly concerned in the evasion of income tax. I want to make it clear that it is not enough for this purpose to show that a person should have suspected that someone was evading tax. The person must have knowledge and involvement in the fraud. For example, he could help someone evade tax by the helping to produce false business records.

<P>
People may ask why we have put the words ``fraudulent'' and ``evasion'' together. I am reliably informed by people who know better than I do that, in English usage, ``to evade'' can mean to dodge, without any dishonest intent. Although ``evasion'' has come to imply dishonesty in the context of tax, the Bill needs to be drafted tightly. ``Fraudulent'' may not appear to add much to ``evasion'', but the expression ``fraudulent evasion'' is well precedented and subject to interpretation by the courts. Therefore, it is sensible to stick with the tried and tested formula to produce the desired effect.

<P>
Let us take the example given of painting a gate for £5. We are not legislating for such instances. A person may not have declared income for benefit purposes, but that is not covered. We are concerned only with tax. The hon. Member for West Dorset said that it was important to ask how the courts would interpret the words. Our view is that the phrase ``knowingly concerned in'' could not be interpreted as including all people who suspected that others might be evading income tax. We do not intend to prosecute everyone on a street because one gate was painted for £5.

<P>
It may help to give an idea of the number of prosecutions that we expect. Committee members will be pleased to hear that I am not setting a quota, as that would provoke questions about whether people were prosecuted simply to make up the quota. It is likely that prosecutions will reach the low hundreds in the magistrates courts. As I said, we hope that successful prosecutions will act as a deterrent. We have chosen the magistrates courts not because we think that it will be easier to achieve successful prosecutions there, but because they are appropriate for a lesser offence that attracts a lesser penalty. However, as I said, we cannot block rights to go to the Crown court.

<P>
It might help to place the power in the context of the Revenue's prosecution policy.

<P>

<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I find the Paymaster General's explanation for why we use the phrase ``fraudulent evasion'' rather than just the word ``evasion'' persuasive, but I think that I use her words precisely when I say that she said that ``knowingly concerned in'' meant ``knowingly involved in''.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Concerned and involved.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Why does the Bill not say that? The word ``involved'' is a clearer concept in the context than the word ``concerned''.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> To be concerned in a fraud is to be actively involved in it. Putting someone in a position to evade tax is not active involvement. Collusion is required. Someone might pay an employee, get a receipt for that and have no reason to suspect that the employee has not declared his income.

<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): Sometimes individuals are invited to pay in cash by a trader or a provider of services-

<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> With a nod and a wink.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Exactly. Would such a person be jeopardised by the new clause?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> No. I have to go back to the beginning. If the hon. Gentleman will excuse me, I shall not repeat what I have said this morning, but I have answered his question. My parents, for example, are of a generation that prefers to pay in cash. They do not like debts. They inform me that, in the old days, the payment of cash as opposed to hire purchase meant that they received a better discount. The use of cash is not the issue. Hon. Members are widening the debate beyond the specific focus of the new clause.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I would like to bring the Paymaster General back to the concept of concern and involvement, because her response made things less clear. She appeared to say that one had to be concerned and involved, but that one could be concerned without being involved. Could someone commit an offence under the new clause without being involved in the fraudulent evasion by the person who should pay tax? Is the concept of involvement relevant?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I sought to clarify the position and did not mean to confuse the right hon. Gentleman. We are talking about active involvement, so I qualified ``involved''. I was trying to anticipate the fact that I would be asked what ``involved'' meant. It means actively involved in a designed course of action.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I understand why Ministers will not accept amendments on the hoof, not least because it would not be in order, but would the Paymaster General accept an amendment that contained the words ``concerned'' and ``actively involved'', as those are the words that she used?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I have been advised that ``concerned'' and ``involved'' are the same, for the purpose of the new clause. If the drafting is not considered tight enough on reflection, I shall return to it. I was careful to ask my officials why certain words were used, not least because I am not legally qualified. I wanted to be assured about points similar to those that hon. Members have raised.

<P>
A statement of the Inland Revenue's current prosecution policy was published last year and so can be scrutinised. The Revenue carries out prosecution in serious cases on a range of offences and in all areas of law for which its board is responsible. The board operates a policy of selective prosecution, focusing on cases in which prosecution most promotes and assists compliance with the law by deterring tax contribution and tax credit fraud. I gave the Committee some estimate of how many cases we might expect of, for example, people painting gates for £5. It is difficult to talk about the number of cases of that type that we might take, because that is qualified by our prosecution policy, which selects and focuses on cases to reinforce our overall enforcement strategy.

<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells asked whether tax advisers could fall unwittingly. No one could be convicted as a matter of general law unless it was proved that he or she had a dishonest intention. The hon. Members for Kingston and Surbiton and for Arundel and South Downs asked about money laundering. The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs contradicted some of his hon. Friends about some of the powers concerning that offence. The money laundering rules are much tougher, and we have not applied them in the clause, which is consistent and on a par with precedents for VAT and national insurance. Money laundering is considered a far more serious offence.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> That was precisely my point. I was concerned that there would be a lack of consistency with two different laws, either of which could be applied depending on the circumstances.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I disagree with the hon. Gentleman because the targets in terms of the protection of the tax base and the nature and scale of the offence are different for money laundering. Regulations for that offence have international dimensions as well, and involve international agreements.

<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells asked about tax advisers who gave advice on avoidance schemes that failed. A failed scheme whose details are not hidden from the Revenue amounts not to tax evasion, but tax planning. That was the point that the right hon. Gentleman was making. The Government may not like some of that planning and may legislate against it but, as it is not hidden, it does not fall within the remit of the measure.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The point that I sought to make was that, if it were discovered that the plan was not an avoidance scheme but constituted an evasion of tax, all those involved, including the secretary who typed the documents, could be said to be involved in a scheme knowingly to evade tax. It is that eventuality that could be caught by the new clause.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> What I said about the meaning of ``knowingly'' and ``involvement'' clarifies that. On the second point, avoidance is not evasion; there are separate laws to deal with the latter. The right hon. Gentleman asked when avoidance became evasion. Unless he can give an example, I cannot think of such an eventuality. The powers that exist to deal with evasion or serious fraud would be used, not the magistrates court.

<P>
The Grabiner report considered whether we had appropriate powers to deal with all forms of tax evasion. Income tax was an area where he considered that we did not and the Government agreed with that. Work carried out by our shadow economy teams on the various industry pilot schemes that we have run, such as, in collaboration with legitimate trade, on part of the fashion industry in London, has shown that we need to tackle that area.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I believe that my hon. Friend the Member for Wells was arguing that a court might find that a scheme that had been regarded as tax avoidance constituted evasion. That relates to the earlier point about the two areas having become blurred. A recommendation that a group of lawyers and accountants might have given may, six months later, suddenly be seen not as avoidance but evasion. The Minister covered that by referring to intent. She dealt with the point about lawyers or accountants giving advice on tax planning without intent of evasion.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The person has to have been knowingly and personally dishonest. It is difficult to keep qualifying words in that way; I am buttressing the argument. Sometimes investigations start on the basis of one offence but it subsequently transpires that a much more serious crime was being committed. A separate set of penalties and rules would therefore work. I presume that the hon. Gentleman was asking whether the measure could be misused as a short cut. I cannot believe that a court would allow that to occur; if a serious offence has been committed, it must be prosecuted.

<P>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton asked about the civil penalties procedure. The policy on civil settlements will continue. He asked why income tax and not capital gains was being considered. We are concerned about income tax fraud, but we are not saying that one form of tax fraud is more serious than another. There could be an argument for applying the measure to the other tax areas. My view was that it was important to focus on that area; that could also be put down to my caution as a Minister and my desire to be satisfied about the new clause before I explained it to the Committee. The measure was not originally in the Bill because we did not have the report. I apologise to members of the Committee if that caused them inconvenience. Lord Grabiner and the Chancellor recommended the measure, but many factors needed to be considered to make the new clause as accurate as possible.

<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> Will the Paymaster General keep under review whether the Inland Revenue needs such powers to tackle capital gains tax fraud, in the way in which it tackles income tax fraud?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> We always keep the tax system under review. I do not want to frighten the children into thinking that the measure is a Trojan horse. All Governments keep an eye open for abuse across the entire tax system.

<P>
I have covered the hon. Gentleman's points, which echoed similar ones made by other hon. Members, about the type of offence and the involvement of someone paying cash for a service. There are already rules-I hesitate to mention them-under the pay-as-you-earn regulations. I think that they are in connection with nannies, but I do not have all the information with me. Relationships should be correct according to legislation. The self-employed, who provide a service and a bill that someone pays, have been covered by our debate already.

<P>
I have also covered the final point made by the hon. Member for West Dorset when he sought clarification. He used the example of a sweatshop. Employers gain from the fraud, and it goes undetected because they evade their share of national insurance contributions by making a cash payment. It also means that the employee will perhaps not pay the correct tax or national insurance. VAT might also be evaded, again because tax movements are concealed through the business.

<P>
The possible advantage to employees of their employers suppressing cash payments is that they then claim income-related benefits. They know that they should not, because they have undeclared cash. For working families tax credit, people need to produce pay slips to demonstrate their income. If pay slips show only a tiny proportion of the true income, the rest of which comes from the employer, the employer will knowingly engage in fraud if he says that they are correct.

<P>
I am sorry for taking rather longer than I intended to make those points, but I hope that I have been able to reassure hon. Members on the issue. I hope that I have said enough to make it absolutely clear, as the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs requested, how we see the new clause being interpreted, how we will prepare the cases and how prosecutions will be made through the magistrates court.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am sorry that I had to miss the first part of this morning's debate. The new clause is interesting and far-reaching. I gather that the position of a husband and wife may not have been fully tackled. I hope that the Paymaster General will give us some idea about the offence of being ``knowingly'' concerned, and whether that knowledge is at the outset of a premeditated intention to fraudulently evade tax.

<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Let me give the Paymaster General an example. A husband deposits money in the Isle of Man, deliberately to evade taxation. He and his wife have a joint account, and his wife honestly believes that the tax on that account will be paid and that the interest will be returned to the Inland Revenue, as it should be. The couple are domiciled and ordinarily resident in this country. The wife, at the outset, honestly believes that no evasion whatever is involved in the transaction. The husband, right at the outset, when making that deposit, has the proven intention to evade tax and not return it.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> As I understand it-certainly it is the case with my tax returns-there is an obligation on the wife as the recipient of interest on something that is in her name jointly with her husband. She must declare that interest, so the question of collusion is not affected by her right to independent taxation. She must make the return that identifies the interest from which she has benefited.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am grateful to the Paymaster General, but I have not finished the hypothesis that I was putting to her.

<P>
Let us imagine that the cash is deposited and interest is paid. After a year, when the wife finds out that the intention is to evade taxation and that it is a fraudulent evasion, she colludes in it. However, at the outset, when the cash and moneys were deposited, she had no intention fraudulently to evade taxation. If, subsequently, she colludes but did not have the mens rea at the outset, will she fall in the trap that the clause lays? Does the culpability lie at the outset, or is it a running offence that one can walk into in due course?

<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Ottaway </B>(Croydon, South): I hope that the Paymaster General will not be offended if I say that that was one of her better speeches during our proceedings. I do not intend to be offensive, and that is the point that we are debating-the question of intent.

<P>
We began with a discussion of the broad expansion of the law of conspiracy. The Paymaster General made it clear that she thought that the present law was inadequate and should be expanded, although that was not a conclusion that the previous government reached. The definition of the crime in the clause significantly expands the law of conspiracy-especially through the words ``knowingly concerned''. The hon. Lady proceeded satisfactorily to define the intention behind the measure. Those who read her words to interpret the clause will find that, when put in the negative, they are very helpful indeed.

<P>
The Paymaster General spoke about specific collusion and said that those systematically colluding would be caught. However, she also said that one would not avoid being caught if one should have suspected that there was fraudulent evasion. I think that I have accurately written down her words and am quoting her rightly. The hon. Lady went on to say that the accused person must have knowledge of fraudulent intent and that assistance in the evasion must be demonstrated. She also said that the offence did not apply if someone could merely have had suspicions. She has therefore clearly eliminated a large category of people who might have been caught.

<P>
The Minister has wrapped up about 99 per cent. of the examples that were given. She could take care of the final 1 per cent. if she confirmed that there was no duty to inquire into what happened to the money. If a payment is made in cash-

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Or by cheque.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Or by credit card.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Indeed. If a payment that led to tax evasion were made, but the person making the payment-in other words, the conspirator-had no knowledge of that, would there be a duty to inquire into whether that person should have been knowingly concerned? If the Minister could confirm that there is no such duty in those circumstances, that would shut the gate completely.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Purely because I am conscious-as is my hon. Friend, with his legal background-of the importance of the record of our proceedings, will he tell me whether he agrees that we are talking about a duty to inquire into what subsequently happens to the money? He said that there was a duty to inquire into whether the person was knowingly concerned, but we are not considering that; we are considering whether there is a duty to inquire about what subsequently happens to the money in the hands of the person receiving the payment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right and I am grateful for that distinction. If the Minister can deal with that point, it would conclude the debate.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> There is not such a duty. The phrasing that needs to be used is that the offence will not require ordinary people making ordinary payments to investigate the tax affairs of the people that they pay.

<P>
The last point was that raised by the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) on the financial relationship between a husband and wife in the situation that he described. That is quite a different matter. I am obviously not here to give tax advice, or to go into the sometimes vexed area of the legal relationship between a husband and wife and the courts' powers to determine their respective involvement in such cases. I confine myself to the tax obligations. The hon. Gentleman asked whether the non-declaration of interest on capital deposited in an Isle of Man account-rather than the depositing of capital itself-constituted evasion. The wife's collusion would have to amount to involvement, as I have explained-in what has been a long debate. If she did not declare her own income, she would have committed a fraud. The mere knowledge of her husband's fraud would not, I am told, amount to being concerned in it-which brings us back to what I said about what constitutes involvement in other cases. That answers the hon. Gentleman's questions. As I have given a full explanation of the use of the words, he might care to write to me if he has more examples.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I would not want the debate to end without thanking the Paymaster General for a clear answer to our final question and, indeed, to all our questions. The debate illustrates the use of Standing Committees to achieve clarification for the purposes of Pepper v. Hart, which is perhaps the most important aspect of the Committee's work. The Paymaster General has clearly expressed Parliament's intention in adding the new clause to the Bill, so we can regard this as a helpful morning's work.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Clause read a Second time, and added to the Bill.

<H4><center>New Clause 4</center></H4>

<P>

<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen Timms)</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.</B><P>

<P>
I fear that I am unlikely to be able to emulate the barnstorming performance that the Committee enjoyed from my hon. Friend the Paymaster General. I want to explain what is intended by the new clause. It is part of a package of measures to help companies that are concerned about the way in which national insurance contributions arise on share option gains in a volatile stock market. The new clause provides tax relief to employees and builds on measures introduced in the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Bill in another place earlier this week.

<P>
The technical changes have been developed as a result of my consultations with companies, which were announced in the Budget. I hope that you will allow me, Mr. Cook, to mention the background of the changes to national insurance legislation so that the Committee can see the impact of the proposed tax relief.

<P>
Taxable gains made by employees in respect of share options granted after 5 April 1999 have been subject to class 1 national insurance contributions since 6 April 1999. The contributions are now charged on share option gains at the same time and on the samebasis as income tax, except when the option or the shares are not readily convertible assets. For an employer, that means a secondary national insurance contributions charge equivalent to 12.2 per cent. of the option gain.

<P>
Gains made on options awarded and exercised within an Inland Revenue-approved scheme are free from income tax and national insurance. Companies have pointed out that although they can plan for national insurance on regular pay, they often cannot plan for their national insurance contributions on share option gains, especially when the share price is volatile, as it is in the high-tech sector of the economy. Under accounting rules, employers are required to provide in their profit-and-loss accounts for the accruing national insurance liability based on the market value of the shares under option at the relevant accounting date. That creates an unpredictable liability, and makes it difficult for companies to control their costs and hit the numbers in terms of the quarterly results required by the stock market. That can put their investment strategies at risk, damage their growth by deterring investors and even make them insolvent.

<P>
We want to continue to attract businesses and jobs to Britain to help our companies compete. That is the reason for the changes. At the moment, when the company does not have a track record of profitability, employers are statutorily barred from asking their employees to reimburse the national insurance liability, even when share prices have risen substantially and employees have realised large share option gains. The changes agreed in another place provide a technical solution to the problem by allowing the national insurance liability to be moved to the employee, who controls when the option is exercised, makes the profit and has the funds to meet the liability.

<P>
The new clause gives employees tax relief when they bear the cost of the employer's national insurance contribution on share option gains. The relief is tied to two circumstances in which an employer and an employee can agree that the employee will bear the costs.

<P>
The amendment that the Government introduced in the Committee that considered the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Bill supplied a solution that several companies requested during a wide consultation. Many companies are now making plans to implement the arrangements envisaged in the Bill.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I ask for clarification on the tax relief. Am I right to assume that the employee would pay a net tax rate of 48 per cent. on the gain if he were a top-rate taxpayer?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I think that the rate is 47.3 per cent., but the hon. Gentleman is right about the impact of the change.

<P>
Companies with employees will receive a deduction from the corporation tax on their profits for the secondary national insurance contributions that they pay as part of the costs of employment. If the liability is transferred to the employee or the money is recovered from the employee, no corporation tax deduction will be offered. Therefore, it is only fair that the employee who bears the cost should benefit from a tax relief for it. The new clause supplies that relief by allowing a deduction from the amount of the share option gain that would be chargeable to tax. We have included safeguards to prevent an employee from receiving the relief when he has not paid the national insurance contributions within 60 days of the end of the tax year. That is a generous time scale compared with the normal time limit for accounting for national insurance to the Inland Revenue.

<P>
Many employees will sell some shares to release funds to meet their liabilities when they make gains on their share options. We have included a measure that will allow employers to calculate the PAYE by taking the new relief into account, so the employee will receive the tax relief during the year through PAYE, rather than having to wait for a tax refund through the self-assessment tax return after the end of the year.

<P>
The changes will help us to continue to attract businesses and jobs to the United Kingdom and will help companies to compete. The changes fully take into account the importance of share options for employers and employees, particularly in the new economy, and remove barriers to using share options in recruiting and retaining employees. They also meet our aim of a fairer tax and national insurance system, by ensuring that tax relief is given to whoever bears the cost of national insurance contributions on share options.

<P>
I commend the new clause to the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> We move from the sublime to the ridiculous. We had a useful session discussing a clause that will be important to millions of people and we are now tidying an understandable but rather egregious error by the Government.

<P>
In our view, the right way of proceeding would have been to undo the original mistake of putting NICs on employee share options, then forget the whole thing. None of us sees the merit in a bizarre and restricted 47.3 per cent. marginal tax rate. It is bizarre because it applies to a highly restricted set of cases, and restricted, because it applies up to the upper earnings limit. There is a strange kink in the tax schedules. The measure has been introduced because the Government's first proposal, as the Financial Secretary fairly admitted, would have had a catastrophic effect on a range of high-tech companies setting up. To their credit, the Government listened to what was said about the matter and began to unwind their position.

<P>
The provisions before us are entirely innocuous. People will not desist from offering their services to high-tech start-up ventures in the UK because they have to pay a tax rate of 47.3 per cent. before reverting to one of 40 per cent. That aspect of the measure will have no adverse effect, and the nation will be deeply grateful to the Government for undoing their mistake.

<P>
It is an inelegant and bizarre way of solving a problem that could easily have been solved by withdrawing the proposal. It would be good if we came to a similarly bizarre and inelegant-but workable-solution to the problems in the measures on double tax relief and controlled foreign companies. If we did, the Committee and Report stages of the Bill would live in the memory for saving British industry from some of the most curious errors ever made by the Treasury. We were not exempt, when we were in power, from sometimes making curious and egregious errors. [
Interruption.] No, I will not make a list of them for the Financial Secretary.

<P>
The present measures top the list of curious errors, however. We have got rid of one, but there are two to go. If Ministers felt inclined to begin now the process of unwinding the absurdities of the climate change levy, which they will otherwise have to engage in anon, we would enter very heaven. However, I will not test your patience by going on about that, Mr. Cook. Generally speaking, we welcome the Government's curious climbdown as being much better than nothing.

<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> The hon. Gentleman could have added other measures to his list-for example, IR35.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I just want to say for the record that the hon. Gentleman is of course right.

<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I should not have tempted the hon. Gentleman. Like him, I agree that the clause is an improvement on previous proposals, in that the Government have consulted the industry. However, I am not convinced-and I am not sure whether the hon. Member for West Dorset is convinced-that the measure goes far enough.

<P>
The letter that the Paymaster General wrote to the right hon. Member for Wells, which was copied to myself and other members of the Committee, explained that the maximum tax rate would go down from 52.2 per cent. to 47.32 per cent. as a result of the measures. I leave aside the absurdity of having a marginal tax rate of 47.32 per cent. Will the measure deal with the competitive issue at the heart of the industry's concerns?

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman share my view that the tax rate is not 47.3 per cent. all the way up, but on a particular band of capital gain that takes the taxpayer up to his upper earnings limit for NIC purposes?

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight indicated dissent.</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My hon. Friend is shaking his head. If the 47.3 per cent. applies all the way up to the total capital gain, it will have more impact and is less curious but more damaging. I agree with the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton that we need clarification on the matter.

<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's intervention because I had understood that the margin rate was 47.32 per cent. on all income, not only a band of income.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Timms indicated assent.</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The Financial Secretary is nodding in agreement.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Self-evidently, the employer NIC contribution rate is not earnings capped. The measure simply puts the liability for that on to the employee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's intervention, which has helped to clarify my thinking. The principle of transferring employers' tax liability to employee seems odd, but I shall deal with that point later.

<P>
If the marginal tax rate is 47.32 per cent. on all the capital gain, it is a large impost. When we analyse whether that is the right way forward, we should consider the international comparisons behind all the representations that the Minister will have received. I understand that the rate is not dissimilar to rates charged in other European Union countries. However, the Paymaster General says in her letter that the rate:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>is similar to what is paid in the US when state income taxes are included.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My information is that that is not the case. California taxes, for example, amount to 46 per cent.-40 plus six when state tax is included. The key point is that there is also a United States federal tax break on the long-term capital gains tax rate of 20 per cent. when one holds stock for a minimum of one year. That brings down the comparative rate in the US vis-à-vis the rate that we are being asked to accept, so that the comparison is between 47 per cent. and 26 per cent., including state taxes.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I apologise for the fact that we are doing our homework on our feet, but this is a very new clause. If the guidance that we received in the form of helpful nods from the Financial Secretary is correct, are we not actually dealing with something like a 59 per cent. marginal tax rate for the employee who has no other income and gets a gain? The amount up to his upper earnings limit that he pays will be his own NIC-12, if I remember the number correctly, plus 47. Let us suppose that it is simply a matter of addition. That gives 59 per cent. Once he hits the upper earnings limit, he will pay 47 per cent., because of the employer's uncapped tax-deductible contributions that he has taken over. That creates the kink that I was describing, but at a higher level-and a pretty high level in comparison with other places. I am beginning to think that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton is right that we should be worried.

<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman is not quite right to add the 12.2 per cent. employee's NIC to the 47.32 per cent. marginal rate. Obviously, on income up to the upper earnings limit, the 40 per cent. top rate tax does not apply, so there is no cumulative 59 per cent. rate. Nevertheless, the substantive point is that there is a large impost.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. I was wrong.

<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am grateful. I think that we are all liable to make a few errors when we exchange different marginal tax rates that we appear to be making up on the back of an envelope in Committee. I hope that certainty about the marginal rates that we are discussing will be established during the debate, and certainly from the Minister's initial response.

<P>
As I understand it, the marginal rate on bands of income, from the top rate tax band at least, that will apply under the proposals is 47.32 per cent. We can compare that with the 26 per cent. rate that would apply in California. Therefore, the basis concerns of industry remain. It is dealing with internationally mobile labour. One reads in the specialist press that various firms in California are stuffed full of employees from Europe, who want to become involved in high-tech industry and achieve the best remuneration that they can. Given the tax regimes that pertain in this country and mainland Europe, they are attracted to the US. It is not simply because there is a well-performing high-tech industry in California, because we all know that Europe has its own well-performing high-tech industries. The issue that is driving many of them to California is the comparative tax rates.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
I understand that the Minister has looked at this with some care, but he needs to share in rather more detail some of his thoughts and experiences. What other alternatives has he looked at? For example, some in the industry have pressed for the gain to apply at the time of the granting of the share option rather than its exercise. Would that be a more appropriate way of dealing with the issue? Can the Minister explain why he has not gone down that route? According to The Independent on Sunday, the Minister looked at the possibility of an exemption for high-tech firms in this area. I was worried to read that he had sent a senior Inland Revenue official to Brussels to meet the competition commission. I hope that he will say that that was not the case because I am not quite sure what remit the European Union competition commission would have in that area. Even if the official did go, I hope that Europe was not involved-

<P>
<B>Dr. Nick Palmer </B>(Broxtowe): You sound like a Tory.

<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> Not at all. The hon. Gentleman will know that I am a passionate pro-European but I believe that we should retain autonomy and control over taxation powers. [
Interruption.] There are a number of sedentary interventions. I am tempted to respond to them, but I am sure that you would bring me to order if I did, Mr. Cook.

<P>
A rather odd principle is being put into the tax system with the new clause and the amendments that were passed recently in the other place-the idea that the employer's tax liability can be transferred to the employee. I know that it is by an election and so is presumably a voluntary agreement between employer and employee, but it raises some issues of principle. Will that happen in future with corporation tax, for example? Is it just a one-off or is it a route that the Minister would wish to go down in other areas? I hope that it is not. It is a bizarre approach and very inelegant. A potentially unwelcome principle is being introduced into the tax system.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I urge the Government to rethink here and to go back to square one. I cannot think that they can be satisfied with creating yet another different rate of capital gains tax. The Government seem to be stuck unnecessarily on an issue of principle. I confess that the Opposition started the issue of principle in the argument, which was started under the last Chancellor, that other group share options represented a form of earnings and that that justified the application of NICs as well as income tax under certain circumstances.

<P>
That principle of income tax and NIC alignment has not been put into effect by the Government in relation to charitable giving. Where individuals make payroll gifts, which, under the gift aid scheme, enjoy deductions against income, it is income after national insurance. If one wants to apply the logic of the principle that the Government are hooked on, it should be applied the other way around when people are giving from their income-it should be on the gross income before both income tax and national insurance. The Government are not sticking to the principle of complete alignment of national insurance and income tax.

<P>
However, on the specific issue, the measures taken by the previous Conservative Chancellor were not intended to expose either employers or employees to uncontrollable and excessive liabilities via NIC charges. The liability was placed on the granting of a share option, to the extent that options were granted at a discount-the issue referred to by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton. Under the old regime a discount was granted on market value, as the employee had earned that immediate benefit and because it could be anticipated and planned by the employer who was granting the option.

<P>
When the Government introduced the crackpot proposals to charge NIC on the exercise of the share option, they claimed that it was for the administrative convenience of employers to align the charge with income tax. That was disingenuous and, as the Minister conceded, it produced all sorts of problems, especially for high-tech businesses without profits but with potentially volatile share prices. On a tangential point, the Minister said that such companies would have to make provisions in those cases; I noted that there was no argument in earlier debates, as with insurance companies, that the provisions should be discounted. That seems inconsistent; when should a provision be discounted for tax purposes? Both territories relate purely to stealth-tax gathering and not to the principle of the matter.

<P>
The Government's tortuous arrangements to get out of the problems are unnecessary. They will not be significant in terms of revenue, and the correct solution to the problem, which is of the Government's own making, would be to go back to square one of the old arrangements.

<P>
How do the Government justify a 47.3 per cent. tax rate when they say that they want to encourage employee ownership and participation, venture capital, entrepreneurship and so on? The net effect of their proposal in certain areas of economic activity will be to give employees the highest capital gains tax rate of the lot.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am a little hurt that Opposition Members think that the new clause is inelegant or, as the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs described it, tortuous. It is an elegant solution to a difficult problem and I hope that I can persuade the Committee to agree with me.

<P>
We had an interesting debate about whether the figure should be 52.2 per cent. or 47.3 per cent.; it was apparent in my discussions with many companies that the 50 per cent. level was psychologically significant. One or two companies said that if they ended up with a rate above 50 per cent. it would be disastrous, but a rate slightly below that figure would be fine. As a result of the new clause, the rate will be significantly below 50 per cent., which will help many firms.

<P>
I had a discussion with a US firm that wanted to establish a high-tech manufacturing facility in Plymouth. It was so worried about the effect of the problem on its operations that it considered not going ahead with its investment. I am delighted that, on the basis of the changes made in the other place and in Committee, the company is going ahead with its plans and is happy with the framework being introduced in the new clause.

<P>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton asked about arrangements elsewhere in the world; I shall come to those in a moment. A couple of weeks ago, I attended a conference for European high-growth firms, at which there were 400 or 500 people from all over the EU. It was evident that the view everywhere else in the EU was that the UK was the best place by a considerable margin in which to establish and to grow such a firm.

<P>
I had an interesting discussion with a French entrepreneur who had decided to establish a dot.com enterprise and who felt that he could choose any location in the world, although he felt that France was not an appropriate location due to the environment there. In the end, his choice was between the UK and the US. He chose to come to the UK, partly because of the difficulties of finding staff in the US because of the tightness of its labour market. From a recruitment point of view, he felt that he would be significantly better off. That perhaps makes the point that it is necessary to consider a range of issues facing companies, not simply one issue, when thinking about international competition. I shall return to the point about different levels of taxation in other countries later.

<P>
The previous Government, of course, removed the cap on employers' national insurance contributions. As a consequence, some companies have sought highly inventive ways in which to avoid national insurance on large cash bonuses. That has been the case in the City especially, where there was significant and extensive use of share options for that purpose. To do away with national insurance contributions on share option gains, as a few Opposition Members have advocated, would again provide a route by which that avoidance might take place.

<P>
Our view, which I hope is shared across the Committee, is that we should not create avenues for very well-paid people that allow them to avoid paying national insurance on a substantial chunk of their remuneration. For that reason, I would not favour returning to the old arrangement.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> One of the arguments behind our arrangement is that shares are inherently risky. As we have seen in the high-tech industry, they are volatile and as likely to go down as up. That gives a great justification for taxing at the point of granting rather than at the point of exercising. Will the Minister reflect further on that point?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> No. The hon. Gentleman is wrong. One of the criticisms of the old arrangement was that one paid national insurance on the basis of the value of the option at grant. If the shares subsequently declined in value, one paid national insurance on the basis of the higher value. The hon. Gentleman makes a telling point, but the matter works in the opposite direction to the one that he suggested. The liability now applies, as income tax has always applied, at the point of exercise. The tax is applied at the right point-the one at which the employee has a potential benefit from the option. That was not the case when national insurance applied at grant.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> With respect, it is not correct to assert that option schemes were widely or even significantly used as an alternative to bonuses. Option schemes and bonuses are clearly quite different in their nature, their time periods and their risk on equities. The typical arrangements involve both bonus and option arrangements. I suspect that the motivation behind what is proposed may be linked to a wrong diagnosis by the Revenue.

<P>
The reason for the old arrangement was practical. It was logical, because sometimes when the options were granted they had a market value. It was not unreasonable for the NIC to apply to that, and for individuals to take their risk then as to whether their income tax liability would go up or down.

<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> On that last point, the hon. Gentleman argued that liability should reflect the actual benefit, which is what is achieved by applying the liability at exercise rather than at grant.

<P>
I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman's suggestion. He did not actually say that avoidance by the route in question did not happen. It is certain that it did. The difference between us lies in our views as to whether that was a significant problem that needed to be dealt with by the Government. Our view is that it was. One company alone avoided £25 million by the device, and there were probably about 50 relevant cases. No doubt there would have been more.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Does not the Financial Secretary agree that there is something odd in what we are discussing? A person who invests capital in one of the relevant start-ups-and who invests it in the form of options-ends up by paying a capital gains tax rate of 40 per cent. His fellow, who invests labour, ends up paying a capital gains tax rate on the same options of 47.3 per cent. Why favour capital rather than labour?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The rate paid by someone who invested would depend on when the shares were sold. Such individuals would be able to exercise their options and continue to own the shares and then benefit subsequently from the changes to capital gains tax under the Bill, with the rapid tapering down to a 10 per cent. rate in due course. That benefit would be available to any people who had exercised their options and hung on to their shares.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The Financial Secretary is right, of course. Let us suppose that the parties in my example have exercised the same options at the same rate. Both might from then on experience capital gain and would benefit-I put heavy inverted commas round that word-from the usually complicated taper relief. Heaven knows whether a business asset or a non-business asset would be involved. They would be all square with one another. The labourer and the capitalist would be taxed in the same way. However, at the moment of the crystallisation-when the exercise of the option occurred-one would be taxed at 40 per cent. and the other at 47.3 per cent.

<P>
I had thought that that was a quirk. I mistakenly assumed that it involved the upper earnings limit and that it did not matter. However, we are dealing with a straight difference between 40 per cent. and 47.3 per cent. I simply cannot see the justification for it. I am worried by the fact that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton looks puzzled. Perhaps I have made another error. However, if I am right about the effects that I have identified, the case is an odd one.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I do not think that it is. People who have worked in the company, of course, have not invested capital. That is the point. They invest capital only at the moment when they exercise the option, not before. What the hon. Gentleman has pointed out is not an irregularity.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Will the Financial Secretary give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I will in a moment, when I have made this point.

<P>
Everyone's labour is subject to income tax and national insurance. The employer has a national insurance liability as well. We want to ensure that those liabilities are incurred by those who are being paid a wage and those who benefit through share options.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am grateful; the Financial Secretary is patient in giving way again. However, I persist in saying that he is not addressing the issue. We all accept the difference between paid labour and risk capital. The maximum tax rate on paid labour is 40 per cent. and the employer pays employer's NICs. However, we are not dealing with ordinary paid labour. We are dealing with risk. People can risk either their capital or their labour. A person who receives no remuneration but who receives share options will have risked his labour. He does not know whether he will be paid anything, because he will not know, until he exercises the option, whether the shares will have a value.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I assume that the hon. Gentleman is making an intervention, not a speech.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> You are absolutely right, Mr. Cook. I shall try quickly to bring it to a conclusion.

<P>
The fact is that either labour or capital is at risk. Why should one be taxed at 47 per cent. and the other at only 40 per cent?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman speaks of risk labour, a concept that was introduced by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs in a sedentary intervention. He seems to suggest that it should be taxed as though it was risk capital. We want to ensure a level playing field between the various forms of remuneration that people receive for their labour. I believe that we have the right balance.

<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I should make some headway. I hope that we have dealt with the misunderstanding about the 59 per cent.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Yes.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The top income tax rate in the major EU countries-France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden-is more than 47.3 per cent. In the US, an employee living in California pays a top rate of more than 45 per cent., and someone living in New York City would pay more than 46 per cent.

<P>
I want to respond to the comparison made by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton with US tax rates. In general, the US taxes such gains in exactly the same way as the UK. The gain made to the date of exercise is chargeable to income tax, and gains made subsequent to that and before the date of sale are chargeable to capital gains tax. On unapproved US options, the gain made to the date of exercise is liable to income tax, with a top rate of 39.6 per cent.-plus state taxes, and plus the employer's Medicare liability, which is comparable to employer's NICs although at a lower level.

<P>
The subsequent gain on sale of those shares is liable to income tax if the shares are held for less than a year-this may be the hon. Gentleman's query-and 20 per cent. capital gains tax if held for more than a year. In the UK, if the shares are held for more than four years, the rate of capital gains tax will apply at 10 per cent. The arrangements for approved options are rather different. I believe that, in full comparison with the US, once the changes are made our rates will be competitive with those faced by many employees in the US.

<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The Financial Secretary seemed to confirm my understanding that, after a year, unapproved share options in the US come under the capital gains tax regime whereas in the UK they will still come under the income tax regime. That is why the differentials in tax rates arise, which is why it is a fair comparison between 47.32 per cent. and 26 per cent. Will the Minister confirm that? If so, it is a major problem, which the new clause does not solve.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The point is that when unapproved share options in the US are exercised-
