<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> This is a small amendment of great importance. As with our previous amendments, which were tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon), its purpose is to ensure that the Bill is brought into conformity with the Patten report. Patten recommended that the Secretary of State should set
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>longer term objectives and principles<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
for policing instead of the two to three-year objectives to be set by the Policing Board. Patten also stated clearly that the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Government should retain the power to set principles and broad overall objectives for policing. But the Policing Board should have the power to set the objectives, priorities and performance targets for Northern Ireland<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
policing
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in both the 3-5 year strategy and the Annual Policing Plan.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Patten report said that it could see no reason whatever
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>for government to second-guess the Board in these matters in the way that<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the Bill provides. However, clause 22 places no limits on the sort of objectives to be set by the Secretary of State. He could even set annual objectives for policing in Northern Ireland. That is not desirable, it was not Patten's intention and the Bill should not allow it. The Bill allows the Secretary of State to retain the power to second-guess the Policing Board, which is exactly what Patten set out to prevent. The Bill endorses the opposite of the Patten recommendation.

<P>
This brief but significant amendment was designed to remedy that defect by allowing the Secretary of State to set only long-term objectives. It does not define what are long-term objectives-that is a matter of good policing practice taken from other police authorities and structures-but it is clear that he should not be involved in the three to five-year or annual objectives set by the board.

<P>
That is the purpose of the amendment and if the Committee wishes to endorse and pursue Patten's intentions, it will accept that the amendment is reasonable and proper and that it fulfils the purpose in which we are engaged.

<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> Good morning, Mr. Malins. I rise briefly to speak to amendment No. 155, which is a probing amendment to ask the Minister whether he would care to consider a period for the objectives. Section 14(3) of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998 contains a provision that is more or less identical to our amendment, including the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>not being less than 3 years nor more than 5 years.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
We should like to know why that relatively recent text has not been reproduced in the Bill. The 1998 Act presumably represented the Government's up-to-date thinking at the time, and only 24 months have passed since then. Is there a reason why the Government have changed their view and taken away this relative focus? We believe that there is merit in that focus because it tends against short termism, and not many of us would find short termism in policing commendable for its own sake. On the contrary, we should find an element of consistency and continuity commendable.

<P>
We should, therefore, prefer the words in the amendment to be incorporated in the Bill, but we are open to hearing why the Minister thinks that they are inappropriate. It is possible that we shall find the Minister persuasive on the matter. Alternatively, we might not. It remains to be seen.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Maginnis </B>(Fermanagh and South Tyrone): Good morning, Mr. Malins.

<P>
Amendment No. 232 is similar to amendment No. 155. It relates to the question, already discussed, as to why the objectives being determined under this clause are different from those in the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998. Perhaps it is appropriate that I should refer to the events of yesterday, when there was an indication that some terrorists were moving towards meeting their obligations under the Belfast agreement by allowing arms dumps to be inspected by the international inspectors.

<P>
The question posed in the wake of that announcement was ``What price will the Government have to pay, in terms of the police Bill?'' I can see that you thought that I was wandering then, Mr. Malins, but I was not. I am aware of your vigilance. I wondered at that question, because I feel that the price is already being paid, in the way in which the Bill is being drafted. It is being paid to the extent that the Bill has to do with political accommodation rather than with law and order. Therefore, the objectives by the Bill will inevitably be inadequate for the needs of society in Northern Ireland. It will almost certainly be necessary to revise those objectives within a comparatively short period of time, because the mafia undercurrent in our society will have a wonderful opportunity to further establish itself under the terms of the Bill. We will need early changes.

<P>
The great problem with an undefined period, if we are talking about setting objectives for the next year, for example, is that things tend to drift. There is room for further debate on what should happen. A period of three to five years may be too long-it probably is-but it is better than having an undefined period for the reconsideration of objectives. The Minister likes to remind us that we do not have a normal society. If we did, the phrase ``long term'', in amendment No. 1, would be appropriate. However, just as I argued that the terms of my amendment were in line with those of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998, I must argue against use of the phrase ``long term''. It would contradict the point that I am making. I hope that, some day, we will be able to have long-term objectives, but that is not possible now.

<P>
That is why we have tabled amendment No. 232. It is a probing amendment, but I would like the Minister to address the issue explicitly and tell us what time scale he sees as appropriate for the setting of objectives. I hope that he will not tell us that it is an on-going or evolutionary process. That would lead to uncertainty and would not provide the stability that either the police force or society needs.

<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Hunter </B>(Basingstoke): I shall speak primarily about amendment No. 1, moved by the hon. Member for South Down (Mr. McGrady). I am not convinced by his argument and shall listen with interest to what the Minister says.

<P>
As it stands, this part of the Bill is consistent with the principles of the Patten report. In essence, it echoes Patten and, arguably, improves on it by allowing a greater degree of flexibility. The Bill allows the Secretary of State to operate in a wider context than Patten envisaged. Surely, that is right, because policing requirements in Northern Ireland are likely to remain fluid. It is appropriate that the Secretary of State should be able to intervene-if that is the word-in the context envisaged in clause 22(1) and put his hand on the tiller or foot brake. The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for South Down puts unnecessary limits on the Secretary of State's flexibility and scope to act in circumstances that can be extremely fluid.

<P>
On amendments Nos. 155 and 232, to which I added my name, I simply emphasise the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor). We are primarily seeking greater consistency with the 1998 Act, and I cannot see any reason why we should depart from the formula in that Act.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram) Good morning, Mr. Malins. I welcome my hon. Friend the Member for South Down to his first sitting of the Committee. The SDLP has fielded two first-class fighters, and I await with trepidation our future discussions. However, I have some good news for him on amendment No. 1, which I shall come to in a moment.</B><P>

<P>
Government amendment No. 247 and amendments Nos. 1, 155 and 232 deal with the Secretary of State's objectives. The Government intend to implement Patten's recommendations for the planning process, as set out in paragraph 10 of his report. I shall place those recommendations on the record. Recommendation 10 says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Policing Board should set objectives and priorities for policing over a 3 to 5 year period, taking account of any longer term objectives or principles set by the Secretary of State or successor.

<P>
It should then be responsible for adopting a 3 to 5 year strategy, prepared by the Chief Constable through a process of discussion with the Board, which should reflect the objectives and priorities set by the Board.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The reason for that is set out in paragraph 6.5 of the Patten report. Recommendation 11 says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Board should be responsible for adopting an Annual Policing Plan, developed by the Chief Constable, through a process of discussion with the Board, on the basis of objectives and priorities set by the Board, and within the agreed 3 to 5 year strategy.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Recommendation 22 says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The provisions of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998 should be simplified so that the respective roles of the Secretary of State (or successor), the Policing Board and the Chief Constable are clear.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have considered the thrust of that recommendation and take note of the reasoning behind amendment No. 1, moved by my hon. Friend the Member for South Down, because Patten says clearly that the Secretary of State should be involved in the long-term objectives. For that reason I ask the Committee to accept the amendment, because it follows recommendation 10 and accords with the Government's intentions.

<P>
Amendments No. 155 in the name of the hon. Member for Solihull and amendment No. 232 in the name of the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis) in a sense reverse that principle. They require a Secretary of State to set objectives for the three to five-year period. As I have said, that clearly contravenes Patten's reasoning and logic.

<P>
One area with which Patten dealt in his report was the interrelationship between the various legs of the tripartite arrangement. He was critical of the 1998 Act, saying that it was unclear, imprecise and confusing. Those were not his precise words, but that was the tenor of his argument. Therefore, following recommendation 22, there was a need to simplify those arrangements. That is why I cannot accept the arguments advanced for amendments Nos. 155 and 232.

<P>
It is not a case of simply taking previous legislation, as the hon. Member for Solihull argued. He asked why, if the wording is there, the Government do not apply it in this Bill and he tabled a probing amendment accordingly. I hope that my response to him shows that we have taken account of what Patten said and have tried to clarify the relationship.

<P>
The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone argued that the Bill is a political accommodation and is not about establishing law and order. I do not accept that. We have heard this argument a number of times and we have a difference of opinion. I do not accept that the Bill involves political accommodation. I genuinely believe that it will establish new relationships in the policing structures in Northern Ireland. I took a similar view of the 1998 Act. Patten's examination took the process a step further. We have a new political determination and a new settlement that, possibly, takes account of new attitudes-although some might argue that the attitudes have always been held. Those views, which pervade all aspects of policing, involve a healthy development-it is time to move on from the situation that applied when the 1998 Act was introduced.

<P>

<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I do not think that the Minister will convince anyone simply by refuting my argument.

<P>
I put a simple test to the Minister. As the law currently stands, would it be easier for a decent, law-abiding farmer to obtain a permit for a shotgun to shoot vermin on his farm or for a convicted murderer who has managed to be elected to the Policing Board or one of the district policing partnerships to obtain such a permit? Which case would be scrutinised more carefully? If he answers that question in the way in which most sensible people would expect it to be answered, he would prove that my argument was fallacious.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I do not accept the test that if I do not satisfy the hon. Gentleman, his case has not been met. Two issues are involved. Every law-abiding citizen would welcome the fact that in-depth scrutiny is carried out before a firearm certificate is issued. We are currently reviewing the whole gamut of firearms legislation, and we are taking into account, for example, the various changes in the appeals process. It is right for there to be scrutiny and strict controls before someone is given permission to use a weapon for sporting purposes. That is not in dispute-

<P>
<B>Mr. Malcolm Savidge </B>(Aberdeen, North): Will my hon. Friend give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I shall just finish this point.

<P>
People who find themselves, by virtue of being elected through the ballot box, on the Policing Board or a DPP will face restrictions-councillors have to stand by certain commitments when they support the use of peaceful means. Convictions can come into play-if someone is convicted during his term of office, he can be removed from the Policing Board or a DPP, depending on the nature of the crime. The route to the Policing Board or a DPP on behalf of the community is through the ballot box. We have argued about this time and again, and we shall no doubt return to it. However, the wider community will make a judgment about who it wants as its representatives, and those people will be appointed to the Policing Board or a DPP.

<P>
<B>Mr. Savidge:</B> Surely the whole purpose of scrutiny in relation to firearms is to determine whether someone is a decent farmer or a homicidal maniac. Most of us feel that we should make such distinctions.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The issue involves more than those two extremes, which are not necessarily exclusive, of course. If there are breaches of firearms legislation, an appeals mechanism for the revocation of the licence comes into play. Currently, I deal with those appeals, but the requirement to conform with European legislation means that we are introducing legislation that will involve a judicial aspect. My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Savidge) said that vigour is needed in such examinations. However, I do not think that I have convinced the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone that the ballot box should be enough of a test. If the public had spoken, through the ballot box, it would be inappropriate for others to say that the elected candidate was not the appropriate person to serve the interests of the community that had appointed him or her.

<P>
We are in a bind, in that the Government and the wider community both have a view on this matter. However, the community respects and lives by the ballot box, and there are constraints for those who breach the rules, even though they may have achieved a route on to those representative bodies through the ballot box. I do not know whether that will satisfy the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis indicated dissent.</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I am getting a shake of the head from the hon. Gentleman. I did not anticipate being able to convince him.

<P>
Other arguments were advanced in relation to a society whose circumstances are not normal compared with the rest of the United Kingdom. That is certainly the case at present, but everything that the Government are doing-with the strong support of the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone-is aimed at normalising society in Northern Ireland. I know that he disagrees with me about whether that means that I am saying that that society is abnormal. I am saying that Northern Ireland is different from the rest of the United Kingdom, and that has to be taken into account. Everything that we are doing, through both the political process and other means, is aimed at normalising that society so that it has the same structure, the same mores and the same ethos as would apply elsewhere in the United Kingdom.

<P>
In those circumstances, the short-term objectives would not be required as the hon. Gentleman has argued. The main thrust of the Bill is to provide the Policing Board with more powers than the existing Police Authority, and also to set up a new framework for the board. That is why I am prepared to accept amendment No. 1.

<P>
We accept amendments Nos. 155 and 232 in part, because they-along with Government amendments Nos. 247 and 246, and amendment No. 1-would require the Secretary of State to lay a copy of any objectives before the House. We are happy to accept that point, which is why we tabled Government amendment No. 247. In the light of those arguments,
I ask the hon. Gentleman not to press amendments Nos. 155 and 232 to a vote. They were, in any case, described as probing amendments.

<P>
Government amendments Nos. 246 and 248 will require the Secretary of State and the board to consult the ombudsman.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Those amendments are the subject of the next debate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I apologise, Mr. Malins. I had understood that they were in this group, but I shall deal with them in due course.

<P>
I ask the Committee to accept amendment No. 1 and Government amendment No. 247.

<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> When I moved amendment No. 155, I omitted to say that I supported Government amendment No. 247-unsurprisingly, as they are almost identical measures.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 246, in page 11, line 8, after ``Constable;'' insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) the Ombudsman;'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendment No. 248.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I knew that you could not wait, Mr. Malins, and wanted to rush through the procedure to find out what I was going to say on Government amendments Nos. 246 and 248.

<P>
The amendments will require the Secretary of State and the Policing Board to consult the ombudsman when determining or revising objectives. We have discussed the issue with the ombudsman, and she has convinced us that it would be sensible for her to be consulted. I am grateful to her for her contribution to our on-going analysis of the Bill, and I commend the amendments on the basis of that argument.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I have only a mild reservation about this. It is not original, because I have heard it expressed in the Committee before, although I am not sure from which quarter.

<P>
To English eyes, the role of the ombudsman is to consider matters that are said to have gone wrong after the event, in order, if appropriate, to make a finding of maladministration. She is a trusted expert in that capacity. By contrast, in judicial review the allegation must be one of perversity.

<P>
Perhaps the Government take the view that, given the ombudsman's experience of things that have gone wrong, it might be a good idea to consult her before they go wrong. My mind is open to that idea. I merely point out that we have tended to regard the ombudsman as someone who deals with spilt milk, and it would be an innovation to ask her for advice ahead of developments. Does the Minister think that that new culture for the ombudsman might be extended? Is there a role on the mainland for the health service ombudsman to be consulted in some circumstances?

<P>
That is a matter of interest, rather than of argument, which I wanted to share with the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Member for Solihull argued against himself as he developed his point. I appreciate that it had just occurred to him.

<P>
This is about the ombudsman wishing to be kept informed of developments in policing. She may have drawn some experience from the spilt milk-for example, she may have designed a new carton or bottle to ensure that it does not spill again. Consultation at that level is not harmful, and is likely to be beneficial over time as the ombudsman builds up a body of knowledge based on individual complaints and past events. It may be possible for her to say, ``I have made recommendations based on this, so could you take that into account when setting the objectives?''

<P>
I envisage that the ombudsman will develop a range of knowledge. Although that will, in any event, enter the public domain, the opportunity to consult the ombudsman will enable a post holder to draw the attention of the board or the Secretary of State to wider-ranging matters. That would be healthy in the circumstances.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>

<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I thank the Minister for welcoming me to the Committee, although I doubt that I fit his description of me as a striker. I was always a pacifist by nature, and my performances on the sports field left much to be desired.

<P>
The amendments follow the theme that my party has pursued with regard to this part of the Bill, in trying to make it compatible, as far as is possible, with the Patten report. Patten stated that the Policing Board should have the power to set the objectives, priorities and performance targets for Northern Ireland in the three and five-year strategy, and the annual policing plan. However, the Bill omits any provision empowering the Policing Board to set performance targets. The Police Authority of Northern Ireland has strongly criticised that omission, and correctly argued that the setting of performance targets is a vital tool in the police planning process. Indeed, the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998 specifically empowers the Police Authority to set such performance targets, so there is no reason why that vital function cannot be set out in the Bill.

<P>
The Secretary of State has laid before the Policing Board draft regulations that would empower it to set performance targets. That is welcome but it is not enough. In respect of policing in Northern Ireland, the Secretary of State has reserved the express power to set performance indicators and performance standards not in the regulations, but clause 26(3), even though Patten saw no reason why the Secretary of State should second-guess the Policing Board on such matters. If there is sufficient room in the Bill to empower the Secretary of State to set such indicators and standards, why cannot the same be done for the Policing Board? That is what Patten recommended, and the main purpose of amendment No. 2 is to grant to the Policing Board the power to set such targets.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 are particularly important in terms of the way in which the Bill is currently drafted. Clause 24(2) will allow the Secretary of State to make regulations setting out what should be included in the policing plan, and again, he has made available draft regulations. They are not a matter of debate this morning, and we agree with much of what they contain, but they are none the less mere regulations-they have no statutory authority. Indeed, the present provisions, which amendments Nos. 3 and 4 would change, would allow the Secretary of State unnecessarily to interfere in and second-guess the judgment and workings of the Policing Board on day-to-day matters. The Minister might argue-I do not want to put words into his mouth-that such regulations would be subject to annulment on the Floor of the House, but that is a cumbersome and in many ways unnecessary complication of what ought to be a relatively simple and straightforward proposition.

<P>
Let us go up the road a little, to possible devolution of security or policing powers. In such an event, there would be a much more powerful reason why the Policing Board should perform this important function. In terms of the political-rather than administrative-aspect, we are talking about a straight division between the board's powers and those of the Secretary of State. The Policing Board, which is constituted in the Bill, brings together all the parties and independent experts. Why can we not recognise it as a strong, legitimate, cross-community, expert panel, which can safely be given the role of overseeing the performance targets of the regulations?

<P>
That is the main reason why we invite the Government to accept amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 4, which together represent a much more acceptable and effective way of handling the police. In the past we have had great difficulty, from the old days of the Department of Home Affairs through to the continuation of the Secretary of State perforce per se, with the almost political direction of the police. We want to start a new regime, in which that is clearly seen not to be the case, and the Secretary of State's interference-I use that word advisedly-or intercession would be only in exceptional and obvious circumstances, where the need arose. The setting of performance targets should be the day-to-day business of any competent board, including the Policing Board, which will, by statute, be cross party and will include many independent experts and observers.

<P>
This important message must be sent out in the new era, in which peace has been established and new structures set up in many aspects-political, social and the rest. The policing model is a core function of our society and will dictate how we progress in the years ahead. It is patently clear and obvious that the people in Northern Ireland, their elected representatives and the independent appointees will have the day-to-day control of setting the performance targets and will then ask ``Did we reach those targets? Did we not?'' Surely that is a fairly common-sense and universal practice throughout the UK, and indeed worldwide. I commend amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 4.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lembit ÷pik </B>(Montgomeryshire): I want to speak to amendment No. 81, which has the same objective.

<P>
I apologise to you, Mr. Malins, for my momentary concern about amendment No. 31 being debated in the wrong place. I have subsequently been assured that it was not in the wrong place. In the white heat of debate on Thursday I was momentarily paranoid and thought that Ministers and Officers were out to get me. I now realise that they were simply following the order of debate. [
Interruption.] Perhaps I was wrong and they are out to get me after all.

<P>
As the hon. Member for South Down has said, the Bill gives the Secretary of State the power to make regulations regarding the contents of the annual policing plan. In our judgment, that is unnecessary and would possibly damage the credibility of the new Policing Board. Even if, as the explanatory notes suggest, the regulations set only the minimum requirements for the plan, that still gives the Secretary of State more control over the police planning process than he has now and than was envisaged in the Patten report. It also goes far beyond arrangements in Great Britain for other police forces. Amendment No. 81 would correct that.

<P>
We have also lent our support to amendment No. 2, because it serves the same purpose. We look forward to hearing what the Minister says.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> As has been explained, the amendments deal with the contents of the board's policing plan. The amendments do not appear to be much different from what the Bill seeks to do. I simply make a general observation, which goes back to recommendation 22 in Patten's report, which says that the legislation in this area should be simplified.

<P>
It could be argued that the amendment will put more into the Bill, complicating it and restricting its flexibility. The Bill does not mention targets; they will be set out under the draft regulations under clause 24(2), which have already been made available to members of the Committee. The relevant paragraphs are 3(f) and (g). Paragraph 3(f) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any performance targets set by the Board to be aimed at in achieving the Secretary of State's objectives determined under section 21(1) of the Act.<P>

<P>
Paragraph 3(g) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any performance targets set by the Board to be aimed at in achieving the Board's objectives determined under section 23(1) of the Act.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Amendments Nos. 3, 4 and 81 would remove the Secretary of State's power to make regulations and prescribe the contents of the Board's policing plan. There is no strong case for saying that it would be better to have that in the Bill than in regulations. I have already referred to recommendation 22 in the report. My hon. Friend the Member for South Down and the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. ÷pik) were keen that the Government should implement Patten. Making these amendments would not simplify the legislation; the regulatory format is simpler.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Down said that the Secretary of State would have the power to set performance standards on objectives. That is not the case. Only the board will set standards and performance indicators on objectives. Perhaps, he was referring to the regulations made under the efficiency provisions. There is a reserve power that can be exercised if the board fails to carry out its duties relating to efficiency, but the board has the lead on the setting of objectives and associated performance standards.

<P>
It has been argued that the Government are interfering too much in the setting of objectives. I have three points to make to my hon. Friend the Member for South Down about that, for the Government will retain a locus in the strategic direction of policing. That cannot be denied. First, the Government provide the grant for policing in Northern Ireland, so we cannot abrogate our responsibility for how such huge sums-in the region of £600 billion-are spent. We cannot simply walk away from that. Secondly, national security and legislation on terrorism remain the responsibility of central Government and must be taken into account in the setting of objectives. Only the Secretary of State can make decisions on that. Thirdly, only the Government-not the board or the current devolved Administration-can require a joined-up approach to the strategic direction of the criminal justice system. That which is not devolved is the responsibility of the Secretary of State. If objectives are to be set in such areas, only the Secretary of State can define them. The Secretary of State is accountable to the House for the proper use of the moneys that have been allocated, and, of course, national security and terrorism legislation will continue to be the responsibility of the House.

<P>
The principles set out by my hon. Friend the Member for South Down and the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire are sound, but they do not need to be in the Bill. The definitions should be contained in regulations. That allows some flexibility, but does not depart from the overriding ethos, in which the Policing Board has responsibility. The Secretary of State will not have a heavy hand, other than in the areas set out in my three caveats. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press the amendment to a vote.

<P>

<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister's comments. He used some significant words, which seemed to contradict the latter part of his speech. He said that the amendments and his position were not ``much different'' and that he wanted to keep the Bill simple and not to complicate it. I do not think that our amendments would unduly complicate the Bill-they would have the significant effect of making statutory that which was, or which was proposed to be, regulatory. The Minister also discussed efficiency and funding. The primary responsibility for efficiency must be part of the immediate hands-on management of the police service, and its policy and strategy. It should be the executive function not of the Secretary of State but of the Policing Board.

<P>
I cannot follow the Minister's logic. I accept entirely his latter argument that a devolved authority is not involved and that the Secretary of State ultimately has responsibility in terms of public accountability and, in general terms, security. That does not preclude the fact that the Policing Board should have the authority-the performance requirement-that is contained in amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 4. I am disappointed that the Minister cannot accept the amendments, which would enhance our community's confidence in the Policing Board. The ultimate responsibility for security will obviously rest with the Secretary of State for as long as policing and/or security powers are not devolved in Northern Ireland.

<P>
<B>Mr. ÷pik:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is weak to use the tactical argument about over-complicating the Bill? We are discussing a strategically important question about the board's balance. To that extent, whatever other arguments the Minister produced, the crucial concern should not be whether to add 20 words to the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention-I totally agree with him. The amendments are quite simple and would not unduly complicate the Bill. We want to define, so far as possible, the role of the Policing Board and to differentiate it from the role of the Secretary of State, who-to repeat myself-will have ultimate, overall responsibility in terms of accountability and authority. It is normal practice to put day-to-day management in the hands of bodies like the Policing Board. Why should it not be normal to do so in Northern Ireland? We are trying to normalise the policing situation there.

<P>
We are dealing not simply with words on paper but with the impressions that will be given to the people of Northern Ireland. We should enhance their confidence that the policing service is open and independent from political interference. I do not seek to defend political interference in so far as that involves day-to-day interference. From the old Ministry of Home Affairs through to the current Secretaries of State, we have had a perceived history of political interference. So far as possible, we want to break that ethos. We need a definitive new change, which should be secured through the operation of the new policing service in the ways in which we have discussed.

<P>
I am disappointed that the Minister cannot accept amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 4. I do not accept the argument that they would unnecessarily complicate the Bill or diminish the Secretary of State's ultimate responsibility. I hope that the Committee will support the amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I am not trying to use technical arguments or tactical positioning. I understand the direction that my hon. Friend the Member for South Down is taking, and the fact that he is articulating the fears of a sizeable part of the community in Northern Ireland in relation to the misuse of power by a post-holder who has been given power by legislation. However, I hope that he would accept that that is not the way in which the Government have approached the Patten report. Indeed, we have accepted the principles that underpin the report that relate to the new future and the new approach.

<P>
There are two ways in which to deal with the issue. One can either incorporate the measure in the Bill, or achieve it by means of a regulatory mechanism. I might not be able to convince my hon. Friend of this, but our proposal will give greater flexibility to the board within the regulatory framework. If the Bill were too prescriptive, it might limit the room for manoeuvre. The regulations will allow those definitions to take place.

<P>
I shall take my hon. Friend a step into the future. At some point, the Secretary of State will cease to be involved in many of the direct relationships that he has with policing and the criminal justice system, if those aspects of administration in Northern Ireland are devolved to the Assembly. Is my hon. Friend arguing that the Minister in the devolved regime-let us call him the Justice Minister-who would be answerable to the Assembly, should not have the responsibility for setting those regulations as determined following consultations on behalf of that democratic forum?

<P>
When the Patten report deals with matters concerning the Secretary of State, it usually adds, in parenthesis, ``or successor''. We must also consider the Bill in that light. If the principle is sound that a regulation-making aspect should exist for a Minister for Justice, it would also be sound for the Secretary of State. This is a light-touch approach. It will not be a case of the Secretary of State keeping to himself the power to over-impose the Government's position on the Policing Board. I have set out the grounds on which the Secretary of State would have to have responsibility at present, in a non-devolved environment, as well as in relation to aspects of national security.

<P>
The regulations will allow that flexibility. That is why we have defined the measure in that way. The policy position is no different between my hon. Friend and me: it is that the Policing Board should be the body through which all those measures are delivered.

<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> The Minister has made several significant points.

<P>
The Secretary of State will make the regulations, not the Policing Board. Therefore, any Secretary of State-or, as the Minister extrapolated, any devolved Minister with responsibility for policing and security-will be able to make regulations. We are trying to foresee the circumstances in which we can completely divorce the day-to-day interference in policing matters from the Secretary of State or a Minister in a devolved Administration in Northern Ireland. Surely that is desirable.

<P>
If the Secretary of State and/or a devolved Minister has that authority to amend regulations in spite of the wishes of the Policing Board-whatever advice he takes, and whatever consultations he may carry out-he will do it. The Bill should state that the Policing Board, which represents the community on day-to-day matters, should carry out those functions.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I have set out the thrust of my argument and I cannot add any thing new. However, it is worth looking at what Patten said. The report was critical of the 1998 Act, and paragraph 5(11) refers to its ``labyrinthine provisions'' on planning and performance indicators. We are trying to tackle that by simplifying the provisions, stating that the Policing Board has a clear function to perform and that the regulations will set out the parameters with which it will be expected to comply. There will be a clear explanation of its responsibilities.

<P>
I cannot accept, as some would argue, that the Secretary of State should not be part of the mechanism. My hon. Friend did not argue for that, but some do and believe that the Government can disappear from the process. That is not possible. Northern Ireland remains part of the United Kingdom until the people determine otherwise, so there must be accountability to the House. The laying of regulations will satisfy hon. Members from Northern Ireland on what is happening in policing. They allow considerable flexibility and for a relationship between the legs of the tripartite structure. I accept the underlying principle set out by my hon. Friend and by Patten that the Policing Board should be the main mechanism for delivering the report's proposals.

<P>
To reflect the emphasis on human rights and equality in the Patten report, codes of practice for the discharge of Policing Board functions should include recommendations on how best to ensure that the board's policy and practice are inclusive and in accordance with human rights standards. I hope that we can all agree on that. The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission and the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland are clearly the bodies best placed to deliver advice on these issues. In simple terms, to effect the spirit of Patten it is necessary to include these two groups in any consultation on revising a code of practice.

<P>

<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I wish to speak to amendment No. 5, which, like previous amendments, would bring the Bill into line with Patten. In respect of the code of practice and the exercise of functions, Patten envisaged a Policing Board given clearly defined and robust powers in relation to the Secretary of State. However, the clause gives the Secretary of State the power to issue codes of practice to the Policing Board in relation to any of its functions. Clause 2(4) would then oblige the Policing Board to have regard to such codes of practice.

<P>
We believe that that is contrary to the separation of powers between the Government and the Policing Board envisaged by the Patten report. We accept the Secretary of State's ultimate responsibility to apply to Parliament for use of Policing Board funding and so on, but we suggest that the Secretary of State's powers be limited to that function. The purpose of the amendment is that the Secretary of State would have this power
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in relation to funds put at its disposal.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That deals with his responsibilities and accountability to Parliament and his public accountability, but it leaves the Policing Board with all the other powers relating to codes of practice on the exercise of functions.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone for moving amendment No. 233, formally. I do not know whether that means that he does not have an argument to advance in support of it, but wants to have the debate, or whether he will have to come back and say that there is a strong case for it. Perhaps I can anticipate his argument in the hope that we do not have an unnecessary debate.

<P>
Amendment No. 233 would compel the Secretary of State to issue codes of practice to the board and the Chief Constable under the clause. As the clause is an enabling clause, it would allow that to be done, but it contains no compulsion. That is why I would not be prepared to accept the amendment, because, as was made clear in previous debates, the Bill is all about flexibility.

<P>
The ability to issue codes is a general rather than a specific power. The codes will certainly deal with financial arrangements and arrangements for board meetings, but we wish to retain that flexibility, instead of forcing the Secretary of State to foist unnecessary codes on the board. Therefore, I hope that we do not need to debate that amendment further.

<P>
Amendment No. 5 in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for South Down would restrict the Secretary of State's power to issue codes of practice to the board to functions relating to the funding at the board's disposal. However, funding is such a wide and general term that it has an impact on many of the board's other functions. It could allow this unsavoury Secretary of State, who may be lurking in the back of my hon. Friend's mind, to say ``I now have a power relating to this aspect, but funding means so many things that I shall not issue any code on it''. Therefore, there is an inherent weakness in my hon. Friend's amendment.

<P>
We do not see the need for any restrictions, because the codes do not impose statutory obligations on the board, but merely offer it guidance. That guidance would be based on best practice and what has been learned elsewhere.

<P>
The codes will concern mainly funding. Indeed, the only existing code deals with detailed financial agreements. A code cannot be used as a back door to undermine the board's role, because it is not mandatory, but advisory. It will address only detailed matters that are strictly in accordance with the Bill's provisions, where that is necessary.

<P>
Provision for the Secretary of State to issue codes to the board is consistent with Patten; with practice elsewhere in Great Britain; with previous legislation; and with the Government's 100 per cent. funding of policing in Northern Ireland. Inescapably, the Government retain a role in the strategic direction of policing. I explained the applications of that during a previous debate.

<P>
The Government have said that they intend to deal with a range of issues in the Patten report through codes of practice. Those issues include guidance on advertising open meetings of the board, guidance on holding board meetings outside Belfast, and guidance on public questioning of the police through the board chairman at such open meetings. I do not think that my hon. Friend the Member for South Down would disagree with any of that, and I am sure that he agrees with the broad principle of transparency. In all those areas, we do not want to be overly prescriptive, but simply to offer guidance to the board. That kind of relationship would be healthy and helpful, bearing in mind that any code will be drawn up in consultation with the board and the Chief Constable.

<P>
I do not envisage difficulties in this respect, but there may be differences of opinion. Given the Government's clear view of the matter, based on our wish to see best practice being applied, there is nothing wrong with developing a code that would give guidance to the board and assist it in taking forward its responsibilities. On that basis, I ask my hon. Friend not to press the amendment to a vote.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 211 and 212 would, as the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire said, require the Secretary of State to consult the Equality Commission and the Human Rights Commission before issuing a code to the board on its functions. Clearly, both those bodies will fall within the ambit of the wide range of consultations that take place. However, the Human Rights Commission would not be an appropriate body to consult on matters relating to financial or funding issues. That could also apply to the Equality Commission.

<P>
Those bodies have responsibilities, understandings and remits in particular specialisms, and consultation would be the order of the day. If a code was issued that touched on equality or human rights issues, I cannot envisage circumstances in which they would not be consulted in order to draw on their knowledge. If they were not consulted, our experience shows that they would not be shy in coming forward to tell the Secretary of State about it. The Department's modus operandi will be to consult widely. As I and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary have often said, consultation is the order of the day in Northern Ireland. Sometimes it can be onerous and time consuming, but it is undertaken nevertheless.

<P>
For those reasons, it is unnecessary to specify the two bodies in the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. ÷pik:</B> Will the Minister confirm that the Government expect that any Secretary of State would feel obliged to consult the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Commission on matters of revision that relate directly to their areas of work?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The answer to that must be yes. I cannot envisage circumstances in which they would not be asked for their views. Experience suggests that if they were not consulted, they would quickly tell us, and we would not want that type of debate. They will have knowledge, expertise and a body of opinion that can assist in understanding issues. I am not prepared to give a commitment to accept representations made, but where such expertise is appropriate and would help to draw up codes of practice to assist the Policing Board, it would be right to consult widely.

<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
I cannot speak for the Policing Board, but I would like to think that it would indeed consult widely before making a particular move. Such a culture exists in Northern Ireland and, if anything, it will advance and improve. Therefore, I ask that the amendment is not pressed to a vote.

<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> In view of the Minister's detailed response and the arguments that he advanced, which are now firmly on the record, we shall not press the amendment to a vote.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Amendment No. 233 is one of a series that draws attention to the huge discretion given to the Secretary of State throughout the Bill. We have debated this point ad infinitum. In this instance, our intention was not to press the matter to a vote, but again to draw attention to the extent of that discretion. Perhaps for the first time, the Minister has made a convincing argument, as we realised that he would in this matter. It continues to cause us considerable concern, but with the permission of Committee members, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<P>
No. 209, in page 15, line 9, leave out ``or the Chief Constable''.

<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> Amendments Nos. 201 to 209 are consequential on amendment No. 6, which, I note with some gratitude, enjoys cross-party support. Part IV of the Bill, which begins with clause 26, again provides for second-guessing-I have used that term before-of the Policing Board. As such, we are seriously concerned about the way in which part IV will operate, and we encourage the Government to reconsider it substantially. Our concerns are particularly grave in respect of clause 26(5).

<P>
The Bill states that the function of the Policing Board is to ensure that the police force is efficient and effective. That is entirely consistent with Patten, who envisaged a strong, ordered department, staffed by experts in budgeting, financial management and value-for-money programmes. However, subsection (5) will fundamentally undermine the powers of the Policing Board in this respect, and will allow the Secretary of State to make orders in the interests of efficiency and effectiveness that could bind the Chief Constable. Thus, in effect, the Secretary of State will ultimately ensure efficiency and effectiveness in the police service, rather than the Policing Board, with its hands-on executive function.

<P>

<B>Mr. Dominic Grieve </B>(Beaconsfield): I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, but is not that the reality for every police force in the United Kingdom?

<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I do not have detailed knowledge of the management processes of every other police force in the United Kingdom, although I understand that there is no conformity in that respect, and that there is diversity from police force to police force.

<P>
The measures provide for the interference-I use the word in a non-aggressive sense-by the Secretary of State in the practical day-to-day business of the normal executive function, an area that should be the responsibility of the Policing Board. It goes way beyond what Patten envisaged. It is disappointing that, under the guise of implementing Patten, the Government are strengthening the tripartite relationship between the Chief Constable, the Policing Board and the Secretary of State. That will cause great difficulty in terms of unnecessary interference in constructing the harmony of the proper function of the Policing Board.

<P>
In response to the hon. Gentleman's intervention, I believe that the measure goes way beyond the equivalent arrangement in Wales, which is embodied in the Local Government Act 1999. Under those arrangements, the Government are unable to undermine the police authorities in England and Wales. Why on earth should it happen in Northern Ireland? I strongly recommend that the Committee accept amendment No. 6 and the consequential amendments Nos. 201 to 209.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Let me assure the Committee that the Government wholly share the aim of my hon. Friend the Member for South Down, in relation to his description of the role and functions of the Policing Board. We want it to be a powerful body, accountable to the people of Northern Ireland. I shall not go into the minutiae of the financial issues, but it will be a high-level body dealing with economy, efficiency and effectiveness arrangements, In that sense, I agree entirely that we must establish a proper relationship between the Secretary of State, the Policing Board and the Chief Constable in relation to the delivery of a best value approach. Everyone wants such an approach to be adopted.

<P>
However, my hon. Friend and I differ on one point. The Chief Constable will have responsibility for the effective use of the grant allocated to him. I find it difficult to rule out the role of the Chief Constable in that process, if he is to be held accountable for it. We must find a mechanism that will give overarching responsibility to the Policing Board to ensure that it is carrying out its functions properly and setting the standards in best value, but I am sure that my hon. Friend will agree that we cannot write out the role of the Chief Constable in terms of the delivery mechanism for that.

<P>
However, we need to establish greater clarity in terms of the way in which the provision is expressed in the Bill. I hope that I shall help my hon. Friend by saying that we are prepared to take on board the concerns that he and others have raised on this matter, and to consider again how the Bill can be better defined. We shall return to the matter on Report. It will not be easy to do so in precise terms-some doubts may remain-but we envisage that the Policing Board will have the important role of delivering the efficiency, economy and effectiveness that people demand of the police service. We cannot ignore the role of the Secretary of State because he will allocate the money, or that of the Chief Constable, who is at the delivery end of the process. The relationship needs to be clarified, and we shall do that on Report.

<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I share the Minister's views, but he seems to be trying to exclude the fact that, at the end of the day, the buck-especially with regard to finance and best value-stops with Secretaries of State. An English police service, such as the Thames Valley police in my constituency, has complete autonomy but, ultimately, the buck stops with the Home Secretary.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> That is a strong point. That is why I said that we need a better way to deal with this matter. It would not be right for the Secretary of State or the Policing Board to be involved in the minutiae of the relevant decisions. Standards will be set in this context. There is an allocation of £650 million for policing and the Secretary of State cannot simply walk away from the matter. It is wrong to suggest that we do not want to deal with the matter or that the Chief Constable will say, ``Well, that ain't my responsibility, guys. Define what I have to do and I'll go off and deliver it.'' That would not involve the proper exercise of line management responsibilities. Everyone in the three legs of the structure should seek to find the best way to spend the money, which involves extracting the maximum advantage and return for the pounds that are allocated to policing in Northern Ireland. We shall consider the matter and return to it on Report.

<P>
With that assurance, I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for South Down will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. William Thompson </B>(West Tyrone): I want to speak briefly to amendment No. 243, which is our response to the confusion about the board's policing and normal operational powers. I am grateful to the Minister for sending me a letter that clarified the position. There is no need to press the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister, and I agree with him that there is a better way to deal with the matter. Obviously I agree with him; if I did not, we should not have tabled an amendment. I take him to mean-he should stop me if I am wrong-that he will consider what that better way is and take on board the amendment's purpose. We may revisit this matter on Report. I underscore the fact that there is a better way to deal with this matter. On that basis, and with those assurances, I shall not press the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I do not have to be boxed in too much with regard to the purport of the hon. Gentleman's amendment. The principle that lies behind his proposal needs better and different clarification. We have taken on board the weight of the argument and the need for clarity. If we can find a better way to approach this matter that satisfies all of us, that would be to the betterment of the delivery of policing in Northern Ireland.

<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 234, in page 15, line 21, after first ``the'', insert ``primary and''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 226, in page 15, line 21, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) to protect the human rights of all without distraction in accordance with the UK's obligations under international human rights law;

<P>
( ) to uphold the rule of law;'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 7, in page 15, line 42, leave out ``have regard to'' and insert ``comply with''.

<P>
No. 235, in page 15, line 43, leave out subsection (5).

<P>
No. 231, in page 15, line 44, leave out from ``functions'' to end of line 46 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`in co-operation with, and with the aim of securing the support of, the local community.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 242, in page 15, line 46, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(6) Where the requirements of subsections (1) and (5) conflict, the requirements of subsection (1) shall prevail.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The amendments are simple but important. The Bill states that it will be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the general duty of members of the police force-

<P>
(a) to protect life and property;

<P>
(b) to preserve order;

<P>
(c) to prevent the commission of offences;

<P>
(d) where an offence has been committed, to take measures to bring the offender to justice.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That should be their primary duty. The police service carries out a range of general duties and has responsibilities in many areas that are not related to crime, such as traffic control or incidents of fire or drowning. The specific responsibility relating to crime should be singled out as the primary duty, rather than a general one.

<P>
In addition to the requirements under subsection (1), subsection (5) requires that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The members of the police force shall, so far as practicable, carry out their functions with the aim of securing that the policing of any part of Northern Ireland is carried out with the participation and support of the local community.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We hope that things are changing but sadly, it is not always possible to carry out the primary-to use my chosen term-policing duty with the accord of members of the public. There may be, for example, large housing estates where criminals hold sway and hold the community to ransom through the threat of violence. They might run a drugs regime, for instance. This is not a political point; it is a policing point-quite novel for this Bill. Amendment No. 242 would allow the police to make sure that they give precedence to the requirements of subsection (1) over those of subsection (5).

<P>
I hope that the Minister will look seriously at the two amendments, so that we have a sense that law and order are very much part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. ÷pik:</B> I want to speak to amendments Nos. 226 and 231. The spirit of what the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone said is in line with an issue that we have also identified. I shall get amendment No. 226 out of the way quickly.

<P>
The clause is the defining one in relation to policing functions. Patten noted in paragraph 4.1:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is a central proposition of this report that the fundamental purpose of policing should be, in the words of the Agreement, the protection and vindication of the human rights of all.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The commission went on to say in paragraph 4.3:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Upholding human rights and upholding the law should be one and the same thing.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That should be given explicit expression in the Bill. That is what amendment No. 226 would do, by adding a few lines to the list of responsibilities and duties set out in subsection (1). I hope that the Minister considers that the amendment is self-explanatory, and I shall be interested to hear what he has to say.

<P>
Amendment No. 231 is even more important, because, as the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone implied, there are some dangers that the phraseology in subsection (5) could lead us down a path we do not want to go down. The amendment would replace some of the text towards the end of subsection (5) with the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in co-operation with, and with the aim of securing the support of, the local community.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That wording does not change the spirit of the clause, but would prevent any future attempt to justify vigilante behaviour under the guise of legality. The concern centres on the word ``participation''. The police should work in co-operation with the community, but the community should not participate in policing if that can be interpreted as meaning that some sort of vigilante behaviour is justifiable.

<P>
Nobody in this Room would pretend or believe in their heart that vigilante activity of the type that we have seen in Northern Ireland leading to paramilitary beatings is acceptable, but we must recognise-I made this point on Second Reading and at other times in the House-that there are those who genuinely claim that the support of the local community lends legitimacy to the illegal way in which they seek to ``police'' their own communities. If we want to get the paramilitaries out of such self-appointed law enforcement behaviour, we must ensure that we do not let that sort of pseudo-justification creep into the Bill.

<P>
That is the concept behind amendment No. 231. As I hope the Minister will agree, the change is in wording rather than in spirit, but it makes it explicit that one of the expectations of the passage of the Bill is the removal of any residual legitimacy that the paramilitaries claim for their work.

<P>
In that context, I hope that the Minister will be able to accept amendments Nos. 226 and-especially-231.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> I want to say a few words on amendment No. 235. As the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire and my hon. Friend the Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone said, we have difficulties with subsection (5). Of course, one would hope that the policing would be carried out with the participation and support of the local community, but there are great dangers in putting that in the Bill in those terms, because it could be open to misrepresentation and misconstruction. Our first option was to remove the subsection from the Bill. As the Government do not always delete what we want them to delete, we tabled other amendments and if they are not prepared to delete, perhaps they are prepared to improve.

<P>
Having listened to the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire and having seen his amendment, I urge the Minister to consider the concerns that have been expressed by the Ulster Unionist party and the hon. Gentleman and to make the provision more acceptable to all of us.

<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> Amendment No. 7 refers to subsection (4), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In carrying out their functions the members of the police force shall have regard to the code of ethics under<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
clause 48, which states that the code of ethics will lay down
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>standards of conduct and practice expected of members of the police force.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
There is an inherent weakness in the drafting of subsection (4). The amendment would delete the words ``have regard to'', which are not strong enough, and substitute ``comply with''. If the code of ethics is to be taken seriously by police officers, there is no legitimate argument for it not being binding on them. It is unacceptable that they should merely ``have regard to'' the codes of practice and the code of ethics in the performance of their duties. There may be no sanction and it may be difficult to create a sanction if there is no compulsion to perform according to the code of ethics, the purpose of which, we hope, is to integrate into police practice matters covered by the European convention on human rights. We must ensure that human rights become a reality in Northern Ireland and not an aspiration, but the wording of the provision is aspirational and not mandatory. There may be an element of lip service in the provision in that the Government hope that the code of ethics will apply, but there is no feeling that that will be required of police officers in the performance of their duties, unequivocally, in a non-sectarian way and even-handedly. Amendment No. 7 would require the police to ``comply with'' the code of ethics and would provide it with strength and substance. If it is not compulsory and is simply a matter that may or may not be complied with, it will lose its effectiveness. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment and change the words ``have regard to'' to ``comply with''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> There is a variety of amendments in this group and as the arguments for them were developed, I confess that my reaction was to object to all of them.

<P>
I shall speak first to the amendments moved by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire, particularly amendment No. 226. The hon. Gentleman had half a point to make, but that is all. There is something slightly odd about clause 30 because it is an attempt to define the role of police officers in their general duty of upholding the law. Therefore, in so far as amendment No. 226 makes a reference to upholding the law, it occurred to me that we might as easily and as simply put it into the clause that it is the duty of police officers to uphold the law, full stop. I wonder whether the clause takes us much further, but I should be interested to hear from the Minister why it was decided to insert it in that form.

<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Once one moves towards putting down what is in the clause, which generally seems to be part of upholding the law, the waters are muddied considerably if one introduces nations' and international human rights law that it is not incorporated into our legal system in any way. That brings me back to my comment in an earlier sitting about the material being otiose. In this case, it is positively misleading.

<P>
<B>Mr. ÷pik:</B> Surely the hon. Gentleman is not implying that things that are explicitly stated in Patten should not be explicitly included in the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> A police officer's remit is the upholding of the law; it is not the upholding of abstract concepts. Indeed, if that starts to creep into the discharge of his duties, he will be in danger of exceeding his functions or being in breach of the law. Therefore, the upholding of the law is central to a police officer's activity, and we must keep it within those bounds.

<P>
In so far as the clause simply defines more closely what upholding the law involves, I have no quarrel with it, although the concept could have been encompassed in that single phrase. However, the first part of amendment No. 226 seems to go further than that and to present problems.

<P>
<B>Mr. ÷pik:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman twice, but I want to press the point. Rather than thinking that the amendment is otiose-to use one of his favourite words, I believe-does he accept that we have here an opportunity to lead the rest of the United Kingdom by making this important addition to the duties of the police? He will see that the amendment says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in accordance with the UK's obligations under international human rights law.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Given the history of human rights violations in Northern Ireland, surely the hon. Gentleman will accept that there is a stronger case than he has so far implied for including that extra sentence.

<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I trust that, since the incorporation of the Human Rights Act 1998 into our law, including in Northern Ireland, any breach of that Act will be a breach of the law. Therefore, it will be a matter for the police, in upholding the law, to deal with it. But in so far as we are going into abstract international obligations that have not been incorporated into our law, the clause places a duty on the police that they, as the servants of the law, cannot possibly get involved with; it is a matter for politicians. The clause does not set a wonderful new precedent by putting a burden on them which, because it is indefinable and does not form part of our national law, is impossible for them to discharge.

<P>
All sorts of things go on in our society on a daily basis that some people would regard as immoral and some might regard as a breach of abstract notions of human rights, but which do not constitute breaches of the law. It is police officers' job to uphold the law and politicians' job to tell them what laws they should uphold. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire is in danger of mixing those two concepts, which is not helpful to the police.

<P>
Amendment No. 7 suggests that the police should comply with the code of ethics, instead of simply paying regard to it. The hon. Gentleman has a point, but one difficulty is that we do not know what the code of ethics consists of; we have not seen it. Until we see the code of ethics, it is likely to contain precisely those abstract concepts, to pick up the point that I made to the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire. There is a danger that, in using the word ``compliance'', we will be asking police officers to comply with, rather than have regard to, matters that cannot be closely defined. There again, I prefer the current wording, although I accept that if the code of ethics were to be tightly drawn, it might be possible to say that there must be compliance with it. However, as we do not have that document before us, we would make ourselves a hostage to fortune if we inserted the word ``compliance'' rather than the phrase ``having regard to''. The Minister will doubtless enlighten us a little about what the code of ethics is likely to contain.

<P>
I have discussed the two main points that arose from our discussion. I could make one or two further points, but they would not be of great substance. I am reasonably content about the clause's drafting.

<P>
To pick up on the point that we discussed when we debated amendment No. 234, I wonder whether the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a primary and general duty<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is needed-``general duty'' appears to cover all the relevant points. We are in danger of agreeing to words that would not add anything substantial to the clause.

<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Temple-Morris </B>(Leominster): I sympathise with much of what the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire said. He dealt admirably with amendment No. 226, which involves a human rights aspect. If the recipient of a difficult-perhaps armed-arrest protested to the arresting police officer that he was acting in a manner that was contrary to the UK's obligations under international human rights law, how would he react? Frankly, we should dispose of the amendment, which takes things too far. With all respect to the hon. Gentleman, it is otiose-I love using that word.

<P>
I sympathise with the motive behind amendment No. 234, which deals with primary and general duties, but that amendment would not improve the Bill. The word ``general'' is not relevant-we simply need to refer to ``the duty'' of members of the police force. ``General duty'' sounds rather vague. That is what the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone was getting at. However, I wish that, instead of inserting the word ``primary'', he had proposed the deletion of the word ``general''. I shall obviously be persuaded by the eloquence of my right hon. Friend the Minister in this regard.

<P>
We should give some consideration to the amendments that revolve around the use of the word ``participation'' in subsection (5). ``Participation'' obviously means more consultative participation and involvement in the policing of an area. However, the subsection's drafting leans towards visions of police officers leading lots of howling locals in a cavalry charge up the hill towards an estate. I know that that is not the amendment's purpose, but it leans towards such an interpretation.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I was going to raise this matter earlier, but I refrained from doing so. Does the hon. Gentleman think that ultimately we are called on to participate with the police? We have a common-law duty to assist them in the discharge of their duties. On that basis, is not participation a perfectly respectable activity for citizens?

<P>
<B>Mr. Temple-Morris:</B> It certainly is-there is no need to argue about that. However, in the circumstances that are of concern to the Ulster Unionist party, the use of the word ``participation'' begs the question-how active should participation be? Would not the Ulster Unionist proposal encourage participation in circumstances in which it might be better not to encourage it? I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Minister will deal with that point and limit the use of the word ``participation''. Frankly, I preferred the wording in the Liberal Democrat amendment.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. George Howarth) </b> Not for the first time, I find myself in complete agreement with everything that was said by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve), and I am in some agreement with the sentiments that lie behind most of what was said.</B><P>

<P>
I shall begin by responding to amendments Nos. 234, 235 and 242. Amendment No. 234, which was spoken to by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, would redefine the general duty of the police as a ``primary and general duty''. In the Government's view, the additional wording adds nothing because, as the hon. Member for Beaconsfield made clear, these are, in any event, the duties of the police.

<P>
Amendment No. 242 would require that when the general duty of policing conflicted with the requirement to secure the co-operation of the community, the general duty would prevail. The amendment creates a false dichotomy, as the hon. Member for Beaconsfield suggested.

<P>
Amendment No. 235 would remove altogether the requirement to secure the participation of the community. Perhaps I should give the Committee an idea of what we mean by participation, as I was so pleasantly invited to do my hon. Friend the Member for Leominster (Mr. Temple-Morris)-although he was ably answered by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield. We are rightly describing the responsibility that we all have for sharing with the police the responsibility for the good order of our neighbourhoods, for the prevention of crime and for the prosecution of criminal activity.

<P>
I should, however, make it clear that we are not referring to some kind of informal, unauthorised-but nevertheless legal-vigilante-style activity. By the term ``participation'', we mean the co-operation and involvement of the community, and the transfer of information, which is often the lifeblood of any police investigation. The Bill has been formulated in that spirit.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The Minister is speaking to amendments Nos. 234, 235 and 242 as though they were complementary. Amendments Nos. 234 and 242 are certainly complementary and intended to be so. However, amendment No. 235 is intended to be a poor alternative. I take on board the point made by the hon. Member for Leominster that the removal of the word ``general'' would serve much of the purpose that I had intended by the amendments, although perhaps, on reflection, not the good amendments. The Minister must address the interpretation of the word ``participation'' vis-‡-vis that of ``co-operation''. There is a huge difference in terms of practical policing.

<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am grateful-I think-for that intervention.

<P>
Community participation is one of the clearly stated recommendations in the Patten report. In the sense that I have just defined the meaning of ``participation'', it would fly in the face of Patten if we were to remove this provision. We accept that there could be occasions in which the need to secure community co-operation and the need to preserve order were in conflict. The hon. Gentleman has wide practical experience of these matters, and could probably give us some good examples of that. It does not require a great deal of imagination to understand that those two needs could come into conflict.

<P>
However, such eventualities are covered by the requirement to secure co-operation ``so far as practicable''. That is a key phrase. Obviously, there will be situations on the ground in which it is impossible, either in the time available or because of the circumstances, to secure that kind of co-operation. I think that I have now covered that point.

<P>
Amendment No. 7 would require members of the police force to comply with the code of ethics instead of having regard to it. Members of the Committee will recall that the selfsame issue was raised during the debate on clause 2, when the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh recommended that the board should monitor compliance with the code. It was made clear at the time that that was at odds with clause 30-which requires officers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>have regard to the code-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and we agreed to consider the matter in future.

<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
We agree with my hon. Friend the Member for South Down that the code is important and should not be something to which we merely pay lip service. We also agree that it should be given more practical effect. However, we have some difficulty with rigid compliance with a code. We have accepted his point that the code should have teeth, and we will consider obliging the Secretary of State to reflect the code in binding disciplinary and conduct regulations.

<P>
However, codes, by their nature, are not legally binding in the same way as is primary or subordinate legislation. The code of ethics should not, for example, be a means of coming up with a second set of disciplinary procedures for the police. That would lead to an enormous capacity for confusion about whether one should comply with the implied procedures of the code or, in different circumstances, with the actual disciplinary regulations. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield would probably be the first to concede that that is precisely the sort of territory where lawyers see pound signs looming. As much as I am in favour of fairness in any kind of disciplinary procedures, I should not want to create that kind of situation.

<P>
The code of ethics should not go beyond what Patten said. I have to tell the Committee that we cannot find any examples of codes that have directly binding legal effect. That is not to say that they do not exist somewhere, but an exhaustive search has failed to discover one. Of course, plenty of codes have strong statutory backing to ensure that their effect is felt. We shall consider those and try to reach a satisfactory outcome. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for South Down finds that significant. Our intentions are the same, but we differ on the means by which to achieve them. If we keep talking, we shall find a way.

<P>
In the light of those comments, and of the debate as a whole, I ask my hon. Friend not to press the amendment and to judge the Government's response on the basis of what we say when we reach clause 48, on the code of ethics, or on Report.

<P>
I agree with the hon. Member for Beaconsfield on amendment No. 226. The general functions of a police officer to uphold the rule of law and to protect human rights are precisely in accordance with the United Kingdom's obligations under international human rights law. We have already debated compliance with international human rights at some length. I appreciate the motives of the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire in tabling the amendment-it is important to reassert those principles from time to time. However, the same reasons apply as to why we cannot accept it. As I have said before, the Bill contains numerous human rights safeguards. Integrating the European convention on human rights into police practice is what Patten recommended in recommendation 3, and the Government intend to implement that.

<P>
Amendment No. 226 would also require police officers
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to uphold the rule of law.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Again, I respect the intentions of the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire, but to assume that the centre of police activity is ever anything other than upholding the rule of law is a bizarre concept. There would be no justification for a police force that had anything other than that aim at its centre, unless one were in certain parts of the eastern Europe before the iron curtain was lifted.

<P>
The human rights-based oath rightly refers to constables
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>discharging all their duties according to the law,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
but I am not sure that we should go beyond that. I acknowledge the hon. Gentleman's sincerity, which shines through on every occasion. However, occasionally the practicality takes some time to catch up with the sincerity.

<P>
Amendment No. 231, again in the name of the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire, would require the police to carry out their functions
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in co-operation with, and with the aim of securing the support of, the local community.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman will be not surprised but pleased to learn that the Government accept that the police should secure the participation of the public, as suggested by Patten in paragraphs 5.14, 7.8 and 8.3. The hon. Gentleman's formulation helpfully tightens up the requirement to co-operate with the community and places a more positive onus on the police to work in partnership with it. I am therefore pleased to tell the Committee that I am happy to accept the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. ÷pik:</B> I am reeling with shock from that discovery.

<P>
The argument on amendment No. 226 has been well made and I do not intend to raise it again in subsequent debates. It is clear that there is a difference of view about whether it would be otiose to include convention provisions that relate to United Kingdom and international law. The Minister mentioned that they might be more appropriate to a former eastern European state, but I now realise that I have been genetically programmed to move this in memory of the dark days when the KGB used to run amok in Estonia.

<P>
I am delighted to learn that the Government are willing to accept this formulation of amendment No. 231. The best way to describe what it attempts to do is to draw the distinction between participating in a team and co-operating with a team. Participating in a team would imply that one is on the field, playing the game, whereas co-operating with a team may imply a support function. I am sure that the latter is intended in this part of the Bill. I am grateful, therefore, that the Government have seen the wisdom of my words.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I am more than happy that the Government have accepted amendment No. 231 in the name of the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire. That goes 95 per cent. of the way towards meeting amendment No. 242, which we felt, and I said at the outset, was an important amendment. I think that we have achieved our objective, if not through our own amendment, certainly through the one that has been accepted.

<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I listened carefully to what the Minister said in response to amendment No. 7, when he talked about the compatibility of partners and the duality of intent. What is more important is the satisfactory outcome to which he aspires in meeting our arguments on the amendment.

<P>
I do not accept the argument put by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield that, because one does not know its contents, a code of ethics that is to be evolved should not be compulsory in any circumstances. However, that is another matter.

<P>
I am somewhat perturbed about some of the Minister's comments in relation not to the undesirability but to the difficulty of rigid compliance. Do we go by a code or by a disciplinary process? Those are the wrong messages to send to those whom I represent. The code of practice is an important issue in the day-to-day performance of the police officer on the beat.

<P>
On the understanding that the Minister seeks a satisfactory outcome to the points that I have raised on behalf of those whom I represent, I shall not press amendment No. 207 to a vote.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
