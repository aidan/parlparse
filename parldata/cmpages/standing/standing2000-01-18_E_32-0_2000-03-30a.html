<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): I beg to move amendment No. 889, in page 101, line 39, after `may', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`subject to implementation of an appropriate tendering process (where practicable)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is an important amendment to an important part of the Bill. Clause 186 deals with financial assistance and what the rail authority may do to secure and provide improvements or in terms of developments by other railway authorities. We aim to find out from the Government precisely what that role involves. There is a suspicion that the provision will allow the Strategic Rail Authority to interfere rather more in the running of the railway and there may also be greater interference with franchise agreements. The briefing that we were given by Railtrack states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This clause gives very wide ranging powers to the SRA. Whilst Railtrack accepts that the SRA will have a role in making grants for particular projects we would hope that any direct funding would be at the margin and that the grants would not undermine the relationship between Railtrack and the Train Operators. Direct funding and direction of investment on a wide scale would make it more difficult for Railtrack to raise capital to fund our investment programme and would reduce the train operators' leverage on Railtrack. We believe this would make it harder for Railtrack to meet the aspirations of Government and passengers for an improving and growing railway.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is concern among some outside bodies.
<P>
Our amendment No. 889 would ensure that any involvement by the SRA would have to be on the basis of competitive tendering. This country has a fairly good history of competitive tendering: of allowing people to submit tenders for services. We are not sure why this provision has been omitted from the clause. We shall be interested to hear what the Government are thinking on this part of the Bill and, in particular, why they do not think that there should be a requirement on the SRA, where it steps in, to conform to something like the competitive tendering process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I will deal with the broader issues that the hon. Gentleman raised before dealing with the amendment.
<P>
During our proceedings we shall have further opportunities to explore competitive tendering. The Government have no anti-competitive tendering intentions for the SRA. In our discussion on amendment No. 881, we stated that in cases where the authority acts as a procurement agency, the value-for-money duty may drive it to a competitive process, which is a good thing. Franchising is one such example. Companies are competing for longer replacement franchises as part of the franchise replacement process. However, competition would not be appropriate where the authority was not securing services but responding to a request from the industry for specific financial assistance, such as an application for a freight facilities grant. The authority will judge such applications against criteria for assistance and it should not have to invent spurious competition.
<P>
In response to a question from the hon. Gentleman about the SRA's relationship with the train operators, as our exchanges unfold there will be further opportunities to examine that matter in greater detail. For now, I assure the hon. Gentleman that the provisions keep the existing basic structure of TOC and franchising director relationships.
<P>
The amendment would require the SRA to exercise all its financial functions under clause 186, subject to a tendering process, with the proviso of ``where practicable''. The amendment is both unnecessary and inappropriate. Of course, we expect the exercise of any power to make grants, loans or guarantees under the clause to achieve the best possible value for money. That is why clause 182(4) explicitly requires the authority to secure any grants, loans or other payments ``efficiently and economically''. Therefore, the amendment is unnecessary. The authority, in the commonsense application of its value-for-money duty, must decide whether, or to what degree, competition is appropriate to the facts and circumstances of each case and must disregard any dogmatic requirement for it. I hope that with those assurances the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his reply. The Bill gives the Secretary of State extensive powers to give directions to the SRA. Will decisions to intervene be purely a matter for the SRA, in line with its strategies, or does the Under-Secretary think that an occasion might arise when the Secretary of State would intervene by giving instructions to the SRA? This might happen for political reasons. For example, there might be a problem in a given area and the SRA might wish to set up a service. How arm's length will the relationship be? There is a suspicion that because the clause is so broadly drawn the Minister could effectively tell the SRA that something ought to be done and it would be under an obligation to pursue it. We spoke about the Secretary of State's involvement being purely on the pay ration and pensions side rather than that he would be empowered to direct that a specific service or whatever was needed and had to be provided. I am trying to draw from the Under-Secretary a few more assurances about how the system will operate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> That is a perfectly reasonable line of questioning. I reiterate that we shall retain the basic structures and relationships. The Government's intentions for the relationship between the Secretary of State and the SRA are clear from the Secretary of State's existing relationship with the franchising director. The SRA will operate in the framework of the directions and guidance that the Secretary of State issues to the franchising director. We do not expect any detailed interventions from the Secretary of State, although residual powers to do so will remain in specific circumstances. The current relationships will apply to the SRA.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the Under-Secretary for that explanation, on the basis of which I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 890, in page 101, line 40, after `arrangements', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`consistent with the strategies it has adopted'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Under the Bill, the SRA will have to set out the strategies that it adopts to fulfil its obligations. Under the amendment, any arrangements that it entered into would have to be consistent with those strategies. If the SRA became involved in financial grants to services, those grants should be consistent with its overall objectives. The amendment would make the Bill tidier and clearer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Under the amendment, the SRA could use its powers to give financial assistance only if doing so were compatible with its strategies. I am pleased that the Opposition have recognised the importance of the overall strategic framework that we shall create for the railway industry. I agree wholeheartedly that the SRA must have a strategy and that it must exercise its powers, including those of giving financial assistance, in a manner that is consistent with its strategies. However, I reassure the hon. Gentleman that the amendment is not necessary to achieve that aim.
<P>
The task of formulating strategies with respect to its purposes will be a primary function of the SRA under the Bill. All the SRA's other functions, including its powers to give financial assistance, must be exercised in accordance with the strategies that it has formulated, as stated in clause 182(1). Any financial assistance that the SRA gives must be for a purpose that is consistent with its strategies. There is no need to duplicate that provision in clauses 186 to 191 and 194 to 197. I hope that with that reassurance the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): As my hon. Friend said, the amendment would make the Bill tidier, but it goes to the heart of part IV. The Bill gives the SRA extraordinarily wide powers: the Bill represents a move towards the quasi-nationalisation of the railways by providing the SRA with bizarrely wide powers. The clause deals with financial assistance, but it might allow the circumvention of the financial relationship between the TOCs and Railtrack, about which many people are concerned.
<P>
The Under-Secretary is right, to a degree, to say that the assurance given in clause 182(1) would be duplicated under the amendment. However, clause 182(1) contains a general caveat that Railtrack must operate within its purposes and written strategies, as is correct. Railtrack does operate within its strategies and plans and it is reassuring that that applies to everything that the SRA does.
<P>
Clause 186 is central to the concerns that I mentioned, especially the financial relationship between Railtrack and the TOCs. It would be sensible therefore to reiterate in that context what is covered under clause 182(1), and to say to Railtrack, ``You may not undermine that important relationship. You must be constrained by the strategies laid down in the plans that are open to public scrutiny''. We need to know who is financing our railways. By inserting that provision into clause 186, it is made abundantly clear. To some degree the Under-Secretary is right to say that clause 186 duplicates the previous clause, but it is worth while to reiterate that important point.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I am pleased that the Under-Secretary has partly reassured me by saying that the wording does not need to go into every part of the Bill. As the hon. Gentleman is aware, the Secretary of State has wide powers to intervene.
<P>
The ability of the authority to borrow up to £3 billion was discussed, although we do not yet know whether the Government intend to give it even a fraction of that. It would give the SRA latitude to intervene and to interfere in the system. We are trying to constrain it slightly in terms of the adopted strategies. With a reasonable Secretary of State there may be no problem, but someone may wish to take a proactive role and intervene in the industry via the SRA—nationalisation by the back door may be too strong a phrase. The Bill could provide a Secretary of State with an agenda that did not chime with that of the SRA, and we would end up with greater political direction in the way in which our railways are run. That is one of our concerns about clause 186.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I shall say a word about the detail of the financial activities of the SRA. Whatever direction the SRA takes, its activities will have to be paid for. We want to encourage private investment in the railway, Railtrack, the train operating companies—passenger and freight—or special purpose vehicles. It does not matter which of the routes is preferred: none is uniquely virtuous or wicked. Each may be appropriate in different circumstances. Everyone seems to agree that private money is available; it may need pump priming with public funds, but private investors are ready to take a stake in the railway.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Let me deal with the hon. Gentleman's assertion that the SRA's powers are too wide. There is a contradiction in the Opposition's position.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Before the hon. Gentleman moves on—
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Let me say briefly that Government support for the industry will continue to be principally via the train operating companies. In clause 186 we seek to secure a degree of flexibility to allow for the topping-up process to which I alluded.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for giving way. I want to pick up the point he made about the importance of the readily available private investment in the railways. Is he not concerned that, because of the threat of re-regulation under the Bill, Railtrack's share price has already fallen from £17 to £7 or £8? That is a direct result of the realisation that there will be more regulations, that it will be harder to make profits and that it will be much more difficult to raise extra funds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I reject the preposterous suggestion that the Bill contains the threat of re-regulation. The hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) asserts that the SRA will have ``extraordinarily wide powers'', while his sidekick, the hon. Member for Pool (Mr. Syms) says that the Bill gives the Secretary of State ``quite wide powers'' to intervene. The Opposition should get their story straight and decide whether the Bill creates an independent, unaccountable quango, or a creature of the Secretary of State. If we are to have a serious debate—I am a listening Minister—the Opposition's story must be clear. However, I am delighted that the canard of back-door renationalisation has raised its ugly head so early in our proceedings, because I am looking forward to disposing of that absurd proposal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The hon. Gentleman must contain himself; I shall give way to him in a second. I am trying to answer his questions in a conscientious and detailed fashion. He might think it necessary to reiterate that the Opposition's amendment is consistent with the strategies but, for the good reasons that I have already expounded, we do not accept that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The Minister says that my argument is inconsistent with that of my hon. Friend the Member for Poole. My hon. Friend complained about the Secretary of State's undue powers; I complained about those of the SRA. Those complaints are entirely consistent with each other because, in different parts of the Bill, both the Secretary of State and the SRA accrue large powers which at present are left to the market, to Railtrack and to TOCs. The Government are interfering in the free movement of capital and of business.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I rebut that argument on a philosophical level. Those who scrutinised the Railways Bill in the Standing Committee in the previous Parliament came to the unavoidable conclusion that the paradox of rail privatisation was that the privatised railway would be more regulated than it was under the old nationalised British Rail structure. Details such as the need for safety cases and the powers of the regulator and the franchising director in respect of the railways' day-to-day operations makes it subject to closer control by powers other than the body responsible for operating it than it was previously subject to. I put that thought in the hon. Gentleman's mind.
<P>
I reiterate that the Bill will not impose a harsher regulatory regime. It is equally preposterous to suggest that the decline in the share price of Railtrack and the rail operating companies has anything to do with anxiety connected with the Bill. If there was such anxiety, there would not be such fierce competition in the current refranchising process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Woolas </B>(Oldham, East and Saddleworth): The hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) was not present when we discussed the possible relationship between Railtrack's share price and the Bill. Is it not the case that the Association of Train Operating Companies has welcomed the Bill warmly and looks forward to the new investment in the rail industry that will be facilitated by it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> As always, my hon. Friend is absolutely right. We are delighted that the Bill has received a wide welcome in the railway community. In addition, it was recently endorsed by the hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells (Mr. Norman), whose absence from Committee is a source of regret to us all. However, I am glad to see the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster), leader of the Liberal Democrat faction, offering support from a sedentary position. In a recent interview with the Financial Times, the hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells said that the previous Administration made a big mistake in leaving the nation with a fragmented railway system. The Bill will repair that damage, as been recognised by the whole railway community in its firm welcome for the measure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I am glad that the Under-Secretary takes such an interest in the views of my hon. Friend the Member for Tunbridge Wells.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Where is he?
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I am sure that he is doing good works.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have had enough of this banter. It is acceptable for hon. Members to score modest party political points—indeed, I am aware that that occasionally happens in this place. However, we all know why the Secretary of State and the Opposition spokesman on transport are not in Committee, and discussion of such matters will not help the progress of our deliberations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 28, in page 102, line 2, leave out subsection (2).
<P>
The amendment continues our theme in relation to this part of the Bill. The amendment would delete subsection (2), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Agreements or other arrangements entered into under this section may provide for the Authority to make grants or other payments or loans, or to give guarantees, on such terms and subject to any such conditions as the Authority considers appropriate.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a widely drawn power. The Secretary of State and the SRA both have wide powers. It is conceivable that a proactive secretary of State would wish to interfere. However, should the chairman or the board of the SRA want to intervene widely, it could do so, unless prevented by the Secretary of State.
<P>
I am sure that there are good reasons for the inclusion of such a provision in the Bill. However, will the Under-Secretary give a full explanation, as he has not answered all our questions about how financial assistance would be given in this important part of the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I shall begin by addressing the detail of the amendment and then tackle the broader aspects of the SRA's financial role, as requested by the hon. Member for Poole.
<P>
I am rather puzzled by the amendment, which would remove from the SRA any powers to make any loans, grants or guarantees, or to attach conditions to any financial assistance that it gives. The SRA will need to have the power to make grants, loans and guarantees to fulfil its purposes. At the most basic level, it will need to make franchise payments. More broadly, we intend that it should be able to make grants for freight and put money into imaginative and effective means by which to encourage the development of the network. It is equally important that the SRA can attach conditions to such payments; such a safeguard is needed for the protection of public money. In that way, the SRA can be assured that a freight grant; for example, for a rail crane, will be used for that and not for another purpose.
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The broader issue of financing the rail industry is a matter for partnership between the industry and Government. Sir Alastair Morton, chairman of the shadow SRA has already made clear that he expects the approach to be one of partnership, with industry playing its full part.
<P>
How will the SRA use the powers in the clause? The SRA will have a major role in the future development and financing of the industry. At the most basic level, the SRA will be responsible for franchising and making payments to franchise companies. At the moment, few of those companies do not require subsidy, so the SRA will need powers to make payments. Current contracts will need to be fulfilled unless they are replaced or re-let.
<P>
We have already announced our approach to replacing franchises and, as Committee members know, negotiations have begun. We are looking for new trains and more of them, better stations and services, and greater overall capacity. The shadow authority has announced the parties selected for the first phase of franchise replacement negotiations and the next steps. Hon. Members may ask how much the Government are going to provide for franchise replacement. However, they should be aware that that is matter for negotiation, in which the shadow SRA will get the best deal that it can. The question of Government subsidy will be resolved in the spending round, as is normal. Subsidy to the train operators stands at £1.3 billion this year, and we considering what extra subsidy may be needed in the 2000 spending review.
<P>
Infrastructure investment is very much in our minds in light of the network management statement issued by Railtrack this morning. The Government welcome the greater detail in that statement, and the regulator will now consult widely with a view to determining whether it meets the industry's needs and Railtrack's licence obligations. As I said earlier, funding decisions will be taken in the context of the spending review. I must point out that the previous Government were responsible for a decline in subsidies. Our vision, however, is of a growing railway that requires greater investment from the private and public sectors.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): Is the Under-Secretary's last remark an indication that the Government subsidy is expected to rise rather than to continue to decline as, the current comprehensive spending review document suggests?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> My remark was neither a indication that subsidies would rise, nor one that they would continue to decline. Such matters will be subject to negotiations with the franchisees, under the terms of the 2000 spending review.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> My understanding of the matter is the same as the Liberal spokesman's. Obloquy was poured on the head of the previous Government for a decline in subsidy, ergo subsidy will now increase. However, the Under-Secretary now seems to be saying that it is perfectly possible that the subsidy will continue to decline under the present Government. Does he believe that an increased subsidy for the railways is a good thing? If so, will the Government deliver it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I did not pour scorn. To set the record straight, describing my remark as obloquy overeggs the pudding. I simply observed, as a matter of fact, that subsidies declined under the previous Government. All these matters will be taken into account. Let me repeat that, under the 2000 spending review, the need for extra subsidy will be assessed. It is a matter for negotiation and we look forward to hearing the results of those negotiations in due course.
<P>
To complete my response to Railtrack's statement this morning, I draw the Committee's attention to the statement issued by my noble Friend the Minister for Transport, the Lord Macdonald of Tradeston. He was pleased that in its network management statement, Railtrack responded to the previous year's criticisms and he looks forward to hearing a response from the rest of the railway industry. That is effectively what I said, so I am delighted to find that we are singing from the same hymn sheet.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Minister referred to a statement issued this morning and I am obliged to ask him whether it has been made available to members of the Committee. The chairman takes a dim view of discussing documents that have not been made available to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I certainly accept your reproof, Mr. Gale. The statement was released as a news release to the media, rather than a document issued to the House. I acknowledge your point, Mr. Gale, and I shall ensure in referring to such communications in future, that they are appropriately drawn to the attention of yourself and other members of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth (Aldershot):</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. In view of your remarks and the Minister's response, should not the Minister now obtain copies of the press release from officials for the benefit of the Committee? The statement was issued to the media rather than to Parliament, which is an important matter. The Minister could readily obtain copies for us.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is not a point of order for the Chair, but the Minister has heard what the hon. Gentleman said. My general impression is that Ministers have endeavoured whenever possible to make documents available throughout our proceedings. It is a matter for the Minister to decide whether to do so now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I undertake to ensure that the piece of paper in question is circulated to members of the Committee.
<P>
I was saying that we expect Railtrack to play its part in creating a high quality, high growth and high investment railway. If Railtrack fails to meet the needs and expectations of the public and the industry, it will be for the regulator to take enforcement action to ensure that Railtrack complies with its licence requirements. The network must be maintained, renewed and enhanced to meet the reasonable requirements of the railway industry.
<P>
Basic investment needs are not the responsibility of the SRA. The clause deals with the conduit for Government support in necessary and justifiable circumstances. For example, moving freight from road to rail is an environmental goal. At present, freight grants help with the extra costs and the SRA will continue—and perhaps expand—these schemes. The Government already play their part in securing investment through the infrastructure investment fund and the rail passenger partnership fund, which will be administered by the SRA. The authority will be a catalyst for improvements that require public financial support, so the powers could be used for pump priming into a new service or for funding a new station that may not be commercially attractive for the industry but serves a social need.
<P>
In responding to the hon. Member for Poole's questions, I have tried to provide a broader explanation of the SRA's financial powers, in the light of which I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I give way to the hon. Member for Bath.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Before the Minister concludes, let me say that I fully appreciate the purpose of the clause and I am not sure why we should be persuaded to withdraw it. The Minister spoke about the conduit for Government funding. Will he clarify the distinction between capital and revenue funding, particularly in relation to the need for on-going revenue funding for schemes for which the Government may have provided capital support but which may not be financially viable in themselves—new stations or lines, for example?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The hon. Gentleman alludes to the category of enhancement schemes, which we have debated in Committee before. We believe that the SRA should be able to contract directly with Railtrack, perhaps in partnership with operators and other funders, where public money is needed to enhance the network. Whether that provides better value for money than the traditional approach of supporting access revenue charges paid by operators will emerge from the franchise renegotiations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The Minister may not have understood the full import of my question. Funding for the SRA will be based on Government grants, which will arise from the regular spending review mechanism. I welcome the fact that it will be on a three-year rather than a one-year basis. Contracts that must be entered into for the revenue support of a capital scheme may need to be guaranteed for much longer than three years. How will the SRA be able to make such guaranteed long-term commitments?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> It may not necessarily be the hon. Gentleman's fault, but as before I am not sure that I fully understand the drift of his question. Let me make two observations, however. First, the hon. Gentleman will know that the franchising process is built around long-term franchises of several years if the franchising director believes that such a deal is appropriate. Commitments entered into by the franchising director—soon the SRA—for 15 or 20 years will be honoured. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that the Government will support appropriate long-term contracts. The Government intend to honour arrangements made under contracts for both the franchised and non-franchised aspects of the railway system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I am spurred to my feet—a mixed metaphor—for two reasons. First, the subsection is central to our concerns—and those of Railtrack—about the operation of the SRA. Secondly, I was amused to hear the hon. Member for Bath say that he could not understand the purpose of our amendment or why ``we should be prepared'' to withdraw the clause. That provides an interesting insight into the thinking of the Liberal Democrats, who seem to believe that they are in the same position as the Government. We were not asking the Liberal Democrats to withdraw the clause; we were asking the Government to do so.
<P>
It is worth explaining why it is important to withdraw the subsection. It is remarkably widely drafted. We listened carefully to the Minister's argument that this provision is at the margin and is merely to facilitate the legitimate workings of the SRA. The words in the Bill would make it perfectly possible for the SRA to give grants, subsidies, funds, loans or anything else, under any terms whatsoever. These terms are to be decided and presumably 0 per cent. interest would be perfectly possible for anyone for any purpose whatsoever.
<P>
The Under-Secretary has gone to some lengths to reassure us that this is not the case, but it is perfectly possible to imagine a fundamental change in the financing of the railway industry, whereby the subsidy from the Government goes directly through the SRA to Railtrack and does not go through the TOCs. The SRA and the Government, therefore, have significantly more control over Railtrack than the TOCs.
<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I believe in the purchaser-provider split, which is effectively what operates in the railways—it operates splendidly in the health service too. In a curious aside from the Minister, we heard that Government subsidy might increase. If the Government considered that particular projects were important for ``social'' reasons, as the Minister described them, such as major new stations or lines, they would intervene directly through the SRA to provide such infrastructure projects. That seems fundamentally to undermine the financial arrangements that were set up under privatisation.
<P>
The Under-Secretary correctly said that we anticipated subsidy declining. Of course we did, that is a central part of privatisation: the whole reason for it was to reduce Government subsidy. Before privatisation Government subsidy was enormous. It has gone down ever since and was projected to fall further. We are proud of that, not ashamed. We want less and less public money to be spent on the provision of the railways and more and more to be levered in, both through the City and fares.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Ah ha!
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Of course, fares—people must pay for the things that they buy.
<P>
The Under-Secretary indicated, more in the subtext and his body language than the actual language, that there might be circumstances in which the operation of the railways and Railtrack in particular might not be what a subsequent SRA or Government would want, and that he could use the clause as a means to interfere in the legitimate operation of that privatised business, Railtrack. That was the reason for my concern. I was spurred to my feet by the hon. Member for Bath who said that he could not understand the reason for the amendment. That is the reason for it.
<P>
The clause is so widely drafted that it could be used for purposes other than those that the Under-Secretary described. I was reassured by some of his comments. He said that primary investment was not the responsibility of the SRA. He said that this was all about freight grants and that the present financial arrangements would continue. Indeed, I was reassured by much of what he had to say. However, I hope that he will understand that our concern is not necessarily about his comments this morning so much as the wording of the subsection. It could be used by a future Secretary of State—or SRA—with a different agenda to the one that he outlined, who might wish to interfere in that important financial relationship between the TOCs and Railtrack.
<P>
Could the Under-Secretary therefore consider tightening the wording of the clause to make it clear that these financial arrangements are at the margin of the railway system and are for particular small projects—to improve things that the TOCs and Railtrack are not doing themselves, possibly for social reasons? In that context, one thinks of the re-opening of Corsham station in my constituency. Grants and subsidies could be used for projects of that kind. If that is the case, the wording of the clause could be tightened so that it is plain to this generation, but more importantly to subsequent generations and to courts that may consider the clause, exactly what the purpose was.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire makes some important points and I wish to add to them. I did not intervene earlier because I wanted to hear what the Under-Secretary had to say. I was intrigued as to how he would deal with the arguments advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Poole (Mr. Syms) about the wide-ranging nature of the powers proposed in subsection (2). I noted his wonderful dismissal of any idea of re-nationalisation. That is helpful because I am not sure whether the words of the Committee are taken into account by the courts, but certainly words used by Ministers on the Floor of the House are now entitled to be considered by the courts when interpreting legislation. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will repeat what he has said on the Floor of the House to ensure that it is absolutely clear that it is not intended that the clause should be used by a future Government to nationalise the rail industry.
<P>
The Under-Secretary rightly said that there was a requirement to provide flexibility. No one in the Committee would consider it unreasonable of Ministers to propose that there should be some flexibility. After all, we cannot determine now, in advance, precisely what nature of funding the SRA will legitimately find itself called upon to provide and it would be wrong of the Committee to impose such funding conditions on its daily operations as to make its position unworkable.
<P>
Having said that, I nevertheless believe it to be the duty of Parliament and of the Committee to flag up concerns about what might happen and to be cognisant of the powers that we are giving both to Ministers and Government agencies such as the SRA. It is therefore right for us to raise such concerns, which Ministers may airily dismiss as being without foundation. I am sure that the Under-Secretary will agree that it is important in this industry to be assured of a degree of stability.
<P>
My hon. Friends have mentioned the share price of Railtrack. Again, the hon. Gentleman airily dismissed the Government's deliberations over the future structure of the industry as having nothing to do with that share price. He should be aware of the significant achievements of the railway industry since it was privatised. I have the ATOC bulletin for this month in front of me, which shows that rail passenger travel is now at a 50-year record high level. That is a great tribute not only to the industry, but to the new structure that it was given by the previous Conservative Government. The bulletin draws attention to the fact that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To accommodate the huge growth in traffic train operators are running 1,500 more trains every day and have over 2,000 new carriages on order, 360 of which were not included in franchise requirements.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that the Under-Secretary will be sufficiently generous of spirit, as we Committee members know him to be, to acknowledge that that is not a failure but a success story. Furthermore, Railtrack's investment—scheduled to be about £2.5 billion this year—is another example of the success of the privatised rail industry. Of course, our constituents are unhappy about delays and the quality of some of the rolling stock. However, improvements are taking place. Given that Railtrack has inherited an infrastructure that had been under-funded not merely in the past few years but the past 40 years, as was said this morning, it will take time to renew out-of-date equipment and to meet the increased demand.
<P>
I hope that the Under-Secretary will accept that our arguments and concerns on the clause are legitimate. The clause cannot be read in isolation. It provides wide-ranging powers for the authority to make payments or loans on such terms as and subject to any such conditions as the authority considers appropriate. However, clause 181(3) on page 100 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State may give the Authority directions and guidance in relation to its strategies, in particular in relation to—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>. . . (c) the strategy to be adopted in relation to any matter<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
One could argue that, taking these two paragraphs together, the Secretary of State is empowered to give directions to the authority on any matter and that if a future Secretary of State were minded to instruct the SRA that it was to buy railway companies or to undertake any intervention of that nature, funding could be provided under clause 186 (2). Bearing in mind that previous Governments have used legislation to provide a vehicle for, for example, nationalisation although that had not been thought of during its passage through the House, it is the duty of those of us who see possible hurdles ahead to draw them to the attention of the Committee.
<P>
Inevitably, we have to provide for some flexibility in the way in which the funding of the SRA is organised. The Under-Secretary has rightly pointed out where the application of powers under the clause would lead—to franchise payments, new trains, more trains, providing a conduit for Government support, pump priming for a new railway station—and none of us would disagree with that. However, a future Government could use the power for purposes for which the Committee, and therefore the House of Commons, had not given their authority.
<P>
Given the concerns that I have raised—not unreasonably, I hope—will the Under-Secretary assure the Committee that it is not the Government's intention that the clause should be invoked in the way that I have suggested? I accept that he cannot crystal ball gaze to determine what a future Government might do. However, I should like his comments on my proposition that clause 186 taken together with the powers conferred on the Secretary of State under clause 181 provide the instruments for a policy that my hon. Friend the Member for Poole suggested could be implemented.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I begin by apologising to you, Mr. Gale, and to the Committee as I have to leave briefly. Before I go I want to respond to the question put to me by the hon. Member for North Wiltshire, although he is not in his place. He was concerned that I was worried about the Conservative proposal in the amendment to withdraw subsection (2). If that were done, there would be no mechanism by which the funds could flow through from Government.
<P>
Nevertheless, the hon. Member for Aldershot (Mr. Gerald Howarth) and the hon. Member for North Wiltshire are absolutely right to require the Government to make a clear statement as to how they anticipate the power being used. If there are no constraints, there could be a string of funding streams that Parliament may have no opportunity to approve.
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I note that the Under-Secretary's constituency name has found a new form of presentation in the Official Report. We should congratulate the ingenuity of those who report our proceedings for the way in which they find a way round some of our bizarre discussions. The hon. Gentleman is someone for whom I have a great deal of affection. He has served the Committee extremely well on many occasions, but I fear that today he has, perhaps inadvertently, opened a can of worms, which he may well regret. By referring to Railtrack's network management statement and seeking to show its relevance to our current deliberations, he has opened the door for concerns to be expressed that relate directly to the amendment. It deals with the mechanism by which Government funding, and therefore subsidy to all aspects of our railway, will operate. The proposal is to delete that mechanism, but this subsection provides the means by which Government subsidy will be channelled.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman, by referring to the Railtrack statement today—and that made by his right hon. Friend in another place, copies of which we hope to receive before long—has raised the important question of how the Government will respond. I do not know, Mr. Gale, whether you had the opportunity to hear the debate on the ``Today'' programme this morning, as I did, in which reference was made to the Railtrack statement. Railtrack is now suggesting that it needs £52 billion over the next 10 or so years. Only 12 months ago, it was saying that it required £27 billion. That represents a huge increase and if the Government provide some of that it will flow through the route described in this part of the Bill. I hope that the Under-Secretary will find it appropriate, helpful and in order to make a statement about today's Railtrack announcement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth:</B> I too heard part of the ``Today'' programme this morning about Railtrack. How does the hon. Gentleman respond to the need to ensure that Railtrack's share price is maintained? Although there may be some Government subsidy, the reason for splitting off Railtrack was to ensure that it could raise the requisite funds in the market place. Experience had told us that Governments of either complexion were not prepared to invest in railway infrastructure and that the private sector would. If the share price is depressed, Railtrack will not be able to raise the money.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. He raises the very point on which I wish to end. Railtrack is now identifying the need for a significantly larger investment than it was discussing even 12 months ago. As the hon. Gentleman said, its share price is significantly depressed. It will find it difficult to raise that amount of money on the market. At the same time, under the Government's proposals the subsidy will decline. Railtrack will find it hard to raise money, but the amount that the Government are prepared to pay will go down and it says that it needs a significantly enhanced sum. When the Under-Secretary responds to the amendment, which would remove the funding mechanism, he will have to say why he wishes to retain it and how the Government intend to use it to meet what appears to be a rapidly growing shortfall.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Committee is aware that I have taken a reasonably relaxed view of wide-ranging debates on material that is available to Committee members because that facilitates debate. However, we are now skirting around discussing a document that is clearly relevant to the debate—that is why I have tolerated the discussion—but which has not been made available to hon. Members. Madam Speaker made it plain that although it is for the Government and Ministers to choose how and when they make statements, she expects that those statements will be made to the House or to the other place when the relevant Minister is there and that Members should have the opportunity to discuss them. I should be grateful if the Under-Secretary would convey that message to other Ministers in his Department who are responsible for the relevant statement. For the moment, I shall rule further discussion of the Railtrack statement out of order because it is not before us.

<P>

<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. Further to your announcement, which was well made and well taken, Ministers must have been aware that the Committee had reached a stage in the Bill that was particularly germane to the press release. May the Committee have the press release?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have ruled on the matter and made it abundantly plain that I do not expect the Committee further to discuss a statement that has not been made or a document that has not been made available. I set my own precedent in that respect in an adjacent Committee Room, when another document was published which was relevant to the debate. Hon. Members should remember that I also ruled discussion of that document out of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I should offer you an apology, Mr. Gale, as I raised the Railtrack network management statement. I am sorry if you feel strongly that it has led to confusion. The statement is not a Government document; it is the property of Railtrack and not something of which a Minister or the Government can take ownership.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. First, I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who has no need to apologise to the Chairman. My experience is that he and his fellow Ministers are always most courteous in making papers available. However, it may help the Committee if I place on the record the relevant quotation from ``Erskine May'' on the citing of documents not before the House, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A Minister of the Crown may not read or quote from a despatch or other State paper not before the House, unless he is prepared to lay it upon the Table.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The paper in question is regarded as a dispatch for these purposes, which is why I ruled it out of order. If the Minister will return strictly to the amendment under discussion, we can proceed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Thank you for that explanation of your ruling, Mr. Gale.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> No, I will not give way, because I rise to respond to questions asked in the debate. If those responses are inadequate, I shall of course give way to the hon. Gentleman, but he should at least allow me to respond before leaping down my throat, as it were.
<P>
First, I shall comment on the observations made by the hon. Member for North Wiltshire, who has left the Committee for understandable reasons. He will read my response in Hansard. The Government intend no fundamental change in the system of financing the railway. Earlier, I accused the hon. Gentleman of over-egging the pudding—he is over-interpreting the purpose of the clause. The Bill will create more flexibility and the SRA will have wider powers to engage in new forms of financing within strict parameters on which I shall expand later. We will not forget the hon. Gentleman's observations about rail fares, which are largely capped at present. The Opposition are obviously making a plea for a free-for-all, so that the public can pay for future investment in the railway system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I hope that the Minister will not forget the comments of the hon. Member for North Wiltshire on the need to reopen Corsham railway station.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I have received numerous representations on the matter from the Floor of the Committee and a goodly number in private, too. There have been times when my positive intentions towards the hon. Member for North Wiltshire on the subject have been strained. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Bath for reminding us about Corsham station. I assure the hon. Member for North Wiltshire in his absence that I have not forgotten his remarks.
<P>
We are always delighted to see the hon. Member for Aldershot in Committee. He raised the canard of renationalisation, which would not be unpopular with the public. If the Government had wanted to do that, we would have introduced a different Bill. As I hope to show in later debates, the Bill precludes any possibility of re-nationalisation.
<P>
In response to the hon. Gentleman's comments on the performance of the privatised railway industry, it is probably true that the public have not caught up with the industry's recent progress. I acknowledge the innovations of the privatised railway and its focus on the customer, which were missing in British Rail, although none of us should be blind to the fact that significant problems remain, notably those of regular overcrowding, punctuality and reliability.
<P>
Hon. Members sought reassurance on stability for the industry. The specific requirement for the SRA to have concern for stability appears on the face of the Bill. It is an innovation in the Government's purposes for the new rail authority. Clause 182(2)(f) states that it should be a function of the SRA
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to enable persons providing railway services to plan the future of their businesses with a reasonable degree of assurance.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
That is the guarantee of stability.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also expressed concern that there might be excessive intervention on the part of the Secretary of State in the affairs of the SRA. He asked why the Secretary of State should be able to give directions and guidance. The power of the Secretary of State to give such directions and guidance to the authority was foreshadowed in his power to set up objectives, instructions and guidance to the current franchising director in section 7 of our old friend, the Railways Act 1993. Clause 186 also has precedents in section 7 of the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998. The strategies will be at a high level and ensure that Government policy and priorities are reflected in the strategies of the authority. It is for the authority to get on with the job of developing strategies.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman cherishes the role of Parliament and the legislature in relation to the Executive. However, Ministers are, quite rightly, responsible to Parliament for the activities of the authority and for its expenditure. It is reasonable, therefore, for Ministers to be able to give guidance and directions to the authority on what it should do and how it should behave so that public concerns can be picked up and reflected in its work.
<P>
If only on the basis of precedents, I hope that that offers the hon. Gentleman the assurances that he was seeking. In more general terms, in response to an earlier intervention by the hon. Member for Poole—the official spokesman for the Opposition—about the general powers of clause 186, it is true that the power set out is self-evidently flexible and wide. The intention is not to let a situation go by where financial assistance could be appropriate for want simply of a power on the part of the authority. The power would be available for traditional purposes such as the payment of grants to franchisees under a franchise agreement, to freight operators, and to passenger transport authorities to support rail services. The wider powers would also enable the authority to act in connection with innovative financing projects where the involvement of the authority in giving, for example, a low-risk guarantee could help to lever in private capital.
<P>
Let me reassure the hon. Gentleman and the Committee that the finance will be available for railway purposes only, as set out in clause 186(1)(a), where we say that the authority may enter into agreements or other arrangements
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>for the purposes of securing the provision, improvement or development by others of any railway services or railway assets,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The intention is that the SRA should be focused on the railway, but also have powers to engage in new and innovative ways to finance railway projects. That is not an oxymoron, but a repetition of a similar adjective—the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Mr. Moore) obviously knows the correct technical expression.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for responding to the points that I made. I shall explain why I raised those issues. In 1974, the then Conservative Government enacted legislation on industrial reorganisation that contained wide-ranging powers for Government intervention. The subsequent Labour Government used those powers for purposes that are wholly anathema to new Labour, or so we are told. I did not fabricate that concern out of the ether; it arose from the specific experience of a few years ago. The Under-Secretary has firmly put on the record how he envisages the powers being used.
<P>
On the point about stability, the Under-Secretary referred me to clause 182(2)(f). I am sure that the industry will welcome the assurance it provides. I wanted to make the point that, unless a firm statement on the new structure of the railway industry was put on the record now, the industry would be uncertain about how to proceed and share prices might be depressed as a result.
<P>
The Under-Secretary has reassured me—and, I hope, the industry—that the Government do not intend to use the clause to intervene dramatically in the industry. For example, they do not intend to use the power to introduce nationalisation. Therefore, those outside should be encouraged. It is worth while for the Government to put on record that the powers are intended to provide flexibility, not as a clandestine means for them to intervene dramatically in the industry in future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> We have had a wide-ranging debate, partly because the clause is wide ranging. We have a better understanding of the Government's intentions. Given that we shall debate Government amendments on the precise drafting of the clause in a moment, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 984, in page 102, line 3, leave out third `or' and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(b)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 985 to 987.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> As we have heard at length, the SRA will have the power to give financial assistance for railways and related purposes under clause 186. The intention is that that power should be flexible and wide. The intention is not to let difficulties occur simply for want of the SRA's having the power to give financial assistance, so we have extended the SRA's powers beyond traditional methods of finance, such as grant assistance. We have given the SRA the power to use innovative financing projects, if its involvement in providing, for example, a low-risk guarantee could help to lever-in private capital.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 985 to 987 are designed to ensure that the SRA's powers in respect of financial assistance extend to acquiring interests in bodies corporate. We consider that the powers in clause 186 as drafted would have enabled that, but we want to put it beyond doubt. The provision is intended to give the authority the option, for example, to pump prime a new company by investing in the company's equity on terms that might be more favourable than the commercial market would demand. That could, in turn, help to lever-in private capital investment and loan finance to secure the high level of investment that the railway industry demands.
<P>
We also need to be certain that the new, innovative models of finance that the authority should be able to deploy are exercisable in the context of franchising and the current franchise replacement programme. Although, under clause 186(3), financial assistance for franchising is to be secured through the franchise agreement, the financing options open to the SRA should be no less extensive than they would otherwise be. Amendments Nos. 986 and 987 make it clear that the Authority's powers to make loans, give guarantees and invest are carried through to franchising.
<P>
In case the question arises in the minds of hon. Gentlemen, I reiterate that any attempt to use the clause 186 power in a programme of renationalisation would be unlawful. Clause 186 relates to financial assistance and nothing more.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> The socialism about which we are concerned is the sort that creeps. The amendment is interesting, because it allows the Government to invest in bodies corporate. When I first saw it, I thought that, when the transfer scheme under schedule 14 came in, it might make sense for the SRA to use its powers to fund the odd company operating within the current arrangements to provide a service. The Under-Secretary said that the objective might be some pump priming or using money from shares in a business for a specific purpose.
<P>
The SRA can fund passenger transport authorities, train operating companies and other innovative schemes by a loan, a guarantee or a grant. It could invest in a business, lend it money and give guarantees in competition—I put it no higher than that—with someone else who was trying to invest in the business. That is not a level playing field. As the Bill is drafted, the SRA is not merely supporting the business, but investing in it. I should like to hear more from the Under-Secretary about the bodies corporate concept. Would he give us four or five examples—or six, if he has them—of how it might operate? Does he envisage the Government wholly owning a business, not for overt socialist reasons, but for a social reason?
<P>
<B>Mr. Owen Paterson </B>(North Shropshire): I should like to chip in. The success that has brought new investment and new life to the railways has come about because we set up the train operating companies. They are the key element in making rail privatisation work. It is not good enough for the Minister to tell us in his jolliest mode that we should trust him when he says that the provision is not about nationalisation, because he is a nice, straightforward sort of guy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woolas:</B> He is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I am sure that he is a nice guy. The Committee has established that, but it is not good enough for him to say that nationalisation will not be the result of a blanket clause that allows taxpayers' money to be invested in bodies corporate. I cannot think of a balder statement of my concept of nationalisation, although it may not be the Under-Secretary's concept. He said in an earlier debate that the measure is not about nationalisation, but that is what was driving the Labour party in the build up to the election. The Secretary of State for International Development once did her best to persuade the public that the Labour party would renationalise the railways. That is what is going on. Taxpayers' money is being spent on bodies corporate, which is a gross interference in the inchoate market that is developing around train operating companies. I entirely endorse the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Poole. I should like some concrete examples of operating companies and train operations that will be affected by this.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I suspect that the issue of creeping renationalisation will continue to creep through our exchanges. I was surprised by the intervention by the hon. Member for Poole: talking about creeping socialism betrayed his suspicion of any kind of change. What we have on the Conservative Front Bench—I draw this gently to the attention of the hon. Gentleman's colleagues on the Back Benches, as I have a shrewd idea of where they are coming from—is a Peelite conservatism that is very different from the radical, thrusting conservatism that we observed during the 1980s. The hon. Gentleman should not be so suspicious of change.
<P>
Opposition Members have asked a number of questions. I was asked what use might be made of these powers. It is difficult to tell—[Interruption.] We are allowing the hon. Member for Salop, North—
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. My constituency is North Shropshire.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am sorry. I fall consistently into the trap of misnaming the hon. Gentleman's constituency—it must have been his chuckling that threw me. Of course it is right to allow for a degree of innovation and new thinking in the railway system. I thought that that was precisely what he proclaimed only a few moments ago was the achievement of the privatised railway. It is difficult to tell what precise use will be made of the powers, because they are not expected to be the normal business of the SRA. We still expect that the main source of funding for the railways industry will be traditional grant financing, but things are changing. The Conservative Government started the change. We are no longer interested in traditional command and control methods of securing railway services. I cannot predict what opportunities for innovative finance might emerge from the current franchising replacement programme.
<P>
I was asked, perfectly reasonably, whether we anticipate that the SRA will become the sole owner of a new railway concern, for example. I am happy to give assurances, both to the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) and the hon. Member for Poole, who raised the question in the first place, that investment could relate only to a minority shareholding. Indeed, I can go further and give assurances that the SRA holding would not be expected to reach anywhere near the 49 per cent. figure, which would be a definition of a minority shareholding.
<P>
I regret that I cannot give the hon. Member for Poole four or five examples of where investment might be made. However, there is no question of skewing the playing field between companies. The provision is about the SRA engaging in a positive act of support for a railway project that, without that kind of investment on a modest scale, might not take off. It is difficult to conceive of the circumstances in which investment in a railway project could have any serious effect at all in competition terms. A consequence of the privatisation of the railways in the early l990s was not only a more regulated railway, but a far from competitive railway. The way in which the hon. Gentleman has posed the question about the competitive consequences of such investment does not take account of current realities on the tracks of the railway system.
<P>
On the issue of renationalisation, hon. Member for North Shropshire asked whether the power to acquire shares in a body corporate could lead to back-door renationalisation. The Opposition's inventiveness continues to amaze me. There is no grand conspiracy—no conspiracy whatever. The paranoia being shown by the Opposition, turning a power to enter into agreements to secure the provision of railway services by others—by others—into a power to renationalise or otherwise regain corporate control over the railways, is a breathtaking jump of imagination. There is no secret agenda; we are not dealing with creeping socialism—some in the leadership of our party would certainly not endorse that prospect.
<P>
Finally, I say to my right hon. and hon. Friends that the purpose of the clause is to enable the SRA to supplement the private sector, not to replace it. I hope that gives the Committee the assurances it needs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> That is a wholly inadequate answer. The Under-Secretary did not deal with any of the questions that I posed. He even managed to get my constituency wrong. He is in danger of getting himself into a titanic battle in Shropshire: about 10 years ago, there was a major dispute as to whether it should be called Salop or Shropshire. The Shropshirites won and I would strongly recommend that he does not re-open those arguments if he does not want to be deluged with letters of well-meant advice.
<P>
It is stated that state funds can be invested in bodies corporate. All the Under-Secretary could come up with were the arguments advanced by the central planner down the ages. The Russians tried central planning—they really gave it a whirl—yet they have a 75-year track record of total failure. I think the provision will result in interfering by busybodies, but the Under-Secretary thinks they will be well-meaning, well-intentioned central planning bureaucrats. They have a track history of always getting it wrong. Privately owned train-operating companies are just beginning to invest in areas outside their franchises, as my hon. Friend the Member for Aldershot says. They are investing extra funds in areas where the market needs it and there is the demand. My hon. Friend's figure for investment was over and above investment in franchises.
<P>
There will be gross interference in a mechanism that, as the Under-Secretary rightly says, is only just evolving. We are only just beginning to see the advantages. My hon. Friend the Member for Poole and I asked for examples, but the Under-Secretary has not come up with anything concrete.
<P>
In our previous sitting, the Under-Secretary spoke about possible infrastructure investment in Birmingham New Street station, which is a chronic bottleneck. He said that a minority stake may be involved, but that is not in the Bill, the explanatory notes, the Library brief or anything else. To what does that stake relate? Another example, which concerns my locality, is the debate about whether to increase services from Shrewsbury to Chester. At the moment, trains run every two hours; money is required to pump prime an hourly service, thus expanding the market. How will the clause work in relation to those two practical examples?
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend, who makes an excellent point.
<P>
Light is beginning to be shed on the matter, but we need a few more assurances. The Under-Secretary mentioned that a figure of 49 per cent. would prevent the SRA from holding a majority in any particular company. Does he envisage the provision operating in exceptional circumstances? For example, could investing in a body corporate relate to microfranchising a certain line to enable or facilitate a service requiring company investment? If so, is the investment required simply to get the service up and running, rather than to be held in the company for ever more? Could the SRA withdraw its investment once the service was operational?
<P>
Alternatively, suppose a company running a service in Scotland were in financial difficulty, putting the service under threat. Scottish Ministers feel that there are social arguments for the service continuing to run to certain isolated communities. The SRA might take stock in a failing company to secure that objective. We have no problems with short-term pump priming to keep a line open or to set up a new service. However, we would be anxious if the SRA built up a portfolio of activity and company investments, and used its guarantees and loans to become a player, rather than the facilitator that it is supposed to be. Will the Under-Secretary provide reassurance on that?
<P>
 The Government amendments may be sensible, but a more precise definition of the SRA's scope of operations is needed to quell the anxiety of my colleagues and people throughout the country. We shall be happy if the Under-Secretary tells us that the SRA is an enabler and facilitator, but we will have problems if he tells us that it could be a long-term investor.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Let me offer further reassurances to Opposition Members whose anxieties, as far as I can see, are not shared by the larger railways community. We are engaged in a railways refranchising process, in which many companies are eagerly participating. There is great enthusiasm for the Government's proposals on the future of railways.
<P>
I can reassure the hon. Member for Poole that the SRA's role in connection with such matters is expected to be that of a facilitator. It will use its spending powers for the purposes of facilitation. The hon. Gentleman asked whether the powers could be used in exceptional circumstances. The measure is designed to provide for the changing pattern of investment in the railway industry. The difficulty of predicting exceptional circumstances makes it hard to give examples of the sort of investment that may be made. The hon. Gentleman asked whether projects for microfranchises would be possible recipients of such SRA investment. The answer is yes, they are.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for North Shropshire asked whether Birmingham New Street would be an appropriate recipient of such investment. The provision is for investment in bodies corporate, so we must consider whether that type of infrastructure project is a separate corporate project. In such circumstances, it is not inconceivable that investment would be forthcoming. On the whole, we would be looking for specific, smaller scale projects, but the matter is one for the SRA and, critically, the industry to decide. The SRA has a responsive power and it is for the train operating companies to offer new ideas, schemes and proposals. The SRA will consider seriously those who are at the margin and require pump priming.
<P>
The railway industry is going through a period of great flux. I am delighted that many excellent, innovative schemes are already emerging from the refranchising programme, and the shadow SRA also encourages new thinking and innovation. As my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan (Mr. Smith) knows, it has asked for a response on the possibility of Welsh railway franchise. We have also floated the possibility of bids on a trans-Pennine route. There are new ideas and new circumstances, so one cannot anticipate in detail what the projects will be. That is part of the excitement of the third stage of the railway renaissance for which the Labour Government will be responsible.
<P>
Finally, I can assure the hon. Member for Poole that the SRA would not expect to have anything approaching a 49 per cent. minority shareholding. That is not the intention. I trust that my full explanation reassures the hon. Gentlemen and that they will support the Government amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am sorry to say that the Under-Secretary has not reassured me. How will amendment No. 985 operate? It states that the authority will be empowered
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to invest in bodies corporate.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It does not state that the authority will be empowered to take a minority investment in bodies corporate. The Under-Secretary dismissed our concern that the additional power could be a vehicle for more substantial intervention in the industry. He simply brushed our concerns aside, saying, ``Only a minority stake is involved. We do not envisage an investment of even 49 per cent.'' There is no evidence in the Bill that that is what the Government propose. Anyone who reads the Bill—or subsequently the Act—will say, ``There is no provision for 49 per cent.'' The SRA is being given a blanket power to invest in bodies corporate.
<P>
I enjoy the Under-Secretary's contributions as much as he seems to enjoy mine, although I do not suppose that he is enjoying this one. He is a reasonable man, and I hope that he understands that his proposal does not, in plain English, prevent the SRA from taking a majority interest in a body corporate. We will require more specific assurances that the Under-Secretary's emphatic undertaking to the Committee will be carried through in the Bill; otherwise, I do not see how he can deliver on it. He might later be traduced by people in the SRA saying, ``Well, that's what the Under-Secretary said at the time, but the Act says that we have the power to invest in bodies corporate, and it does not limit us to a minority stake.''
<P>
In passing, I acknowledge the Under-Secretary's reference to the industry's enthusiasm for the new round of franchising; I welcome his recognition that the industry is enthusiastic and innovative, as those in the previous Parliament said that it would be. I sat that Parliament out—I was merely resting between engagements. I was following the activities of my right hon. and hon. Friends, and I know that they regarded innovation as a key element in the new and exciting world of the privatised rail industry. The Under-Secretary has confirmed that view this morning, and I hope that it will reach a wider audience. Such is the enthusiasm of the industry that it has invested in 360 more railway vehicles than it is required to under the conditions of the franchise.
<P>
I am sorry to challenge the hon. gentleman, but I do not think that he will regard the challenge as unreasonable. If he can assure us that investment in bodies corporate is limited to a minority interest, I will be impressed by his intellectual dexterity in making the amendments seem to mean something that they do not.
<P>
Finally, on a small technical point, amendment No. 984 leaves out the word ``or'' and inserts ``(b)'', and amendment No. 985 inserts ``(c)''. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman could tell us where ``(a)'' goes, because it does not appear on the amendment paper.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Smith </B>(Vale of Glamorgan) rose—
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I call the Under-Secretary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am sorry—I had not noticed my hon. Friend. I will give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> I must be standing too far away to be noticed, Mr. Gale.
<P>
The key point is that we want maximum flexibility. If we want innovation, novel ideas and solutions to tackle the difficult problem of providing a comprehensive, flexible and reliable railway service, it would be a mistake to place restrictions on the Government. We cannot foresee what lies ahead.
<P>
I can understand the Opposition's paranoia about nationalisation. In fact, a previous Conservative Government introduced the fastest nationalisation—overnight, or at least within 24 hours—that this country ever saw. I am talking about the nationalisation of Rolls-Royce—a great Conservative achievement, about which we hear very little nowadays. Legislation was not needed; the inventive Prime Minister of the time nationalised Rolls-Royce without it.
<P>
I want the railway service that this country deserves, which it has not had for a long time. The only way to achieve that is to provide maximum flexibility—to introduce new partnerships, new ideas, shared equity, partial equity and so forth to safeguard taxpayers' money. Opposition Members justify spending taxpayers' money to substitute for revenue and contribute to the profits of newly franchised companies, yet they oppose even partial investment in projects.
<P>
I am delighted that, for the first time in almost 30 years, we have the real prospect of reopening one of the most beautiful stretches of railway in this country—the rural Vale of Glamorgan line—for passenger transport. It stretches west of Barry, through Rhoose—close to Cardiff's international airport; the railway will provide a public transport facility to it—and the beautiful villages of East Aberthaw, Llantwit Major and Llandow to Pen y Bont, otherwise known as Bridgend. I shall have a word with Hansard transcribers later.
<P>
The Vale of Glamorgan railway line is stunning. For the past 30 years it has been used only for freight, yet there is huge commuter demand to use it, and we want it reopened. Happily, the last Railtrack network management report identified the case for doing so. Several companies are interested and we are almost certain that it will reopen within the next two years. The last thing that we want at this crucial moment is the introduction of unnecessary restrictions because of the Opposition's paranoia. As I said, I am aware of their previous experience of 24-hour nationalisation, but please let us not throw the baby out with the bathwater. Let us keep our options open and look forward to the Vale of Glamorgan railway line opening again for passengers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Let me repeat that I greatly appreciate the supportive remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan, who represents the third most beautiful constituency represented in Committee. It goes without saying that ``St. Reatham'' is number one, but I have paid ample tribute in the past to TEL—Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale. My hon. Friend paints an exciting picture of the reopening of the railway line going through the beautiful villages of Llandow and Llantwit Major that are so close to his heart. He, too, is close to the hearts of the voters of Llandour and Llantwit Major.
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> I was about to tell my hon. Friend that the line will serve the villages of Llanfihangel and Trehyngyll, but I thought I that would spare him that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I shall not be tempted down that line. I have been out-Welshed by my hon. Friend—quite rightly. We look forward to the results of the feasibility study into the Vale of Glamorgan line and to hearing about any approach that is made to the SRA by a PPP. My hon. Friend will understand that I say that without commitment.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I turn to the remarks of the hon. Member for Aldershot. He need not apologise for returning to certain matters. I take no offence in the world, Hal, no offence—For Hansard, that paraphrases Henry IV, part II. Little ``a'', comes after ``Authority'' and before ``to give guarantees''. It will come out in the printing. I hope that that satisfies the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Is the Under-Secretary tabling amendments on the hoof? I do not see a reference to little ``a'' anywhere in the list of amendments. Is he tabling a new amendment? May I table a new amendment in the expectation that he will be prepared, for the first time, to accept an Opposition amendment?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The hon. Gentleman does not seem to know whether he is tabling amendments. I am certainly doing so and endeavouring to have them agreed to by the Committee. It was my impression that the hon. Gentleman asked about the location of little ``a''. As ever, I have sought to reply in detail. If it was unsatisfactory to him, I undertake to look at it again. If I deem it necessary, I shall write to members of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before we go further down this road, I understand that it is standard drafting procedure. The hon. Gentleman should not be further concerned about the issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale.
<P>
I turn to the SRA's minority shareholding. I made the point that the clause refers—as I did—to provision ``by others''. In other words, the object of the SRA's possible investment is provision not by the SRA, but by other bodies. The SRA will be responding to proposals from the rail industry, which will be unlikely to want to lose ownership of its projects. The SRA will not run projects, but will support them. I ask the hon. Member for Aldershot to read my lips: clause 186(1)(a) has the magic words ``provision . . . by others''. That phrase is the reassurance that he is seeking against it being a vehicle for excessive shareholding by the SRA or for back-door nationalisation. It is nothing of the kind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I am sorry to return to a point that have been covered, Mr. Gale, but we have still not had any explanation of how the provision will work in practice. Each time that the Under-Secretary rises to his feet, we learn a little more. The first time we had arm-waving and were told to go away, put a cold towel over our heads and calm down, the provision had nothing to do with nationalisation. The second time, it was revealed that it was to do with shareholding, even though that is not in any document that I have seen. The third time, we were told that the provision would be used only in exceptional circumstances. The next time, we were told that its use would be inspired by the train operating companies themselves, which was a whole new development. Then came a categorical statement that any shareholding would be a minority shareholding, not more than 49 per cent.
<P>
Those are all very interesting elaborations which illuminate the amendment somewhat. In blunt terms—going back to the very first statement—the provision allows taxpayers' money to be invested in bodies corporate. We had some explanation relating to Birmingham New Street. However, I also alluded to the Shrewsbury-Chester line, where there is currently an inadequate two-hour service. It is similar to the example cited by the hon. Member for Vale of Glamorgan. There is a case for upgrading that service to an hourly service, and money will be needed from somewhere. I wonder whether that is the kind of example that the Minister had in mind. Will the money go into the train operating company? ``Others'' could include another shadow company, as I understand.
<P>
Taxpayers' money is going to be spent and committed in a blanket manner, and we need to know how the arrangement will work in practice. That is all I am asking. Will the Minister have another go? We learn a little more each time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I feel that I have given a more than adequate explanation of the purposes of the amendments and I reiterate my request that the Committee should accept them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> These are probing amendments, and the Under-Secretary need not get too excited by the vast number because they all relate to the first one. The purpose is to give the Committee an opportunity to explore in some detail schedule 14, which—to me, at least—is a mysterious schedule to the Bill.
<P>
According to the explanatory memorandum, schedule 14
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>provides a transfer scheme for the administration of grants for freight from the Secretary of State to the Authority.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, when looked at in more detail, it is hugely wider than that. I appreciate that the old Railways Act gave the Secretary of State powers to give grants and subsidise track access charges, and the Government now need to give the SRA those powers; therefore, the SRA has to be inserted between the Minister and the railway companies and the general public. However, schedule 14 gives incredibly wide-ranging powers to the Secretary of State to devolve his responsibility while at the same time retaining considerable powers to give directions, grants and loans to the SRA, but no responsibilities—he will be able to transfer virtually all of them to the SRA. That raises several technical questions that I hope the hon. Gentleman will be able to answer.
<P>
The schedule is opaque and the language is intriguing. If my hon. Friends have not already done so, paragraph 3 of schedule 14 is worth a read. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A transfer scheme may define the property, rights and liabilities to be transferred to the Authority by specifying them or describing them or by referring to all (or all except anything specified or described) of the property, rights and liabilities comprised in a specified part of the undertaking of the Secretary of State (or partly in one way and partly in the other).<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The parliamentary draftsman who created that paragraph deserves a medal; I have absolutely no idea what it means and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will explain it. [Interruption.]—in some detail.
<P>
The schedule states that the Secretary of State may transfer responsibility for legal proceedings—including present cases, according to paragraph 8. For example, responsibility for legal proceedings involving the Secretary of State and someone who believed that his property rights had been infringed could be transferred to the SRA. Thus, the Secretary of State's liabilities could then be transferred to the SRA. That has considerable significance.
<P>
There is a further confusion over Scotland and Wales. Clause 216 refers to Scottish Ministers and to the National Assembly for Wales. Scottish Ministers will have considerable powers to direct the SRA in Scotland and that is curious. Scottish and Welsh Ministers will have more powers than the Secretary of State in England, who wants to transfer his powers to the SRA. It appears that more powers will be available to Scottish and Welsh Ministers than to the Secretary of State, which will create difficulty in relations between the SRA, the Secretary of State and those Ministers. I should be grateful if the Minister would clarify the position.
<P>
The purpose of the amendments is to discover why the schedule gives such wide-ranging powers. For example, the Secretary of State can devolve responsibility to the SRA, then change his mind and modify the scheme because schedule 14 refers to the modification of transfer schemes. Orders can be made and unmade at the Secretary of State's whim. That will create a strange legal relationship between the Secretary of State and railway companies.
<P>
The schedule is important. My hon. Friends and I wish to know why it is necessary to introduce such complicated and wide-ranging powers to do something that, according to the notes on clauses, is relatively simple.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I entirely agree with the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) that paragraph 3 is worth a read. He talked about the liabilities of the Secretary of State being transferred to the SRA and asked for examples. One example would be liabilities for freight grants. I hope to return to some of the other questions raised by the hon. Gentleman, as far as I noted them, in due course. I understand that these are probing amendments and that is perfectly reasonable. The hon. Gentleman will understand that our procedures require that I respond to amendments on the amendment paper that will appear in Hansard.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The effect of the amendments would be to place restrictions on the exercise of powers to transfer the property, rights and liabilities of the Secretary of State, the British Railways Board and the SRA. The restrictions include making it a requirement to exercise these powers, dictating the form that a transfer scheme should take, restricting the power to make any supplementary provision and requiring the consent of the transferee. These powers are a perfectly normal set of transfer scheme provisions of the type adopted by the Conservatives in so much of their legislation when they were in Government. I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that there is nothing sinister here. All that the amendments would achieve would be to make the transfers consequent on the Bill more difficult by restricting flexibility in what is to be transferred and making the whole process more bureaucratic.
<P>
The powers in schedule 14 will be used to ensure that the administration of the existing freight grant regime and property, rights and liability in respect of freight grants will be transferred to the SRA. When it is established, a direction will be given to the authority to continue the freight grant regime without hiatus while a more responsive and flexible freight grant regime is established. The current freight grants will be continued without hiatus unless and until they are replaced by other schemes for grants for freight specified by the authority.
<P>
Nothing is gained by converting this transfer scheme provision or any of the other transfer schemes into a duty on the part of the Secretary of State rather than a power. That applies especially to the various British Railways schemes where there is the option at least of transferring some property to the Secretary of State under schedule 20 and/or leaving some property behind to serve the liabilities of the British Railways Board—for example, the channel tunnel usage contract—until it can be transferred by agreement. The same can be said of amendments Nos. 931 and 942.
<P>
As I said, schedule 14 includes conventional provisions for transfer schemes. The powers will be used to ensure a seamless transfer to the SRA of the freight grant function. The Secretary of State will consult the SRA before making such a transfer scheme to ensure the exact form that it takes, but we are setting out the intention for the transfer of freight grants liabilities in the Bill and the Secretary of State will not need its consent to the transfer. The same goes for the other consent requirements sought by the hon. Gentleman, including amendments Nos. 899, 901, 936 and 944.
<P>
The Secretary of State could not direct the sort of modifications anticipated in paragraph 12 of schedule 14 if they forced the authority to act in any way contrary to its statutory framework under clauses 181, 182, 192 and 193. Amendment No. 900 is unnecessary, therefore, as are amendments Nos. 937 and 941, which are similar or the same—it says here.
<P>
The amendments to schedule 18 affect the transfer of residual property rights and liabilities of the British Railways Board to the SRA. The Committee may find it useful if I start by explaining our policy towards this transfer and the British Railways Board before I deal with the amendments. We will come to this subject in more detail in our discussion of the substantive clauses.
<P>
We intend to wind up the British Railways Board as soon as possible after the creation of the SRA. However, some significant residual property rights and liabilities remain and, as they relate to railways, it is appropriate that they be transferred to the SRA. Amendment No. 930 would restrict the transfer of the BRB to those property rights or liabilities that are necessary or appropriate for the authority's proper exercise of its powers and performance of its functions in accordance with its strategies. This would not fulfil the purpose of the transfer, which is to facilitate the wind-up of the BRB.
<P>
As one of the SRA's purposes will be to act as the residual body for the BRB, the transfer of BR land and so forth is consistent with its obligations and functions. There is, of course, a separate structure under clause 193 for British Rail's non railways land. Amendments Nos. 932 and 933 are also unnecessary, so they fall with amendment No. 930.
<P>
Schedule 18(6) is the exact equivalent of section 92 of the Railways Act 1993, which, in turn, is a standard transfer scheme power. The type of statutory functions being transferred here relate to tangible property rather than to the wider concept of property rights and liabilities. Typically, but not exclusively, we are referring to statutory undertaker privileges that still attach to BR in respect of any of its land that is being transferred. I am satisfied that paragraph (6) is properly drafted and that amendment No. 934 is unnecessary. Amendment No. 935 deals with the Secretary of State underwriting liabilities. The Government will, of course, ensure that adequate funds are made available to the SRA to meet any financial obligations that may arise from the board's liabilities.
<P>
In response to the question from the hon. Member for Hexham, the Bill sets out clearly the respective powers of the Secretary of State and the devolved authorities: the devolved bodies would not usually be involved in transfers into or out of the SRA. I repeat that we do not consider that it is helpful to require the SRA to consent to modifications to a transfer scheme. It is intended that these transfers be made by the Secretary of State. I assure the hon. Gentleman once more that cherry-picking is not an option. I trust that I have offered the hon. Gentleman adequate explanation and reassurance. I hope that he will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation of schedule 14. We thought that it was a much wider schedule than perhaps the notes suggested, not least because we suspected that it provided the Secretary of State with the ability to wrap up and dispose of the British Railways Board.
<P>
I remain somewhat puzzled about the transfer schemes. I have looked in the Railways Act for something similar, but have not succeeded in finding anything yet. I am perplexed as to why the schedule is so wide and unspecific in its detail. It could simply be to do with track access charges and grants and payments towards facilities. However, the schedule could have been written more tightly and compactly. Nevertheless, I am grateful for the Under-Secretary's explanation, which is now on the record. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 822, in page 193, line 8, leave out `instruments, contracts' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`documents'.<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 823 to 826 and 831 to 835.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> This long list of amendments comprises technical and housekeeping amendments to ensure that all references to the franchising director, the British Railways Board, the Central Rail Users Consultative Committee and the rail users consultative committees in statutory instruments, deeds, contracts, notices, administrative rules and so forth are converted to references to the SRA—in the case of the franchising director and the BRB—and to the rail passengers council and committees. Our main concern was that the formula in clause 196, which converts references to the franchising director in instruments, contracts and legal proceedings, was too narrow, so we have widened it to cover all statutory instruments and other documents.
<P>
The other amendments adopt similar provisions, as appropriate.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
