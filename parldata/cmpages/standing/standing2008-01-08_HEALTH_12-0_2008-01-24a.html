							<b class="B">Mr.
Stephen O'Brien</b> (Eddisbury) (Con): We were galloping
through clause 121 stand part, but over lunch we have had the
opportunity to reflect a bit more. I shall not rehearse what I briefly
alluded to before the break, although I recognise that over lunch we
had the slight distraction of the demise of the Secretary of State for
Work and Pensions. I draw the Committee&#146;s attention to
&#147;Healthy Weight, Healthy Lives A Cross Government Strategy for
England&#148;, which was the obesity strategy launched only
yesterday&#151;I appreciate that is not as fresh as today&#146;s
lunch time news. If the Government seriously consider the health in
pregnancy grant a proper nutrition and health-based initiative, surely
it should be included in that document? It is not. Although on page 3
the document
claims:</div>
					<a name="08012516000463"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
baby&#146;s growth rate is in part determined by parental factors,
with the period immediately after birth of particular
importance&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08012516000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s obesity strategy makes no mention of that
grant.</div>
					<a name="08012516000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, both the Prime Minister on 6 December 2006 and the Health
Secretary on 12 September 2007 claimed that the grant is for maternal
nutrition in the last weeks of pregnancy, alongside the unsubstantiated
claim that in that period nutrition is most important. By the time the
Minister of State, Department of Health, the hon. Member for Exeter
(Mr. Bradshaw) gave his oral evidence, that claim had become
diluted to the grant supporting other things,
namely:</div>
					<a name="08012516000464"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;specific health

					<a name="08012516000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">A claim that is
questionable given the oral evidence of the treasury official, Jonathan

said:</div>

					<a name="08012516000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had no evidence
from the Minster underpinning the choice of an otherwise apparently
arbitrary figure of &#163;190. Clearly that is a contribution rather
than the full cost associated with the joyful event of having a baby.
The Minister also referred
to</div>
					<a name="08012516000468"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The serious
problems of underweight babies in this
country&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012516000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a
serious problem affecting 7.3 per cent. of live births in 1999. The
&#147;Scientific Review Of The Welfare Food Scheme&#148;, which I
mentioned earlier, states that that problem is combated by impact
pre-conception nutrition. It is also important to mention what the
Minister referred to as</div>
					<a name="08012516000469"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the still very stark inequalities
in health of both women and children&#148;.<i class="I"> &#151;[ Official
Report, Health and Social Care Public Bill Committee, </i>10 January
2008; c. 103.]</div>
					<a name="08012516000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am absolutely
sure that each one of those items will be recognised by the Minister
because each one was a direct quote from his oral evidence.</div>
					<a name="08012516000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the
&#163;3.8 billion that it is claimed is needed to achieve the
Government&#146;s target of cutting child poverty by half by 2010,
the figure of &#163;145 million does not even make a dent. In case
hon. Members misunderstand me, particularly Government Back Benchers, I
am not questioning the need to support pregnant mothers or the need to
make a payment. We want to give the money; never let it be said that we
do not. I am simply seeking to call the Government to account for the
evidence for the health in pregnancy grant being the best way to spend
&#163;145 million per annum and whether that is the best way to
achieve the best outcome for vulnerable pregnant mothers.</div>
					<a name="08012516000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe
that I have made my case, but I fear that I will be unable to persuade
the Minister. I hope that Government Back Benchers will seek to call
Labour party policy to account for the effective use of
taxpayers&#146; money. Otherwise, there is a real danger that they
will find themselves joining a bandwagon that an ill-advised Chancellor
set rolling before he became Prime Minister. Officials and Ministers
are now trying to cover up the Prime Minister&#146;s considerable
embarrassment at being seen to be a headline-grabber rather than
someone who introduced a workable and effective policy based on
hard-headed evidence. It is a policy that Ministers and officials are
now desperately scrabbling around to post-rationalise, change by
stealth, refuse to provide the evidence for and ram through. On that
basis, we are looking genuinely and seriously for answers, and above
all, at last, please, the evidence to substantiate what the Prime
Minister said when he started the ball rolling. We are looking for the
reason why we now find ourselves engaged in parliamentary scrutiny of
the Bill.</div>
					<a name="08012516000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08012516000531"></a>
							<b class="B">Greg
Mulholland</b> (Leeds, North-West) (LD): I thank the hon.
Gentleman for reiterating and reinforcing many of the points that I
made at the beginning of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column485" />Column number: 485</div>morning sitting, particularly the stark reality that there is no
evidence to support this significant new policy. It is abundantly
clear, and will plainly remain the case, that the very pertinent and
important questions that have been asked, both today and previously,
about the new payment and its aims, have not been answered at any
stage. It is regrettable that that is still the case in
Committee.</div>
					<a name="08012516000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reality&#151;something that no one, including the Minister, would
disagree with&#151;is that a considerable proportion of the large sum
of taxpayers&#146; money represented by the payment will probably be
spent on things that have nothing to do with diet and nutrition. A
proportion, again, probably considerable, will be spent on things that
have no direct effect on health in pregnancy. It remains unclear what
the health in pregnancy grant actually aims to do, and we have got no
further down that road during our discussions.</div>
					<a name="08012516000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">In reality, this is a pre-birth
child benefit one-off payment, and if that is what the Government want
to do, they should say so and be clear about what they hope to achieve.
One specific point that I wish to pick up is the issue of multiple
births. If this is, as it seems to be, a child-benefit payment, it
should reflect the reality of multiple births. Not to recognise that at
seven months into pregnancy seems absurd.</div>
					<a name="08012516000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">There should
have been more consultation. The expert advice and views of the
involved organisations should have been listened to, to see whether
there was a better way of achieving this or whether the Government need
to change their rationale. Either way there is still a lot of work to
do, and that should not be the case at this stage of the legislation.
The measure will undoubtedly go through, despite the fact that the
arguments and the purpose are not clear. When the payment starts, there
must be a lot of analysis to see if it delivers. I hope that the
Minister will acknowledge that and tell us that that will happen and
that we will have a sense of what the payment achieves once it is
introduced.</div>
					<a name="08012516000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08012516000532"></a>
							<b class="B">Angela
Browning</b> (Tiverton and Honiton) (Con): I want to pick up
on one or two issues that have been raised. I feel confused about the
Government&#146;s intention for the grant. It is over 40 years since
I studied nutrition to an advanced level as a home economist. In the
oral evidence-taking session I mentioned that as a former president of
the then Institute of Home Economics, issues of nutrition and care of
family welfare, food and budgeting and so on made up an important part
of our deliberations. I agree, if it is a question of putting extra
money into the family income at a time when a child is expected and
there are additional expenses. The case has been made that the money
might be used not just for buying more nutritious food and having more
information about it, but also for other things such as paying off
debts, or helping to relieve stress in pregnancy, and we can all
understand that. However, I wish to focus on how the measure will help
women who are pregnant to be healthier and to produce children whose
health can be measurably defined as improved at birth. I assume that
the Government would want to monitor that. We have heard a lot about
birth weights, so one must assume that, however the money is used, it
will have a direct effect, statistically, over a period, on the health
of the child at birth and on birth weight.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column486" />Column number: 486</div>
					<a name="08012516000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not claim
to be as up to date on such matters as I was 40 years ago. I am aware
of the importance of folic acid in pregnant women&#146;s diets, which
I was not aware of some years ago. Equally, some things are still
relevant today. For example, as I said in an oral evidence session,
calcium and vitamin D in particular, as well as phosphorous, are
important in the foetal development of teeth and bones. We know how the
generation who lived through the second world war and did not receive
adequate supplies of calcium were affected.</div>
					<a name="08012516000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those things
are important, but I am not clear on who will deliver the information
and advice, or whether that will mean that mothers take heed of the
advice. I remember watching with horror the Jamie Oliver series in
which he tried to improve school meals. I was not shocked that school
children did not want to eat their greens&#151;all parents have been
through the battle of trying to get their children to eat cabbage and
things like that. I was shocked, however, that the mothers not only did
not buy fresh fruit and vegetables, but would not know how to cook them
if they did. There is a large body of people out there, and among those
people, particularly mums, it is probably the poorest who most need the
information about introducing those things into their diet. They need
to undergo the education process by which they will come to recognise
the importance of nutrition as well as in what foodstuffs the essential
vitamins and minerals that are important during pregnancy are to be
found. It will be fine if we are talking about middle-class mums who
will read magazines on such matters and attend antenatal classes
frequently. However, I suspect that the Minister has in the back of his
mind that large group of people, who are among the poorest, for whom it
is not only a question of introducing money or information, but who
have a mountain  to climb because of what they regard as a
normal, healthy
diet.</div>
					<a name="08012516000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Earlier in the
debate we discussed who will offer the advice. The Minister said that
that would be dealt with in regulations. I made a quick note of the
options available for offering the advice. It included GPs, practice
nurses, and midwives who are involved in antenatal care. However, I
suspect that once the forms are filled in to trigger the grant, it will
be a matter of pressing a leaflet into someone&#146;s hand and
saying, &#147;There you are, that is what you need to know&#148;.
If that happens, we will not be able to say in five years time that
there has been a demonstrable improvement in birth weights and the
ongoing health of children who benefited from the grant in the
womb.</div>
					<a name="08012516000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should
remember that recently, for the first time in 100 years, we identified
rickets in children. Rickets can be avoided if people have proper
nutrition, particularly those things that lay down calcium, such as
vitamin D and phosphorous. The debate has gone round and round on what
the measure is for, but we have not talked about outcomes. If we went
out on to Westminster bridge, we could do a little survey by asking
people, &#147;Do you think it is a good thing that the Government are
going to give this grant to pregnant women?&#148;, and perhaps
everybody would say &#147;Yes&#148;. The reality is, however, that
if public money is going to used to deliver an outcome, the Minister
must focus much more on what the money is intended for and how he will
deliver it, bearing in mind some of my points about the lack of
knowledge and understanding and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column487" />Column number: 487</div>the somewhat limited time scale that will be available to the
professionals who are going to be charged with delivering the
information.</div>
					<a name="08012516000498"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div>
					<a name="08012516000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am going to
congratulate the Government, something that I am always happy to do
when they get it right. The Minister need not look surprised, he knows
that I am a fair-minded person, he is my next-door neighbour. It is
absolutely first class that the Government are going to introduce
cookery classes into schools. I have lobbied for that for a long time;
it was wrong to get rid of them in the first place. I hope that it will
make a difference, but it will take some years to filter through, so
let us start at the beginning, which is what the clause seeks to do,
and ensure that the Minister gets it right. We are actually willing him
to get this right, but at the moment I am not convinced from what I
have heard that it will deliver what he
intends.</div>
					<a name="08012516000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08012516000533"></a>
							<b class="B">Anne
Milton</b> (Guildford) (Con): I do not want to rehearse the
arguments that have already been made, but there are a few issues that
I want to raise. On the number of midwives, the Minister might have
been under a misapprehension&#151;he needs to look at the full-time
equivalents. The figures for full-time equivalents demonstrate that the
number of midwives is not keeping pace with the number of live
births.</div>
					<a name="08012516000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
matter I would like to raise about the grant is inequalities in health.
Under part 5 I have tabled an amendment that touches on some of the
issues surrounding public health. The problem with the grant, to repeat
what my hon. Friends have already said, is not whether it is spent, but
how it is spent. As a poverty alleviation method, it is absolutely
fine. As the National Childbirth Trust pointed out, it gives mothers
some extra cash in the home at a difficult time in their pregnancies
and one would hope that they would spend it on their own and their
baby&#146;s health. However, the grant does nothing to address the
inequalities that exist in health, which are getting worse, not better.
The distance between the health outcomes of poorer people and richer
people is greater than it has ever been. I do not doubt the
Government&#146;s commitment to reducing those inequalities and the
fact that they have been unable to reduce them demonstrates that it is
extremely difficult to do so. The sad thing is that this is a
substantial amount of money that is not being directed to closing that
gap because we will be stuck with a group of people that are hard to
reach. The trouble with antenatal care in particular is that the good
old middle classes, the ones that actually think about what they eat
and how they spend money, trot along, listen to the midwife, pick up
leaflets and go home and do all the things that they are meant to. The
ones that we really need to reach will not do
that.</div>

							<b class="B">Sandra
Gidley</b> (Romsey) (LD): I am a little alarmed at the
assumption that the middle classes will read magazines and do things
well, and the working classes will not. I think there is probably a
spread in any socio-economic group.</div>

Milton:
						</b> I thank the hon. Lady for her intervention. She
used the words &#147;working classes&#148;, I did not. I am saying
that there is no denying the fact that there is a hard-to-reach group.
They might be in the middle classes; they might be those members of the
middle classes who are alcoholics sitting at home drinking themselves
stupid, and whose babies will be born with foetal alcohol syndrome. We
have to use generalities; there is a hard-to-reach group. They are not
necessarily working-class, but the hon. Lady might pay more attention
to inequalities in health than making comments about language. It is
absolutely vital that we reach those women. [<i class="I">Interruption.</i>] If
the hon. Lady would like to make another intervention, I am happy to
give way to her again.</div>
					<a name="08012516000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the Member for
Tiverton and Honiton commented that the problem with introducing
vegetables into diets is that some families&#151;some mothers, some
fathers&#151;do not even know how to cook them. That is what we are
up against. Recently somebody who works on a labour ward in south
London told me that a substantial number of women are asking to stay in
for the night after their baby is born because they want to go out
clubbing on that first night. Talking from personal experience, when I
had a baby, I was locked in a room with the curtains closed. I would
never have been able to go to a club, probably even within four weeks
of the birth of my children. However, a different sort of women is
having babies nowadays, and they are extremely difficult to reach. I do
not think that the Minister has listened to all that has been said in

					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(6) The
Secretary of State may by regulations indicate the payments to be made
in the event of a pregnancy that is carried beyond the twenty-ninth
week, but is not carried to term or live
birth.&#146;.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column489" />Column number: 489</div>
					<a name="08012516000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
owes it to Parliament to take the Bill seriously; after all, he is
proposing it&#151;the rest of us are trying to scrutinise it.
Following that gross disrespect, we move to amendment No. 64.</div>
					<a name="08012516000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 64 seeks to probe
Government thinking, but it sounds to me as if they cannot be bothered
to think and, if necessary, amend the Bill on the issue of payments to
mothers who, for whatever reason, at the later stages of pregnancy,
when it is often at the most tragic, do not carry their babies to full
term. I hope that, for once, the Minister will take the matter
seriously, because outside this Room, people think it is extremely
serious.</div>
					<a name="08012516000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note from
the draft regulations that a woman who has given birth to a child, or a
stillborn child, is entitled to payment of the health in pregnancy
grant, if she was at least 25 weeks&#146; pregnant, and before that
birth, had received advice on matters relating to maternal health from
a health professional. Of course, I should be more than willing to
withdraw the amendment if I received adequate assurance that the
regulations touch on it. My anxiety is that the need to have received
health advice will become the trigger, rather than the needs of the
mother, who will no doubt be going through extraordinarily difficult
times, when anything that would help her health, not least through diet
and nutrition, so that she can overcome desperate stress and grief must
be our primary focus.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012516000538"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> The draft regulations published by the Medical
Research Council, which I circulated to the Committee some time ago and
which, incidentally, included the list of professions that would be
involved in the work, set out the detail about the entitlement
conditions. In particular, regulation 2 of the draft sets out the
conditions in relation to pregnancy, and refers specifically to women
who have a stillbirth after the 25th week of pregnancy. That would
include the exceptional cases where a pregnancy has to be terminated on
medical grounds after the normal 24-week limit for legal abortion. I
assure hon. Members that we have carefully considered this most
sensitive matter. When a woman loses her baby, we do not want to add to
the distress that she and her family will be facing, by placing
additional requirements on her. Accordingly, where a woman meets the
specified conditions of entitlement, as set out in clause 121, and
claims within the time specified in regulations set out under clause
122, she will continue to be entitled to the grant, regardless of the
outcome of her pregnancy.</div>

					<a name="08012516000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
will recall that there were a series of reasons for that concern, which
it was important to consider. Indeed, they were reprised by my hon.
Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton in her contribution. There
was concern about the focus on the birth, which is what the Government
pray in aid, as compared with the health of the baby and the mother,
who is under much greater demand when it is a multiple birth. One must
think carefully about making these grants available to individual human
beings, be they boy or girl, on the basis of health rather than simply
as an event of birth. I wonder whether the Minister would like to
amplify his comments on that point, given that he chose to keep his
remarks rather short during our previous attempt at the
subject.</div>

Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. I assume that it disallows illegal
immigrants from claiming 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column491" />Column number: 491</div>the health in pregnancy grant. Does that stand also for those who have
claimed asylum but not yet heard the outcome of their application? This

A8 countries are the new EU entrants: the Czech Republic, Estonia,
Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. The

somewhat
equivocal:</div>
					<a name="08012516000471"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government are introducing from April 2009 a one-off payment to

					<a name="08012516000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Could

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012516000545"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> Under subsection (2), the health in pregnancy
grant will follow the long-standing Government policy that those who
have not established their right to remain permanently in the UK,
should not have welfare provision on the same basis as those whose
citizenship or status here entitles them to benefits and assistance
when in need. To ensure that people who are subject to immigration
control and who are in the UK illegally are not entitled to the health
in pregnancy grant, subsections (2) and (3) apply section 115 of the
Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 to the health in pregnancy grant.

					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(b) produce an annual

plan.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="08012516000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment, crucially, would insert into the Act a duty on primary care
trusts to produce an annual health improvement plan. All NHS bodies
currently have a duty, under section 45 of the Health and Social Care
(Community Health and Standards) Act 2003, to ensure that they have
arrangements in place for the purpose of monitoring and improving the
quality of care. Clause 129 would amend the National Health Service Act
2006 to insert a duty on primary care trusts to make arrangements to
secure continuous improvement in the quality of care provided by or for
them. This new version of the duty is intended to be more closely
aligned with that imposed on local authorities by section 3 of the
Local Government Act 1999. The existing duty in section 45 of the 2003
Act would cease to apply in relation to English NHS bodies.
Responsibilities for the duty of care would thus be placed with
commissioners of NHS services and primary care trusts.</div>
					<a name="08012516000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment would put a
condition on PCTs to produce an annual health improvement plan. I
believe it is still the case that primary care trusts produce an annual
health report. That is important as it reports on what has happened
within its area in the previous year. However, that focus on future
improvement is crucial. Many parts of the Bill, in relation to
maternity grants, the weighing and measuring of children and here under
the clause, make reference to the public&#146;s health. I would urge
the Minister, as I said in my brief intervention on the discussion of
the previous clause, that this is non-party-political issue. We will
move on to obesity and I am restraining myself from talking about it
now, but it is terribly important that we deliver better health for the
public.</div>
					<a name="08012516000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Public health
is in many ways a dispiriting area to work in because, particularly
with measures that have long-term outcomes, one is looking for
improvements over the course of five years. The health improvement plan
would help those working in the field to keep their focus and allow
them to be measured against what they are delivering and indeed,
measure themselves. It is disappointing that on the state of public
health in July 2006, the chief medical officer warned that raiding
public health budgets can kill. Although it is not so much the case
this year, in previous years we have seen PCTs&#146; responses to
budget deficits as raiding the public health budgets. Unfortunately,
public health money is always seen as soft money, partly because of
those long time frames for outcomes&#151;there is no immediacy. I do
not know that newspapers such as the <i class="I">Daily Mail </i>report public
health very much and it does not have the sexy image that many other
parts of healthcare have, but it is equally if not more
important.</div>
					<a name="08012516000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we look
at the figures for the number of people employed in public
health&#151;I should reiterate my interest, which is that my husband
is a public health physician&#151;between 2005 and 2006, with no more
recent figures available, the number of full-time equivalent public
health staff in the NHS was cut by  4 per cent. It went down
from 1,324 to 1,268. Of those, the number of public health consultants
was cut by  6 per cent., going down to 687. PCTs are working
with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column493" />Column number: 493</div>tight financial constraints these days and there is a feeling that they
must deliver on those headline figures. It is absolutely crucial that
we get PCTs to focus on public health improvement; to produce a plan
would make a substantial difference.</div>

						</b> Clause 130 and schedule 12 deal with money for

Currently the nationally agreed figure is administered nationally and
everyone knows what the situation is. In its consultation,
&#147;Modernising Financial Allocations for NHS Pharmaceutical
Services 2007&#148;, the Department of Health proposed devolving the
global sum to primary care trusts&#146; baseline allocation. In doing
so, the Department stated that it would</div>
					<a name="08012516000474"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;continue to set the levels of
fees and allowances for community pharmacies in negotiation with the

					<a name="08012516000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
introduces the necessary amendments to the National Health Service Act
2006 to permit the global sum to be devolved, but does not include
provisions to ensure that the Secretary of State will continue to set
the levels of fees and allowances nationally, following consultation

is concern that the longer term aim is perhaps to have different fees
in different areas and fees set by primary care trusts.</div>
					<a name="08012516000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Currently,
section 228 of the National Health Service Act 2006 requires the
Secretary of State to pay sums equal to pharmaceutical services
expenditure to primary care trusts. Such sums are distinct from the
main expenditure and require the Secretary of State to determine the
remuneration of persons providing pharmaceutical services after
consulting with the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee. The
Bill removes the distinction between pharmaceutical services
expenditure and a primary care trust&#146;s main expenditure from
section 228 and therefore removes any obligation to make a
determination of the remuneration of persons providing pharmaceutical
services. To give effect to the stated intention of the Department of
Health to continue to set the levels of fees and allowances for
community pharmacies in negotiation with the Pharmaceutical Services
Negotiating Committee, the Bill must retain an obligation on the
Secretary of State to determine some elements of the remuneration of
persons providing pharmaceutical services. In its current form the Bill
does not do
that.</div>
					<a name="08012516000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill amends schedule 14 of the National Health Service Act 2006 and
adds a new paragraph 3A. That will authorise the Secretary of State to
designate elements of remuneration payable by primary care trusts to
persons providing pharmaceutical services, which is not remuneration
referable to the cost of drugs. The designation has two effects; first,
the Secretary of State will be obliged to apportion the total to
primary care trusts&#151;that will be accomplished by transferring
the global sum&#151;and secondly it will make primary care trusts
accountable for those sums. Almost all fees and allowances paid to
persons providing pharmaceutical services are not referable to the cost
of the drugs being provided. However, the Secretary of State is under
no obligation to designate any elements of the remuneration. To give
effect to the Department of Health&#146;s intention to continue to
set the levels of fees and allowances for community pharmacies in
negotiation with the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee the
new paragraph 3A should oblige the Secretary of State to designate
certain elements of remuneration. That is what the amendments would
do.</div>
					<a name="08012516000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section
164 of the 2006 Act provides that the Secretary of State is a
&#147;determining authority&#148; who determines the remuneration
to be paid to persons who provide 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column495" />Column number: 495</div>pharmaceutical services. However, he may also authorise any primary care
trust to be a determining authority, which is particularly needed to
allow primary care trusts to determine payment for locally commissioned
enhanced services. Some fees and allowances apply to all persons
providing pharmaceutical services, for example the dispensing fee. In
its consultation, the Department emphasised the importance of
continuing to set the level of those nationally.</div>
					<a name="08012516000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section 165 of the 2006 Act
requires that before the Secretary of State makes a determination that
relates to all persons who provide pharmaceutical services, such as a
determination of dispensing fees, he should consult a body appearing to
him to be representative of persons to whose remuneration the
determination would relate, namely the Pharmaceutical Services
Negotiating
Committee.</div>
					<a name="08012516000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sections
164 and 165 do not place an obligation on the Secretary of State to
determine the remuneration of persons who provide pharmaceutical
services and the Secretary of State could, with no further legislative
amendment, decide to authorise primary care trusts to determine
remuneration for persons providing pharmaceutical services, including
dispensing fees. The community pharmacies in England provide an
accessible health care resource that is greatly valued by members of
the public. In a recent <i class="I">Reader&#146;s Digest</i> survey only
firefighters were more highly valued. It is a very useful health
resource. Other health care professionals such as doctors and dentists
have nationally agreed fee structures. 85 per cent. of a typical
community pharmacy&#146;s income comes from the NHS and certainty of
income levels from this source is
essential.</div>

					<a name="08012516000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The payment
by primary care trusts of remuneration to persons providing
pharmaceutical services, which has been determined by the Secretary of
State, must be mandatory. Unlike providers of general medical services,
who have legally enforceable contracts, providers of pharmaceutical
services do not operate under a contract that can be enforced by the
provider. The Secretary of State may issue directions to PCTs with
respect to the application of sums paid to them and to ensure that the
fees and allowances determined by the Secretary of State, after
consultation with the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee,
are properly paid to persons providing pharmaceutical services.
Direction must be issued to oblige PCTs to pay that
remuneration.</div>
					<a name="08012516000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
seems to be some uncertainty about the future of the payments. We are
seeking to regularise a situation where the Government have made
promises that do not appear to be incorporated in the Bill. I hope that
the Minister will look kindly on the amendments. There is one small
problem with the transfer of the global sum: because payments are made
in arrears, the transition from one method of payment to another needs
to be looked at carefully to ensure that PCTs have their act together
and that there is no hiccup in the distribution of
payments.</div>

Hopkins</b> (Luton, North) (Lab): I have had these problems
explained carefully to me by a representative of pharmacists, and I ask
my hon. Friend the Minister 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column496" />Column number: 496</div>to ensure that whatever the Government do, they protect those local
pharmacies who would find these problems difficult and might have their
continued existence threatened. Local pharmacies are important for
local communities, and I want to ensure that that is taken into
account. I am not suggesting support for the amendment, but I hope that
my hon. Friend will take into account what has been
said.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012516000553"></a>Anne
Milton:
						</b> I want to reiterate the point made by the hon.
Member for Luton, North. Local pharmacies almost have an air similar to
local post offices&#151;a big topic at the moment. Local pharmacies
are increasingly important in the delivery of some preventive matters,
such as screening, and in respect of issues such as chlamydia,
pregnancies and all the rest. It is important that any change does not
undermine their business or make it more difficult for them to
continue.</div>
					<a name="08012516000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012516000554"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> Hon. Members have raised some important points.
These are matters of concern to pharmacists. I will spend a little time
dealing with the concerns raised by the hon. Member for Romsey.
Amendments Nos. 229 and 230 would remove the ability for anyone other
than the Secretary of State to determine the remuneration paid for the
provision of pharmaceutical services. Current legislation enables the
Secretary of State to determine such remuneration himself or to
authorise others, such as PCTs, to do so. Under these amendments, the
Secretary of State would have to set the fees, allowances and payments
for all categories of pharmaceutical services, whether those services
were agreed nationally and provided by all pharmacy contractors, or
commissioned locally by PCTs from certain pharmacies to meet local
needs&#151;for example, services for drug misusers. That would
undermine the existing community pharmacy contractual framework,
whereby PCTs determine the remuneration for the local enhanced services
that they commission and fund from community pharmacies.</div>
					<a name="08012516000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">I share the hon. Lady&#146;s
desire for the NHS to commission a wider range of services from
pharmacies. They are often in the most accessible location and can
provide services tailored to meet local community needs. Having
attended its annual conference last year, I know that that view is also
held by the pharmacy profession, the all-party group on pharmacy and
others. We believe that the amendments would undermine the ability of
local PCTs to continue to commission existing local enhanced services
from pharmacies, never mind extending the services that they fund
through pharmacies.</div>
					<a name="08012516000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
240 would require the Secretary of State, where he determines
remuneration for pharmaceutical services, also to give directions to
PCTs in respect of that determination of funding. That is unnecessary
because, where the Secretary of State has made a determination of the
fees and allowances to be paid to community pharmacy contractors, that
determination has to be honoured by PCTs. So that amendment would add
nothing.</div>
					<a name="08012516000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
241 would require the Secretary of State to designate any element of
remuneration determined by him for pharmaceutical services. Designation
allows costs to be charged to a PCT other than the PCT where the
pharmaceutical service was provided. That would enable certain elements
of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column497" />Column number: 497</div>pharmaceutical services to be charged to the PCT where a prescription
was issued, while other costs would be borne by the PCT where the
pharmacy was based, thus avoiding a PCT with a pharmacy that provides
services to a wide area&#151;such as an internet
pharmacy&#151;inappropriately bearing the costs of pharmaceutical
services for people resident elsewhere. Designation would not be
appropriate for certain types of expenditure, which will be borne by a
PCT where the pharmacy providing the service is based. That amendment
would require the Secretary of State to make a designation in respect
of all remuneration determined by him for pharmaceutical services, even
where such a designation is
inappropriate.</div>
					<a name="08012516000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
the Department consulted on the proposals, we indicated our intention
for the Secretary of State to continue to determine the fees and
allowances for the national elements of the community pharmacy
contractual framework, in negotiation with the Pharmaceutical Services
Negotiating Committee and in discussion with the NHS. Those national
elements are the essential services provided by all pharmacy
contractors and advanced services, such as medicines use reviews, which
pharmacies choose to provide.</div>
					<a name="08012516000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Concerns have
been raised, including by the hon. Lady today, that that might not
continue to be the case. We recognise that pharmacy owners need to know
the remuneration that they will receive for those substantive parts of
the contractual framework, so that they have the confidence to continue
to invest in their businesses. I should like therefore to take the
opportunity strongly to reinforce our commitment that the Secretary of
State will, indeed, continue to set the fees and allowances for the
national elements of the community pharmacy contractual framework. In
light of those reassurances, I hope that the hon. Lady will withdraw
her
amendment.</div>

							<a name="08012516000555"></a>Sandra
Gidley:
						</b> I thank the Minister for the explanation. Clearly,
as he said, it is important that enhanced services continue to be
commissioned locally. I fully support that. I do not want any
unintended consequence for enhanced services, so the amendments may not
be perfect. I was pleased to hear the Minister&#146;s clarification
that the intention is for the Secretary of State to continue
determining national rates. Will he write to clarify where that is
stated in the Bill? Also, where is the protection that I alluded to
during my opening comments, so that payments cannot be determined by
PCTs in the future? I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

					<a name="08012516000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clinical negligence scheme
for NHS trusts indemnifies members against losses and liabilities that
arise out of negligence occurring in NHS care. It is currently only
available to specific NHS bodies, under section 71 of the NHS Redress
Act 2006. When the schemes were first established, most NHS care was
provided directly by NHS bodies, but in recent years, non-NHS bodies
have started to deliver a considerable amount of NHS care. The
Secretary of State also procures some NHS services
directly.</div>
					<a name="08012516000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
has been considerable expansion in the use of private providers. We
have seen them in the independent sector treatment centres, about which
there has been some controversy, not only about the placing of the
treatment centres and the possibility of them undermining the local NHS
structures and trusts, but about them cherry-picking what are presumed
to be the easier cases and leaving the NHS with a bill to pick up for
the more complex ones.</div>
					<a name="08012516000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">There have also been issues
about independent sector treatment centres, because when it all goes
wrong, local NHS trusts pick up the bill. If ISTCs have been using, as
many of them have, a lot of doctors from places such as South Africa,
patients can be transferred in emergency circumstances into the care of
perhaps the local orthopaedic surgeon who has not previously been
involved with their care.</div>
					<a name="08012516000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am aware
that the Government are keen to increase private provision. I gather
that there has been some delay in the second wave of ISTCs, but the
Government were aiming for a target of 9 per cent. of all NHS care
delivered by private providers. We are now looking at an expanding
mixed economy of provision in the NHS. We have talked about pharmacies
delivering some care and undertaking some diagnostics. The amendment
would cover the liabilities that relate to people who are treated in
those private sector
organisations.</div>
					<a name="08012516000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 68 would prevent loopholes in the Bill, whereby expenses or
liability might arise from the provision of non-publicly funded health
care. I have been lobbied on the issue by, among others, Action against
Medical Accidents. I quote from what I think was a submission by the
organisation to the Minister that welcomes the move but
believes</div>
					<a name="08012516000475"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that the
provision of the Bill at the moment is seriously flawed in that it
makes this arrangement voluntary on the part of the
provider.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012516000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">The concern is
that if the arrangement is not compulsory, private providers will not
necessarily make it and that therefore leaves
the</div>

have a problem with who provides the health care&#151;whether a
voluntary, charitable, publicly funded or private body does

that they need as and when they need it. However, we are still using
public money, so we must ensure that if the state&#151;the
Government, the PCTs&#151; commissions care from the private sector
the same safeguards are in place to protect and indemnify patients when
things go wrong.</div>

						</b> I am sure that you would not welcome it,
Mr. Conway, if the debate were widened into a general debate
on the merits or otherwise of involving the voluntary and independent
sectors in providing health care. I take the point that my hon. Friend
made.</div>
					<a name="08012516000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have sympathy
with the hon. Lady&#146;s amendment, but I will explain why it is
unnecessary. Subsection (1)(b) of section 71 of the 2006 Act limits
schemes to covering liabilities that arise out of carrying out the
functions of the member body. Under clause 131 (4) and (7), the
liabilities of the Secretary of State and non-NHS members will be
limited to those that relate specifically to their functions of
providing health services under the 2006 Act. Under our proposal,
schemes are limited to covering liabilities that relate to the
provision of publicly funded NHS health care with regard to those
members. However, the schemes cover not only such liabilities, but the
functions of health service bodies and expenses that arise from the
loss or damage to property that is not directly related to the
provision of publicly funded health care. An example would be malicious
damage to NHS property.</div>
					<a name="08012516000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment would prevent the
existing schemes from providing cover to the NHS for such expenses and
liabilities. I am sure that that is not the hon. Lady&#146;s
intention, but it would be an undesirable outcome. In response to her
question about compulsory or voluntary participation, we cannot make
participation compulsory, because we cannot compel foundation trusts,
but in the contract with the independent provider, we can and will
require liability&#151;we cannot specify, but the scheme will be much
cheaper for them.

					<a name="08012516000478"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;information relating to a
child&#146;s body mass index&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08012516000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is important because height and
weight in themselves are not accurate enough measurements. They give a
picture, but some children have growth spurts, for example, and any
problem would be less easy to identify. The American Academy of
Pediatrics has placed frequent measurement as its first priority in the
identification and management of obesity. The academy&#146;s research
stressed to every doctor the importance of a yearly assessment for
children. If body mass index were tracked from year to year, it would
be easier to identify any early deviation from the normal, expected
growth
curve.</div>
				
					<a name="08012516000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Body
mass index is not something that most people can calculate off the top
of their heads, but there are easy sliding scales and mini calculators,
so it can be done at the touch of a button or the turn of a dial. Once
a school nurse, say, has the height and weight measurement, it would be
easy for them to provide the extra information. People could plot the
information on hand-held growth charts so that they had a history over
time. A one off measurement of height, weight or BMI is, in fact,
fairly useless&#151;all one can do by measuring that trend is to get
an overall picture of whether 11-year-olds are getting larger and
fatter. That may help to provide national statistics, but we are trying
to produce something that will help to identify children who are at
risk so that appropriate action can be
taken.</div>
					<a name="08012516000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Minister will look kindly on the amendments. He has not
looked kindly on any amendment so far, but I live in hope&#151;I am
eternally optimistic. I do not think that we should get too bogged down
in whether people understand the concept of BMI; it is a fairly simple
idea and can be explained to people. They do not need to know the
calculation or anything else, but it is important that they are able to
track the trends. My children are too old to benefit from such a
measure now, but perhaps I will be a grandmother one day, and I would
like to think that someone would keep an eye on my
grandchildren.</div>

						</b> I congratulate the hon. Lady on finally using the
word &#147;fat&#148;&#151;it is not used very often these days.
My issue with the word is that &#147;fat&#148; is something for
which a person might feel that they have responsibility, whereas they
might think that &#147;obesity&#148; simply happens to them. I feel
like a victim because of the extra stone and a half that I carry, but
if I thought about it as &#147;fatness&#148;, I might take more
personal responsibility for getting rid of
it.</div>

hon. Lady&#146;s sentiments. I do not know about the use of the words
&#147;junior&#148; or &#147;primary&#148;, but I dare say that
there is a legal definition. We could use numbers or simply a term such
as 9 to 10-year-olds. I do not believe that inserting the word 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column502" />Column number: 502</div>&#147;annual&#148; would be terribly useful because, in fact, it
might be useful to weigh and measure people monthly. There needs to be

							<a name="08012516000569"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> Amendments Nos. 168, 170, 172 and 174 make
explicit provision for weighing and measuring to be carried out
annually. In England, the National Child Measurement Programme is
currently run on an annual basis, with children in the reception year
and year six being weighed and measured at any time during the school
year. I am happy to confirm that we have every intention of continuing
to collect that data annually. However, we do not think that the
frequency of the programme needs to be specified in the Bill, indeed,
that could cause potential confusion as existing guidance already asks
primary care trusts to weigh and measure the children in reception and
year six each year. PCTs are able to carry out that task over the
course of the school year, which allows for the local health care
professionals involved to be used most effectively, spreading their
duties over the year and visiting schools at the time that best fits in
with school activities and causes least
disruption.</div>
					<a name="08012516000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012516000570"></a>Sandra
Gidley:
						</b> I am not sure why that would cause confusion. The
Minister mentions a scheme in which, at some stage during the school
year, children in reception and year six are measured. This measure is
an entirely different proposition and suggests that each year all
children will be measured. It is not so that they can be measured at
any random time, the aim is to provide an annual health check for each
child in Britain.</div>
					<a name="08012516000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012516000571"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> I beg the hon. Lady&#146;s pardon, I
misunderstood. I have explained why we believe the amendment to be
flawed, but I misunderstood her reasons for tabling it. We do not take
the view that it is justified or proportionate to measure every child
every year. Measurements from these two different years will give us a
pretty comprehensive database without imposing disproportionate burdens
either on PCTs or schools.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012516000572"></a>Sandra
Gidley:
						</b> It would be interesting to know if the Minister
has any data so far. The scheme has only been going for four or five
years, so he may not have any, but we do not yet know how far adrift
children have been allowed to go in six years. It is a considerable
period of time during which a child may have picked up bad 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column503" />Column number: 503</div>eating habits. Yesterday we discussed how children do not always get the
best food at home and how lunch boxes are not always healthy. Despite
efforts being made with school meals and cooking, a lot of damage could
have been done during that time. It is not about recording data, it is
about identifying early problems.</div>
					<a name="08012516000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012516000573"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> That implies that the only way of identifying
those problems is through weighing and measuring. As the hon. Lady
knows, there are a range of measures taken by schools and by doctors
and nurses so that they are able to intervene in this. Our advice
suggests very strongly that, as things stand, annual weighing and
measuring would not be justified in terms of the benefits compared to
the costs.</div>
					<a name="08012516000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 169, 173 and 175 would make the scope of the provisions in clauses
132 and 133 apply to primary pupils instead of junior pupils. There is
a technical reason why we have used &#147;junior&#148;. It goes
back to the Education Act 1996, where</div>
					<a name="08012516000479"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;junior pupil&#148; means a
child who has not attained the age of
12&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08012516000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Primary pupil,
however, is not defined, and unless accompanied by a suitable
description, the amendment would use a term in statute without a clear
definition. The main difficulty with that approach is that it risks
excluding those children aged 10 or 11 who attend middle schools rather
than primary schools.</div>
					<a name="08012516000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendments Nos. 176 and 177
on the body mass index, as the hon. Lady will appreciate from the
letter I sent her at the end of November last year, we have not ruled
out providing parents with their child&#146;s BMI but we believe that
further work is required before we can be certain exactly what should
be prescribed. That will be debated again when we come to discuss the
regulations. An important reason why we may decide not to include BMI
information is that recent research suggests a lack of understanding
about it. We need to be sure that the information we provide is in a
form that can be most readily understood and used by parents. Research
commissioned as recently as 2007, from the British Market Research
Bureau, on parental attitudes to the current weighing and measuring
programme in England suggests that most parents do not understand BMI.
Some parents said that they had never even heard the term used before
and others, who had heard the term, said that they did not understand
what it meant.</div>

						</b> While the debate has focused on weight gain, in
terms of a child&#146;s health, I wonder what thought the Minister
has given to girls approaching puberty. We know that increasingly, some
of them suffer from anorexia and bulimia at quite a young age and the
idea that suddenly their parents are going to start encouraging them,
as a result of a statistic, to dramatically lose weight would give me
some cause for concern. Although in terms of children&#146;s health
weight gain is a problem, so too is the increasing problem of how we
handle young girls who become much more fashion conscious, even at
primary school level, and for whom getting the balance right in how
that information is given will need to be sensitively handled.

							<a name="08012516000575"></a>Mr.

						</b> The hon. Lady is absolutely right. Sometimes we
are better to talk about a healthy weight, because she is right to
point to the problems of anorexia among teenage girls in particular, at
a slightly later stage than the one we are discussing now. We agree
that we need to move away, over time, from focusing solely on obesity
to focusing on a healthy weight and healthy
lives.</div>

							<a name="08012516000576"></a>Angela

						</b> May I say to the hon. Gentleman, I do not think
that we must assume that this is a problem just in the teenage years?
Increasingly, it is younger and I know of many nine, 10 and
11-year-olds who are fans of the Sugababes and others, who are now
fashion conscious even at primary school level, and for whom the
argument would apply.</div>
					<a name="08012516000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012516000577"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> Yes, indeed and as part of the national child
measurement programme we will advise school nurses or other health
professionals who are concerned about a child&#146;s health or weight
that whether the child is overweight or underweight, they should take
action accordingly through the local care and support that is
available.</div>
					<a name="08012516000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I was
saying, one of the reasons why we think that BMI may not be the
appropriate way to give information to parents is that they do not
understand it. Another reason is that as a single measurement, it may
not as accurate in young children as it is in adults and I am advised
that there are a number of reasons for that. Unlike adults, children
are still growing and therefore one single measurement may be skewed by
a particular growth phase, in particular BMI may vary with puberty.
Secondly, evidence linking children&#146;s BMI to health outcomes is
not as strong or well established as it is for adults. We will be
consulting parents, professional groups and other relevant
organisations over the next few months, to develop the best system and
format for providing children&#146;s results to their parents. That
will include determining what level of detail parents would find most
helpful. In due course, we will consult further on the regulations
around this measure, so all who have a view will be able to contribute
to that debate. I have already sent the draft of the regulations to the
Committee. I hope that in the light of those assurances, the hon.
Member for Romsey will feel able to withdraw her
amendments.</div>

Gidley:
						</b> I listened with interest and disappointment to the
Minister&#146;s remarks. To return to the point about BMI, it is
slightly different in  children but I think that the Minister
was being uncharacteristically feeble when he said that parents do not
understand it&#151;whatever happened to education? We do not have to
call it a body mass index, we can call it something else, such as a
healthy weight index, but it is a cop out to say, &#147;Oh, this
looks a bit difficult, we won&#146;t do it this way&#148; if it
does prove to be the most effective
measurement.</div>

those?</div>

Gidley:
						</b> Yes, I have considered the use of centile charts
and, having been reduced to a nervous wreck by a health visitor because
my child was at the bottom of the curve, am not terribly enthusiastic
about them. The BMI gets round some of those problems. I was interested
to hear what the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton said because I
have a naturally-skinny daughter who has always been slim, although she
ate like a horse and has a healthy body image. She was constantly being
asked by school nurses if she felt that she looked fat. Clearly, they
thought that she was potentially underweight. If that had been tracked
for a longer period, they would have realised that that was just her
and that some people fall at the extremes of those measurements quite
naturally.</div>
					<a name="08012516000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
obsession with weight can be unhelpful for a fit and muscly child who
will always be at the top of the scale, and it is a difficult one to
judge. However, annual weighing would help to pick up early signs of
decreasing BMI, which can also give cause for concern. Obviously, that
would be treated in a different way. I shall turn my attention to the
regulations and beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

						</b> I could not help but notice the Minister&#146;s
eyes go up to heaven when I mentioned the possibility of a stand part

a little tetchy, but I think that the mood of the Committee has
improved. I would hate to see the Minister&#146;s emotional state
regress as a result of a stand part debate because this is
important.</div>
					<a name="08012516000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obesity is
probably one of the most important public health issues that we face. I
understand that we are the first generation of adults whose children
are likely to have a lower life expectancy than us. In this century, it
is absolutely appalling to think that what we are doing will shorten
our children&#146;s lives.</div>
					<a name="08012516000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a few issues that I
would like to raise. I am not entirely sure why there has to be
legislation on this matter. I saw the regulations and would like to
thank the Minister because, although they are neither lengthy nor
exhaustive, they give some idea of the thinking on that. They
state:</div>
					<a name="08012516000480"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;An
important effect of the Regulations is to protect the position of the
young children participating in the NCMP in compliance with the
European Convention on Human Rights and data protection
legislation.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012516000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">I assume,
therefore, that that has to be placed in legislation simply to allow
the PCTs to relay the information to the parents, but I would like the
Minister&#146;s clarification because at the moment that is already
ongoing. I have had contact with all the strategic health authorities,
which are all advancing well towards meeting their targets for that
programme. </div>
					<a name="08012516000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
issues that we should start with is just how fat we all are, and the
figures are absolutely dreadful. The Department of Health&#146;s
website advises that the proportion of children in England aged two to
10 who were overweight or obese in 2005 was 31 per cent., compared to
22.7 per cent. in 1995. The proportion of children who are overweight
increased 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column506" />Column number: 506</div>from 12.8 per cent over that period to 14.2 per cent, while the
proportion of obese children rose from  9.9 per cent. to 16.8
per cent. over the same period. In 2005, the prevalence of obesity for
boys and girls aged two to 10 was similar: for boys, obesity rose
from  9.6 per cent. in 1995 to 16.9 per cent. in 2005, while
for girls, obesity rose from 10.3 per cent. to 16.8 per cent.</div>
					<a name="08012516000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also have some figures from
Yorkshire and Humber. In fact, I congratulate the strategic health
authority there on giving me such a detailed breakdown of what is going
on. This will distress my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and
Honiton, but it suggests that young people in the region eat only half
the recommended portion of fruit and vegetables. It is projected that
33 per cent. of boys and 30 per cent. of girls will be overweight by
2010.</div>
					<a name="08012516000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">The figures for
those aged 11 to 15 are even more stark. The projected level for boys
is 33 per cent., and the projected level for girls is the highest in
England. Some 28 per cent. of girls are projected to be obese, with a
further 16 per cent. being overweight by 2010, which means that almost
half the children in that region aged between 11 to 15 will be obese.
That is  truly shocking.</div>
					<a name="08012516000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend raised the issue
of anorexia. It is important to note that the flipside to obesity is
anorexia. She is right to say that the issue affects younger and
younger children. Sadly, though, that issue and the issue of obesity
cannot be addressed simply by weighing and measuring
them.</div>
					<a name="08012516000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012516000582"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I would like to reinforce the points made by my
hon. Friends the Members for Guildford and for Tiverton and Honiton.
Because of the increased evidence of obesity and anorexia appearing at
a much younger age, the clues that one gets for the trend starting are
that much smaller. The sooner that the trend lines can be picked up,
the sooner one can get the evidence, which will lead to better health
advice and hopefully to a better outcome. That is another reason for
saying the younger the better when it comes to applying this
measure.</div>
					<a name="08012516000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012516000583"></a>Anne
Milton:
						</b> My hon. Friend raises a crucial point. It is all
about picking up the trend. Early intervention is important for
children suffering from anorexia and bulimia. It is not nutritional
advice that such children need but psychological help. Looking at the
figures on what is being spent on obesity drugs, one can see that they
are now the fastest growing item being prescribed. Prescriptions for
obesity drugs increased 28 per cent. with a total cost of nearly
&#163;50 million. I know that the Government are keen to address the
drugs budget. In some ways it is a shame that we are having to treat
such conditions with drugs because we have not acted at an earlier
stage and tried to treat the condition with a lifestyle
change.</div>
					<a name="08012516000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">The burden of
the proposed measure will largely fall on school nurses from primary
care trusts. The nurses will oversee the weighing and measuring.
Schools will be asked to provide the PCT staff with a list of children
to be weighed and measured and to inform the PCT if the parents have
chosen to opt out of the programme. Information about individual
children&#146;s weights or heights will not automatically be given to
parents, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column507" />Column number: 507</div>although they may request the child&#146;s information. The records of
children&#146;s heights and weights will be anonymised and the data
used in the NHS for the analysis of trends in obesity and overweight
and underweight children.</div>
					<a name="08012516000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have to
flag up to the Minister the concern that exists in my own constituency
and across the country as a whole about the need for security of this
data. We had quite a lot of discussion yesterday about obesity
following the Secretary of State&#146;s statement. I appreciate that
this measure is only one aspect of the Government&#146;s programme to
tackle obesity. Again, if anyone wants to get to sleep tonight and is
failing to do so, the current arrangements are described at length on
the Department of Health&#146;s website. Such reading is a guaranteed
cure for insomnia. The Department of Health has issued a leaflet for
parents called &#147;Why your child&#146;s weight matters&#148;.
It is probably an indication of the state of affairs that we have got
to, that we have to say that.</div>
					<a name="08012516000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is guidance for PCTs and
arrangements for measuring. Some of the regulations are highly specific
about what machines are used and so on, which is important. If we are
going to lump the data together, we need to ensure that data sets mean
something. As I said, the guidance also sets out the legal basis for
the current programme, the responsibilities of PCTs, the role of
schools and local authorities, the schools covered, and lists of data
collected and how they are stored and used. Separate guidance will also
be issued for schools. That is a considerable burden on schools and
PCTs.</div>
				
					<a name="08012516000503"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30
pm</div>
					<a name="08012516000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
concern about school nurses. The Royal College of Nursing&#151;I
declare an interest in that I am a member&#151;supports the proposals
that help school nurses to share information with parents on the
well-being of their children. It sees it as a positive step that PCTs
and the Government will work together to ensure that every child has
access to a school nurse by making the adequate resources available.
However, it is concerned that progress to achieve the
Government&#146;s target of one qualified school nurse in every
secondary school and its cluster primary schools is slow, with evidence
indicating that many school nursing teams have been adversely affected
by the impact of NHS deficits, which I mentioned
earlier.</div>
					<a name="08012516000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 2006
joint report by the National Audit Office, the Healthcare Commission
and the Audit Commission entitled &#147;Tackling Child
Obesity&#151;First Steps&#148; indicated that head teachers
reported that their ability to tackle health issues, such as obesity,
was seriously inhibited by the lack of access to health professionals
within schools and other educational settings. I am sure that I am not
alone in saying that schools are increasingly worried about the burdens
and responsibilities place on them for looking after an aspect of a
child&#146;s growth and development that they do not feel is their
responsibility and that, in many cases, they do not feel well equipped
to deal with. The presence of school nurses, therefore, will be crucial
to the success of the programme.</div>
					<a name="08012516000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other point I want to raise
relates to what we do with the information. In the light of some of the

<div class="Column"><a name="Column508" />Column number: 508</div>responses from strategic health authorities around the country, my
concern is that it will be yet another box-ticking exercise. Their
letters had an air suggesting that what mattered was that they reach
the target for weighing and measuring children, and that was
it&#151;their job was done. But, of course, that is only a way of
benchmarking health improvements put in place afterwards. What is
crucial is the follow-on that we are able to provide and the
resources.</div>

public health. In any village in any developing country, the first
thing that one sees is a sling on which babies are weighed. It is the
first means of establishing, in those cases, the presence of
malnutrition, and in general the state of young people&#146;s health.
That applies quite a long way up the age scale.</div>
					<a name="08012516000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">We ought to
learn from the public health agendas of such developing countries,
because we are in grave danger of losing out as a result of our more
sophisticated approach to health care provision. We should issue the
mother with a little booklet recalling over time all the weights and
heights of her children&#151;most of us of a slightly older
generation will have experienced that. That would be a very powerful
tool, because that information would be owned by the mother, which is
more important than the broad statistical measurements in SHA or PCT
measuring units. That is one way in which we could use such
information. It would give the mother ownership of the health of her
child.</div>
					<a name="08012516000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012516000585"></a>Anne
Milton:
						</b> My hon. Friend raises a very important point about
ownership. I opened by talking about fatness and obesity, with one
being something that happens to me and one being for which I am
responsible. That endorses his point. The ownership by parents of their
children&#146;s health is extremely important. I must raise again the
issue of hard-to-reach groups. Parents can withdraw their children from
the programme, and I dare say that the child could withdraw themself.
Even if a parent gives permission for their child to be weighed and
measured, if the child on the day refuses, the school or school nurses
could not insist otherwise. My concern is that the fat kids will
withdraw.</div>
					<a name="08012516000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">Often,
particularly with very obese children, there are huge issues about
self-esteem. We have talked about anorexia and bulimia, and in relation
to severe obesity there are many similar psychological overlays making
children fat. This has a great deal to do with self-esteem. It is
important that when we introduce the programme there is a safety net to
pick up the children at that stage and to give them counselling,
because there are other problems in their life. It gives us an
opportunity to deal with those children and their psychological
problems at a very early stage. Withdrawal from the programme is in
itself an indicator that there are other problems.</div>
					<a name="08012516000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously, we
would support anything that could be done to tackle the problems with
obesity. If you will indulge me for a minute, Mr. Conway, I
will return to the health in pregnancy grant and say that this issue
starts with maternal health, foetal health and having enough midwives
to support and encourage breastfeeding. In this day and age, women are
not in hospital long enough to establish breastfeeding, and the problem
starts from that point and goes right the way through. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column509" />Column number: 509</div>The work is quite resource-intensive; it costs quite a lot of money.
However, if we really believe in joined-up government and want to make
a difference, we have to see that investment up front in the areas that
I have described will save&#151;if we want to consider this purely in
financial terms&#151;a great deal of money in the long term, because
we will prevent at an early stage all the diseases associated with
being both underweight and
overweight.</div>
					<a name="08012516000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think
that the Minister finds these clause stand part debates slightly
tedious, but the issue is important. He is shaking his head to show
that he enjoys every minute of them, but he did not feel happy to
respond to the points raised on the health in maternity grant. I hope
that he will address some of these matters. The problem concerns us
all, and the Government can make a difference if they apply themselves
not to the headline figures or to the figures on children&#146;s
weight going down, but so that we see children at a more healthy
weight, eating more healthily and living more healthy lifestyles to
prevent the implications for the health service that we are storing up
for the
future.</div>

							<a name="08012516000586"></a>The

						</b> I cannot imagine why Mr. Hood and I
were appointed to chair this
Committee.</div>
					<a name="08012516000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012516000587"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> May I put it on the record that there is nothing
tedious at all about clause stand part debates? What I always try to
avoid is repetition &#151;particularly when I am given direction by
the Chairman, who has asked specifically for brief contributions
because many of the arguments have been explored and illustrated in
debates on the amendments. I think that most members of the Committee
find that tiresome and it is exactly what I was trying to avoid
earlier. However, the hon. Lady has made some very important and new
points and I will endeavour to respond to them to the best of my
ability.</div>
					<a name="08012516000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
asked first the most fundamental question: why is the legislation
necessary? There are three reasons why we need to legislate. First, we
need to give a legal basis to the existing programme. Secondly, we need
to allow feedback to parents. She will be aware that at the moment
people have to opt in to obtain the feedback, whereas this provision
will mean that people have to opt out. We hope that it will mean that
more parents receive the feedback. Thirdly, we need to legislate to
allow the data to be used for performance management for local primary
care trusts on their obesity
strategies.</div>
					<a name="08012516000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Lady has said, and I acknowledge, that this provision is a small part
of our overall strategy against obesity, which was launched, and very
well received, yesterday. I do not intend to broaden the debate out to
that in general, because we are talking about a specific programme of
weighing and measuring of children. She may not have mentioned it, but
it is worth putting it on the record that another reason why we are
legislating is that two Select Committees&#151;the Health Committee
and the Public Accounts Committee&#151;specifically recommended that
we did so.</div>
					<a name="08012516000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Lady will know, our target for 2006-07 is 80 per cent.
coverage&#151;that is the percentage of eligible children weighed and
measured. We are confident that improvements to the programme will have
resulted in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column510" />Column number: 510</div>much greater coverage and that there will be a vast improvement on the
48 per cent. participation that we achieved in the first year, 2005-06.
We do not have those figures yet for 2006-07, but the hon. Lady might
like to table a parliamentary question every few weeks and as soon as I
can I will put them in the public domain. She is right to point out
that the child would have the freedom to refuse. I do not think many
people would suggest that we should force children, particularly given
the self-esteem issues and the sensitivity that she rightly described,
but we have developed a DVD and a flyer for children about the
programme to help to reduce any concerns that they might have about
participating.</div>
					<a name="08012516000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">PCTs
will upload the data electronically to the national child management
database, which will be developed and maintained by the Information
Centre for Health and Social Care. The centre will not have access to
child-identifiable data. When the data is uploaded to the database, it
will be anonymised by removing or converting all identifiable data,
including the name of the child; the postcode will be converted to
lower super-output area, whatever that means; and the date of birth
will be converted to age and month. Although the information centre
will not have access to any patient-identifiable information, there are
robust information security measures in place to ensure that the data
is held and accessed securely.</div>
					<a name="08012516000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">Individual children&#146;s
results will not be shared with school staff or other pupils, and
suppression and disclosure controls will be implemented when the data
is set and publication released. That means that when the data is
published, small numbers that could allow individual children to be
identified will be suppressed. For example&#151;someone must know
what this means&#151;at super-output area level, or even at PCT
level, if numbers between one and five appears in any data cell, that
number will be replaced by an X; so will any corresponding total
relating to that number.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012516000590"></a>Greg
Mulholland:
						</b> I warmly welcome clause 134 as a whole, as it
extends direct payments to include people who lack capacity. We
strongly agree with the choice and flexibility that it will give the
system. It is an important and possibly overlooked part of the Bill. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column511" />Column number: 511</div>The Minister will also be aware that the provision has been welcomed by
many of the relevant organisations, including Age Concern, Carers UK,
the Parkinson&#146;s Disease Society, the Local Government
Association and the Commission for Social Care Inspection. However,
some organisations have expressed the concern that although it is
excellent in principle, and that it is right in practice, they want to
be reassured that adequate support is offered for the service user and
the carer&#151;and the nominated representative or agent.</div>
					<a name="08012516000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments are about
creating safeguards to ensure that there is sufficient protection for
recipients of direct payments. Together, they would mean that 
a designated person must be determined by investigations to be
undertaken by the responsible local authority. They would bring in
arrangements that would allow direct payments to be made to the agents
of someone lacking capacity, interlined with current good practice as
established under the Mental Health Act 2007, in order to determine who
is or is not suitable to act as agent.</div>
					<a name="08012516000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments would place a
clear duty on local authorities to make such checks when agreeing to
make payments to an agent or nominated person. The suggestion is simply
that such checks would be prudent to ensure the safety of vulnerable
people who lack capacity. The amendments would also ensure that public
funds were appropriately spent and not passed on to anyone with an
unsuitable financial background, which would make such payments a
matter of concern. It might be that the Minister can assure the
Committee that the amendments are not necessary, but I am sure that he
agrees that the sentiment is a sensible one. I look forward to his
comments.</div>

							<a name="08012516000591"></a>Anne
Milton:
						</b> I do not want to add much, except to welcome this
move with direct payments. I would just like to caution the Minister
again that I might want to say something briefly in the clause stand
part debate&#151;he did not raise his eyes, but he looked a bit tense
for a second. I will be very
brief.</div>
					<a name="08012516000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue of
the proper person can fall two ways. I was involved with a case in
which an over-zealous social services department was utterly convinced
that the guardian of an elderly lady was abusing his position. It took
more than five years to resolve the matter. This issue is very
difficult, and it arises in child protection and any case when
responsibility has been given to a third party to look after somebody.
We need to ensure that there are safeguards in place in both
directions: to protect the vulnerable person; and to protect genuine
carers from over-zealous social services
departments.</div>
					<a name="08012516000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08012516000592"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Brian Jenkins</b> (Tamworth) (Lab): I ask the Minister for
clarification. If a person is regularly taken into day care on a
regular basis, a local authority may provide direct payments. Some
local authorities, I understand, will give a direct payment for the
individual, but then refuse to allow them to go into public authority
day care so that they must buy that provision in the public sector. Is
the Minister&#146;s 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column512" />Column number: 512</div>intention to clarify that if a place is provided by a public authority,
the people with the direct payments should have the opportunity to
purchase that requirement from that
authority?</div>
					<a name="08012516000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012516000593"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> I reassure the hon. Member for Leeds,
North-West, who tabled the amendment, that we all agree that we should
take steps to reduce the likelihood that a suitable person may
mismanage a direct payment or abuse their position of trust. Anyone who
cares for a person who lacks capacity under the Mental Capacity Act
2005 and wilfully neglects or ill-treats that person can be found
guilty of a criminal offence that is punishable by up to five years in
prison, a fine, or
both.</div>
					<a name="08012516000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not think
that the amendments are necessary because the safeguards that they
would introduce are already present under new subsection (1A) and
amended subsection (3). Direct payments will be made under the new
scheme through a multi-step process. If someone is considered to be a
suitable person who could potentially manage a direct payment on behalf
of somebody else, that does not automatically mean that the direct
payment will be made to
them.</div>
					<a name="08012516000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have taken the powers in new subsection (1A) and amended subsection (3)
to enable regulations to be made that impose conditions that must be
met before the responsible authority decides to make the payments. Only
if certain steps have been taken, or conditions have been satisfied,
can payments be made to a suitable person. An example of a condition
that we envisage being in the regulations is the requirement that the
local authority must, when appropriate, consult family members or
friends already involved in the care of the person who lacks capacity
before deciding to make a direct payment to a suitable person.
Furthermore, regulations may specify that if the suitable person is not
a family member or a friend of the person lacking capacity, local
authorities may be required to carry out vetting and a barring check
under the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 before making the
direct payment.</div>
					<a name="08012516000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should perhaps add that the draft regulations on these matters will be
subject to full consultation with local authorities, the Office of the
Public Guardian and other interested stakeholders. In the light of
those comments, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to
withdraw the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08012516000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">In response
to the question from my hon. Friend the Member for Tamworth about
whether direct payments can be received even though somebody has been
assessed as eligible for continuing care funding, my understanding is
that it is not currently possible for somebody in receipt of continuing
care funding to receive a direct payment as
well.</div>

							<a name="08012516000595"></a>Anne
Milton:
						</b> I want to raise the question of what direct
payments buy, and I have some figures from an article that appeared in
one of the papers. We have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column513" />Column number: 513</div>already talked about our welcome for direct
payments, and there is no doubt that empowering people and having them
feel in control of the services that they receive is useful for not
only the individual concerned, but service providers. However, the
effect of individuals&#146; purchasing power can be quite profound,
and the help that people will be buying will be in the form of a
personal assistant or a home carer. It is very important that these
changes do not have unintended consequences. The job of being a
personal assistant or home carer must be kept viably
attractive.</div>
					<a name="08012516000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
danger is that cost cutting is turning the personal assistant or home
carer role into that of a poorly paid dogsbody, and a job that not
enough people are willing to do. We have seen this in the tourism
industry. For some reason, we have a dislike of unskilled labour in
service industries in this country. I do not remember the precise
figures, but in central London there is unemployment of about 8 per
cent. We are importing labour from eastern Europe and British people
will not work in service industries here because it seems
demeaning.</div>
					<a name="08012516000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">These
direct payments must be sufficient to employ people of a sufficient
calibre to give the care. The danger, particularly in any sort of work
that involves going into people&#146;s homes, is that if the status
of that work is not high, not enough people are recruited and we get
second-class care. While it is important that people are empowered and
feel that they have ownership of the care that they receive, we do not
want them to feel that they can receive only the very worst possible
care that is
available.</div>

					<a name="08012516000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to
give a brief explanation of the new clause. It would address concern
relating to people moving house or care home between local authority
areas, and designate the responsibilities of both the original
authority and the new one. The aim is to resolve any problems that
might arise from the patient moving so that care may continue
uninterrupted. The practical reasons are that local authorities might
have different standards and practices of care. People are concerned
that they might have to start the assessment process again, which could
have cost implications. They are also, crucially, concerned that there
could be a delay in receiving care in their new local authority, and,
fundamentally, that the level and quality of care may fall. I hope that
the Minister can assure the Committee that that is not the case and
that the new clause is not necessary, and that he appreciates that this
is a sensible, practical
point.</div>

					<a name="08012516000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will go back
to the subject of over-zealous social services departments and problems
relating to where people reside. I will give as an example an adult,
perhaps with learning difficulties, who has been looked after by his
parents, but who moves to another area because it is thought that he is
able to manage on his own. For argument&#146;s sake, let us say that
he builds up social networks and lives there happily for ten years, but
his situation then deteriorates and he needs care. He could find
himself wrenched away from the area that he knows, has social contacts
in, and has become used to, and having to return to where his parents
live, but where he has not lived for ten years. I do not know whether
the new clause is necessary, but I would like  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column516" />Column number: 516</div>the Minister to take on board the fact that the problem often arises
because people get caught up in the crossfire of no one wanting to pay.
That is what this comes down
to.</div>

departments under pressure spend a huge amount of time and energy

						</b> The hon. Lady and the hon. Member for Leeds,
North-West make some important points, but I hope to reassure them that
the new clause is not necessary. Local authorities already have a duty
to work together to make appropriate services available to people who
move from one local authority to another and to co-operate with each
other in the process. The statutory guidance that we issue also
requires co-operation when people are placed by one authority into
accommodation in another authority area.</div>
					<a name="08012516000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 18 seeks to impose a
duty on the new local authority to provide</div>

and quantity to those provided by the original
authority&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08012516000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the
example that the hon. Lady just gave, it would remove any flexibility
from the relevant authorities and would assume that the needs of the
individual have not changed since the original authority&#146;s
assessment. In order to allocate funds appropriately, it is essential
that local authorities have responsibility to decide their eligibility
criteria and to carry out an assessment of individual needs,
circumstances and preferences. In the light of those comments, I hope
that the hon. Gentleman will not press the new clause, and will get
home in time to put his two-year-old to bed.</div>

an emergency, such as those that the new body will deal with, it is
even more important that guidance is clear and the bodies and boards

O'Brien:
						</b> We have moved to the general part of the Bill,
part 6. Our amendment No. 66 relates to this clause, and I believe that
I said I may wish to press it to a Division. In my point of order in
the Committee&#146;s fourth sitting, I pointed out that we were made
aware of the memorandum on delegated legislation only the day before
our sittings began. The Minister kindly apologised, ascribing the error
to a new Library rule. Officials have now succeeded in depositing the
paper, and I am pleased to confirm that it is numbered DEP2008-0077. I
am of course happy with that explanation, and I should be grateful if
the Minister would continue to ensure that his Department and the
Government give hon. Members plenty of time to study the Bills that
they sponsor, particularly those involving complicated
memoranda.</div>
					<a name="08012516000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
conscious that amendment No. 66 would mean that all regulations would
need to be confirmed by the affirmative resolution. I am equally sure
that I would press it to a Division only to hold the
Government&#146;s feet to the fire, as it were, as I have said on
rare occasions before, so that they go away and think about the
measure. Quite fairly, the Minister has just said that he promises to
think about some of the issues that we have raised in amendments. Even
if they were not made, they have spurred the possibility of some
refinement of the Bill&#146;s drafting, and we may well look forward
to some changes on
Report.</div>
				
					<a name="08012516000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will have to focus on that
next week because, with the recess on the way, the timetable is such
that we will have to table our amendments for Report in the next few
days to ensure that we are ready to deal with that stage of the Bill on
the first day following the recess. At least, that is what I have been
informed. If that proves to be the case, we will have a busy time even
in  the recess.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column519" />Column number: 519</div>
					<a name="08012516000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the Minister will
look carefully at our arguments. It is important, particularly with
this Bill, given that we are dealing with so many entitlements and
rights of people who are often in a vulnerable position, and because we
are seeking positively to promote itemised and tailored individual
public health issues, that we consider using the affirmative resolution
procedure.</div>
					<a name="08012516000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 260 is coming up on clause 158, so I am trying to work out in my

debated in a group, it is important that whoever moves the amendment
indicates to the Chair or to the Clerks if they wish to press the
amendments to a Division. Otherwise, the group is not specifically put
at a later point in the proceedings. With that in mind, if the hon.
Gentleman wanted to press to a Division, it would have to be on clause
stand part, rather than on an amendment which the Committee has already
considered. To avoid that happening with any future amendments that
come up in future clauses, the hon. Gentleman or other hon. Member

wish to reinforce how important it is, when we consider how the powers
are transmitted and utilised by Welsh Ministers, that the Government
recognise that those of us who represent English constituencies in
border areas have a grave difficulty in accessing accountability
through Parliament for Welsh matters that affect our constituents.
Notwithstanding the helpful discussion we had earlier, that has been a
running theme and, at many times, a running sore in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column520" />Column number: 520</div>legislation since devolution. To a lesser degree, that applies to those
who represent Welsh constituents in the Westminster Parliament in
relation to English matters, such as when my neighbours are treated in
a hospital in my constituency.</div>
					<a name="08012516000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">With those matters in mind,
there is still this overhanging difficulty about the accountability

O'Brien:
						</b> Just in case anyone was getting excited about us
galloping away, and if my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford thought
she was being pedantic, well here we go. The important point to note is
that the clause deals with repeals which are listed in schedule 15.
Some 15 Acts passed by the Government over the last nine years will be
repealed or amended. They include the Health Act 1999, the Care
Standards Act 2000, the Health and Social Care Act 2001, the National
Health Service Reform and Health Care Professions Act 2002, the Health
and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003, the National
Health Service Act 2006, the National Health Service (Wales) Act 2006
and the Health Act 2006. So it is clear that the vast majority of those
15 Acts are from this Department&#146;s
watch.</div>
					<a name="08012516000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">Parliament is
the place to both propose and pass laws, but it is always helpful if
Governments can get it right first time. Most importantly there is a
big question about the almost iterative method by which we are making
law in this area. Our parliamentary predecessors recognised that
ground-breaking law needed a lot of consideration. Of course that was
in the days when Bills were not programmed, so they would get full and
detailed consideration. I have never been in favour of the new hours of
this House and I think we should work through the night when we need
to. That would give us plenty of time to discuss everything in detail.
This is a good example of where truncated parliamentary scrutiny and
iterative law making have ended up with a rather shabby list of Acts
that have to be repealed. I am sorry to see that, but it is worth
placing on the record because it is a reflection of where we have got
to in the legislative procedures, which the House has decided, in its
wisdom, to
sanction.</div>

						</b> Both provisions relate to the fee-charging

debated at some length earlier in the Committee. I do not intend to add
any more to the discussions that we had
then.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012516000630"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> As the Minister said, this relates to matters
that were brought forward on the Floor of the House in a separate ways
and means debate. We had a long discussion around the fee-raising
powers of the OHPA and the associated governance and value-for-money
issues. That debate is recorded from  column
357.</div>
					<a name="08012516000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is right to
point out that we remain concerned that the OHPA is not totally
independent of the Government. The Minister assured the Committee that
departmental power lies only with payment and loans made to OHPA. He
also assured us that an executive, non-departmental public
body&#151;if OHPA is eventually classified as one of those by the
Office for National Statistics&#151;does not have to refer any of its
judgments back to the sponsoring Department. It does not have
to  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column523" />Column number: 523</div>explain to the Department why it has made any professional decision, nor
does it have to give the Department details of its professional
decisions. There is total independence in the panel&#146;s
professional decisions and Ministers will have no power to interfere in
any of its adjudication
decisions.</div>
					<a name="08012516000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
new clause 7 opens up the path for the OHPA to collect fees from the
General Optical Council and the General Medical Council&#151;fees
that will be passed on to doctors, opticians and associated
professions. Again it is right to place on record that we remain
concerned that the Government have a power over the levy, particularly
as they have not yet clarified the likely level of the fees and the
running costs of the OHPA, although I readily acknowledge that the
Minister will seek to give us further details, hopefully in the near
future, so that we can bottom this one out. The Government have not
given sufficient guarantees protecting doctors against massive
year-on-year fee increases, in the event that the OHPA fails
financially because of Government error. I was half-inclined, on a
feet-to-the-fire basis, to propose that we should seek to divide the
Committee on the issue, but assuming that the Government are happy to
acknowledge that they are genuinely coming forward with more details
for us to consider, I am happy to allow the amendment to go forward at
this stage.</div>

							<a name="08012516000649"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> It does not matter how many times one does it;
returning to a discussion of many days or weeks ago is the most
challenging part of the procedure. At least we have reporters if I have
got any of that wrong.</div>
					<a name="08012516000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had
an important discussion on public and patient involvement. That is
something that is of great concern across the House and I do not intend
to seek to embarrass or press in a partisan way. As hon. Members are
aware, there is a proposal, which happens to come from the Opposition,
to establish an organisation called HealthWatch. I have urged the
Minister to look seriously and carefully at what my party proposes. We
have worked very hard on this matter: we have discussed it with a lot
of people and we have made a commitment to establish HealthWatch, a
national consumer voice for patients and service users. Having had many
discussions about local involvement networks with patients and public
involvement throughout the Committee stage, we are very grateful, and I
genuinely mean that, that the Minister has undertaken to look at the
matter again. His commitment is welcome.</div>
					<a name="08012516000401"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will not unduly delay the
Committee although we are not particularly rushed. New clause 8 seeks

					<a name="08012516000402"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;further the interests of patients
and the public in relation to the provision of health services in

such
patients.&#146;.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08012516000404"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 11 would establish HealthWatch as an &#147;English
network&#148; for the purposes of the Local Government and Public
Involvement in Health Act 2007. I do not know whether any members of
this Committee served on the Public Bill Committee for that
legislation, but I should have checked, given that there has been
genuine interest from many hon. Members present. HealthWatch would use
existing legislation to achieve the aim of having a national
representative body for local involvement networks.</div>
					<a name="08012516000405"></a><div class="hs_Para">Contrary to
the Minister&#146;s assertion that our proposal is opposed to the
bottom-up, organic approach&#151;he will recall that
discussion&#151;LINKs would be the drivers. HealthWatch would give
them the power to engage with policy at national level, which they are
denied by the Government. That is the essential part. I am sure that
Committee members will recall the importance of the old community
health councils and the bed watch publication. That had a major impact
on the way in which Governments thought about the patient experience,
what needed to happen and priorities. Indeed, in their early years in
office, one of the Labour Government&#146;s priorities was capacity
issues.</div>
					<a name="08012516000406"></a><div class="hs_Para">With the new
clauses, we aim to deliver on our commitment to establish a national
consumer voice for patients&#151;HealthWatch&#151;to provide them
with support at a national level, to provide leadership to LINKs at a
local level and to incorporate the functions of the independent
complaints advisory services. That is very important. We have had many
discussions on concerns about the capacity to process complaints,
assuming the Bill becomes an Act, and the capacity of the complaints
handling system. Today&#146;s memorandum helped to put a little more
flesh on the bones regarding complaints issues. That welcome and
important document has been placed on the record as a
memorandum.</div>
					<a name="08012516000407"></a><div class="hs_Para">HealthWatch
would also make representations on the closure of NHS services, for
example. We would have it make representations to the NHS board, and we
have published a draft Bill on that, which we hope to have the
opportunity to introduce. Subject to consultation, HealthWatch would
have statutory rights over nationally issued guidelines on the care
that NHS patients should receive and on decisions that affect how NHS
care is provided in an area. I urge the Minister to take our new
clauses into account as he seeks a way forward for patient involvement
in the CQC and our
NHS.</div>
					<a name="08012516000408"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend
the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) has
promised to bring our proposals forward as part of our announced NHS
Autonomy and Accountability Bill. I hope that this debate has
sufficiently whetted the Minister&#146;s appetite for that discussion
and that he has no concerns about pride of authorship or the fact that
the measures happen to have been proposed by us rather than his
Government. It is undoubtedly the right way forward for our NHS. On
that basis, I commend the new clauses to the Committee and very much
hope that the Minister will regard them as a useful addition that will
improve the Bill as we speed its passage through
Parliament.</div>

						</b> I reiterate my concern that the representation of

particular problems. I am also concerned about access to advocacy. Some
Labour Members will be watching carefully to see how the new
arrangements work in practice and to ensure that patients have proper
representation in every way necessary and appropriate. I hope that my

							<a name="08012516000651"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> I am sorry to tell the hon. Member for Eddisbury
that we think the HealthWatch idea is as flawed as other ideas in the
Conservatives&#146; draft Bill, such as giving over the running of
the health service to an independent, unaccountable national quango.
The reasoning behind the new clauses appears to be that the committee
will represent patient and public views to the commission more
effectively than the local involvement networks&#151;or the regional
or national networks that they might choose to establish with the Care
Quality Commission&#151;might otherwise be able to achieve.</div>
					<a name="08012516000411"></a><div class="hs_Para">The re-establishment of a
centralised body, especially one that sits within the Care Quality
Commission would undermine our move towards more local determination,
flexibility and responsiveness. It would also go against the conclusion
of the arm&#146;s length body review in 2004, which recommended the
abolition of the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in
Health&#151;a not dissimilar body to the one being proposed as part
of the wider Government agenda to move resources from centralised
bodies to the front
line.</div>
					<a name="08012516000412"></a><div class="hs_Para">LINKs should be
given time to determine their own way of being represented regionally
and nationally if they wish. Together with other changes we are making
such as the complaints reform to which the hon. Gentleman referred,
that will more than cover the function set out in the Bill for
HealthWatch and ensure the representation of the public and patient
voice to the new regulator, as my hon. Friend the Member for Luton,
North so eloquently advocated.</div>

O'Brien:
						</b> I put it on the record that we do not accept the
Minister&#146;s analysis of the approach advocated by our NHS
Autonomy and Accountability Bill but there may be a future opportunity
to consider it in detail. I recognise that the soundbite used in
relation to it has been repeated.</div>
					<a name="08012516000414"></a><div class="hs_Para">I pay tribute to the hon.
Member for Luton, North, who did not necessarily support the new
clause, for his consistent approach to patient involvement and the
level of advocacy that needs to be established. He and I have shared a
view on that issue over at least eight years since we looked very
closely at what was happening when the community health councils were
abolished, as it was one of their key roles. The independence and trust
that they enjoyed led to advocacy that worked, which was especially
helpful to those in a very vulnerable situation. Our HealthWatch
proposal, which is contained in the new clauses, is intended to try to
replicate that aspect of the CHCs.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column530" />Column number: 530</div>
					<a name="08012516000415"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want to press the hon.
Gentleman to make a decision and I recognise that the Government are
taking a view on these matters. The point is well heard as well as well
made and the best I can do is hope that if we continue to take
opportunities to press these ideas, the Government will one day realise
that they are not intended to be something that they should resist, but
something that they should embrace. That would be one of the best ways
of demonstrating that there is a unity in many of our objectives for
making sure that the NHS is not only robust and well designed but that
its priority is to serve patients from the very first to the very last
and to improve their lives through better health.</div>

are lucky, family and unpaid carers may step into the breach, at great
cost to their health, employment opportunities and well-being, as we
all know. Instead of rationing according to severity of need, which
deprives some disabled people with moderate or low support needs of any
help whatsoever, and increases the likelihood of more costly acute
health and social care intervention further down the line, the new
clause proposes an alternative approach. It would require local
authorities to meet minimum outcomes in respect of disabled people
regardless of the level of presenting need. That would maximise the
opportunities for disabled people and maintain and extend their
independence and
well-being.</div>
					<a name="08012516000425"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
minimum outcomes would be prescribed in regulations, and, given the
import, there would be virtue in making them subject to the positive
resolution procedure. Parliament should get the chance to debate fully
and decide what a minimum level of support should
be.</div>
					<a name="08012516000426"></a><div class="hs_Para">Examples
of minimum outcomes are given in the new clause. They are based on core
human rights standards as set out in the European convention on human
rights: freedom from physical risk is based on article 2, which deals
with the right to life; freedom from inhumane or degrading treatment is
based on article 3; and the right to privacy and family life is based
on article 8, which encompasses a positive obligation on states to
support people in developing their personality and social
relationships, and in participating in social, economic, cultural and
leisure
activities.</div>
					<a name="08012516000427"></a><div class="hs_Para">Organisations
such as the Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation hear
from many disabled people for whom those basic human rights are denied.
Unless and until those rights receive clear statutory 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column532" />Column number: 532</div>underpinning, disabled people and their families will continue to
experience daily hardship, exclusion and
indignity.</div>
					<a name="08012516000428"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
that local authorities are left to flout human rights standards because
the Government have failed to spell out clearly what the positive
obligations in the convention actually mean. They cannot simply be
dismissed by reference to resource constraints, although I would point
out that independent living support is frequently cheaper, better and
more flexible than traditional
support.</div>
					<a name="08012516000429"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause would underpin effective implementation of recommendation
4.4 of the Prime Minister&#146;s strategy unit report, which is
accepted as Government policy. That report on improving the life
chances of disabled people said that there should be a new system in
place by 2012 to deliver independent living. It should include
provision for eligibility based on requirements arising from disabling
barriers&#151;for example, cash payments for taxis when public
transport is inaccessible&#151;and additional requirements associated
with impairment. For example, voice-recognition software would enable
someone to read text at home and work. Subsection (1)(a) is designed to
implement that. The system should also include provision for security
and certainty about what level of support is available. That would be
implemented by subsection
(1)(b).</div>
					<a name="08012516000430"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause
would help to create a social care system geared towards prevention and
the achievement of beneficial social and economic outcomes in place of
the dependency-oriented, increasingly threadbare safety net that exists
today. I will concede that the Government want a debate about the
future funding of social care, but it must be informed by a clear
position on what we want social care to achieve. The Wanless review
noted that the impact of current social spending on achieving the
Government&#146;s desired outcomes of promoting choice, independence
and prevention is unclear. In fact, the review said that the evidence
that does exist suggests that the social care system is falling short
of those aims.</div>
					<a name="08012516000431"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
economic and social benefits, and cost-effectiveness of independent
living support, including the low-level support mentioned earlier, have
been well documented in reports published by the Office for Disability
Issues. Wanless estimated that an additional &#163;3 billion now
needs to be pumped into social care. Even if that investment is not
forthcoming, whole-system reform as outlined in the Disabled Persons
(Independent Living) Bill currently before the Lords&#151;which
includes provision for seamless support and individual
budgets&#151;would release major savings which could fund the
provisions in the new
clause.</div>

							<a name="08012516000656"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I do not want to detain the Committee long. I
have read the new clause very carefully. When something deals with
guaranteed minimum outcomes for people with disability, I think that we
are all genuinely very exercised as to whether it carries with it a
thrust that we should follow.</div>
					<a name="08012516000433"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first issue I have is that
it does not come with any costings. That has an effect. We have real
issues about increasing the burden on local authorities at the very
time when their finances are under increasing and continuing pressure,
particularly in the area of social 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column533" />Column number: 533</div>care. The hon. Lady and I have regularly had quite serious disputes,
both in Westminster Hall and at other times because of her confession
that the free personal care promise made by her party, first in
Scotland and then as part of their last national election campaign, was
a lie. That was something she agreed and confirmed on the Floor of the
House, and I have been regularly reassured that it is in order to use
the word.</div>
					<a name="08012516000434"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed, she
said that that was the way her party&#146;s manifesto writers like to
approach their whole manifesto, something with which I could not
possibly disagree, and which I dare say the Minister would also find it
very tempting to endorse. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for
Leeds, North-West says he wants to go home. It seems quite
extraordinary that he does not wish to vote this
afternoon.</div>

reason I am not voting is that I have chosen not to vote on my own pay

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012516000663"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I accept your ruling, Mr. Conway. The
reason this was important&#151;and it is important to place it on the
record&#151;is that we do not get many chances to scrutinise one
another&#146;s promises and proposals, and the Liberal Democrats were
making a serious contribution to this. They have form, and the hon.
Member for Romsey prayed in aid the approach that her party has taken
to social care. She even prayed in aid the Wanless report. That has
been prayed in aid by her party in the past when it promised free
personal care&#151;a promise that, in their most recent announcement,
has been withdrawn as no longer being affordable. It is important to
recognise that, in fairness to the hon. Lady, she was at least two if
not three years ahead of her party in admitting that the policy was
unsustainable and undeliverable&#151;and indeed, was not delivered.
On that basis, and on the basis of the fact that there is an absence of
costings in new clause&#151;I think the Minister will share that
concern&#151;there is an issue here about whether the promises in the
new clause are deliverable in reality.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012516000664"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> I do not want to intrude on the private grief of
the Liberal Democrat and Conservative parties, but I will defend the
hon. Lady&#146;s right&#151;and indeed the right of any political
party or hon. Member&#151;to change her mind. Indeed, the
Conservative party changed its mind on policies almost every day, so I
do not see what point the hon. Gentleman is making.</div>
					<a name="08012516000443"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that many of us have a
great deal of sympathy for the sentiment expressed by the hon. Lady,
but we have problems with the new clause for reasons I will briefly
spell out. First, they would curtail the autonomy of local authorities
in the provision of social care services and undermine their ability to
deliver the services required by their population with the funding
available to them. The Department of Health published &#147;Fair
access to care&#148; guidance in 2002, which provides councils with a
framework for setting their eligibility criteria based on
individuals&#146; needs and associated risks to independence, and
includes four eligibility bands: critical, substantial, moderate and
low. When placing individuals in those bands, the guidance stresses
that councils should not only identify immediate needs, but those that
might increase for lack of timely
help.</div>
					<a name="08012516000444"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
reason why we do not think that the new clause is desirable is that
where fundamental reform of the social care system is needed, which is
what the hon. Lady was really talking about, it ought to be considered
as part of a coherent package. That is why the Government are
developing the Green Paper to which she referred. It is an historic
advance reflecting the fact that society is changing and will change
even more in the future. Dignity and control for those who use the
services and their families will be at the heart of the new system. The
work on the Green Paper will consider the issues that she raised about
eligibility. In the light of those remarks, I hope that she will
withdraw the new
clause.</div>
					<a name="08012516000445"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08012516000665"></a>Sandra
Gidley:
						</b> I thank the Minister for his comments. The new
clause was tabled in an attempt to start a debate on a slightly
different approach. I take issue with his comments about curtailing the
autonomy of local authorities. Many of us think that local authorities
do not have the autonomy that they want, owing to budget pressures and
being unable to raise taxation should they wish to in order to meet
social care demands. They are forced increasingly to make very
uncomfortable decisions&#151;this goes across the political
spectrum&#151;to restrict the services that they can offer. We can
only guess at the impact of that in the long
run.</div>
					<a name="08012516000446"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall not
detain the Committee further by indulging in cheap cross-party banter.
For once, I shall rise above it and beg to ask leave to withdraw the
new clause.</div>

							<a name="08012516000667"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> On behalf of the official Opposition, I would
like to take this opportunity to thank all those who participated in
this Committee. Despite the fact that none of our amendments was
adopted, for which we are sorry, we recognise that the Minister has
undertaken not only to provide information&#151;some of which he has
already provided&#151;but to think through some of the issues that we
raised. We might genuinely expect to see that materialise on Report or
at other later stages. As I said, although we are sorry that amendments
have not been accepted and that we have been unable to secure the
evidence that we are seeking on the provenance of the health in
pregnancy grant, which is a serious point, we are confident that our
deliberations will have helped to improve and clarify the
Government&#146;s intentions.</div>
					<a name="08012516000452"></a><div class="hs_Para">I pay tribute to the
contributions of the hon. Members for Luton, North and for Tamworth,
and obviously to the Liberal Democrat spokespersons. I also pay tribute
to my hon. Friends the Members for Rugby and Kenilworth, for Tiverton
and Honiton&#151;she has much expertise&#151;and for Preseli
Pembrokeshire, who unfortunately has been detained on other
parliamentary business. In particular I pay tribute to my co-Front
Bench spokesperson, my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford for the way
in which we have sought to hold the Government to
account.</div>
					<a name="08012516000453"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before I pay
tribute to you, Mr. Conway, and your co-Chairman,
Mr. Hood, I would like to add my thanks to the Officers and
the <i class="I">Official Report </i>writers for their work during the

tribute to my expert and very diligent researcher, Sam Barker, who has
been very helpful to me during the course of these

Gidley:
						</b> Carrying on from where the hon. Member for
Eddisbury left off, I would like to thank you, Mr. Conway,
and your co-Chairman, Mr. Hood, for your light-touch
chairmanship. We had slightly fractious moments this morning, but
Mr. Hood dealt with them admirably and kept us on track so
that we can all get home to our families this evening.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column536" />Column number: 536</div>
					<a name="08012516000456"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to thank the Clerks
for their great attention to detail and their support and advice, which
was always forthcoming and well given. I would like to thank the
Minister for being flexible at the beginning when we were trying to
clarify what happens in evidence sessions. We appreciate that this is
all still new and we have probably learned lessons from that. I think
it is a shame that the Minister has resisted all amendments, but I take
heart from the fact that he was sympathetic to some of them, so I hope
that we might see some Government amendments on Report.</div>
					<a name="08012516000457"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had some strange
debates on occasion. We have heard about the Minister&#146;s liking
for organic coupling, which had us all wondering. The tenor of the
debate has sometimes been characterised by a lack of hearing. We seem
to have had some confusion over whether the Minister was regarding
someone&#146;s comments as iffy or sniffy. This morning, we had a
slightly fractious moment when it was felt that an hon. Member had used
the word &#147;cheat&#148; when in fact the word
&#147;cheap&#148; had been used. I apologise if the bug that I have
had has affected people&#146;s hearing in some way, but it has
provided some lighter moments to a Bill that has been quite hard going
on occasions because of the amount of technical
detail.</div>

and your co-Chairman, Mr. Hood, for your excellent chairing
of this Committee. I would like to thank the Opposition for their
careful and close scrutiny of the Bill. The Bill will emerge better
from the scrutiny that it has received during the Committee process. I
would like to thank the Whips, who have ensured that we were all here
at the right times, my parliamentary private secretary and all other
members of the Committee for the time and dedication that they have
shown in both attending and contributing to our debates. I would also
like to thank the Clerks, Committees attendants, <i class="I">Hansard, </i>and
the police. Last, but not least, I would like to thank my excellent
officials who have served me and this Committee extremely well in
helping to provide hon. Members with very timely information so that
they have been able to debate issues rather than receiving details in
letter form later. Although, some issues have had to be delivered in
that form, my officials have done a really superb job of getting
information to the Committee in a timely and efficient
manner.</div>
