<B>Mr. Ian Bruce (South Dorset):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 534, in page 25, line 32, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`6 ( ) There shall be created a de minimis schemeto exempt very small generators and distributors from the above licensing requirements'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
In many of our earlier debates, the Minister said that de minimis relationships were covered. A strict de minimis provision in a full licence could help where a person was doing experimental work and dealing with the supply of electricity in a small way, as nobody would require them to go through a long, costly licensing procedure. Moreover, the de minimis provision in the amendment would enable those who were applying for a licence before their business had got into full flow—every business tends to start small and build up—to start up. While negotiations for a full licence were taking place, the de minimis requirements would perhaps not be exceeded. Therefore the provision would be an easy inward route for those who apply for a licence later.

<P>
I have described how, when I was in business, the licensing regulations for employment agencies allowed me to stop other people starting such a business. That was very much in restraint of trade, and I am not particularly proud of it. However, if the Government provide ways of stopping somebody operating, even in a small way when they are starting up, they may not start at all. The de minimis criteria that I have suggested may be a suitable way in which to deal with such problems.

<P>
<B>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Dr. Kim Howells):</B> We fully understand the need to minimise the regulatory burden on operators, and that is our policy on the regime for exemptions. My Department is consulting on the development of the exemptions regime for distribution and, in particular, on the appropriate thresholds to qualify for exemptions and any conditions that it may be appropriate to attach. We have consulted similarly on supply and generation exemptions and are considering the responses.

<P>
As the hon. Member for South Dorset (Mr. Bruce) predicted, the amendment would be an unnecessary duplication of the exemption process, which already contains de minimis provisions. The amendment does not say what the proposed scheme would do. If the hon. Gentleman is suggesting that the groups should be outside the regulatory framework, that would be inconsistent with the new primary objective to safeguard the interests of all consumers. I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to seek to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The amendment was to some extent a probing amendment. When I read it again, it occurred to me that Ministers were more likely to make such suggestions under clause 26. I appreciated what the Minister said about further consultation, although we are always a little worried about that in this Committee. Perhaps it means that electricity provisions—or even gas provisions—will not be in the Bill at all. Let us assume that that consultation will go only part of the way. Some people outside the Committee might think that we had done an absolutely brilliant job if the entire Bill were withdrawn. However, I am sure that Committee members would like to think that our legislative procedure had not removed every Government proposal. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 531, in page 25, line 32, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`6C. The Authority will determine the licence application within 90 days from application'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
This is certainly becoming an exercise of jumping up and down. After an excellent lunch with the chairman of the BBC, which was especially laid on for me and some of my colleagues—it was probably for my birthday, but I was told that the intention was to discuss regulations—the exercise from bouncing to my feet must be good for my waistline.

<P>
The amendment is apposite. It relates to comments that I and other hon. Members have made about the time that it takes to obtain licences. The Government would agree that a timely system should operate, whereby the authority cannot simply sit on an application for months and months. Immediately after AOL's recent announcements on providing unmetered access to the internet, I received a letter from somebody in Essex who told me that he had applied to the Office of Telecommunications three years previously to offer precisely the same deal to consumers in the UK. He was still waiting for a reply. When someone wants to introduce innovation in the supply of a particular service or good to the public, the regulator should ensure that the public will not be ripped off or endangered. However, regulators often sit on applications, saying ``This is a bit novel. Let's discuss it, leave it at the bottom of a pile, and wait and wait.'' By the time that the person who had the innovative idea receives a reply, he has probably gone out of business and can no longer proceed.

<P>
The amendment proposes that the authority should deal with a licence application within 90 days. Given the pace at which industry and business want to operate, that is an absolute maximum. I hope that the Minister will indicate his willingness to accept the amendment, assuming that an even shorter time limit is not hidden elsewhere in the Bill's provisions.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I understand why the hon. Member for South Dorset tabled the amendment, but I am unable to support it.

<P>
I agree that licence applicants should be able to expect an efficient and effective service from Ofgem, and I am confident that they will receive it. To protect consumers and ensure applicant's bona fides, however, Ofgem needs to have access to a range of information about the applicant. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will be interested to know that, according to Ofgem, about half of all applicants omit important information. Therefore, an important part of the service that it offers is to talk applicants through the process, as often as several times a week in some cases. The main determinant in the time taken to reach a decision on a licence application is how long the applicant takes to correct omissions and errors.

<P>
Given Ofgem's lack of control over the process, I cannot see how it would benefit anyone—especially applicants—if an artificial and impracticable deadline were adopted. I am not saying that 90 days is more impracticable than any other time limit. However, I am convinced by Ofgem's point, and urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The Minister suggests that the authority will effectively take the view that it is the applicant's fault for not getting the application correct. I would be perfectly happy to insert ``completed'' between ``from'' and ``application'', so that the amendment would read: ``The Authority will determine the licence application within 90 days from completed application''. Local authorities are required to determine planning applications within a set period. I am afraid that I do not know exactly what it is.

<P>
<B>Mr. Norman Baker </B>(Lewes): Eight weeks.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
The intentionis that if an application is not approved within eight weeks, the applicant can go to appeal. Planning authorities have the added complication of six-weekly, or even four-weekly, meetings cycles. An eight-week period would place a real discipline on the people dealing with licence applications.

<P>
Although get-out clauses may be necessary, I honestly believe that the Minister would do everyone a favour, including the authority, if he ensured that there was a deadline. If a person did not get a licence within 90 days, he or she might be deemed to have a licence until the authority determined that he or she should not. There should be some way of forcing people take real-time decisions. It would be perfectly proper, even under the amendment, for the authority to reject an application because it had been incorrectly filled in. It could do that twice a week if it wanted to, but once it had a properly completed application, three months— thirteen weeks—would be more than adequate to determine the case. Unless that kind of pressure is placed on the authority, it could take years to sort out some cases.

<P>
This morning, I talked about MOD sites that have been vacated in my constituency, two of which the MOD sold off to private industry. A business man who wants to start a business can go to the site at Southwell, walk into an area that he thinks looks right, decide that he wants it, go straight to the director's office, sign a piece of paper for a month, three months, or whatever period he wants, and have a set of keys cut there and then. That is a great way of ensuring that businesses start up in my constituency.

<P>
The third site passed into the hands of the regional development authority. That lovely word ``authority'' gives it the statutory ability to do this, that and the other, and probably to bulldoze its way through all the necessary red tape. The site has been empty for a year—not a single person who has been queuing up to occupy it has been allowed to do so. That is what can happen when authorities are allowed to grab hold of things, delay matters and continually say that they are the monopoly providers of licences that cannot be obtained anywhere else. Parliament should require such authorities to get on with their business and conclude it in a sensible time—that is, an absolute maximum of three months.

<P>
Does the Minister believe that such matters should be deterimed sensibly? Even a period of six months or a year would act as some limitation and give a degree of certainty to licence applicants. I hope that the Minister, having heard my additional plea, will get to his feet and say, ``Yes, 14 March is the day on which I would like to give something solid to the Committee to ensure that the authority is kept under control.''

<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I can hardly not respond to such a sterling defence of all things swift, and I am keen to ensure that licence applications are dealt with quickly. I am sure that Ofgem and all Committee members will have taken heed of what the hon. Member for South Dorset said. However, I remind him that licence applications are often complex and require a good deal of to-ing and fro-ing. Setting artificial deadlines would not help.

<P>
Ofgem's job, which I am sure that it carries out assiduously, is to help applicants to deal with complexities. Its representatives will have heard this debate, or will certainly read it, and I ask that the amendment be withdrawn.
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am grateful for what the Minister has said. People should be aware of our strength of feeling, and I am sure that some Members on the Labour and Liberal Democrat Benches will join us in pressing the matter to a vote. Those who believe that official bodies should give swift replies should be able to put down a marker in this debate.

<P>
</FONT>Question accordingly negatived.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): The clause contains some commendable features. It sets out four types of licence: generation, transmission, distribution and supply. In the case of electricity, it will take away from the Secretary of State the power to grant licences and confer it on the authority only. That is consistent with the 1995 amendments to the Gas Act 1986, but I am unsure whether I am comfortable with the increasing de-democratisation of important decision making. I suppose that that is part and parcel of our times—a result of people's lack of faith in politicians. Of course, politicians have brought this on themselves. Voters feel that politicians of all parties say one thing to get elected and do the opposite when in power. That is a debate for another day, but it is an important one that will dominate politics in the next few years.

<P>
On this occasion, the Opposition do not oppose the removal of the Secretary of State's power to grant licences. In fact, we support the provisions in new subsection (2), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The same person may not be the holder of both a distribution licence and a supply licence.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As was discussed, that provision merely stipulates separate legal entities; it will not prevent the ownership of both entities by the same person. For example, they could be subsidiaries of a group of companies. The question, which we have debated and which was mooted in the Green Paper, is whether there should be complete separation of ownership. Had the Government taken that line, it would have been a mistake. There has been and will be consolidation in the industry. Provided that there are no legally created barriers to entering a market, it does not matter if there is consolidation in the industry.
 
<P>
If companies were ever to abuse their market position in a competitive environment, the Competition Commission could step in. Separate legal entities are important, to ensure that accounting is kept separate between the monopoly service of distribution and the competitive service of supply. To avoid unfair competition against new suppliers which do not have the advantage of a monopoly service behind them, it is crucial to ensure that there are no hidden subsidies from the monopoly distribution licence to the connected supply licence.

<P>
However, care needs to be taken to ensure that the issue remains an accounting one, and that, provided that a fair market price is paid as between the distributor and supplier, the combined unit can take advantage of synergies resulting from shared use of combined assets. Some clarification is still needed from the Minister following this morning's debate on the use of call centres. It is not sufficient to say that it is up to the companies themselves. We need a clearer view of the Government's intention behind the clause.

<P>
New section 6A(2) enables the authority to levy any fee that it prescribes, and ``prescribed''
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>means prescribed in regulations made by the Authority.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have a number of concerns. I know that the Minister will say that there are plenty of precendents, particularly in recent years, for regulators having the power to make statutory instruments. It is part and parcel of the point that I touched on at the beginning about de-democratisation of decision making, as more and more laws are made outside the House. However, it is not acceptable for non-elected non-parliamentarians to make regulations that carry legal force—rules in a rule book perhaps, but not statutory instruments. A regulator does not have a constituency with all the pressures of public opinion and exposure to the electorate's view; nor does a regulator have to defend his regulations to Parliament. For both those reasons it is a bad precedent for the Government to continue in the clause.

<P>
We are also concerned that the fees will be levied without recourse to Parliament. As they amount to a form of stealth taxation, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset rightly said, they should be subject to a vote in the House of Commons.

<P>
However, I am pleased about,—I disagree with my hon. Friend on this fine point—new section 6A(7), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Any sums received by the Authority under this section shall be paid into the Consolidated Fund.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is a crucial and long-standing principle of government that the body that levies the fine should not benefit from its proceeds. I know that we are talking here about a licence fee, but the principle is the same. Although I agree with my hon. Friend that, at the end of the day, it is all a form of stealth taxation, it is better for the money to be paid into the Consolidated Fund than directly into the authority's coffers. If the latter were done, it would create a perverse incentive.

<P>
Parking fines are a classic example of that perverse incentive. They were introduced to ensure that people do not park in a town or city in places where their cars would disrupt the flow of traffic. That is why we accept them. I know that this issue was introduced by the previous Conservative Government, but allowing local authorities to keep the proceeds of parking fines encourages traffic wardens to target residential areas of London at 8.31 am for the rich pickings of oversleeping Londoners, whose cars are causing no disruption to traffic, intead of patrolling major thoroughfares for the occasional illegally parked car that may be causing huge tailbacks. That is precisely what is happening in London and why Westminster council generated £100 million in parking fines last year. It becomes a revenue-earner instead of a measure to ensure that traffic flows.

<P>
Although licence fees are paid into the Consolidated Fund, which is welcome, because they are intended to recoup the authority's and the council's expenses, and it is the authority that sets that fee, there is a perverse incentive to raise fees to accommodate itself in a style and size to which it wishes to become accustomed, or which it feels to be necessary. That is the view of the gas forum—although the clause relates to electricity, the principle is the same. The forum states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Although it is accepted that these costs will be recovered through licence fees, there are no clear guidelines as to the manner in which licence holders' proportions of these costs would be calculated.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It would be helpful if the Government could give further details. The forum goes on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There is no limit on the amount of any increase, nor any restriction on the back-dating of fees.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It seeks clarification
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>as to the proportion of the costs individual licence holders will be expected to bear together with an explanation of the methodology which would be used to ascertain the proportion of these costs.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It also believes that there should be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a cap on the increases imposed on the industry,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>fees should not be capable of being backdated.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Having said that, we have had a full debate on clause 27, and I await the Minister's responses to those final points of detail.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I certainly do not want to get into an argument with my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb), who has, I am sure, read the clause much better than I have. However, the clause will empower the authority to raise money by giving out licences for people to produce electricity. As I understand the clause, it makes no provision for imposing fines for doing things incorrectly, which was the analogy that my hon. Friend used.

<P>
However, I am more concerned that the Government have just started the bidding procedure for the licenses for third generation mobile telephone services. It is an interesting auction procedure, in which we know, day by day, how much is being stacked up for the Consolidated Fund. That has nothing to do with money going back into mobile telephones, but is comparable to direct taxation. I understand that more than £1 billion has been bid so far for these licences. I suspect that people will put in even more bids at the last minute.

<P>
I am worried that the authority, which would simply aim to cover its expenses and any switching of funds from one group to another, might be told by the Chancellor, ``Hang on a minute. I have looked at the value of the shares of the utilies''—as happened just before the Labour party came into power—``and I don't like the way all this money is being collected by the utilities. Let's put a £5 billion tax on them.'' That utility tax has been paid over the past two years. We know that it exists.

<P>
I am worried that the clause could allow the Chancellor to say to the head of the authority, ``In addition to the money you need for yourselves, we need an extra £1 billion—or £5 billion—from the licence holders this year, as we have a bit of a shortfall. The war chest is likely to be emptied at the general election, so we need to raise more money.''

<P>
I am still worried that the clause does not make it clear what the money should be used for, but that the money will automatically handed over for the Chancellor of the Exchequer to use in any way he decides.

<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> First, I register the arrival of a word that is new to me: de-democratisation. It was used by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton on several occasions. I can see the hon. Member for Lewes (Mr. Baker) looking at me as though I should have heard of it. It sounds like word that was invented at the Liberal Democrats' annual conference.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Stolen by the Labour party.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> We are very good at that.

<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton gave thoughtful expression to his interpretation of the clause, which was very helpful.

<P>
I shall deal with the question of licence application fees, in so far as they tie in to the point made by the hon. Member for South Dorset about whether those fees should go into the Consolidated Fund as at present, or into a trust or be earmarked. The analogy of the revenue from parking meters suggested by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton was interesting, and it worked. One of my hon. Friends behind me muttered that, inevitably, the most effective ambushers at 8.31 am are Conservative-dominated London boroughs, and I suspect that he is right.
<P>

<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
New section 6A(7) dictates that licence application fees will be paid into the Consolidated Fund. The Treasury will not allow the authority to do more than recover its costs through fees. That is a general principle in the exercise of fee-raising provisions. The draft standard licence conditions suggest that the licensee will be informed in advance of the proportion of total licence fees that he must pay.

<P>
On the question of whether the power to make regulations should be handed over to the authority, the body responsible for deciding whether an individual is granted a licence should be able to specify the information that it requires, so that a proper decision can be reached. I am sure that the authority will consult extensively before making or amending regulations. In addition, although the regulations will not be subject to parliamentary procedure, they will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny.

<P>
I think that I have answered all the questions put to me, and I recommend that the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I want to come back on one point. The Minister says that, according to the draft standard in the Ofgem consultation document, the licensee will be informed in advance. That is right, but the document does not explain how the licensee will be billed; it merely states that the licensee will be notified in advance of the proportion to be paid. Several licence holders have raised that important point with me. It would help if the Government were to explain their licence fee allocation methodology. Will it be allocated on the basis of market share, profits or market dominance? Will a company licence holder that is a dominant player in the market get a higher market share percentage? Those are crucial questions to which we need answers. If the Minister cannot answer them now, he will have the opportunity to do so when we discuss subsequent clauses this afternoon.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I understand from Ofgem that there will be no significant differences in the new application regulations or the ways in which they will be administered, beyond the new supply and distribution licence types. In other words there will be no increase in the regulatory burden placed on applicants. The application mechanism is well understood and will not change. The regulations must be in place before commencement of the relevant clauses, so that companies will not be in breach at commencement. That does not answer the question that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton asked about the specific proportions that companies will be charged, but it suggests that we do not envisage wholesale changes to the methodology through which the new regulations will be applied.

<P>
The methodology for the licence fee proportion forms part of consultation on draft standard licence conditions, and we shall take a view when we have heard the opinions of all interested parties.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> In responding to Ofgem consultation documents, I hope that licence holders will put forward their views, because the documents discuss no differing apportionment methods on which people can express views. The message from today's debate is that licence holders need to put forward a view. I suspect that the view that most benefits every licence holder will be submitted to Ofgem, and I doubt whether we will discover the eventual conclusion of the consultation process.

<P>
A consultation process should contain firm proposals. I am reminded of the consultation process on the reform of capital gains tax, for which no proposals were put forward. The Government listened to a whole host of ideas for reform, and produced a proposal in the Finance Bill to which everybody objected. That is not the way in which one should consult. I am trying to advise the Government on how to get themselves out of difficulty, but if this bill is anything to go by, they will doubtless plunge into a new set of difficulties.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Clause 27, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 28</center></H4>
<H4><center>Enactments referring to public electricity suppliers</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 582, in page 25, line 33, leave out subsection (1) and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) References in any enactment to public electricity suppliers shall have effect after the commencement of this section as if they were references to—<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) electricity suppliers:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>( ) References in any enactment to holders of licences under section 6(2) of the 1989 Act shall have effect after the commencement of this section as if they were references to electricity suppliers.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 583, clause 28 stand part, Government amendment No. 594 and Government new clause 6.

<P>
The amendments ensure that the Bill will achieve two purposes. Amendment No. 583 withdraws the repeal of section 18 of the Electricity Act 1989 in clause 28(2), and new clause 6 repeals that section instead. It is proper to repeal section 18 in a clause in its own right because it is very important. The effect of the repeal is to abolish tariff supply.

<P>
The abolition of tariff supply is a significant change to the regulatory regime for electricity. In future all electricity supply, like gas—the previous Government put everyone on to contract in 1995 by amending the Gas Act 1986—will be governed by a contract between the customer and his supplier. That is an important contribution to the development of supply competition in the interests of consumers. It opens the way to flexibility and diversity in electricity supply and removes the statutory distinction between tariff supply by the public electricity suppliers and contract supply by all other suppliers.

<P>
The change represents a significant shift in the way in which consumer protection is secured for electricity customers and will put them on a par with gas customers. At present, for customers of public electricity suppliers only, the terms under which they receive a supply are determined by a statutory tariff and certain other statutory provision. Disputes between a customer and his supplier may be determined by the regulator. That was appropriate in the days of monopolies, but competition is now at the centre of consumer protection. Supply contracts will be subject to the full range of consumer safeguards under the law applying to contracts. Ultimately, contract disputes can be determined by the courts and the authority will continue to control suppliers' behaviour through their licences under its principal objective to protect the interests of consumers. In addition, the Bill establishes the new consumer council as an independent champion of consumer interests with a specific role to investigate consumer complaints. We believe that this is the right package of consumer protection for our future energy markets.

<P>
The second purpose of this group of amendments is to make necessary consequential changes to the drafting of the Electricity Act 1989 which result from the separation of supply and distribution and the move to a single class of electricity supply licence. Amendment No. 582 is necessary to ensure that any reference to a public electricity supplier and supply in the 1989 Act or other legislation can be read in future as a reference to supplier, supply, distributor or distribution as appropriate. It also ensures that any reference to holders of second tier supply licences—licensees other than public electricity suppliers—can be read in future as a reference to electricity suppliers as defined in the Bill.

<P>
The amendments are a consequence of the separation of supply and distribution in the Bill. The concept of public electricity suppliers will disappear and the old meaning of supply, which covered both supply and distribution as defined in the Bill, must be adapted to those two distinct concepts. In future there will be only one type of supply licence.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 583 and 594 combined will withdraw the repeal of section 22 of the 1989 Act made by clause 28(2). We now need section 22, to which the Government will table amendments to allow for connection to a distribution system on terms to be agreed between customer and distributor. This will be an alternative to connection in accordance with the procedures and requirements laid down by the Act, as amended by the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Government amendments rewrite clauses 28 and 64. Clause 28 simply changes the references to ``public electricity suppliers'' in the Electricity Act 1989 to ``electricity suppliers'' or ``electricity distributors'', acknowledging the change arising from the separation of licensing of distribution and supply, and ending the concept of the public electricity supplier, given the increased competition in supply.

<P>
The amendments do nothing to change the substance of the clause; they merely change the drafting. It is yet another example of the poor drafting in the Bill and further evidence that the whole Bill, apart from clause 56, should have been withdrawn and not simply the telecoms and water clauses.

<P>
We support the amendments because, if the Government are adamant that they do not want to withdraw and rewrite the Bill, we want to see at least a half-decent Bill on the statute book at the end of the Committee stage.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Amendment made: No. 583, in page 25, line 45, leave out subsection (2).—[Dr. Howells.]

<P>
The Chairman, being of the opinion that the principle of the clause and any matters arising thereon had been adequately discussed in the course on debate on the amendment proposed thereto, forthwith put the Question, pursuant to Standing Order No. 68 (Debate on Clause or Schedule standing part), That the clause stand part of the Bill:-

<P>
Question accordingly agreed to.

<P>
Clause 28, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 64</center></H4>
<H4><center>Gas transporters</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 584, in page 63, line 37, leave out from ``accordingly'' to end of line 4 on page 64 and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`section 7 is amended as follows.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>( ) In subsection (1), for ``public gas transporter'' (the expression defined in that subsection) there is substituted ``gas transporter''.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>( ) In paragraph (a) of subsection (2), for the words from ``so much of'' to the ``and'' preceding paragraph (b), there is substituted ``any area specified in the licence as it has effect for the time being;''.

<P>
( ) After subsection (4) there is inserted—

<P>
``(4A) The Authority may, with the consent of the licence holder, direct that any licence under this section shall have effect as if any area or pipe-line system specified in the direction were not specified in the licence; and references in this Part to, or to the grant of, a restriction under this section, or a restriction of such a licence, shall be construed as references to, or to the giving of, such a direction.''

<P>
( ) In subsections (5) and (6) the words ``or extension'', in each place where they appear and, in subsection (5), the words ``or, in the case of an extension, such shorter time as may be prescribed'' shall cease to have effect.

<P>
( ) Subsections (7) and (8) shall cease to have effect.'.

<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 591 and 592.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Amendment No. 584 makes a number of changes to the clause. As this is quite a technical area, I want first to explain briefly the purpose of the clause.

<P>
I shall explain one piece of jargon. Current legislation refers to public gas transporters or PGTs. The word ``public'' is not appropriate in a competitive market with a number of players, so the clause changes the term to ``gas transporters''. Nevertheless, PGT is useful shorthand, so I hope that the Committee will forgive me if I continue to use it until we have debated the amendment.

<P>
Gas transporters are licensed to operate only within the area specified in their licence—their authorised area. At present any given place can be within the authorised area of only one transporter at any given time. This is sometimes called the geographic exclusivity of transporter licences.

<P>
If a transporter's licence includes an area that does not contain gas pipelines and a second transporter wins a contract to lay pipes and use them to convey gas to premises in that area, the second transporter can ask to have the area carved out of the incumbent's licence.

<P>
This geographic exclusivity derives from section
7(2)(a) of the existing Gas Act 1986, which defines the term ``authorised area'' of a PGT in a way that depends on exclusivity. The clause introduces a new regime that allows overlapping authorised areas, so the existing definition must be changed. The clause in the original Bill provided a new definition that did not cover the case when a licence is restricted—that is, when its geographic scope is reduced at the transporter's request—so the second part of the amendment is necessary.

<P>
The third subsection in the amendment creates the ability to restrict licences. That was always part of our policy intention, but, as we said when we introduced the Bill, we could not include all the policy at that time. Restriction of licence areas has always been allowed for gas suppliers and shippers, and it is sensible to offer that here so as to increase flexibility in responding to changes in the market.

<P>
The amendment deletes subsection (2) of clause 64. The change envisaged is consequential on the rest of the clause as amended, so it fits better in schedule 5 with the other minor and consequential changes. That is the effect of amendment No. 591.

<P>
The clause is highly detailed, but I hope that I have provided sufficient context for the moment. I commend the amendment to the Committee.
<P>

<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Committees sometimes face difficulties in the task with which they are charged. We must consider legislation in great detail and must not allow it to progress without proper scrutiny. Clause 64 amends the Gas Act 1986, which most members of the Committee are not reading in conjunction with the Bill. Through the amendment, the Government are replacing that clause with a completely different clause, and we are all expected to have read the relevant provisions in conjunction with one another.

<P>
The strange term ``public gas transporter'' was no doubt created by those who drafted the 1986 Act as a term of art to refer specifically to somebody who transports gas through a pipe. Is the term ``gas transporter'' fully defined as a term of art in the Bill? If not, anybody with a pile of Calor gas canisters, or even a bottle of fizzy water, on the back of their lorry may find themselves inadvertently caught by the terminology. I suspect that ``public gas transporter'' is defined in the 1986 Act. Does the amendment transfer the definition of ``public gas transporter'' into the Bill to define ``gas transporter''?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I am glad that the hon. Gentleman did not return to his excruciatingly vile image of the mobile kebab lorries in his constituency.

<P>
This morning, we discussed the example of the exclusion of Calor gas and butane. The term is defined by section (7) of the 1986 Act, as amended by the clause. I do not know whether that answers the hon. Gentleman's question, but he has put it on the record and we have taken due notice of it. I hope that, in response, he does not mention kebab vans.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I know that the Minister prefers the fish and chip vans in my constituency, which is sensible of him. I have nothing against people who sell kebabs from vans, but I prefer fish and chips.

<P>
When some poor lawyer of a gas supplier reads the Bill, he might ask himself, ``What is a gas transporter?'' If he consulted the Gas Act 1986, he would find a reference to a public gas transporter, but other legislation has established that that Act's definition of a public gas transporter is no longer in use—reference is made only to a gas transporter. Such legislation should be consolidated, which would remove the need to make numerous amendments. That doubtless creates work for lawyers and parliamentary draftsmen. Although the Government's intentions are clear in this instance, we should not, frankly, agree to amendments whose meaning is unclear.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Clause 64, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Electricity licence conditions</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The clause will tidy up section 7 of the Electricity Act 1989, which involves including conditions in a licence to reflect the changes that will arise from the separation of distribution and supply licences. It will also have a more fundamental effect: it will insert the words ``or Secretary of State'' into subsection (3) of the section, which gives the regulatory authority—the director, according to the 1989 Act—the power to issue directions to licence holders on the contents of licences. Section 7(3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Conditions included in a licence by virtue of subsection (1)(a)''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the conditions that the regulator feels are requisite or expedient and should be included in a licence—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>may require the licence holder  to comply with any direction given by the<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
regulatory authority
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>as to such matters as are specified in the licence.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When the clause is enacted, the subsection will refer to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any direction given by the Authority or Secretary of State.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Secretary of State will add his tuppenny-worth and explain how the utility company should comply with the licence's conditions. Therein lies the difficulty.

<P>
The Minister, who is up to speed on these matters, will doubtless point out that the 1995 amendments to the Gas Act 1986 applied the same provision to the gas regulations. The Government have the commendable aim of placing both sets of regulations on an equal footing, but why do they feel that it is necessary to level down to the most interventionist set of rules for the two industries? Why do they not level up to the most permissive regulations? The industry fears that the provision will add significantly to costs, because increased numbers of people having a say about the way in which licence conditions will be interpreted will increase regulatory risks.

<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for reminding us that levelling down was introduced by the previous Government. In the interests of consistency, I point out that I do not agree that our approach involves levelling down—the Secretary of State's power will be handled responsibly, no matter who is the Secretary of State. The arrangement worked well with the gas industry, and there is no reason why it should not work well with the electricity industry.

<P>

<H4><center>Standard conditions of electricity licences</center></H4>
<P>
Amendment proposed: No. 585, in page 26, line 37, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2) The standard conditions for the purposes of licences of any type may contain provision—<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) for any standard condition included in a licence of that type not to have effect until brought into operation in such manner and in such circumstances as may be specified in or determined under the standard conditions; or

<P>
(c) for any standard condition included in such a licence which is for the time being suspended to be brought back into operation in such manner and in such circumstances as may be so specified or determined.'.—[Dr. Howells.]

<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 586.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> We would prefer to receive an explanation from the Minister of why the Government want to amend clause 30. I hope that the Minister will have had time to put his thoughts in order. It is not acceptable for the amendments to be nodded through without some form of debate or explanation.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I am willing to provide an explanation; I thought that the Opposition were prepared to nod the amendments through. That is not part of an understanding between the Government and Opposition—I just did not hear a voice.

<P>
The purpose of amendment NO. 585 is to give effect to a flexible licensing structure that will enable the regulator to tailor application of the standard licence conditions to match the circumstances of a licence holder, thereby avoiding the need for him to be subject to unnecessary or irrelevant obligations.

<P>
Hon. Members who have found time to look through the draft standard licence conditions on which we are consulting—I admit that I did not find time last weekend to do so—will see that they are arranged into groups. Those groupings relate directly to the purpose of the powers under the amendment. Each group of conditions has been designed to be relevant to a particular and well-defined group of holders of that type of licence. Under the amendment, those groups of standard conditions can be matched to licence holders in the way most appropriate to their individual circumstances. For example, instead of public electricity supply and second-tier supply licences, there will be a single supply licence.

<P>
Licence holders will include the following: those who supply industrial and commercial customers only; those who supply domestic customers; and supply businesses of the current public electricity suppliers, on whom other suppliers will continue to rely for services such as the provision of pre-payment meter infrastructures.

<P>
I am sure that the Committee will be relieved that I do not want to go into great detail. Hon. Members can look at the draft standard conditions themselves—if they do not have an allotment the size of mine. The amendment would subject all suppliers to the conditions in sections A and B of the licence. Those suppliers who serve the domestic market will also be subject to the conditions in section C, while any supplier that is the supply business of a current public electricity supplier will be subject to the conditions in section D.

<P>
All supply licences will contain all of the standard conditions. However, in any given licence, not all of the standard conditions need to operate all of the time. The flexibility offered by that approach goes one stage further, as it allows for the application of groups of conditions to change as the licence holder's circumstances change.

<P>
To give effect to the licence structure, the amendment provides that licences may include conditions that may act in two specific ways. First, a standard condition may provide that standard conditions do not have effect until they are brought into operation. The means by which the condition may be brought into operation will also be spelt out in the licence. In the case of electricity supply licences, conditions are given effect by means of a direction given by the director. Secondly, a standard condition may provide that the effect of conditions may be suspended, and that that suspension may later be reversed. Again, that will be set out in the licence.

<P>
I believe that the amendment will enable a new, flexible licence structure that will benefit licence holders to be created. It will allow them to hold full licences without imposing on them obligations inappropriate to the activities that they wish to conduct.
<P>

<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Amendment No. 586 corrects a minor technical error in the clause. Subsection (2) provides that the authority may, when granting a licence, modify the standard conditions to meet individual circumstances. Subsection (3) concerns the procedure associated with such modification, and contains nothing to which the main provision in new subsection 8A(1) should be subject. Therefore, the amendment will remove the reference to subsection (3).

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The standard licence conditions are the machinery through which the regulatory authority—Ofgem or GEMA—implements the Government's many social and environmental policy imperatives. Therefore, the clause is the key to delivering the Government's broad policy aims in the Bill. The Bill provides the broad framework and general objectives, and the powers to enable the Secretary of State and the authority to deliver on those objectives, but the licence conditions impose on utilities the legal obligations to implement them.

<P>
The Minister claims that the Bill will not amount to a revolution in the gas and electricity industries' regulatory framework. However, outside commentators who have read the Bill believe that it falls just short of re-nationalisation of the industries. It is a new form of confiscation—control by regulator. The Bill is highly interventionist and regulatory and its wording is clear, but in the short term at least, the way in which Ofgem interprets the wording will determine whether the Minister is right. The standard conditions that Ofgem proposes in its eight volumes of consultation documents—which, alas, the Minister has not had the opportunity to read—will determine whether he is right to say that the Bill will not amount to a revolution in the regulatory regime.

<P>
On page 4 of the Government's consultation document on standard licence conditions, paragraph 3.13 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Based on the standard conditions of licences, the Government is intending to develop a licence structure which would allow a greater degree of flexibility in the application of obligations imposed by the licence than is at present the case.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The tone of that paragraph is quite interventionist. Paragraph 3.14 states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the standard conditions of each licence type should be divided into a series of clearly delineated groups,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
including generation and supply. On supply, paragraph 3.14 sates that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>it is intended that there will be a group of conditions which applies to all suppliers and another group which applies only to those engaged in supply to  domestic or small  customers  Another group  applies to companies  dominant in a region.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There will also be standard licence conditions in respect of the new distribution licences that the Bill will introduce. Paragraph 3.14 states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>it is intended that there will be a group of conditions which will apply to all licensed distributors and another group which applies only to companies which are regionally dominant.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
My first concern relates to the standard conditions referred to in volume 1 of the Ofgem consultation documents. When spring is over and the Minister has planted his vegetables, he may find time to look at paragraph 3.8, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Government has indicated its intention to abolish the present capping provision on gas licence fees  the condition on payment of fees has been amended in the standard conditions to provide for the recovery of the total costs of the Authority  The condition itself does not go into detail on the methodology to be used for calculating such fees. Instead this will be provided to licensees by separate notification, in the manner set out in the licence condition.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So will the Minister spell out the broad policy for the Committee? We discussed this matter earlier in relation to another amendment, but it should not be left simply to the regulator and those responding to the consultation document. The Government should know how they intend the fees to be recovered and, in particular, whether they will be apportioned to the various licence holders on the basis of turnover, market share or a higher percentage of market share where there is a dominant player in the market.

<P>
In volume 2 of the Ofgem document on standard licence conditions, condition 48 on security deposits says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Any deposit required of a Designated Customer—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which basically means a domestic customer—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>may be 1½ times the value of the average quarterly consumption of electricity reasonably expected at the relevant premises, or more if that is reasonable in all the circumstances.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
One of my great concerns about the electricity industry in the past was its tendency to insist on high deposits from people before they could be connected to the system, a hangover from when the industry was in state control. To allow such a condition to appear in the licences is remarkable, given the Government's purported aim to help the consumer. The Government have set out a plethora of objectives for those on low incomes, pensioners and others whom they intend to help, but one way to help all those groups would be by dealing with this wretched issue of deposits. Yet the Government seem to have allowed the regulator to continue to permit the companies to ask for high deposits.

<P>
I am less concerned because I am aware that, in a competitive market, this condition will not be used by many electricity companies, but it demonstrates that the Government simply want to peddle their social and environmental agenda and have no real concern for consumers. If they had, they would insist on promoting competition, in which case we would not find licence conditions that enabled the electricity supply companies to levy huge deposits equal to one and a half times the average quarterly consumption, which can amount to sums of over £100. I am thinking particularly of the phrase,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>or more if that is reasonable in all the circumstances.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Condition 29 in volume 2 relates to a duty to supply designated customers. Will the Minister confirm that it will apply to all suppliers and that he does not intend, under the powers granted by amendment No. 584, not to apply this condition to certain suppliers? If he does, will he explain why and to which type of suppliers he does not intend the provision to apply?

<P>
Condition 21, which deals with agreements for the provision of meters says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Licensee shall not enter into an agreement with any person for the provision of an electricity meter at any premises (whatever the nature of that agreement) which is intended or is likely to restrict, distort or prevent competition in the supply of electricity.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Minister explain what condition 21 means and provide an example, because I am not clear what Ofgem has in mind with that proposal? I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset will also intervene during this debate to discuss metering in more detail.

<P>
Condition 34 in volume 3 of the Ofgem documents on standard licence conditions deals with powers to carry out street works. It is an important condition in the licences. Will the Minister explain the condition and say why it contains no requirement for street works to be co-ordinated with other utilities that want to dig up the street over a period of, say, two years? That would be a sensible requirement to prevent our streets from being dug up unnecessarily by all the utilities. However, most street works in our cities tend to relate to traffic-calming rather than to laying useful piping. Most traffic jams are caused by road works to install traffic-calming measures rather than by utilities. That is one of my hobby horses that I shall trot into the debate.

<P>
Will the Minister respond to those points, which raise important issues in the Ofgem document that the Government should have a view about?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has raised a number of issues that go well beyond amendments Nos. 585 and 586, but I shall try to reply to them.

<P>
With respect, the hon. Gentleman has misunderstood the point about having a more flexible licence. Licence obligations to individual licence holders that are not appropriate should not be applied to them. I should have thought that he would welcome that improvement.

<P>
Ofgem will consult separately on the methodology with regard to the proportional allocation of the licence fees. We discussed that point at some length earlier this afternoon.

<P>
Our intention to remove the licence fee cap in gas has been signalled clearly to the industry and others for some time. Industry is concerned that regulation should be cost-effective and that the cost should be proportionate, but it is also anxious to ensure that the regulatory offices and the Consumer Council are adequately resourced and staffed with people of the right calibre to cope with an expanding and increasingly complex workload.

<P>
The quality of regulation and of regulatory decisions must be high, and clearly a cost is attached to that. That is recognised by the industry. The problem with a rigid formula for setting a cap on licence fee increases is that it cannot flex to take account of unforeseen developments.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the ability of suppliers to charge deposits. The fact that they can impose deposits does not mean that they will. I expect competition to be a much more effective determinant on deposit ceilings than licence conditions. The hon. Gentleman also asked about the duty to supply all designated consumers. If a licensee is supplying the domestic consumer and therefore is subject to the conditions of section C of the licence, he will have to supply any domestic consumer who requests supply. I hope that that answers that important question.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Far be it from me, a Tory, to point this out, but the competition between companies is often to get rid of bad debtors on to other people. The bigger the deposit that companies require for somebody who has a bad credit record, the more likely the person is to go to another operator. I am not sure that the Minister is on solid ground when he says that competition will sort this matter out; the reverse is often true.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> That is another example of the rather Albanian tendency of the hon. Member for South Dorset. I pin my colours to the competition mast a little more firmly than he does.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I am glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell) is able to join me. Hon. Members will have seen his name on the annunciator. That shows that Liberal Democrats can be in two places at once, if we try very hard.

<P>
Amendment No. 500 is aimed at promoting renewable energy. As the Government have clearly nailed their colours to the mast in favour of renewable energy, if the Minister wishes to indicate early on that he is prepared to accept the amendment, I need not outline the arguments in its favour. Failing that, I shall proceed.

<P>
The amendment is about net metering and provides that electricity generators at a customer's location can be returned to the local distribution grid at a rate equivalent to the standard retail price, through the installation of a meter or meters that record the flow of power both in and out of electrical facilities at the customer's location. If the Government are committed to renewable energy, they should accept that radical proposal. In view of their massive programme of incinerator build, which is necessary if they are to meet the targets in the document, ``A Way with Waste'', I fear that they will concentrate predominantly on obtaining energy from waste. We shall discuss renewable energy later, but although it can be obtained from waste, I am not convinced that waste is genuinely renewable. I hope that electricity will come from genuinely renewable sources such as polar power.
<P>

<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Brian White </B>(Milton Keynes, North-East): Is the hon. Gentleman aware that the EU directive currently excludes renewables from waste?

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Yes. The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East (Mr. White) makes an extremely valuable point. We need to identify sources of renewable energy that are genuinely renewable. The amendment would give a big boost to solar power and it would encourage small-scale renewable energy generation. It would also be applicable to micro-CHP—combined heat and power—strategies when domestic-scale systems come on the market.

<P>
Solar power is the most relevant strategy for home owners who want our energy sources to be greener than they currently are. It could be used to help to achieve the Government's targets for climate change, in relation to which the Deputy Prime Minister has played a leading role. It would also give valuable support to the UK's photovoltaic industry, which does not require hot sunny climates. The 1992 ETSU study estimated that the UK could get two thirds of its electricity from solar power if all suitably oriented roofs were equipped with solar panels. This important amendment would make our energy greener, cut bills and help to meet the Government's targets.

<P>
There is an element of unfairness in the present arrangements. Householders who wish to take environmentally responsible action feel that they are being ripped off—they are charged 6p or 7p per unit of electricity that is imported but they are offered between only 2½p and 4p for each unit of electricity that is exported, which is a disincentive to the use of renewable energy. The Governemnt should deal with the problem and ensure that there is a level playing field in renewable energy—clearly there is not one at present.

<P>
The Minister may—I hope that he will not— respond by saying that the amendment could not work because it is a wacky Liberal idea.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> It is an American idea.

<P>
<B>Dr. Baker:</B> It is. The Minister makes my point for me. The approach works elsewhere, and we look to the United States for inspiration. The Government's new-found attraction to competition and their move to the right mean that they are interested in developments in the United States.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I dispute the hon. Gentleman's suggestion that being more in favour of competition means that one is moving to the right. If the left is defined as involving state control of the Stalinist variety, why is the hon. Member for South Dorset sitting on the Opposition Benches?

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> It would be unfair of me to discuss the approach of the hon. Member for South Dorset, who, the Minister suggested, was interested in Albania and Russia.

<P>
There are many varieties of competition. Competition that falls within the framework of the social market and that involves the needs of consumers is sensible. Unregulated competition, which has been advocated in certain circles, is not. We advocate the former, not the latter, approach.

<P>
In the United States, net metering is used in California and other states. Photovoltaic production increased by 20 per cent. last year, which represents one third of world production. There are strong reasons for supporting that approach. In February, the German Government agreed to a new feed-in law to help the development of PV production. The amendment will bring clear benefits to the consumer, the environment, the Government—in meeting their Kyoto targets—and the British PV industry. I am therefore at a loss as to what arguments the Minister could deploy to resist the amendment, and I await his response with interest. I hope that he will accept the amendment or, if he is unable to do so, return with a similar amendment that meets the serious point about renewable energy.

<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> I should declare at the outset that I am a long-term supporter of the CHP schemes and renewable energy. I hope to demonstrate to the Minister that net metering is not only desirable but necessary if the Government are to achieve their renewables targets.

<P>
I would emphasise that amendment No. 521 would be an enabling provision; it would not place a mandatory requirement on companies. They would have to permit net metering, but it would not be forced on them. We dealt with the granting of licences to the major players this morning. The amendment is focused not on large companies but on individual consumers who stand to benefit from its provisions.

<P>
Although I agree with much of what the hon. Member for Lewes said, there is a crucial difference between the amendment that I tabled and that of the Liberal Democrats—mine is so clear and reasonable that the Government are bound to accept it. Seriously, the real difference is that it would put a cap on the amount of profit that can be made by domestic producers. My proposal that the grid should act as a battery would not allow profit motives to rule; nor would the Liberal Democrats' amendment.

<P>
Net metering is a scheme whose time has come, as has been recognised in the United States. BT Technology estimates that net metering agreements could save the average household 30 per cent. on its bills. There is therefore a consumer reason for including them in the licence. The arrangement would not penalise distributors, because it would allow for fair and reasonable charges.

<P>
I used to be an assistant analyst promoting new systems. Six or seven years ago, the driving force behind the entire energy sector was that power stations should be big. The introduction of gas-fired combined cycle plants has reduced that tendency. The technological changes that are taking place mean that micro-CHP and photovoltaics, which the hon. Member for Lewes mentioned, are now standard in the United States. I would strongly argue that to take advantage of the new technologies, the Government should include a net metering agreement in the licence, thereby removing a barrier to new entrants to the market. Important as the environmental and social factors are, the amendment is primarily about benefiting consumers.

<P>
Under the current arrangements, the negotiations that have to take place are abyrinthine, to put it mildly, and people who attempt to discuss net metering with electricity companies face a convoluted process. When I chaired the Local Government Association planning committee, we were told horror stories about months of negotiations. The Government and the distribution companies should accept the principle of net metering, because it would simplify the process and allow the introduction of new technology and new schemes at an affordable price for households.

<P>
Micro-CHP and the other technologies are developing at a tremendous rate, with power systems of 10 KW to 50 KW regularly generating electricity. Those who say that a mass of nuclear power stations is necessary are missing the point. The United States is demonstrating that. BT Technology estimates that there are potential benefits for 4 million to 6 million households of the 13 million in this country.

<P>
Amendment No. 521 would encourage new technology and help consumers. It would allow small players into the market and remove some of the barriers. If the Government reject the principle of net metering, there will be a risk that the conditions of use will prevent new entrants coming into the market and deny benefits to consumers. A commitment from the Government on net metering is the way forward. It would benefit consumers and the environment, and enable the Government to meet their target on renewables.

<P>

<B>Mr. Andrew Stunell </B>(Hazel Grove): The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East (Mr. White) is compatible with ours and we accept much of what he said. One of our problems in Parliament is to ensure that the different strands of legislation interact to provide overall beneficial results and do not cause knock-out blows to other policies. The Bill provides a unique opportunity to lay some foundations for low-cost changes to the industry which could be of real benefit to other industries, especially the renewables industry with its potential for jobs, exports and growth, which would also benefit consumers.

<P>
At the moment, it is a major undertaking to install renewables on a domestic scale. When I visited a solar-powered building in London a few months ago I was told that, apart from the cost of installation, one of the major problems was the extra £400 that had had to be paid to the electricity company for a second meter to export power. It is a simple matter to put that right in the Bill and the amendment would do that.

<P>
I have visited the meter manufacturing companies in this country and the sites where such meters might be installed. I have talked to the producers of pilot schemes of micro-CHP. I have seen how keen the photovoltaic industry is to get started. I assure the Minister that those technologies are on the verge of an economic breakthrough and they have already gone through the technological barriers.

<P>
I understand that if the regulator was given the simple function of telling electricity supply companies to install two-way meters when domestic meters are replaced, that would be a no-net-cost choice. The cost of an electronic two-way meter with half-hour provision for monitoring electricity tariffs is no greater than the one-way electronic meter that is currently being supplied. If that is so, why are they not being installed? The current structure of the market means that there is no benefit to any electricity supplier or distributor in doing anything other than the most basic job with metering, because the consumer could switch to another company 28 days later and any investment by the previous company would be written off. It is in the regulatory environment that low-cost or nil-cost changes can be made which, in 10 years, will lay the foundation for rapid expansion of renewables. To take the analogy a little further, this is the butterfly fluttering in Hong Kong that causes the cyclone in the United States. A small regulatory change at this point can mean significant changes further down the track.

<P>
Almost 1 million electricity meters are replaced each year. The meters that are installed are a matter for regulation as well as for the market. We hope that we are providing a framework that will allow effective progress.

<P>
The amendments are foundation stones to prove the Government's credentials in the development of the renewables industry. I hope that, even if the Government cannot accept these words, they will give a commitment to take on board our underlying concerns and include them in the Bill at a later date.
<P>

<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Sawford </B>(Kettering): I do not have much to add to what has been said. The amendment gives due recognition to the many technological advances in the energy sector and aims to encourage the new developments and technological advances. My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East referred to smaller combined heat and power units, and other hon. Members have referred to solar energy generation. Perhaps the most significant advance is in the ability of fuel cells to store fuel so that it can be used later.

<P>
Most of us remember when speaking into a small, hand-held communication device was pure science fiction. When children of 10 watch films now they howl with laughter when someone pulls out a mobile phone the size of a house brick, but it was the battery that made the difference. There are so many new devices and so much more technology. Communications are much easier—perhaps, for many of us, too easy in restaurants and on trains. The change has been so rapid. Most of us had just got used to the idea of a lap-top computer when somebody turned up with a palm-top computer. How can such things be done? It is all too quick for many of us, but younger people can cope with it better.

<P>
Many of us remember when the ultimate aim in one's new home was 3 in of fibreglass in the loft and double glazing was revolutionary. Technology is moving so quickly now. We must encourage it, embrace it in the Bill and promote new approaches to energy generation and use.

<P>
I believe that the amendment is meant to be helpful, because none of us can predict where all this new technology will lead; none of us knows where we are heading. However, we must do all that we can to reduce energy demand, promote energy efficiency to benefit the environment, reduce cost, and improve competitiveness, if that is not too right wing—or should that be left wing? Yes, it is left wing.

<P>
I hope that the Minister will take these points on board. We must acknowledge the great changes in the energy markets and allow for them in the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> We have done our arithmetic and, clearly, the amendment can either be accepted by the Government or the Division on it won by those of us who believe that net metering is the correct way forward—members of the Committee are 9:8 in favour of the amendment.

<P>
The amendments are sensible, but before today's debate, we worried that not all who tabled them would turn up to speak to them. Many people may not expect Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace to see me as a natural ally, but both organisations contacted me at lunchtime because they were keen for me to ensure that the amendments were moved. I am not opposed to green policies on power, and those organisations are keen for us to introduce them. However, I worry that they will organise a march and a petition because a particular solar panel or windmill has been erected in an unsuitable place. Let us hope that we are all of one mind in considering this a sensible way forward.

<P>
I would have preferred that the amendments retain the extra ``t'' in the word ``nett'', because an agreement of this type may correctly be descirbed as a nett agreement. The second ``t'' was perhaps chopped off to fit modern English usage, but as a result, many people may think that reference is being made to the internet or fishing nets.

<P>
According to my understanding of the Greenpeace briefing, the facility is already available. The Bill contains pages and pages of regulations that deal with problems that do not exist, and about which no one has contacted us. However, in setting up the authority, the Committee is being asked to deal with a real problem. Technology exists that will enable people with solar panels, small wind turbines and so on, to sell effectively in a spot market. [
Interruption.] It is interesting to note that the Government Whip is checking where his votes are. Perhaps he should be sitting while I am standing; otherwise, I might think that he wants to intervene to ask whether we shall withdraw the amendment.

<P>
There is a real problem, and a real solution to it is being suggested. [
Interruption.] I am glad to see that the Government Whip is leaving the Room to avoid witnessing losing the vote. There are several early-day motions that have the overwhelming support of Labour hon. Members. My hon. Friend the Member for Blaby (Mr. Robathan) has campaigned alongside Liberal Democrat and Labour hon. Members to incorporate a suitable amendment. On sitting down, I hope to hear the good news that the Minister will not suffer a defeat but join the campaign.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> We have had a real debate—it is scary.

<P>
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Lewes and my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East for tabling the amendments. They address important issues, and I am grateful for the opportunity to explain the Government's approach to them. There was a flourish from the hon. Member for Lewes at the beginning—
<P>

<P>
<H5>6.9 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.
<P>

<P>
<H5>6.24 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
On resuming—

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I was about to pay tribute, probably unwisely, to the hon. Member for Lewes. He made several remarks that cut to the quick, but he also said that he had discovered the United States was liberal
in its regulation. For the most part the Americans are
not liberal, either in regulation or in innovation. In a
couple of states—the hon. Gentleman mentioned California—a good deal of innovative work is going on, but the United Kingdom is miles ahead in the liberalisation of the gas and electricity markets. I am certain that over the past decade, and certainly from now on, our regulatory system has encouraged innovation much more than the United States system has, hag-bound as it is with lawyers and litigation.

<P>
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Lewes and to my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East for tabling the amendments. They address important issues and I am glad to have the opportunity to explain the Government's approach to them.

<P>
Our approach is not the one proposed by the amendments, and I shall ask the Committee not to support them. Net metering would create a cross-subsidy from electricity consumers in general to electricity consumers who have some generation capacity for their own purposes, on a domestic or a commercial scale, and who at certain times generate more electricity than they can consume themselves. It would be a cross-subsidy because it would require suppliers to pay more for the electricity thus generated than it is worth to them.

<P>
We talked earlier about the growing season and spring. Let us suppose that I go to Sainsbury, Tesco, Waitrose or Somerfield—to a local supermarket—and I buy some lettuces. I then go back to the supermarket with my home-grown lettuces from my allotment and say, ``You've got to buy these back from me at exactly the same rate as I bought the lettuces from you.'' That is a fair analogy, and I shall try to explain why.

<P>
The supermarket would have to adjust its prices to its other customers to reflect that sale. Advocates of net metering are usually trying to achieve a mixture of two things. First, they are trying to encourage the spread of small-scale generation embedded in the distribution system, for economic and environmental reasons; secondly, they are trying to encourage small-scale generation technologies—notably solar, but also others such as wind power—for environmental reasons. Net metering could also operate in favour of combined heat and power plants.

<P>

<B>Mrs Linda Gilroy </B>(Plymouth, Sutton): Most of the arguments that were deployed in the debate arose from environmental concerns, but I draw my hon. Friend the Minister's attention to issues relating to the gas network. The localised and dispersed nature of combined heat and power application enhances the security and diversity of the load on the gas network. Has my hon. Friend fully considered those issues?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for raising that important point. I shall certainly come to it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> On the question of electricity going into the grid, the Minister will know that even nasty Tories, when setting up a situation, to encourage green energy, required the electricity companies to buy more expensive, green-generated electricity from suppliers. The amendment merely requires a quid pro quo for the electricity that is being charged at a certain price— normally it is charged throughout the day at the same price, although there are peaks and troughs in the day. Does the Minister really mean that green-generated electricity should not have a premium, or at least an equal amount of money?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I am not saying that. I tried in my own way, as a country boy, to use the lettuce-purchasing analogy so that the Committee could see where I was coming from. As my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Mrs Gilroy) said, net metering could also operate in favour of combined heat and power plants, which can be on an industrial scale.
<P>

<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
A category that has not been mentioned is embedded generation, of which CHP can be an example. The Government recognise that it is an important issue, and the Bill is designed to address it. However, we intend to use the Bill not to subsidise embedded generation, but to allow it to compete in the marketplace on its own merits. We want to create a level playing field, and the Bill does that. It separates supply and distribution, places a duty on distributors to facilitate competition in generation and develop and maintain an efficient, co-ordinated and economical system of distribution, and places a duty on the authority to promote consumer interest by promoting effective competition. That is the right statutory framework for embedded generation.

<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> If distribution companies were to prevent consumers who wished to sell surplus electricity from doing so, would they not be acting against the interests of competition and consumers?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Yes. If companies refused, for whatever reason, to take up such sales opportunities, and there was a clear customer base, the competition authorities would wish to investigate the matter.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> There are currently fewer than 10 instances of photovoltaic energy being sold on the national grid because of the complexity of the agreements that have to be negotiated. The point that the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East made was correct: given current circumstances selling such energy is more or less impossible.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Indeed. That is why we are trying to simplify the matter. The new contractual arrangements, which separate supply from transportation, will make transactions much more transparent.

<P>
The Government and the regulator recognise that further action may be required at a regulatory level to ensure that embedded generation can thrive. That is why a working group of representatives from the Government, Ofgem and the industry is examining all issues that surround embedded generation. It will report before the end of the year and the Government will address the problems that it has identified.

<P>
I turn to the promotion of particular generation technologies. That is primarily an environmental issue, and the relevant technologies are renewables and CHP. Clauses 50 to 55 introduce a completely new framework for supporting renewables generation. That is the right approach to renewables, and I look forward to debating it.

<P>
On CHP, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions is about to publish—hopefully before the end of March—the Government's strategy up to 2010. That will set out a comprehensive package of measures to support CHP.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The last time that the Minister said a White Paper was to be published, it was a signal to the Committee that the Government were about to withdraw parts of the Bill. Are we to understand that electricity and gas provisions are to be removed as well?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> No.

<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Fraser </B>(Mid-Dorset and North Poole): My hon. Friend has thrown the Minister.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Totally.

<P>
The report will address the issues thoroughly and precisely. Frankly, the amendments involve no more than an inefficient cross-subsidy which would run counter to the competitive framework for electricity that the Bill will establish.
 
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> The Minister said that the amendments' subject matter will be dealt with in the forthcoming CHP White Paper. Will it deal with micro-CHP and photovoltaic electricity generation?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The short answer is that I do not know. If it does not include those subjects, I should want to know why. I expect the whole range of technological possibilities that could be used in relation to CHP to be examined.

<P>
On amendment No. 501, I have already argued that the Bill will establish the correct framework for embedded generation and net metering. That includes clause 40, which will place the correct duties on distributors—it will facilitate competition and help to develop and maintain an efficient, co-ordinated and economical distribution system.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I hope that the Minister agrees that the amendment is important. The logic of his answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Hazel Grove was not clear. Why should the CHP White Paper deal with photovoltaic energy? They are completely different energy sources. I should be surprised if the whole gamut of renewable energy sources was in the CHP White Paper. Are not the Bill's provisions on renewable energy the only aspects on which we can hang the Government's commitment to renewables?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Photovoltaic energy will not be in the CHP White Paper, but I believe that the micro-CHP schemes will be.

<P>
The arguments are identical in relation to demand-side management, which amendment No. 501 raises. Demand-side management is an imprecise phrase. In its broad sense, we can take it to mean the process of establishing the correct economic signals and incentives on users of electricity to encourage them to adjust their demand to available supply. By no means could all that be the exclusive responsibility of distributors. All participants in the electricity market have a role to play. However, in so far as it can be identified as the responsibility of distributors, there is no sensible definition of the term that is not encompassed in the duties that clause 40 will place on distributors. In this context, the duties to facilitate competition and to develop and maintain an efficient, co-ordinated and economical distribution system are what matter.

<P>
It is simply not sensible to try to distort those important general duties on distributors by the addition of a particular item, according to the whim of a particular interest group. The Bill will introduce a framework under which all interests can be fairly balanced—that will help consumers and the economy as a whole. I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> The Minister made some interesting comments, but I am sad that he did not go further. His latter comment, that the Government do not want to pander to a special interest group, misses the point. We are concerned with fulfilling the Government's policy of reducing carbon emissions and of rapidly developing renewable energy sources in the United Kingdom.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> It ill becomes the Liberal Democrats to demean the efforts that the previous and present Governments have made to reduce CO2 emissions. We have achieved a great deal more than any other major industrial nation on earth.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> The Minister is right to say that much has been achieved—I do not suggest otherwise. However, in a previous sitting, I pointed out that that was the unintended consequence of the dash for gas. It had not been predicted or designed; it happened, and I welcome it. The Government are setting the country challenging targets, not just for 2010, but for the decades that follow. Achieving more efficient use of energy, especially in the domestic sector, will be vital. Domestic micro-embedded generation will make a substantial contribution. We are providing the Minister with a platform from which he can introduce a low-cost—even a no-cost—way of advancing that policy. I am not pleading on behalf of special interest groups. The proposal is a fundamental part of the policy that is supported by the Deputy Prime Minister, Liberal Democrats and, as I understand it, the Conservative Members on this Committee.

<P>
We are disappointed by the Minister's reply. We do not intend to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> I have enjoyed this debate. My hon. Friend the Minister made a number of points that require further discussion. He talked about cross-subsidy, and made an interesting analogy. I draw his attention to the concept of the local exchange trading scheme. I do not agree that such choice is not acceptable. Diversity and choice are important. We should recognise the scale of micro-CHP—we are not considering massive power stations; we are considering individuals and consumers who stand to benefit from such an arrangement. As the Minister said that the working group will return with proposals, I am prepared not to press my amendment to a vote. As the only person who managed to defeat the Government on the issue of vellum, it is tempting to do so, but I shall resist that temptation.

<P>
I hope that the Government recognise that barriers to competition need to be addressed from the individual consumer's point of view. To achieve renewable targets, schemes at micro-level, instead of the massive CHP scheme to which the regulator recently referred, will be necessary. The Government should recognise the scale of the problem, and the weapon that they have to achieve their agenda. As my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton pointed out, it is also a way of protecting the energy supply.

<P>
I thank my hon. Friend the Minister for the promise to return with the working group's proposals.

<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am disappointed to hear that, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman will support the amendments tabled by Liberal Democrat Members.

<P>
I studied electronics at Mid-Essex technical college, and, as a subsidiary subject, thermodynamics. The lecturer on thermodynamics was a photovoltaics specialist. He was convinced, 30 years ago, that the breakthroughs in photovoltaics were ready to be used. Although this is not a very sunny country, an enormous amount of electricity can be so generated. We have discussed the salesmen who install roof mechanisms that never seem to work properly. Government after Government say, ``Yes, we are very keen'', but nothing happens. I suspect that the amendments are not perfect, but if the Committee votes for them it will produce a worthwhile result from the Government On Report, we shall have the breakthrough that we have waited 30 years for.

<P>
Countries throughout the world use techniques and technologies for energy saving that were invented in this country. The Committee could send a signal to the Government if two Labour colleagues would put their votes where their mouths are. That would show that they are not all mouth and no delivery, and they would be heroes of the hour. The Government could return to the matter on Report and change whatever they want with their massive majority. We understand the difficulties faced by Labour Members, but they could send a signal to the Government that these policies are going somewhere.

<P>
Last Friday, the House discussed the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Bill and my hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess) received the support of the House to take it forward.
<P>

<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> A 50,000-roof programme with a 50 per cent. subsidy, as suggested by Greenpeace and others, would cost taxpayers around £250 million and generate less than one half of one tenth of 1 per cent. of the United Kingdom's current electricity demand. Is that something on which we should be spending £250 million?

<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I know that you are a generous Chairman, Mrs Roe, and you did not rule the Minister out of order, but the amendments do not call for that expenditure. People who have installed photovoltaic cells or farmers with wind generators who create energy that is wasted because it is either not used or is put into batteries, which is an inefficient way of storing electricity, could simply put it back into the grid.

<P>
Once the scheme has been kick-started and is working well, people might want to revisit it. The Government are being offered the opportunity to allow individuals who spend their own capital on their own installation to receive a beter return on that expenditure. That is good common sense. It is not the Conservative party trying to introduce a massive subsidy—even more than that we provided when in power. An early-day motion on the subject has been signed primarily by Labour Members and we are simply suggesting that, with our Liberal Democrat and Labour colleagues, we have an opportunity to put our votes where our mouths are and to do something positive. The Government could then fine-tune the amendments on Report.

<P>
The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East thought that he was receiving an assurance from the Minister, but the Minister said that it was ridiculous for a silly group of people to ask for something unreasonable. There will be no action from the Government unless the amendments are accepted.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> The Minister is a jolly fine fellow and entertains the Committee regularly with his contributions, but on this occasion he has been badly briefed. He seems not to understand the amendment if he thinks that it is a call for subsidy. As the hon. Member for South Dorset said, there is no such call. The Minister made a desperate attempt to persuade his recalcitrant Back Benchers to vote with the Government. He has failed consistently to explain the Government's position on renewable energy and what they will do under the Bill.

<P>
We have been told that subsequent clauses cover renewable energy, but they will not deliver the Government's policy on it. They rely substantially on energy from waste, which, as the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East said, is not renewable energy.

<P>
The Government have not made it clear how they will deliver on their renewable energy targets. The amendment would provide a no-cost or low-cost way in which to do so, but the Government are rejecting it. This is about power to the people—letting individuals choose what they want to do—but the Minister is determined to stop them.

<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> One problem with the amendment is that it does not cap the amount of profit that can be made by the domestic producer. Does the hon. Gentleman agree?

<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I accept that point; as the hon. Member for South Dorset said, some fine tuning may be necessary. The amendment is in line with Labour policy. It is of the type that they would want to promote, and they could fine tune it on Report. I would be happy for the Minister to say as much, but instead, he is saying, ``This is rubbish and we're not having it.''

<P>
The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East put his case eloquently, but unlike him, I heard no reassurances from the Minister that he would return to the issue at a later stage. I heard something about lettuces, which, with respect, made no sense. Were I asked to choose between a supermarket lettuce, on which a pesticide was probably used, and an allotment lettuce, which was probably organic, I would choose the latter. The Minister's analogy does not work, because the electricity is the same, but the lettuces are not.

<P>
It is a great pity that the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East will not press to a vote an amendment that most Committee members wanted to accept. The half-time bell rang for a Division in the House, and he was nobbled by the manager and persuaded not to pursue his amendment.

<P>
On an earlier clause, the Minister spoke eloquently on something called a public gas transporter. I was fascinated by that, because he clearly had great control of his brief. Our introduction of the relevant amendment was a master stroke, and I feel sure that, in years to come, hon. Members will read that speech and think, ``My God, the Minister really did understand the public gas transporter.'' However, if he thinks that an amendment such as this should be voted down, he clearly does not understand the renewable energy market.

<P>
I ask the Minister to look again at the amendment. If he will not, he should look at the underlying concept of low-cost or no-cost net metering, which is helping the consumer and the environment. He talked about a level playing field, but there is no level playing field for renewable energy in this country, and there never has been. Nuclear energy has been repeatedly subsidised and help has been given to the coal industry, but renewable energy has never received such help. That is why a pathetically low percentage of our energy comes from renewable sources. No account is taken of externalities. Renewable energy does not pollute the environment in the same way as fossil fuels and nuclear energy, but the Minister has said nothing about that.

<P>
I am not convinced that the Minister has in any way shown a commitment to renewable energy, other than in the loosest of words. Nor have I heard anything to suggest that this amendment or amendment No. 54 should not be pursued, at least in principle. Will the Minister explain how the Government will deal with renewable energy? Will they rely on energy from waste? What is wrong with the amendment? Such a provision works elsewhere in the world, and it could work here. If the Minister rejects the amendment, he will lose a golden opportunity to introduce a measure that would cost little, and which would enact Labour party policy.

<P>
Clause 30, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 31</center></H4>
<H4><center>Modification of conditions of particular licence</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 587, in page 28, line 18, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2) After subsection (4) of that section there is inserted—<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(5) The modification under this section of part of a standard condition of a licence shall not prevent any other part of the condition from continuing to be regarded as a standard condition for the purposes of this Part.''.'.
</UL></FONT>

<P>
This technical amendment would ensure that when standard conditions of a licence are modified under section 11 of the Electricity Act 1989—that is, after a licence has been granted—such part of the standard condition that remains unchanged by the modification shall continue to be regarded as a standard condition in the licence. The amendment brings the provisions of section 11 into line with the provisions of section 8A, as inserted by clause 30, which covers the modification of standard conditions at the time when the licence is granted.

<P>
Although rather technical, the amendment is important because standard conditions are to be subject to a procedure of collective licence modification under the provisions of clause 32, which we shall consider next. That procedure will not apply to any provisions of the standard conditions of an individual licence that have been modified either on granting or subsequently; nor will it apply to any part of a standard condition that is modified. It will, however, apply to any part that is not modified.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 588, in page 30, leave out lines 6 to 9 and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``relevant licence holder'', in relation to proposed modifications of standard conditions of licences of any type, means the holder of a licence of that type—<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) which is to be modified under the proposals by the inclusion of any new standard condition; or

<P>
(b) which includes any standard conditions to which the proposals relate, other than standard conditions which are not in effect (by virtue of standard conditions under section 30(2) of the Utilities Act 2000) at the time specified in the notice under subsection (3).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment limits the constituency of licence holders who are entitled to register their objection to a proposed collective licence modification under the procedures set out in the clause. By altering the definition of relevant licence holder in subsection 10, the amendment would ensure that, in most cases, only those with a real interest in the proposed modification can have their opposition counted in the numerical tests provided for in section 11A(6) and (7).

<P>
Collective licence modification may result in one or more of three outcomes—changes to existing conditions, removal of existing conditions or the creation of new conditions. The amendment would ensure that, where existing conditions are to be changed or removed, holders of the relevant type of licence can vote on the change only if the conditions being modified are operative in their licence. Thus, only licence holders with an immediate and direct interest in the proposed modification have a chance to vote on it. That seems to me to be right.

<P>
Where the modification takes the form of a new condition, however, all licence holders of the relevant type will have the right to have their objections counted in determining the amount of opposition to the proposed change. It is right that, where the authority proposes to introduce new standard conditions into a licence, the holders of that type of licence should have their say and have their vote counted.

<P>
The inclusion of a new condition is more likely to extend the scope of the licence and raise bigger issues of principle for those whose licences it will affect immediately and those who may be thinking in the longer term of having inoperative conditions in their licences switched on.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The clause will give the regulatory authority new powers to modify standard licence conditions, and it will provide a way in which to force companies to take steps that they had not envisaged taking when they first entered into the licence agreement—they may still object to the licence modifications.

<P>
The first key change that the clause will introduce is in subsection (6), which makes it clear that silence constitutes assent to a licence modification proposal. Previously, silence was regarded as constituting opposition to a modification to a licence condition. The previous regime involved a safer structure—a heavy onus was involved, which ensured that licence holders were aware of the proposed changes. They were not deemed to be aware of such changes. When people's rights are being changed, it is important to place the onus on the body that seeks to change the rights. I strongly object to the concept that silence constitutes assent, especially when Governments are involved.
<P>

<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. White:</B> If that is the case, why did the previous Government' policy on housing transfers require that if one did not vote, one was assumed to have voted in favour of a transfer?

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> That is slightly beyond the Bill's scopes. I do not recall that was the case with housing action trusts—I was an activist in Tower Hamlets and I worked hard to get people to vote in that regard.

<P>
The second major proposal in the clause is to reduce the size of blocking minorities. Currently, the relevant figure is 10 per cent., which means that 90 per cent. of licence holders—however that is measured—have to agree before a modification can take effect without reference to the Competition Commission. The proposal is to raise the figure to about 20 per cent. The consultation document contains a different set of figures, depending on the type of licence that is involved. Blocking minorities may involve 12 per cent. or 22 per cent. of licence holders. Clearly, 22 per cent. and 25 per cent. are too high and we should revert to the figures that were used previously.

<P>
The third issue relates to subsection (8), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This subsection applies where the Authority is satisfied that  (a) the effect of the standard conditions is such as to impose a burden affecting relevant licence holders  (b) the modifications would remove or reduce the burden  (c) the modifications are such that no holder of a licence of the type in question would be unduly disadvantaged.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That will ensure that the agreement is passed without securing the agreement of the licence holders, referring to the Competition Commission or giving any consideration to the blocking minority. A whole quantum of licence holders might oppose the modification but, according to the subsection, the agreement would be passed because the provisions would be treated as a deregulating clause. That is fine if a deregulatory clause really is involved, but who decides whether
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the modifications would remove or replace the burden?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Deciding whether the burden has been reduced is a subjective decision. The Government claim that the whole Bill will reduce the burden of regulation, but that is utter nonsense. Anyone who has read the Bill knows that that is not true. The Government could propose amendments to licence conditions that they claim, with forked tongue, will reduce the burdens on businesses.

<P>
Who will decide whether an amendment involves a reduction? When the matter is put out for consultation, it would be useful if the regulator produced a cost-benefit analysis of any modification that he proposes to impose on licence holders. In many cases, the judgment will be balanced, but I hope that someone will calculate whether the costs of the modification are outweighed by the benefits that will be derived from the new conditions.

<P>
Will the Minister confirm that the Government will consult on standard conditions and modifications before making a decision? The fair regulation campaign, which was set up by the Confederation of British Industry and other business groups, has accused the Government of failing to scrap regulations and make proper assessments that would save industry
£3.5 billion immediately, with continued savings of
 £1 billion a year. An article in the Financial Times states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The report casts doubt on the effectiveness of efforts by the prime minister and Stephen Byers  to control the regulatory burden.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The campaign—which the Cabinet Office said was complementary to the work of the regulatory impact unit—has made a serious allegation about the Government's conduct with regard to the Bill. The Financial Times article states that the campaign's report alleges that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The DTI consulted on the costs associated with its utilities bill after publishing a white paper, instead of before, and the assessment merely ``sought to justify decisions to which ministers had already publicly committed themselves''.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
There we have it. The Government hear without listening, as Simon and Garfunkel would say. It is important that they listen and consult before coming up with proposals. On that note, I await the Minister's response.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I hope that before we reach the end of the Committee's proceedings, the hon. Gentleman will dispel my image of him as a student, sitting in his room, strumming his guitar and listening to Simon and Garfunkel.

<P>
I shall deal first with the issue of silence equalling assent. In the gas supply industry, where competition is developing and the number of licence holders is consequently rising, it is becoming increasingly difficult to gain the necessary support for licence modification. That is because many licensees do not respond to notices that they are sent by the regulator. Like people, firms tend to act when they object to something, but do nothing when they are reasonably happy. In current circumstances, a firm's decision to do nothing because it is happy would result in its effectively voting against a proposal that could be in its interests. It is fair to ask firms to give the regulator a better basis for assessing the level of opposition to his proposals by requiring them to register their objections to the proposal if they wish to influence the outcome. If, as a result, firms scrutinise proposals more closely, that will be no bad thing.

<P>
On the question of blocking minorities, licence holders will have recourse to the courts to seek judicial review if they are concerned about, for example, the manner in which a consultation has been conducted. An appeals process on the merits of the proposed modification in circumstances in which no blocking minority exists would completely undermine the original purpose of collective licence modifications. It would amount to no more than the existing arrangements for modifying licences individually, whereby any licence holder can force the matter to the Competition Commission, delaying changes by several months or longer.

<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton asked how ``modification'' could mean creating a new condition.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Subsection (6)(c) states that ``subsection (8) applies''. That means that if the condition removes or reduces the burden, it can be put through without any agreement from the licence holders.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> With respect, that makes perfect sense.

<P>
I shall deal with the hon. Gentleman's question about size of blocking minorities. The figures quoted are from a consultation paper that we recently published. The hon. Gentleman was right to raise the matter. We recognise that it is important to get the balance right, which is why we are consulting on the matter. Ultimately, Parliament will have to approve the relevant order.

<P>
The authority will decide whether a proposed modification reduces or removes a burden. However, if, when consulted, everyone told the authority that the measure was not purely deregulatory, and the authority went ahead none the less, that would constitute grounds for a judicial review. Licence holders can seek a judicial review anyway. I hope that that clarifies the matter for the hon. Gentleman.

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> That was a partially successful answer. I still contend that the Government should not regard the sound of silence—an allusion to Simon and Garfunkel, which most Committee members seem to have missed—as assent. It is wrong in principle, regardless of the extra burdens imposed on the Department and the authority.

<P>
I accept the Minister's point that the Government are only consulting on blocking minorities. Ultimately, a statutory instrument will be introduced. I hope that the industry will make its views clear on the reduction in the blocking minority. On the authority's judgment on whether modification constitutes a reduction in burdens, the Minister said that if licence holders had told the authority that it did not amount to a reduction in the burden, and the authority proceeded anyway, there would be grounds for a judicial review. However, it is very difficult and expensive for companies to pursue a judicial review, as the grounds are restricted to an authority taking action without a reasonable basis.
