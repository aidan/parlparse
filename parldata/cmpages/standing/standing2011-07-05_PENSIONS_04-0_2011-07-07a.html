Bill, it might be helpful to remind all members of the Committee about
the rules of debate in Committee. Debates on amendments, or groups of
amendments, should focus specifically on the purpose, content and
impact of those amendments. Clause stand part debates allow for a
debate on the specific content of the clause. Interventions should be
specifically relevant to the question before the Committee at any one
time, and hon. Members should avoid unnecessary repetition of points
that have already been made. As far as possible, speeches should not be
read out, and the reading of quotes and statistics should be limited to
the minimum required to support the Member’s
argument.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000017">&#160;</a>

responding to a rare intervention from the Government Benches by the
hon. Member for High Peak. It was about health and safety, and whether
legislation has helped to reduce inequalities by socio-economic group.
I hope that some health and safety measures do make a difference, but
as we have seen from statistics shown to the Committee earlier,
different socio-economic groups continue to show marked differences in
both healthy life expectancy and life expectancy. The hon. Gentleman
will know from his constituency that there is a difference between
people who are involved in manufacturing and heavy industry and those
who work in office-based jobs, and the toll that their working lives
take on their health. I hope, as I am sure he does, that health and
safety legislation has made some difference to reducing those
inequalities.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000020">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> My constituency of Leeds West was built on
engineering and woollen mills. Although much of that industry no longer
exists, there are still many people coming up to retirement who have
done physically demanding jobs throughout their lives. It is inevitable
that that will put a strain on their health, as reflected in the
healthy life expectancy and life expectancy numbers that
persist.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000022">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The Minister
will know that in his local authority, life expectancy is 79.8 years
for men and 83.6 years for women. I am sorry to tell my hon. Friend the
Member for Nottingham South that out of all constituencies represented
on the Committee, men and women in her constituency have the lowest
life expectancy. An average man in Nottingham is expected to live for
75.1 years, compared with 80.1 years for women. I recognise that we
have been asked to keep statistics to a minimum, but there are great
differences in life expectancies in our constituencies. In West
Worcestershire, for example, men are expected to live until they are
79.2 years old, and women until they are 83.2 years
old.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000023">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I am suggesting what is in the amendment: we
should look at all relevant factors and at the number of years over
which people have contributed into the system. For example, if somebody
has worked since they were 15 or 16 and paid into the system for 50 or
51 years, would it be right for them to receive their state
pension a little earlier?<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000025">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As the hon.
Member for Arfon will know, in his constituency, life expectancy is
77.3 years for men and 81.9 for women, perhaps reflecting the
industrial nature of jobs there. Members will know the figures for
their constituency, so I will not read them all out, but if anyone is
particularly interested, they might intervene and I wait in
anticipation.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000026">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendment is a useful tool for analysing questions of differential life
expectancy by socio-economic group and years in the labour market. When
the current system was created in 1908 and built on in the 1940s,
healthy life expectancy was not a measure against which the system
could be built. We can now measure the differences in life expectancy
between areas and income groups and, theoretically, make accommodations
for them. For all the reasons I have set out, we should be looking at
the problems that the amendment highlights. At least we now better
understand the challenges our constituents face, particularly those
from lower socio-economic groups and those who started working as
teenagers.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000027">&#160;</a>

carers, health issues, differing life expectancies—which we have
dealt with today—women, and the effect of age discrimination.
This was in direct response to the recent Green Paper, and I hope the
Government will look at the amendment in that review, if not as part of
this
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000029">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
I argued on Tuesday, the way to do that is to build consensus around
what needs to be done, to work out solutions in the long-term interests
of people looking towards retirement in the future—whether in
Kensington or in Glasgow; whether behind a desk or in a manual
job—that introduce stability to the system and certainty for the
individual, and also recognise the contributions that people make. I
thank my right hon. Friend the Member for Croydon North for tabling
this amendment. As I have said, we have all seen the changing pattern
of working lives and differential opportunities and experiences in our
families and in our constituencies, let alone between cities, regions
and across the country. The distribution among socio-economic groups
and geographical areas of life expectancy and healthy life expectancy
bears witness to these changes. The amendment is an interesting
mechanism by which we can deal with the issue. I look forward to
hearing the views from the Government Benches on
it.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000030">&#160;</a>

in charge of the Family Policy Studies Centre. His formative years in
social policy were in the 1980s, before he came to this House, and that
may have shaped the amendment. Many of the points he raises were
particularly pertinent in the 1980s and I want to respond to some of
them, in a positive way.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000031">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The issues
raised by Opposition Members are important and significant.
They have identified differences between social classes, regions and
genders. Even on that short list, we start to see the problem with
using the blunt instrument of the single figure of the state pension
age as a solution to a whole range of very diverse problems. The issues
of health and safety, emphysema, workplaces, and Welsh mining villages
have been mentioned. One of the fascinating things about pensions is
that someone’s pension story is their life story. Trying to deal
with all the things that were unjust and unfair about it in a single
age is quite a challenge, but it is a noble attempt, and I want to
respond constructively to the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000032">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
are a lot of issues about trying to rewrite history and identify past
injustice and put it right now. In principle, if we wanted to tackle
the issue the right hon. Gentleman raises, would it be possible to do
it from now going forward? We have just produced a Green Paper called
“A state pension for the 21st century”, and if this was
going to be a feature of the state pension system going forward, how
would we design from scratch the issues that the right hon. Gentleman
raises? There are formidable barriers to doing it retrospectively, but
could we even do it prospectively?<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000033">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Clearly one
could now identify particularly heavy manual occupations. It is
interesting that we have heard a lot of different points, such as
“low-paid”. But pension provision for the low-paid is a
different issue from that of people who do heavy manual work. We heard
“monotonous”. One cannot imagine a separate national
insurance regime for monotonous jobs, although there were times today
when I wondered if we should introduce one. The right hon. Gentleman is
right to say that some people who work incredibly hard and do heavy
physical labour might not reach the state pension age. That is changing
quite dramatically, but they may not get a pension for very long. That
is the fundamental point that he wants to address.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000034">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We could, in
principle, have different national insurance rates for different
occupations. We could identify categories of heavy manual work or
whatever, but then there would be a question of whether a person has
spent their whole life doing heavy manual work or a minimum number of
years. What if they worked in mining, for example, but as a clerical
worker? Would someone have to take each individual job and categorise
it according to whether it would lead to a lower life
expectancy?<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000035">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">These
things are all possible, but create all sorts of anomalies. One can
imagine doing a heavy manual job in what was fundamentally an
administrative sector. There is a danger of radically complicating the
system. I usually say that Oppositions demand simplicity and
Governments legislate for complexity. Actually, this Government are
trying to legislate for simplicity in pensions—a simple, single
flat-rate state pension and common state pension ages—and these
amendments would potentially create great
complexity.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000036">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let
us pursue the idea and suppose we could look ahead. The hon. Member for
Erith and Thamesmead made a good point about the private pensions
sector, where the issues that the right hon. Gentleman raises are being
addressed through impaired annuities. We are going into a world where
pension provision will increasingly be on a defined contribution basis,
which people will turn into an annuity. If we can get the annuity
market to work properly—we are getting there slowly, though
there is more to be done—the pensions of people who have had the
sorts of lives that have been described will be bigger precisely
because of that.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000037">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Annuity
providers, as the hon. Lady rightly said, can go down to postcode
sectors and can consider all manner of life histories. They can do
health checks if they want to. So strangely enough, in the world we are
going into, the pension system of the non-state sector will be more
sensitive to the important points that the right hon. Gentleman raises
than in the past. I welcome that, and we need to do more to ensure
take-up of impaired life annuities. It is the one time when filling in
a medical form that people should really make sure that they say that
they smoke, because we need to make sure that people get what they are
entitled to. That is a positive thing and I think it will help. We
understand from the Association of British Insurers that only around
10% of those potentially qualifying for this sort of annuity actually
take one up. There is huge potential to do more prospectively for
people who have had this sort of life history. That is the first thing
to
say.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000038">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">One
of the issues about using that within the national insurance system is
about drawing lines and categorising people. If we started today, we
would be a generation 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 123<a class="bkMark" name="Column123">&#160;</a>
                  </div>away from making a real impact. I am gently teasing about a solution for
the 1980s, but there is an issue about whether this solves a problem
that is fundamentally about the past rather than the future. Clearly
people are still coming through with these life histories, but take the
coal mining industry as an example: in 1978 there were 420,000 people
in coal mining; today there are 52,000. If we defined categories of
people who qualified for enhanced national insurance, the numbers
affected are dropping
dramatically.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000039">&#160;</a>

Presumably, as time goes by, we would be constantly re-categorising new
professions as they emerged and became more significant, and qualified
for enhanced NI under the scheme as another dropped out. I hope that
the right hon. Gentleman is beginning to see that the complexity of
trying to identify ex ante the sort of jobs that will lead to shorter
life expectancy. Essentially, his thesis is that people who have long
and back-breaking working lives will have shorter pensions, and that is
not fair, but the correlation between the length of their national
insurance record and their life expectancy is sophisticated and
complex, and does not neatly match
occupations.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000043">&#160;</a>

forward, but I am also all for going backwards. Presumably he will

people have worked or been in the labour market caring for their

if someone went into a manual industry at 16, and had the opportunity
to do an apprenticeship or to go on to university and ended up doing a

records—I will come to how dodgy they are—to match past
NI to occupation, and in broad occupational categories there would be
different sorts of jobs, which are varyingly low paid or not,
back-breaking or not, monotonous or not. It would be hard to draw the

               <p class="tabbed">The
right hon. Gentleman asked me to focus on whether we could today
specify whether people had had a lifetime of injustice and to put it
right now. The starting point is that national insurance records were
not set up with that in mind, and they were not linked to occupations.
In the mid-1970s, as I am sure the right hon. Gentleman knows from his
time in my role, there was a big national insurance computer shift to
the new system. The pre-’75 records are held principally in
paper form. A one-figure summary is held, which essentially tells us
the number of weeks of contributions people made before 1975. That
might say 260 weeks, which could be five years at 52, or 10 years at
26—we do not know. I cannot envisage that he is really
suggesting that 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 125<a class="bkMark" name="Column125">&#160;</a>
                  </div>we go back to the paper records and try to re-enter them. Therefore,
there is a profound issue, which I would not say is insurmountable,

more profound issue about the pre-’78 situation, relating to
women. Home responsibilities protection to protect the rights of
women—and men, but principally women at home with
children—was brought in from ’78. Post ’78, we
sort of know, even though there was a complete computer mess, which
women were at home with children. The hon. Member for Islwyn mentioned

her a birthday card. The serious point is that, if we take the example
of the hon. Gentleman’s mother, we do not know that she was at
home—assuming she was—with him in 1977, 1976 and 1975. It
is a blank. So, as far as we are concerned, that is a year when she was
not working or doing anything. If we applied the amendment that he is
supporting, for 49 years or a full working life, his mother would not
qualify. A problem with the amendment is that, although the hon. Member
for Nottingham South said that women get a raw deal out of pensions,
and I entirely agree with her, the amendment is pro-men. Partly because
of the ’78 coming of HRP, it would do more for men than for
women. That is not necessarily a bad thing, I suppose, but I do not
think that that is the basis on
which—<em>[</em>
                  <em>Interruption.</em>

is an important issue, because if we are talking about past injustice,
for us to now go back and say that time at home with the kids
pre-’78 does not help but time in a paid job matters, that
almost adds insult to
injury.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000056">&#160;</a>

been born in 1959 and would be close to retirement now. The problem

age at which people who have not yet retired retire, is perhaps not
quite as significant as

earlier and women born 61 years earlier, in 1951. In 1975, those women
would have been 24 when we switched over to the new computer, so there
are perhaps six or seven years when we did not have very good data.
More to the point, if they were born in 1951 they would have
had 27 years in which to have children, be at home with them and be
penalised by the amendment. I did not start with the nitty-gritty of

records, and I have not consulted Her Majesty’s Revenue and
Customs at length on this point—my suspicion is that
pre-’75 income tax records, if they exist at all, are on
parchment and I very much doubt that they would be useful as a basis
for this.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000059">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">He mentioned
employment records in a sort of vague sense, but I do not know what
they are. Of course, one problem is that we need to be systematic. We
have to do this fairly for everybody. We cannot just use data sources
that we have for some people. We have to be systematic and we need data
sources that we can apply without going to back to clerical records.
Much as I would like to be able to think of practical ways around those
problems, I cannot see what they are and that is why I started by
thinking about whether we could do it
prospectively.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000060">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The Minister is making a thoughtful and detailed
speech that I very much welcome, and I thank him for that. Just to
clarify, I was not thinking about occupational groups. Obviously, a lot
of the stuff that we have been talking about relates to heavy manual
work that hurts people’s backs and knees and so on. I was simply
arguing that if it could be proven that someone had been working since
15 or 16—even if it was in a white-collar job, which can be
stressful—they should be part of, as it were, my grand
design.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000061">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On
the more substantive point about women, I understand the issues, but I
would argue that someone could complete a proper application form that
detailed their life story generally. When they started work can be
proved through national insurance records; they then had children,
family allowance and child benefit. If someone could put in what looks
to be an authoritative application, it should be
accepted.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000062">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> A whole can of worms is raised by that. From a
sedentary position, the hon. Member for Leeds West mentioned child
benefit, but pre-’78 it was family allowance not payable for the
first child in the family, so even if we had the records from back
then—we don’t—we would not know about the first
child. That is just one of the issues.

                  </strong> Yes, but of course a birth certificate does not tell
us whether the parent was at home with the child. It simply tells us
the child existed. Unfortunately, the right hon. Gentleman needs more
than that. There are inconsistencies in his argument. His argument for
paying pensions early for people who have 49 years of contributions is
that they have probably come from 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 127<a class="bkMark" name="Column127">&#160;</a>
                  </div>lower social classes and will die younger, but then he says that he does
not want to do it on occupation but on NI, and somebody who has spent
their life doing an undemanding clerical task just gets a windfall. One
of the themes in this Committee is that all the windfalls are paid for
by
somebody.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000067">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
official has very kindly come up with a figure for the cost of the
right hon. Gentleman’s proposal. I have to say the odd caveat is
attached to this number. However, let us say that I am going to round
it to the nearest £10 billion—it is £10
billion, at a stretch, in the time scale of this Bill, to bring such
pension rights forward. Before the right hon. Gentleman intervenes and
asks how I can know that because I have just said that it cannot be
done, we have had to make some heroic assumptions about how it might be
done. My point is that we are talking serious money. And who has to pay
that money? Everyone who pays NI, including—guess
who?—people doing boring, monotonous, low-paid manual jobs, so
there is a complicated distributional impact to what he proposes, which
needs to be factored
in.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000068">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Another
observation came up during the debate. To some extent, shorter life
expectancy at pension age is exogenous; it is environmental or genetic,
or a life of back-breaking toil. But a bit of it might be lifestyle
choice. For example, the hon. Member for Nottingham South mentioned
smoking because of a cigarette factory in her constituency. I am not
specifically referring to that, because that is a very particular case.
However, in general, if people have shorter life expectancies because
they have chosen to smoke, should we pay them a state pension earlier
to make up for that? It is a difficult question to ask, but it is a
factor. We know that smoking rates have declined dramatically, which is
welcome in terms of life expectancy. That is partly why the life
expectancy of what we call the lower social classes has improved. Less
smoking and less coronary heart disease is part of the story. Whether
we should factor that into the state pension age raises
questions.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000069">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> There is a whole raft of quite proper compensation
for health and safety at work. That is right. We identified a group in
which we could say that all of that group were deserving of
compensation. The difference is that the amendment would lump together
folk who did a back-breaking 49 years of toil and lived a blameless
life with folk who did an office-based job who will probably live to
100. As soon as we say that it is not fair and that we cannot help the
group that we want to help specifically, there will be a blunderbuss
approach to the whole category. Another set of people will say that the
system is not fair to them because they worked for 48 years, not 49
years, or worked in a fairly demanding but not very demanding job. None
of those problems is fatal but, put together, they give us pause for
thought on the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000071">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
want to make a couple of other observations, given that there are a lot
of other issues that we want to get through this afternoon. Let us
consider the extent to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 128<a class="bkMark" name="Column128">&#160;</a>
                  </div>which the historic statistics that have been quoted do not wholly tell
us what will happen in the future. Many figures that have been quoted
are described as period life expectancies, and are generally those
figures in the right hon. Gentleman’s report. They do not take
account of what we already know about the improving life expectancies
of the people coming
through.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000072">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is often said in stock market adverts that past performance is not a
good guide to the future, and the same applies to life expectancy. Some
of the figures probably understate the extent to which folk in the
lower socio-economic groups will have a longer life and a longer state
pension than history suggests, because of the continuing improvements.
I have a long table for seven social classes, six periods for men and
for women, but I will not read it out—tempted though I am to do
so. I do not want to minimise the issue of inequalities, but I want to
give the right hon. Gentleman some flavour. He referred to 19% of men
in social class 7 dying before the age of 65, but that period data does
not take account of projected
improvements.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000073">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">For
example, if we took the chance of a man aged 25 today dying
before the age of 65 and used the period measure, we would get 13%
risk, but if we used the cohort measure that takes account of
improvements, we would get a 9% risk. So these things are improving. It
would be an overstatement to say that we are solving yesterday’s
problem, because it is clearly still a problem. I take that point but,
to give an idea of the scale of the problem, it is worth using the
cohort measures wherever
possible.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000074">&#160;</a>

the Minister let members of the Committee have copies of some of the
tables to which he is referring? It would be helpful. I think he is
saying that the routine class, on the measure that we are discussing,
would be 9%. Has he the equivalent figure for social class I—the
professionals?<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000075">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> We are back in the lecture theatre, I think. There
have been improvements across the social scale and although over, say,
20 years, those have been distributed unevenly and have hit more of the
top than the bottom, the opposite is true in respect of the most recent
figures.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000078">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
will give an example. Let us consider the period from 1997 to 2002 to
2002 to 2006—the latest five years against five years period.
Life expectancy at 65 for men in the routine class rose the second
fastest of all groups in the last five years—1.3 years compared
with 0.7 years for men in the higher professional class. To give the
ONS perspective, it says:<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000079">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“While
this only represents a return to the inequality of the 1990s, it does
appear to be a change from the earlier trend…It is dangerous to
attach too much significance to the figures of a single period, but
these results are consistent with the hypothesis that inequalities were
no longer rising for males in the early 2000s, as they had done up to
1997-2001.”<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000384">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p>All I can say from those
figures is that the situation is not static. The danger is that we
hardwire into the state pension system something that reflects
manufacturing industry in the ’70s and ‘80s and, before
we know it, we have hardwired in something that does not mirror the
current
situation.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000080">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have one other observation, because there is a tendency to choose the
top and bottom social classes. When we use the five categories, as the
right hon. Gentleman did occasionally, mentally we assume that those
five classes are of equal size, but actually the top and the bottom
together are less than 10% of the entire population. It might be
assumed that vast numbers of people at the bottom are falling behind
vast numbers of people at the top, when actually most people are in the
middle. The differences in general are not as big as we might have
thought from the
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000081">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
right hon. Gentleman has given us a lot of food for thought, and we are
all grateful to him for that, as we are for the other contributions to
the debate, to which I tried to respond as I went along. For the
reasons that I have explained, I do not think that the right hon.
Gentleman’s proposition or anything like it is practical going
backwards, and it would raise some profound issues going forward. I
took the amendment to be a probing amendment, and I imagine that he
will withdraw it. However, I am more than happy to continue the
dialogue with him in a constructive
way.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000082">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I thank the Minister for taking the proposal
seriously. Over the years he has gained a great reputation for going
into great detail as well as using a philosophical framework. From role
reversal with him, I know that he can pick arguments apart—not
always successfully, but with great aplomb. I suppose I had rather
hoped that he would use those very fine skills—I am not being
cynical—to find a solution for me that was even more perfect
administratively than my proposal, but he has been unable to do so.
Before commenting on his speech, I shall reflect on those of my
colleagues.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000083">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We started
well today with the speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh
East, who reflected on lower life expectancy in parts of Scotland. I
think she mentioned Inverclyde in light of recent experience there. To
my surprise, she mentioned the Western Isles, which I have visited.
They are beautiful islands, but they are cold in winter. Many of the
occupations in the Western Isles would come into the category of those
that might, sadly, produce lower life expectancy.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000084">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My hon. Friend
the Member for Edinburgh East reflected on the causes of longevity and
treated us to a taste of the various juices and medicaments—the
socialist medicine—from the Clement Attlee Government, which,
she argued, helps explain the life expectancies that are under
discussion. We have also been reminded that public health
measures—Victorian sanitation measures, hot and cold water,
better housing and today’s measures relating to tobacco and so
on—are very important. My hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham
South drew on similar experiences from her constituency, but they were
not repetitious. They reinforced the argument that many people’s
life expectancy is far shorter than the average—or far shorter
than that of people from richer backgrounds.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000085">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My hon. Friend
the Member for Erith and Thamesmead also drew on personal and family
experience. She thought 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 130<a class="bkMark" name="Column130">&#160;</a>
                  </div>that she had gone too far by outing her sister as a pensioner. I
reassure her that the secret is perfectly safe, because if we do not
want someone to find out about something, we make a speech about it in
the House of Commons, preferably on pensions, and there will be no
further publicity. That has certainly been my experience, and it is
shared by others. My hon. Friend’s sister will never find out
what was said. My hon. Friend sparked off a discussion about annuities
and the Minister’s reflections on that were interesting. If that
is how private pensions are going forward, does it not reinforce the
case for some flexibility in the state pensions system? The Minister
has not entirely understood that consistency.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000086">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As an aside,
if smokers get better deals than non-smokers, I do not understand how
the private sector polices that. Is there a smoke police? As a former
Social Security anti-fraud Minister, I am glad that I do not now have
to police that situation in the private sector.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000087">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My hon. Friend
the Member for Islwyn made a powerful speech, which, again, drew on
constituency and family experience. He spoke graphically about people
ending up being unable to do manual jobs, because it is a pain and a
strain—the hands go, the knees go. He brought a very human and
down-to-earth analysis to our discussions. The shadow Minister
presented a compelling and authoritative analysis in support of the
themes and ideas in the amendment. She raised some serious questions,
for which I thank her.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000088">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There are two
issues. Is this a serious question? Is there something in the measures
that needs reflection and solutions? Many of us feel that it is a
serious question. The Minister sees the point of it. We need to talk
about the 1980s stuff later, by the way, to see what the Minister meant
by
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000089">&#160;</a>

                  </span> I thank the right hon. Gentleman
for giving way, even though I am looking forward to hearing his
response to the Minister’s doubt. I have enjoyed the amendment
and what the right hon. Gentleman has said. I would add that it not
only affects people who work in the construction business. My partner
is a community matron. Nurses who have been nurses for 30 years find it
more challenging as they get older, so I have a lot of sympathy and
support for the 49-year principle. I have spoken to the Minister about
it, and I spoke to the right hon. Member for Croydon North this
morning.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000091">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">My challenge,
although I am glad the probing amendment has been moved, is in trying
to square the circle. I know the Minister has responded and I have
sympathy with him explaining how challenging and difficult this is. I
wanted to flag up my support for the right hon. Gentleman’s
amendment. I wait with bated breath for his possible solution to square
the
circle.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000092">&#160;</a>

                  </div>the scene for not only the next year or two, but the next two, three,
four or five decades. No doubt, from time to time, whoever is in
government will have to come back to the House and say, “Now the
time has come to raise the pension age again.” Given that the
ONS has published data, first published on its behalf by the Minister,
that shows that an extraordinary number of us—I think it is one
fifth—of people could become
centenarians—<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000094">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> Given that one sixth or one fifth of those around
today could become centenarians, who knows what the hapless Minister at
the end of the century will be advising Committees of this kind that
the state pension age should be. The serious point is that we will
return to this. Issues about fairness, and therefore social variables,
are worth reflecting on.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000096">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Of course we
understand that occupational structures are changing. The nature of
social class is changing. A recent survey suggested that 70% or 71% of
people now regard themselves as middle class, although I am bound to
say that some of those are not necessarily on higher incomes than those
doing skilled manual jobs. Some may be more insecure in their jobs than
their grandfathers. That shows how occupational structures have
changed. Despite the fantasies of those writing science fiction and
those interested in advanced technologies, my guess would be that, just
as in the 1940s there were people who were packers and cleaners, van
drivers and machinists, factory workers and agricultural labourers,
fishermen and firefighters, many of those jobs —not all, and not
necessarily in the same magnitude—will still be done in the
2030s, 2040s and 2050s.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000097">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I mentioned
people working in care homes under whatever ownership, be it public,
private or voluntary sector. As we know, many of the people working in
care homes are doing demanding work. Those looking after those with
mental illness have work that is stressful mentally as well as
physically. My guess is that their numbers have grown in the light of
the demography we are discussing. Although, in overall terms, the
numbers of people doing back-breaking work might well be in decline, we
should not overstate that argument—the Minister did not. Those
things will be present in the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000098">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">I
recognise that, in answer to the rather important question of what can
be done, it is not easy. I confess that when I was drafting my paper,
the bit headed “Conclusion” was not the easiest to write.
I rather envied the Minister being able to call on researchers, civil
servants and experts to think the matter through and see whether there
might be solutions. I put it to him again that the art of judgment and
the test of leadership are not to do the research to show why it cannot
be done, but to test the research and the data to see whether it can be
done. I hope he does not give up on that
question.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000099">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To
clarify, when I put forward what I might call my draft proposal that we
should look at the reality of those leaving school at 15 or 16 and who
have been at work ever since—we will come on to the issue of
women, although we have touched on it already—I was not at 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 132<a class="bkMark" name="Column132">&#160;</a>
                  </div>all thinking of defining them occupationally. That is too complex, and
we do not have the records. My assumption was that many of those
people, but not all, would be in the kind of manual jobs that I am
discussing. However, I recognise that some will have started office
jobs, so the Minister could say that there is an element of rough
justice, although I do not see that as a great problem, because those
people would nevertheless have been in the labour market all that time,
for 49 or 50 years.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000100">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We hear today
about people who after graduating got jobs in their early to mid-20s
but who are now, because of ageism in the labour market, finding it
difficult to get a new job in their mid-50s. I deplore that fact of
course, but if we are talking about people who might only be in the
labour market for 30 or so years—I think I have got that
right—is it such a crime to suggest that those who have been in
the labour market for 50 years should be treated fairly by the state
and have a right to an early pension? I do not think it
is.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000101">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Before I allow the Minister to ask his question, I
will make one point, although I do not want to overdo it. When we look
at those who are on whatever we now call incapacity benefit—the
name is changed to confuse the innocent and, sometimes, the
guilty—although the great majority of them receive it because of
musculoskeletal problems, nevertheless the growing slice of that pie
chart is the people in white-collar occupations, who are on incapacity
benefit because of what we call stress. We should not necessarily
assume that all those in office work should, after 50 years of work,
keep working a bit longer because that is what the Minister
thinks.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000103">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I appreciate the thrust of the right hon.
Gentleman’s argument: life is unfair on everyone, so everyone
should get a pension
early.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000104">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">One
of the right hon. Gentleman’s proudest achievements in the
previous Parliament, I assume, was the decision to pay a basic state
pension after 30 years of contributions. Presumably, he thinks that was
a good decision. Why was that a good thing, when he now suggests that
people who pay for 49 years should get preferential treatment? Does
that not go in the opposite
direction?<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000105">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I do not think that it does, does it? We thought
the pension should be paid after 30 years because we were aware of the
gender issue and the points that the Minister made about women and
carers and so on, and the need to credit that in. We are saying that,
after 30 years of contributions and once people have reached state
pension age, they can get their state pension. If he thinks, as I do,
that 30 years was a fair number in that argument, I do not see why he
thinks it so outrageous that those poor guys and women who have been
working for 50 years should not get their pensions. I do not see the
logic of where he is coming from—but now he will confuse me
more.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000106">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> So 30 is a magic number in the system, and yet 31,
32, 33, 34 and 35 bring someone nothing—just as 49 will be a
magic number but not 48 or 47. Is there a big discontinuity in what the
right hon. Gentleman is describing?<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000107">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> No, I do not think so. On the one hand when one
meets the magic number, which the Minister wishes to increase, as long
as one has 30 years of contributions—recognising gender, caring
and so on—one will get one’s pension at, say, 65, whereas
I am saying that, in the future, if someone can show that since leaving
school they have been working or caring or in the labour market for 49
years or whatever it is, they should be able to get the state pension
as a minimum. The arguments are not altogether
different.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000108">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I understand
that from where the Minister and his team sit, the administrative
issues are really quite complex. I accept that. Despite welcoming his
response, which he has presented in good spirit, I am not absolutely
convinced that he has set the Department the task of seeing whether
this really could work. I suspect the task that they have engaged with
is to show why this is all a bit silly. Although the Minister is very
bright, let us give him a bit of added evidence to show why the
proposal cannot work. I do not think we have tested this out. I put to
the Minister again the idea that—like everything else, there
would have to be some kind of application form and evidence
produced—if someone could produce an application form stating
when they left school, giving whatever evidence they could of their
employment record, their national insurance contributions, birth
certificates for their children and their family allowances and so on,
that application could be taken seriously.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000109">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I am very interested to hear more about that idea,
as the right hon. Gentleman was in charge of the chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease scheme and the vibration white finger scheme. That
was the type of thing that was used to research records for people who
worked in mines at that period when they could not find anything. Is he
envisaging something along those lines?<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000110">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> Yes, I think I am. Certainly, as I recall, in that
important scheme, which perfectly properly cost the state several
billions of pounds—it is coming back to me now from my days as
Energy Minister—there were often arguments about how you proved
whether someone was working on the surface or underneath the ground.
The best that can be done in such circumstances is for people to
present a case and then for the system to judge whether it seems a
reasonable application for the pension that I am arguing for.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000111">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I intended the
amendment to be a probing amendment. It has produced a useful debate.
It has brought up social class. Sometimes people consider that an
outmoded concept, but sadly, the evidence on life chances shows that is
not the case—social class is still alive and a sad issue in our
society. I think we have had a good debate. I recall from one of his
documents that the Minister envisages that because we will need to
return to these issues in the years and decades to come, he
proposes—I cannot remember whether it is a Green
proposal—that some kind of committee be set up to advise the
Government of the day on longevity. Will he nod if I have got that
right? I thought I had read that in one of the documents. If that is
the case, I hope that this could be the kind of thing that that
committee could look at, because I do not think we can just kick this
issue into the long grass. It is a very significant issue. If we are to
take public opinion with us on continually raising the pension age, the
social class dimension needs to be fully investigated and we need to
find solutions.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000112">&#160;</a>

State must report to Parliament within one year of the implementation
of this Act with details of the communication of changes in the State
Pension Age to all those affected by this
section.’.</p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendment was tabled because many of the objections raised to clause 1
are about the unexpectedness of the changes, and the element of
surprise or, some might say, shock at the acceleration of the
equalisation of men’s and women’s pension ages. The sheer
volume of correspondence that I have received from constituents and the
research carried out by Age UK have revealed to me the unexpected truth
that many people are completely unaware of the
changes.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000116">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Age
UK carried out two types of survey—an online survey, which was
self-selecting in a way, and a commissioned survey based on
face-to-face interviews with 519 women. The women polled were asked at
what age they expected to be able to draw their state pension, and 18%
said 60 or below, 4% said 61-62, 12% said 63-64, 36% said 65, 12% said
66, 8% said 67 or above and 10% did not know. In reality, at the time
of the poll, none of the women would have been able to draw their state
pension before the age of 63. It is very surprising that they gave
completely wrong
figures.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000117">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Nearly
nine out of 10 women polled said they were aware that the Government
had announced changes to the state pension age, but those in social
class AB were more likely to be aware of them than those in social
class DE. About a third of women polled said that they did not know
when, following Government proposals, the state pension age would reach
65 for both women and men, and only one in 10 correctly said 2018.
Almost half expected equalisation to happen before the planned date,
and 9% thought that it would be later than is planned. There seems to
be total confusion, with very few people knowing the actual
facts.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000118">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Although
the proposals are new and are only filtering through, some women polled
did not even understand the previous changes about already having to
wait until after 60, which is very worrying. I have received letter
after letter about people’s surprise and shock, and people have
written that if they had known, they would have done this or that
differently. Communicating the proposals to people is therefore really
important, and we have discussed the website and how it can be changed
and
improved.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000119">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Another
aspect surveyed was how much notice people would require or thought was
right for raising the state pension age. Not surprisingly, the majority
of people said that they would expect more than 10 years. When asked
how they would expect to find out about the changes to the state
pension age, 55% said that they would expect the Government to write
them an individual letter to inform them. Given the number of letters
that people receive from the Government over their lifetime on matters
such as income tax, it is not too harsh to ask them to write to people
about such a fundamental change. Some 37% of people said that they
would want everyone to be informed through advertising, 20% said they
would ask, 15% said that they would check websites 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 135<a class="bkMark" name="Column135">&#160;</a>
                  </div>and leaflets, 4% said that they would ask an independent adviser, 1%
said that they would use some other way and 5% said that they did not
know.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000120">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Writing
a letter and being told personally are the most popular ways of being
informed, but people might have moved and the Government might have the
wrong address for them, so just writing a letter is not sufficient.
Alongside writing to everyone, some form of advertising would therefore
be
fair.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000121">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have a little plea that any information lines are not on 0845 numbers.
In my constituency, the majority of people have mobile phones and do
not have land-lines, and 0845 numbers are very expensive for people
with mobile phones. They are cheaper on a BT land-line, but other than
that, they are expensive. Until the Department for Work and Pensions
gets to grips with 0845 numbers and negotiates with telecoms companies
to reduce the rates, I plead that they are not used any more than they

UK’s survey was interesting. It was a surprise to me that so few
people understood the facts. Although I do not welcome the changes, if
there are to be changes the most important thing is that people know
about them. People can plan for things they know about, but things that
people do not know about, which come as a surprise, will simply be an
added burden for them. Age UK has been arguing that people need
sufficient time to plan for any increase in the state pension age. Its
polling backs up what we are saying about a minimum 10 years’
notice, and it shows that people believe that the Government should
proactively inform people of any changes.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000123">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">There is a
view among some members of the public that the Government know
everything about them. They think the tax office knows everything about
them—for example, if they move or get married—so there
will be an expectation that the Government will write to them. I think
that is fair, and I would ask the Minister to consider that seriously.
Given the unhappiness among that cohort of women, the least he can do
is write personally to tell
them.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000124">&#160;</a>

the debate, as the amendment raises and seeks to address an important
point. In total, 4.9 million people will be affected by the Bill. Will
the Minister tell us how many of them know about the changes?
Certainly, the 12,000 who have signed the petition to stop the changes
and the thousands of people who have lobbied their MPs over past few
months know, but they are a small proportion of the 4.9
million people who will be affected. I hope the Minister can tell us
what communication strategy is in place for warning people of the
changes; I have not seen anything so far.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000125">&#160;</a>

is facing a delay in her state pension of exactly two years. As I
mentioned in Tuesday’s debate, she knew nothing of the plans
until I told her, and the phrase, “Don’t shoot the
messenger” came to mind when I did
so.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000128">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Even
now, with the changes due in just five years’ time, or seven
years, in my mother’s case, if she goes to the Directgov
website, which I did this morning, pretending to be
her—<em>[</em>
                  <em>Interruption.</em>
                  <em>]</em> I typed in her date of
birth. When I clicked on the calculator, I was still told that she
would receive her state pension on 6 March 2018 rather than
on 6 March 2020, as it would be under the new timetable. I will give
the Minister this: there are some warnings—the first page that I
went to sets out the proposals—but if someone had gone to the
website to calculate their state pension age, the big eye-catching
button that says, “State pension age calculator” is
probably where they would go. Similarly, if someone clicked into a
website to find out about a mortgage, what they would look at is the
button that says, “What you can afford” or “What
will apply to you”. I clicked on that calculator and it asked me
to input the gender and date of birth. I submitted that, and up popped
a screen that said that my mother was due to reach state pension age on
6 March 2018. There is a link to the Government’s proposals, but
it is rather like the terms and conditions that we know people do not
read, rightly or wrongly.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000129">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I am sure the
Minister will say that until the timetable becomes
law—if it becomes law—the website
will have to communicate the existing timetable.
However, I urge him to look at the Age UK website. There, if my mother
enters her date of birth, the screen that pops up will tell her in
large font that under existing plans, she will reach state pension age
on 6 March 2018, but under proposed legislation, that would change to 6
March 2020. The two dates sit alongside each other in the same font and
size. Surely that would be a more sensible approach for the
Government’s website as well? That highlights how problematic
the five years’ notice is in conveying information. My
mother—and the 32,999 women who are in the same boat of having
to wait for exactly two years—is being told by a Government
website calculator that she will be receiving her state pension in less
than 6 years, 8 months’ time. She is trying to plan
accordingly, only to find that in the autumn, the goalposts will have
moved. Does the Minister think that is
fair?<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000130">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is not just my mum. Age UK has recently undertaken an omnibus survey in
which women were asked about possible changes to the state pension age.
I will not repeat what my hon. Friend the Member for Erith and
Thamesmead has said, but I will read a couple of quotes from the
website:<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000131">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Most
women polled were aware that changes to State Pension age are planned
but many had limited knowledge about what this would mean in
practice.”<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000385">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
then goes on to give the statistics that my hon. Friend quoted. One of
the women surveyed by Age UK as part of that omnibus
says:<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000132">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“I
love my work and put my heart and soul into it as well as very long
hours. I worry about my health if I have to continue working at this
pace for too long. Given that I presumed for many years I would retire
at 60 and then do some part time voluntary work, the alteration in
pension schemes has hit me very hard.”<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000386">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">This cannot be
a new problem. With over a fifth of women expecting to receive their
pension before they are 63, we know that this is not just a problem
with this legislation, but a longer legacy issue. I accept that, and I
accept that we now know that both the previous Labour Government and
the Conservative Government before that did not convey the information
that would have enabled people to have that knowledge. However, when
those changes were made in 1995 to kick in in 2010, people had 15
years’ notice. There are only five years’ notice of these
changes, so the risks are even greater that the men and women affected
will not know. They have only a third of the time to find out, compared
with the previous changes to their state pension age. It falls to this
Government to get it right, now. We know that even with 15
years’ notice, not everyone knew of the changes, and with just
five years’ notice there is a huge risk that people, when they
are 63 or 64, still will not be aware of what their state pension age
is.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000133">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Age UK has
been arguing that people need sufficient time to plan for any increase
in the state pension age, and its polling backs up its call for a
minimum of 10 years’ notice. As was debated
yesterday, the most common response to the question of how much notice
should be given was 10 years, at 22%. The average number of years that
people felt they needed as notice was 9.6 years. The Age UK survey also
shows that people believe the Government should proactively inform
people of any changes, as my hon. Friend the Member for Erith and
Thamesmead mentioned.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000134">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In the absence
of any previous communication strategy, will the Minister set out what
such a strategy might look like if this legislation goes through? For
example, will the Minister commit to writing to every one of the
4.9 million people affected by these changes? Would the
Minister consider a TV or radio communication campaign, accompanied by
adverts in national or local newspapers? How and when the Government
plan to communicate their changes to the people affected is critical,
but is often an overlooked area of policy. Stories gathered by Age UK
highlight the significance of the notice period. One woman
said:<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000135">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“How
can you plan? When the government say insufficient people plan or save
for retirement, they make it difficult by constantly changing the
rules. The system needs simplifying, guaranteeing for 10 to 15 years,
and a minimum notice of 10 years of future changes. Life is complicated
enough.”<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000387">&#160;</a>

changes. Those may be communicated together with the changes to
automatic enrolment that the Committee will discuss next week. There
are issues about the information received by both employers and
employees. We know that not enough people knew about
previous changes, and the time people have to prepare for these changes
is even more limited. We must, therefore, get the communication
strategy right so that people can do their best to make necessary
preparations and adapt to the changes that are arriving at short
notice.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000138">&#160;</a>

more months will have passed and more women will have looked at the
Directgov website and received what I believe to be inaccurate
information. I welcome the amendment. I hope that the Government will
accept it and do all they can to let those people affected by their

                  </strong> I thank the hon. Member for Erith and Thamesmead for
tabling the amendment and giving the Committee an opportunity to
discuss the important matter of how we communicate these changes. I
agree with a lot of what she says. I entirely take the point that
people need to know where they stand and that the Government have an
important role to play and must be proactive. I assure the hon. Lady
that we intend to do precisely that.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000140">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Obviously, we
are bound by the legislation as it stands. Two days ago, had a couple
of my colleagues taken a different view, we might have ended up with a
different state pension schedule to that in the Bill. One can imagine
the chaos that we would have wrought had we had a legislative
timetable, a proposed amended timetable, and another timetable because
the Bill had been amended. We have a duty to describe the legislation
as it stands, but I fully accept that as soon as the law is changed, we
have a duty to ensure that people know about that. We have tried to get
that balance right on the Directgov website.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000141">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The reason we
do not give equal prominence to the two different state pension ages,
as suggested by the hon. Member for Leeds West, is because they each
have an entirely different status. One age is the law of the land, and
one is subject to the will of Parliament and has not yet been
decided—it might have changed two days ago. We risk confusing
people if we give them information in that form. I accept that we must
alert people to the possibility of change, and the Directgov
website—which I have visited—does that. The information
has been refined. There was a period some months ago when it was
probably not as clear as it could have been, but we now strike the
right balance between stating the law, flagging up the fact that a
change in the law is under discussion, and not giving equal status to
the two different figures because they do not have the same
status.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000142">&#160;</a>

Bill was first published, and I give credit to the Minister for those
changes. I think, however, that more 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 139<a class="bkMark" name="Column139">&#160;</a>
                  </div>could be done. For example, when the retirement date of 6 March 2018 is
given, as in the case of my mother, perhaps below that the website
could also give the date of 6 March 2020, possibly in a smaller font.
At the moment, people have to click somewhere else to find out the
details. Given that we know what the impact of the Bill will be, the
alternative date should at least be given so that people think,
“I don’t know what that is; perhaps I should find out a
little more.” I urge the Minister to go away and make some
changes before Third

receive Royal Assent in September or October, which is about 10 weeks
away. It would be nice to think that Government websites are incredibly
flexible, and that we can put something up and it will all be fine.
Getting a link to Directgov was quite a challenge. Integrating the new
system with the database that calculates the current state pension age
and will do the new one, is far less straightforward than it might
appear. Hopefully, we are only about 10 weeks from Royal Assent. I will
come on to how we will notify the women affected in a moment, but
surveys on the website we have shown high levels of customer
satisfaction with that section of the website. Our evidence from people

                  </strong> With respect, the Directgov website is a slightly
bigger enterprise and is controlled by a much more complex machine. On
the point about clicking through, 250,000 people have clicked on that
page but lots of people who ask to calculate their state pension age
are not affected by these changes at all. There are a lot of people who
visit the page but are not affected and have no reason to click
through, so the hon. Lady cannot draw any inference from
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000150">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As a
Government, we issue very large numbers of pension forecasts each year.
To give a flavour, last year we issued nearly 500,000 individual
pension forecasts, 150,000 real-time pension forecasts—people
getting information there and then—and 3.7 million combined
pension forecasts, something the House may be less familiar with, where
we integrate occupational pension forecasts with state pension
forecasts. We are pumping out a lot of information and a lot of effort
is going in. I take the point that a lot of that is reactive—you
have to want to go to a website and ask for a forecast. The hon. Lady
raises the important point about what we do for the people who do not
ask.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000151">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I was interested to hear what the Minister said
about people writing in and requesting pension forecasts. Has the
Minister got any information about the age at which people tend to do
that? I imagine it is not spread across the full range of
peoples’ working lives and is focused on those closer to
retirement. Is it people in the last couple of years of their working
lives, or the last 10 years? That would be of
interest.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000152">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> In terms of the individual pension forecast and the
real-time pension forecast, I estimate that it is about 71% in the over
55s as a category and 21% in the 45 to 54 category. The hon. Lady
raises an important point, which comes back to one of the reasons why
people have not clicked with the Pensions Act 1995 yet. The women
affected—who will be affected in the next few years—were
in their mid-40s on the whole. If you put the word
“pension” in a headline, women in their 40s do not read
the article—present company accepted, I am sure. I am not being
facetious; that is the problem we have. We must give people forewarning
but if we go too far ahead they switch off. The hon. Lady asked a
perfectly sensible question. As people get into their mid and late 50s
they start to get very interested and this is when they ask for
information.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000153">&#160;</a>

                  </span> I am interested in the point about people
not taking an interest in pensions. When I was working at a bank and
actively selling pensions, I found that they were overly complicated to
explain, and people would switch off and not buy into them. Do the
Government have a wider strategy to explain what pensions actually
are?<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000155">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> The hon. Gentleman raises an important point. I had
not realised we had someone on the Committee who used to sell pensions
and we might probe that later. The challenge is simplicity, and I
suspect I shall say that in response to quite a number of amendments.
We feel the system is over-complicated. The state system that we are
directly responsible for is grotesquely complicated, as clause 2 will
demonstrate shortly. We want to produce a simple state system on which
people can build, and 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 141<a class="bkMark" name="Column141">&#160;</a>
                  </div>then have simple products like the National Employment Savings Trust
pensions and such like. I take his point: we do need to simplify as
much as possible.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000156">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Coming back to
the women who are affected by changes pre-2016, we have written
individually to 1.16 million women who were born between
April 1950 and April 1953 and retire in the 2010 to 2016 period.. They
have already had letters indicating what their state pension age will
be. Interestingly, the other day I signed off a letter to an hon.
Member who was disgusted because his constituent was born in 1951 and
the evil Government had raised her pension age. In fact, the evil
Government—sorry, the Government—had not touched it and
had written to her individually, but she still did not know about it.
That demonstrates that—although she quite properly quoted the
Age UK surveys—even when you write to people they do not always
read the letters. We will never get to 100% on this. That is the first
thing to
say.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000157">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
second point is that we must wait until we get Royal Assent, but
assuming we get it, we will send individual letters to 791,000 women
and men born between 6 April 1953 and 5 April 1955. If we get Royal
Assent in September, we will send those letters in the autumn. As soon
as we have a statutory basis to issue those letters, we will do it.
That takes us up to the people whose pension age comes at the end of
this decade, in 2020. We are also putting more than
£1 million into call centres, because when we send
these letters, I suspect people will phone us, so we will put extra
capacity into the call centres to deal with that.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000158">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Beyond that,
we are researching the best way to reach the next 4.6 million people
whose pension age is due between 2020 and 2026, who are also affected
by the timetable in the Bill. Because of the numbers, the question is
whether we use letter writing, television or specialist
magazines—or a combination. We are at the stage of reflecting on
the best way to do that. We do not have a definitive answer, but we
will certainly endeavour to draw this to people’s attention in
the most cost-effective way possible.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000159">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I hope I have
reassured the hon. Lady that we take our duties in notifying people
seriously. We will write directly and personally to everyone who is
affected this side of 2020 and we will look at other measures beyond
that. I hope that, in that spirit, she will withdraw her
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000160">&#160;</a>

age of pension payments must give people fair and proper notice, and

                  </div>disproportionate in its impact on a particular group. Those are the
tests of reform that the Labour party has set out, building on the
consensus built up from the Turner report. The Government’s
proposals for accelerating the timetable for state pension age
equalisation, with speeded-up increases from 2016, and increasing state
pension age to 66 for men and women from 2018 starts in just five
years. Currently, the age of eligibility for the receipt of pension
credit—this is the point of the new clause, which is targeted at
the poorest pensioners—follows women’s state pension age,
so the restriction of pension credit for the poorest men starts in five
years,
too.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000187">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Therefore,
under the proposals, the poorest men and women pensioners are set to
lose out with a delay in their pension credit of up to two years, with
insufficient time to prepare. Not only do the proposals hit women
unfairly and give them little time to prepare, they hit the poorest in
society—a point accepted by the Government in their impact
assessment. Pension credit ensures that anyone aged over women’s
state pension age has a guaranteed level of income. It does that by
topping up a person’s income to a guaranteed minimum level,
known as the standard minimum
guarantee.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000188">&#160;</a>

state pension age is increased will be able to rely on working age
benefit, but does my hon. Friend agree that there is a huge difference
between the level of pension credit of more than £130 a week and
the level of working age benefits, which my hon. Friend the Member for
Edinburgh East referred to this morning. For example, non-contributory
jobseeker’s allowance currently stands at only £67.50 per

                  </strong> I thank my hon. Friend for raising that point. In
2011, the pension credit maximum was £137.35 a week, about
£60 higher than jobseeker’s allowance for a single
person. An increase in the state pension age of two years means a
corresponding increase in the age of eligibility for pension credit and
will result in a loss of income of up to £5,000 for those most
affected. In fact, that is an underestimate because it does not take
into account the passported benefits, the eligibility for which is
linked to pension credit. For example, if a person receives pension
credit, that person will also be entitled to housing benefit, council
tax benefit and help with health costs, such as dental charges or the
cost of spectacles. A person in receipt of pension credit is entitled
to grants or loans from the social fund and cold weather
payments.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000190">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government are proposing that, with just a few years’ notice,
such guaranteed income and associated lifeline benefits will be pulled
out from under the feet of those unfortunate enough to be born in 1953
and 1954, in particular. As we debated on Tuesday, the Opposition
believe that such a notice period is unacceptable for changes to the
state pension age as well as for changes to the qualifying age for
pension credit. The National Association of Pension Funds, in its
response to the Government’s consultation, said
that<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000191">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“the
Government should give people around 10 years notice before increasing
the state pension age so people have time to adjust their
plans”.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000504">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>We
should add to that the views expressed by Saga, Lord Turner, Age UK and
the women whom I quoted in Tuesday’s debate.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000192">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The measure
would maintain the qualifying age for pension credit at the previous
timetable for women’s state pension age, thus providing a buffer
of help with the transition for those least able to cope financially
with the move. Those eligible to receive pension credit would do so on
the same date as under the original timetable set out in the Pensions
Act 1995 for state pension age equalisation. That would mean that
potential future beneficiaries of pension credit—men and women
who are currently in their late 50s—would not experience the
markedly higher costs of pension credit income that would otherwise
occur.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000193">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
change would reinstate that timetable for wholly pension credit
purposes. Turner referred to that in his report. He stated:<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000194">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“The
alternative way forward is to maintain the option of making
means-tested benefits available at an earlier age than the SPA, i.e. to
make the Guarantee Credit available, not conditional on jobsearch,
sometime before the SPA is reached. Between 2010 and 2020 the minimum
age for Guarantee Credit will rise as planned from 60 to 65 in line
with the increase in SPA for women. Beyond 2020, however, and
particularly if there is no sign of the differences in life expectancy
by socio-economic class reducing, there is a good case for keeping the
earliest age of Guarantee Credit, at least initially, at 65 even as SPA
rises, and therefore keeping the earliest age of Guarantee Credit
eligibility, say two years below the
SPA.”<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000505">&#160;</a>

relates to the one that my hon. Friend the Member for Erith and
Thamesmead put to the Minister on Tuesday, when the Minister urged his
Back Benchers to vote against my hon. Friend’s amendment because
it left some gaps in relation to state pension age. Was that the only
reason why he did so, or was it also because of the cost?<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000198">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Similarly,
will the Minister tell us whether this proposal might be rejected on
cost grounds? If so, when the Government put together some transitional
arrangements, as I still hope they might, what envelope of costs might
be deemed suitable to help the 500,000 women who are impacted for more

               <p class="tabbed">I
join my hon. Friends the Members for Nottingham South and for Erith and
Thamesmead in urging the Minister to give us a ballpark estimate of how
much he 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 146<a class="bkMark" name="Column146">&#160;</a>
                  </div>will put aside to help with the transition, as both he and the Secretary
of State said on Second Reading that they hoped to do.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000200">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Although the
Minister has given us no cost estimates, I have asked the House of
Commons Library to estimate how much it thinks our proposals on pension
credit would cost. It estimated the current annual spending on pension
credit for men aged 60 to 64 and the number of people in that age group
who currently claim pension credit but will no longer be able to do so
under the Bill. It estimated that the saving generated by that
group’s no longer claiming as a result of the new timetable
would be in the region of £3.5 billion. However, many people who
will no longer be able to claim will claim alternative benefits
instead, such as employment and support allowance, jobseeker’s
allowance or some sort of income support, as my hon. Friend the Member
for Nottingham South alluded
to.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000201">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
pension credit minimum guarantee is £137.35 a week, but
jobseeker’s allowance is £67.50 a week for a person aged
over 25. Although the House of Commons Library cannot be exact about
the number of people who would move on to other benefits, in reality,
approximately half the savings generated by the change in the pension
credit qualifying age as a result of the provisions will be wiped out.
Therefore, the true cost will probably be in the region of £1.5
to £1.75 billion. Perhaps the Minister, with the help of his
Department, can give us a more accurate costing. I urge him to tell us
whether the costing will be in the ballpark amount he might set aside
for transitional
arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000202">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Putting
into context the cost of these transitional arrangements, the cost of
the new clause and new schedule would be in the region of less than 5%
of the £30 billion total savings that the Government hope to
achieve from the acceleration of the timetable for the increase in the
state pension age. The Minister rejected our amendment on Tuesday on
the grounds that it would cost £10 billion. He did not like the
amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Erith and Thamesmead
because it would have cost £5 billion. In the other place, the
amendments tabled by Baroness Greengross and Lord Boswell were
rejected, and they would have cost some £7 billion. Will the
Minister tell me whether £1.75 billion is an acceptable amount
to pay to smooth the transition and to support those least able to
adjust to the plans, particularly the poorest? Does he believe that
this is a cost of his transitional
package?<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000203">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Are
the new clause and new schedule not exactly the sort of transitional
arrangements that the Minister should be looking for? For a cost of 5%
of the total savings generated by the proposal to increase the state
pension age, he would be able to alleviate the hardship and burden
inflicted on the poorest. If not, I go back to the question I asked in
our previous session: what would an acceptable cost be?<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000204">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Will the
Minister also tell me whether he will engage in discussions with
parties such as Age UK to determine whether this is the sort of
transitional arrangement he might have had in mind when he said on
Second Reading that he was willing to work to get the transition right?
Let us remember that the Government’s current proposal, where
the age for receipt of pension credit should track women’s state
pension age, in line with the accelerated timetable, does not make a
contribution to reducing the fiscal deficit in this
Parliament.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000205">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Under the new
clause and new schedule, the state pension age would still rise in
response to increased life expectancy, although I continue to argue
that the increase from 65 to 66 should commence in 2020, which would
maintain the course for long-term fiscal sustainability. This is about
fairer treatment for the poorest and least well off, who are in their
mid- and late-50s and so are nearer to the pension credit
age.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000206">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government, in their initial impact assessment, identified key criteria
against which they assessed the timetable options for accelerating the
increase in the state pension age for women and men and, consequently,
the impact on the eligible age for pension credit. One criterion was
intergenerational fairness. The new clause would not undermine
long-term fiscal sustainability or prevent progress on
intergenerational fairness, which are the Government’s other two
criteria. It would, however, inject some intergenerational fairness in
that it seeks to mitigate the concentrated impact on the poorest group
of people who had the misfortunate to be born in particular months in
the
1950s.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000207">&#160;</a>

contacted Age UK about their situation, and came to the lobby of
Parliament in May to present a letter to their MP. I want to share some
of that story with the Committee now, because it makes a specific point
about how they are affected by both the increase in the state pension
age and the increase in the age at which Paul will be eligible for
pension credit. Mari-Anne

               <p>This makes the point that
it is not just women who are affected by these changes, because the
poorest men who could have got the pension credit at women’s

               <p class="tabbed">The other two
of the Government’s criteria for changes to state pension ages
were intergenerational fairness and the long-term sustainability of the
pensions system. I accept that no changes to the proposals in the
Pensions Bill must undermine either of those things. However, as the
cost-saving for this amendment is likely to be less than 5% of the
total savings identified, it does not undermine that. There are any
number of options further down the line in terms of progressing the
state pension age beyond 66 that could be explored if the Minister did
feel that this cost was a risk to long-term sustainability. I argue
that if I am correct in estimating it at being between £1.5
billion and £1.75 billion, it is not a huge cost to help with
the transition for those most affected by the Government’s
proposals. I ask again: at around 5% of the total saving proposals, is
this an acceptable price to pay in order to protect the poorest from
the harsh and sudden impact of the timetable in the
Bill?<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000213">&#160;</a>

responds in his wind-up, because it is the poorest who are being hit
the hardest by the changes to the pension credit timetable, as the
Government’s own impact assessment sets out. To be consistent
with his earlier views, I hope the Minister will accept this amendment
or at least set out what proposals the Government are looking at to
help the poorest people and the people most affected by the Bill in the
transition.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000216">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let us
consider what groups are most likely to suffer as a result of this
change in the pension credit timetable. We have already had a very
interesting debate about how life expectancy varies between
socio-economic classes. Those in receipt of pension credit are more
likely to be in the lower socio-economic groups. Research published by
the Department for Work and Pensions shows that 50% of people in
receipt of pension credit have had manual jobs. As the Government's
impact assessment tells us, those in the lowest income groups are set
to lose up to 10% of their pension income by the delay in pension
credit of up to two years. On page 70 of the initial impact assessment
it says,<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000217">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“at the extreme
end, a person who would qualify for pension credit two years later than
under the legislated timetable could see a reduction in lifetime
pension income of up to 10%”.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000511">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Yes, the
evidence shows that those in lower socio-economic groups have also
benefited from improvements in their life expectancy although, as
discussed, not 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 149<a class="bkMark" name="Column149">&#160;</a>
                  </div>necessarily so greatly in their healthy life expectancy. That
improvement is an argument in support of the general proposition that
the state pension age needs to rise. But let us be clear that it is not
an argument to deploy to defend giving those on the lowest incomes and
with fewer private savings to draw on so little time to adjust. The men
and women who will be impacted by the accelerating rise in the
qualifying age for pension credit will have little opportunity to
adjust to their loss in the time available. They are the people with
the lowest incomes with the least potential to
save.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000218">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">For women who
will be dependent on pension credit, we have only to look at the
difference in median pension savings between those of a 56-year-old
woman of £9,100, which translates to £11 a week on a
level basis, and those of a man of £52,800, which translates to
more than £60 a week, to confirm how little prospect low-income
women have of saving enough to cover their loss from the delayed
receipt of pension credit. That is particularly so, given all we know
about their labour market participation level—as we discussed on
Tuesday—earnings, memberships of pension schemes and caring
responsibilities. Those on lower incomes are likely to have less
favourable health outcomes and they are less able to adjust to the
short notice by working longer and saving more.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000219">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Does my hon. Friend agree that there is also a
correlation between socio-economic class and race, and that black and
minority ethnic workers, who historically have suffered discrimination
in the labour market, are therefore more likely to be employed in
manual unskilled work and might therefore be disproportionately
affected by the proposals? Given the duties set out in the Equality Act
2010, do the Government not have a duty to try to mitigate that
discriminatory
impact?<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000221">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I want to come on that point because, although the
impact assessment acknowledges that people from black and minority
ethnic communities save and earn less and are more likely to be in
receipt of pension credit, nothing in the Bill will alleviate the
impact on the groups that will be particularly affected, as we have
seen in other
areas.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000222">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
know that poorer pensioners need extra support. The Government’s
impact assessment shows that men and women born between 1953 and 1955
who are on lower earnings, have had interrupted careers and will be
dependent on pension credit throughout retirement, will suffer the
greatest percentage loss in lifetime pension income as a result of the
accelerated timetable. It also shows that people who rely mainly on
pension credit in retirement will lose proportionately more than higher
earners, who can carry on contributing to their private pension saving
if they work longer and who also tend to live longer on
average.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000223">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Beneath
the headline numbers, there is a worrying distribution between
different ethnic groups, as my hon. Friend said. People of black and
black British origin 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 150<a class="bkMark" name="Column150">&#160;</a>
                  </div>have the lowest level of private pension and investment
income—£46 a week compared with £155 for white
people. Some 40% of pensioners of Pakistani or Bangladeshi origin and
29% of black and black British pensioners are in the bottom quintile
compared with 14% of white pensioners, and that concentration will be
greater as a consequence of the increase in the age for eligibility for
pension credit consequent on the acceleration of the equalisation
timetable.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000224">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">People
in minority ethnic groups are less likely to be saving for their
retirement, while, according to the latest DWP family resources survey,
white households are 10% more likely than any other ethnic group to
have an ISA or premium bonds, and are over 30% more likely to do so
than the group with the lowest saving rates—those of Pakistani
and Bangladeshi origin. Consequently, they are less able to mitigate
the loss in pension credit income. A person from a non-white ethnic
group is twice as likely to be entitled to pension credit at the
minimum age at which that benefit is paid, and labour market activity
rates show that, for over-50s, non-white groups are less likely to be
in
employment.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000225">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The

that<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000226">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“delaying
the point at which the State Pension and Pension Credit become payable

those affected by a delay in Pension Credit income of more than a
year”.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000512">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“disabled
people are also more likely to be reliant on Pension Credit at minimum
qualifying age than non-disabled people, there will be a

be both affordable in the long-term, and provide a decent income in
retirement.”<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000514">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>I
do not think that that is a justification. When we consider that to
mitigate the adverse and disproportionate impact on this group would be
likely to reduce the overall savings by less than 5%, it is very hard
to see how the Government reached that conclusion.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000229">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I support an
acceleration of the state pension age, although I stand by the
Opposition’s amendment that sees no change before 2020. In the
face of increasing longevity, our pension system does need to respond,
but this amendment does not undermine those goals. It does, however,
address the disproportionate impact that such an accelerated timetable
has on the poorest, who had the misfortune, for the purposes of this
Bill, to be born in certain months of the 1950s, and it improves the
transition to a higher state pension age for men and for women. This is
a transitional arrangement that does not affect the timetable proposed
by the Government.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000230">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On Second
Reading, the Minister and the Secretary of State said that they would
look into transitional arrangements. Members on both sides of the House
went away with the view that these would be forthcoming for the
Committee stage this week. Yet this is the third proposal that we have
debated in Committee, and it is no doubt the third that will be
rejected, although I wait to have assurance from the Minister. First,
we had the amendment yesterday, which saw no change before 2020, and
then a rise in 2022 in the state pension age to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 151<a class="bkMark" name="Column151">&#160;</a>
                  </div>66, which would have saved £20 billion. Next, we had the
amendment from my hon. Friend the Member for Erith and Thamesmead,
which would have alleviated the burden on the 33,000 women facing a
delay of two years, and the 500,000 facing a delay of more than a year,
saving £25 billion. Now we have this amendment, which sees a
transitional arrangement that would at least protect those on the
lowest incomes and save more than £28 billion of the planned
savings that the Government are looking for. If not this amendment,
then what amendment will support the transition process for those most
affected by the provisions in this Bill?<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000231">&#160;</a>

even two days ago, when we were debating the very issue in early-day
motion 1402, the hon. Member for Redcar (Ian Swales) signed it. More

                     </span>
                  </strong> The issue of pension credits links back to an
amendment that we debated earlier today. The group of people we are
talking about—both men and women—have not been able to
work in the crucial years just before state pension age. We know that
such people exist. We know from all the statistics that have been
quoted, which I do not think I need to repeat, that substantial numbers
of people are out of the labour force at that stage in their life.
While some of them, as I said earlier, do so on a voluntary basis and
have a reasonable income to support that, a substantial number do not
have a fantastic amount of income or savings, or have health problems,
perhaps because of the type of employment that they were in, or their
job has come to end at an awkward time. Getting another job at that
stage is not easy, however hard people try. The example that my hon.
Friend the Member for Leeds West gave is a good example of the sorts of
things that can happen to people. Such things are more likely to be
experienced in some geographical areas than others, simply because of
the employment situation. We do not always know when such things are
going to happen—only this week, Bombardier announced
redundancies. Such redundancies could hit older people, some of whom
may have partners who also, for one reason or another, are not
working.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000238">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
ability to claim pension credit at a slightly earlier age is of
interest only to men at the moment, because as things stand, with
women’s pension age still at 60, there is no difference for
women as they will qualify for their full state pension, with or
without some top-up from pension credit. Men are particularly affected.
However, as women’s pension age rises in the next short period,
some women will also be
affected.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000239">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
are dealing with people who have found themselves in a difficult
financial situation at that stage in their life An entitlement to
pension credit could make a considerable difference to their quality of
life, because the amount that is paid in pension credit—although
some people may have other income and so would not receive the full
amount—was intended to be substantially more generous than other
means-tested benefits in recognition of the fact that that is what
people at that stage in life need. From that point of view, it would be
of considerable benefit to a sizeable group of people who are
economically inactive, although that does not apply to
everyone.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000240">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
will always be a cost. I repeat what I have said earlier in this debate
and in other debates in the House: we need, at various times, to make
choices about where we set our priorities, whom we assist and who must
either meet higher costs or face the loss of certain services. However,
the group we have been discussing should not bear the brunt of the
difficulties and changes. The Government’s own impact assessment
made it clear that groups such as ethnic minorities and the disabled
will be most affected by the policy.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000241">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
Government’s view is that, while there is an adverse impact on
those groups, it is justifiable in the wider context of making the
state pension system affordable in the long term. The Government are
making a judgment call. Our position is that that call should not be
made and that it is not necessary. There are other ways—some 
<div class="columnNumber">

                  </div>have already been mentioned—within pensions policy and in other

is not unduly affected because of the changes that the Government have
chosen to make.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000242">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Those who are
following this debate both inside and outside the House—one
hopes that some people are interested, and they will certainly be
interested in the outcome—will be disappointed that we have
reached this stage and we are still not precisely clear what, if
anything, will happen to mitigate the most adverse effects which the
Government themselves admit will exist for some groups, which they
consider to be particularly small. The Minister himself has
acknowledged those effects. We are still unclear about what kind of
proposals are going to be introduced. We have heard a number of reasons
for that, including the fact that there has not been a great deal of
time, but we would contend that the Bill is not hot off the press. It
has been a matter of contention and debate for several months and has
been through the House of Lords, where similar issues were debated at
considerable length. There has been a lot of correspondence and
campaigning on this, so there has been a great deal of time, I would
submit, to come up with proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000243">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">All of the
Opposition’s proposals, but perhaps not the new clause tabled by
my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds West (Rachel Reeves), have been
turned down by the Government. We wait with considerable interest to
see how many people are affected, in what categories and what sort of
transitional proposals may be introduced in due course. It would have
been helpful to see those proposals in Committee. I said on Tuesday
that if it was not possible to introduce them before the first day in
Committee, I it should have been possible, given that timings are
within the Government’s remit, to delay consideration in
Committee for a short time to allow amendments to be tabled.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000244">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I support new
clause 3. I suspect, perhaps wrongly, that the Minister may suggest
that other proposals for further reform of the pension system, which
have been presented in the Green Paper entitled “A state pension
for the 21st century” may render the new clause redundant. If
the proposal were implemented quickly, perhaps the need for pension
credit would disappear. People would still be affected by changes in
the pension age, but pension credit may be overtaken by further
changes, although at this stage we do not know when, or in exactly what
form, such proposals would be introduced.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000245">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">This is a
relatively minor proposal to try to address the position of people on

               <p class="tabbed">I ask the
Minister to give us his reflections and, as it were, his vision, about
the group of people who are, say, four or five years away from state
pension age, which will increase dramatically in the future for groups
of women as we have heard. It is not clear that the Government have a
vision for that group. If we make a comparison with NEETS—young
people who are not in education, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 154<a class="bkMark" name="Column154">&#160;</a>
                  </div>employment or training—we can see that previous Governments have
taken a view about that, even though we may not always have been
successful. We have a view about single parents and their labour market
responsibilities and options when their children reach a certain age.
We have a social policy on mothers or parents returning to the labour
market that involves child care, child tax allowances and so
on.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000248">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Is there a
vision or policy prospectus for those people who, although categorised
formally as being of working age, are clearly not working? If I have
understood the impact tables correctly, 42% of men aged 60 to 64 and
31% of women aged 55 to 59—to take the five-year group up to
pension age—are classed as economically inactive. We have
acknowledged that not all those people want to work. Different
individuals make different choices. If people do not want to work and
they have an occupational pension, that is fine, but why are some of
the women aged 55 to 59 in that group economically inactive? Some 43.5%
of women in that group are sick, injured or disabled, but not all of
them will be sick, injured or disabled for a three, four or five-year
period. Some will, but sickness need not last that long. Governments
have been struggling with the fact that we have an enormously large
number of people on what used to be called incapacity benefit. Whatever
the figures were, they trebled over a 20 year period. That is not a
credible position, and we have been striving to enable and encourage
those people to enter the labour market. Is that the
Government’s view about people who have the temerity to be over
55 or, for men, over 60? Some of those people would wish to work and,
to be blunt, some of them should be in work. That is what Governments
have been trying to do.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000249">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Similarly,
some people classified as looking after family and home will be looking
after their children. In that age group, however, some will be carers
for elderly parents. People do not stay carers for ever—the mum
or dad they are looking after will sadly die and they may want to enter
the labour market again. Whether they are men or women, do the
Government have a view about that? What would be the response if I
asked my local Jobcentre Plus manager, or if I asked the Minister
formally, how high a priority is this compared with other priority
groups?<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000250">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I raise that
as a genuine question, because of the serious concern, which I noted
earlier, that we already have, and could continue to recreate, a
pre-pension age group of people in the four or five years before
pension age who—leaving aside those who have occupational
pensions—are in a kind of twilight area. They are not in work,
and perhaps the system is not making much effort to enable them to
work. They are not top of the priority list for training or education.
I could be wrong, but I suspect that they are not top of the jobcentre
plus agenda. They are not in work. They are not pensioners, and they
are jogging along on a range of benefits that are designed for quite
different purposes. What is the Government’s vision? Is there
one? How confident is the Minister that some of those people, defined

                  </div>in the pension age were inevitable. I certainly look forward to further

               <p class="tabbed">On
the way to Committee, the right hon. Member for Croydon North said that
he expected me to speak for two hours this afternoon or at least
provide a joke or two. Two minutes is more like it. I thought very hard
about such matters and recalled something that Evelyn Waugh said about
Conservative Governments or, in this case, Conservative-Liberal
Democrat Governments. He said that the trouble with Conservative
Governments was that they never “turn the clock
back”.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000253">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Minister is looking forward. He is not turning the clock back, which is
a good thing. Our debates over the past two days have been concerned
with a small group of women who will lose out substantially. That is
the only point that I want to make. He said that he was aiming for
simplicity, but the effect of achieving simplicity over complexity is
that there are hard categories and some people are left out. Some
people at the margins inevitably suffer, and that small group of women
have been identified as losing up to £10,000. I appeal to the
Minister to make an announcement as soon as he can about ameliorating
that particular piece of gross
unfairness.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000254">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I hope that our reasons for including clause 1 are
apparent, so I do not need to restate them at great length. As the
Committee will appreciate, the clause and its associated schedule bring
forward the equal treatment of men and women, and the move to the age
of 66. The basic reasons for that have been stated repeatedly during
the past hours of our debates, as has the dramatic improvement in
longevity even since the Pensions Act 2007 was passed and during the
four years of new and updated projections. I am horrified to tell the
Committee that new projections will be published in the autumn. I shall
not do an Arnold Schwarzenegger and say, “I’ll be
back” but if I were a gambling man—we can guess in which
direction they will
go.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000255">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">It
is worth saying that the issue is something of a moving target. All the
evidence suggests that, for the past century, we have been an awfully
long way behind the curve. Clause 1 will start to rectify that. By
2020, when the clause is fully implemented and women draw a state
pension at 66 years old, they will still be receiving a pension for 24
years, which is exactly how long a woman in 1990 who drew her pension
at the age of 60 expected to receive a pension. So 30 years
later, with six years on the state pension age, we are back where we
started. When it is suggested that such a measure is draconian or
unduly severe, it is important to stress that, in a sense, on pension
ages we are running to stand
still.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000256">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
want to say a few words about new clause 3 and new schedule 1 tabled by
the Opposition. Members of the Committee will see that they are
familiar. They are identical to those that were tabled in the Lords,
and rejected by their lordships for several reasons. The hon. Member
for Leeds West made a gallant effort to cost her proposal. I was
greatly heartened by her speech. She was talking about costs, and I
consider that we have 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 156<a class="bkMark" name="Column156">&#160;</a>
                  </div>progressed during our three sittings given that the Opposition are
trying to justify the cost of their proposals. That is time well spent.
Her estimate, with help from the Library—I have often benefited
from their expertise on these matters—was in the right ballpark.
Were new clause 1 and new schedule 3 to be implemented and carried
through to 2025, when the 65 to 66 change was due to happen, we would
be talking of a cost of some £1.9 billion, which is not
radically different from the numbers that the hon. Lady was
quoting.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000257">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Cost is one
important factor here, but it is one among others, such as workability
and complexity. In responding to the previous group of amendments, I
mentioned that there is a danger that we bring in yet more complexity,
with the best of intentions. The new clause and schedule would do just
that, because they propose that the qualifying age for pension credit
would follow the track of the women’s state pension age from
2016 onwards set out in the 2007 Act, diverging from women’s
state pension age, which itself will be divergent from men’s
state pension age. We would be running three different eligibility ages
in tandem. That would create anomalies.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000258">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To give an
example, I will take the Committee forward in time to 2017. A
63-year-old woman is made redundant and applies for pension credit.
First she thinks that she must be due her state pension and then she
discovers that it will not be until she is approaching 64 or, at least,
well past 63. She applies for pension credit and assuming that new
clause 3 is passed, she is told that she cannot have pension credit
until she is 63 years and 6 months. When she asks, “Why is it 63
years and 6 months?” the answer is that the 2007 Act would have
made the women’s state pension age 63 years and 6 months, so
that is the age for eligibility for pension credit. That would be less
than her pension age and less than a man’s pension age. Is it
different from the winter fuel payment age or the free prescriptions
age? I have no idea.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000259">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">All those
things are intertwined. Running those different systems in tandem would
create considerable complexity. It would also create some nonsenses.
For example, post-2016 women would flow on to pension credit and two
months later would flow on to a pension. Pension credit, as we have
heard in the debate, is attached to various passported benefits. For
two months they may get their rent, council tax and various other
things paid by pension credit. Two months later, we would have to
reassess then, cancel the claim, pay them the pension and stop the
automatic housing benefit, all for eight weeks.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000260">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That is an
extreme example. The point is that it would create periods of four, six
or eight months between getting pension credit and getting a state
pension. It introduces whole new layers of complexity, both for the
system and for the individual who wants to know where they stand. We
have heard how difficult it is to communicate what the state pension
age will be. To communicate to people what the pension credit age will
be and that it is changing and at a different rate to the other pension
ages is grossly
complex.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000261">&#160;</a>

state pension age would quickly go up to 66, the cost is £0.8
billion. I am happy to write to the hon. Lady and put a copy of any

stop in 2020, there would be a set of women who thought they were going
to get a pension at 65 in the early 2020s who would now get a pension
at 66 and who would not get pension credit at 65. The
hon. Lady may argue that that is tough, because they had
10 years’ notice so they can lump it, but given all
the other arguments that she and her colleagues have been making about
how difficult it is for those a year before pension age to live without
pension credit, I am not sure whether that is an entirely consistent
position. It would, however, be cheaper to do what she just
suggested.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000264">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">There
is also the crucial issue of take-up. We know that pension credit has
poor take-up and that a third of those entitled to it do not claim it.
That is with a static system, with everybody knowing that they can get
it at 60, because that is the women’s state pension age. The
issue of take-up would be a nightmare in a world where the pension
credit age changed every few months and at a different rate to the
women’s pension age, with a different men’s pension age.
If we were trying to run take-up campaigns, we would have different
calculators on our website for the pension credit age, for the
women’s state pension age and for the men’s state pension
age. I hesitate to use this phrase, but that would be a web of
complexity, and we do not want to go in that direction. There would be
a few other undesirable side
effects.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000265">&#160;</a>

the Fabianism of the past 13 years of designing intricate, genius
complexity. I am sure that the tax credit system looked elegant on a
whiteboard in the Treasury; it just made everyone’s life a
misery. It was not only that the system was complex, but that the
people who had to deal with it found it baffling and overwhelming. The
proposals are similar: they might sound good in Committee, where we all
understand pension credit, but we cannot expect people to interact with
the system and to know whether they are entitled to pension credit. We
know the take-up of the current system, and a third miss out;

is a ridiculous argument. I remind him that, despite the problems with
any means-tested system, the pension credit gave some vulnerable
pensioners, particularly women in their 80s or 90s, an extra
£30-odd more a week, which they rather
welcomed.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000271">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> It was entirely in the gift of the previous
Government to increase the rate of what was then called income support,
when pensioner premiums were £30 a week. It was not therefore
pension credit per se that gave them the £30; that was a
decision about levels. The decision to introduce the intricate
structure of pension credit with the savings credit—I have never
yet met anyone who understands it—was classic Brownism. I agree
with the right hon. Gentleman that it is not about the system but about
the individuals. However, if the proposals were agreed, those
individuals would be expected to interact with a complex system, to
follow it for a few months and then to go on to another system, which

folk, and I will come back to that—and how to have a clean
dividing line between systems that apply to people, so that they know

ruled out as they approach the pension age. In the previous income
support system, not only were the amounts much lower, but the
means-testing, particularly in relation to capital savings, was much
stricter. That was an attempt to enable more people to claim. It was
perhaps complex, but it was a real attempt to give people a better

it to say that the reason why the savings credit was deemed necessary
was the chasm between the basic pension and the means test. The chasm
arose from the 30-year link of the retail prices index to the state
pension, which we have done something about. A decent basic state
pension is a better solution than the intricate complexities of the

Member for Croydon North asked me about a vision for older people. One
of the important things that we believe is not that the state should
determine a vision for sets of people, but that individuals should have
choices. We have talked in Committee about flexible and part-time work
and not going into full-time retirement. Part-time work is facilitated
by the universal credit framework, not the pension credit framework.
The amendments would push a set of older women—and men, for that
matter—on to the pension credit rules, whereby practically all
their earnings would be taken off them. In fact, many of them might
want to keep some contact with the labour market, as he says. That
contact might be interrupted or part time, but the amendments
potentially rule out an option for them that we would not want to rule
out. We could make consequential changes to that and have different
rules in universal credit for people over different ages, but that
would add yet more complexity, which is the

the earnings link to pensions had been restored, the gap would
doubtless have closed. However, in the early days of the previous
Government, when pensioner poverty was considerably greater than it has
been latterly, it would have taken many years to get anywhere near
closing that gap. The purpose of introducing the pension credit was to

                  </strong> Tempted as I am to discuss at length the merits of
the savings credits, it is worth saying that the take-up rate for
savings credits is even lower than for the main pension credits. It is
like throwing darts at a board and every second dart misses. Some of
the measures hit the target, but it was quite a scattergun approach,
and we have a better one in
mind.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000281">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
overall context of the amendments and of clause 1 is to recognise the
changes in our society, which we have been talking about in our
deliberations earlier today. We need a dose of economic realism, which
is absent from some of the amendments that we have considered. However,
we recognise the issue about the particular group who will be affected,
as I said right at the start of our proceedings. My right hon. Friend
the Secretary of State committed us to looking at that transition, and
that remains our position. However, we need to stick to the principle
of fast equalisation and the move to 66, which I think the hon. Member
for Leeds West has said that she supports.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000282">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> One of the specific requests that my hon. Friend
the Member for Edinburgh East and I made in our speeches on the new
clause is that the Minister addresses this question: if the Government
are looking at transition and if they want other people to come up with
transition mechanisms to support the group of people most affected by
the Bill, will they give us some idea of how much such mechanisms are
allowed to cost if they are to be considered? Is £1.75 billion
or £1.9 billion okay if they are not too complex? Is
£800 million for a transition up to 2020 okay if it
is not too complex? Will he give us some idea of what the Government
might set aside to help the transition for that group of women and
men?<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000283">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> As I was trying to say earlier, it is not simply a
matter of cost, but a matter of finding proposals that are workable and
do not introduce unnecessary complexity. There is a range of
considerations. It is not an exercise of simply asking, “What
can you do for £100 million?” The issue is not reduced to
that simple question.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000284">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Our goal is
clear: to recognise that as things move on and life expectancies
increase, we need pension legislation that reflects that, but we need
to make the transition fair. I reassert today that that is the
Government’s
commitment.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000285">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> Yes, I wish to press new clause 3 to a vote. My
constituents, and all our constituents, want simplicity, but there is
nothing simple about changing the state pension age and moving the
goalposts again for that group of women. They do not think that that is
simple, but that it adds a new complexity. What people to say to me,
and what I expect all our constituents to say to us, is that they want
incomes that make ends meet, pay their bills and allow them to do what
they want to do, both during their working life and in retirement. The
1.1 million pensioners who were lifted out of poverty, particularly
because of pension credit, would see that and other means-tested
benefits as more than just a scattergun approach. Those benefits helped
them live the lives they wanted to during their retirement, helping
them pay bills and feed themselves and their families. I therefore
dispute some of the criticisms that the Minister has made of that
system.</p>
               <p class="tabbed">My hon. Friend
the Member for Edinburgh East asked what a transition might look like.
We have debated three transition mechanism proposals that would help
those most affected by the Bill, but all three have been rejected by
the Government. I am not clear whether they have been turned down on
the ground of cost alone or on other grounds, such as
complexity.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000287">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">On
Second Reading and on other occasions, hon. Members have urged the
Minister to find a way, even if it is complex, of helping those people
who will be most affected. The hon. Member for Cardiff North (Jonathan
Evans) has great faith in the Minister, who, he said, must find a
complex solution if not a simple one. However, the Minister seems to be
rejecting complexity, even though it might help such people. Although
people want simplicity, more than anything they want to know that they
will be able to make ends meet and have sufficient income to balance
work and family life as they have planned.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000288">&#160;</a>

proposals that would do just that. The Minister must provide more
clarity not only for Opposition Members, but for the 500,000 women who
will have to wait more than a year for their pensions, for the poorest
men who will miss out on pension credit and for the 33,000 women will
have to wait two years for their pensions because of the

Friend the Member for Croydon North discussed the Government’s
vision. He referred to the support given to people in their late 50s
and early 60s and asked whether such people should be trotting along on
benefits or be supported, either through more appropriate benefits or
through being helped back to work. The Minister seemed to reject the
idea of a vision, but it would be good to hear more in Committee about
what he regards as the options for such people.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000290">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Arfon told some jokes and spoke about Tory Governments never
rolling back the clock. He also expressed concerns about those who will

it. The people who are following the debate will be none the wiser,

                  </strong> Sad but true. I want to introduce the Committee to a
niche part of the state pension system. We talked about complexity
earlier. This is the doyen of complexity. This is the payable uprated
contracted-out deduction increment, known in the Department as the
PUCODI, to rhyme with Kirkcaldy. It gets worse, because when a spouse
dies, the widow or widower can inherit a PUCODI, and 9,000 people have
inherited them. It is an example of just how absurdly complex the
pensions system has become.</p>
               <p class="hs_ParaIndent">To
disentangle the different bits, a contracted-out deduction is the bit
that comes off a person’s pension to reflect the fact that they
contracted out of the state earnings- related pension scheme and its
successors, and that the scheme has to provide them with something
instead. They get a deduction because they contracted out, or a COD. If
they put off the COD it is incremented, so it is a CODI, a
contracted-out deduction increment. However, it is increased in line
with inflation under different rules, depending on when it happened,
what 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 163<a class="bkMark" name="Column163">&#160;</a>
                  </div>sort of scheme was opted out of and so on, which is where the uprated
contracted-out deduction increment comes from. In payment, it is a
payable uprated contracted-out deducted increment, or a
PUCODI.</p>
               <p class="hs_ParaIndent">We have
had enough, really, and reached the view that there are bits of the
system that are not achieving a great deal, and it is time we got rid
of them. I can reassure the Committee that we are not taking any money
off anybody who is currently getting one, so those who treasure their
PUCODIs can keep them. Seventy-eight per cent. of these payments are
less than £1 a week; 21,000—17%—are between
£1 and £3; 6,000 are £3 a week or more. A tiny
number of people who have been getting these things for a long time,
and have a particularly obscure combination of circumstances, can get
more than £10 a week, but if I tell the Committee that fewer
than 1% of pensioners get those things, I hope that hon. Members will
agree that their days are numbered. I would like to stress that we will
carry on paying them to existing recipients, but we do not think that
keeping that kind of thing in the system achieves anything for anybody.
Therefore, under clause 2, we abolish the PUCODI. I commend the clause
to the Committee.</p>

schedule 2 covers the amendments consequential upon the
abolition of the PUCODI. There are often references in other
legislation to particular bits of the system, and if we do away with a
bit of the system and do not do away with the references, we have
defective legislation. Schedule 2 is fundamentally a technical schedule
that does away with this complex bit of the system. I commend it to the

                  </strong> The Committee will see that clause 3 is probably the
simplest clause in the Bill, because it just says to read the schedule.
The reason it says that is because the schedule is long and
complicated, and we regard our legislation as akin to poetry. We do not
like to disturb the flow of the poetry with long and technical detail,
so we shove it all in a schedule, and clause 3 just provides for doing
what it says in the schedule. If I may, Miss Clark, because clause 3
enacts the schedule, I will refer to the schedule, and not speak about
the schedule itself
again.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000337">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Clause 3
relates to consolidation, which is another juicy bit of the system. It
was something that a previous Government legislated for, and it made a
lot of sense. Consolidation tries to bring together historic rights and
earnings-related bits of the state scheme and the contracted-out
equivalents, into a single number rather than have a history of state
pension that is built up from, for example, periods from ’78 to
’88 under one set of rules and ’88 to ’97 under
another, and a different set of rules after that. It tries to take all
of that—bits that are uprated at different rates, bits where the
scheme has to uprate at one rate and the Government have to uprate at
another—and collapse it into a single figure.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000338">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The purpose of
that exercise, which I supported in previous legislation, is to help
people know where they are going. Coming back to our earlier
discussions, when people ask us how much state pension they will get,
the letter we send them is utterly baffling. It has to be because it is
full of caveats, qualifications and “what ifs”. Indeed,
this issue of consolidation would help us a great deal with that
because we would be able to say, “This is the figure and this is
what will happen to it,” whereas at the moment we have to say
things like, “The figure we have given you might turn out to be
too low or too high or maybe it should be zero.” That is what
our letters say because of the great complexity of the
system.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000339">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Consolidation
per se is a good thing. The question is, when should we do it? The
previous legislation was designed to produce consolidation in 2020.
That date was chosen specifically because it was the date at which
equalisation of men’s and women’s state pension age was
due to happen, so it seemed logical to do it at that point. Obviously,
the Bill changes the date of equalisation. 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 165<a class="bkMark" name="Column165">&#160;</a>
                  </div>We could just bring 2020 forward to November 2018, or a financial year
around then. However, as the Committee is aware, there is an awful lot
going on in the state pension world at the moment—not least our
Green Paper and a possible flat-rate state pension, which would itself
have implications for consolidation, and when it happened and how it
interacted. So what we are seeking leave to do under clause 3 is,
rather than have a specific date of 2020 for consolidation, which was
the previous proposition, to give ourselves more flexibility about when
it should happen.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000340">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I reassure the
Committee that consolidation, which I support—which
was legislated for by a Labour Government—is designed to smooth
payments to overcome differences in indexation between additional
pensions that the state pays and contracted-out rights, which just
caused great complexity in the system. The purpose of all this is to
give us the power by regulation to set the most appropriate and
effective group and start date by order rather than have it in primary
legislation. We will come back to the House when we have taken a view
on that. It does not affect people’s pension rights overall. It
can affect the profile of their pension rights through their
retirement, but it is very much a simplification that we support and
welcome. However, we want to ensure that it meshes in with our wider
state pension reform agenda, so we are seeking the flexibility that
clause 3 and schedule 3 would give us. I commend the clause to the
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000341">&#160;</a>

history to check that they are getting the right amount. People can
accumulate some money from things that are now relatively obscure, such
as the graduated pension scheme. Will the Minister tell me whether in
the future people will still have enough detail to ensure that they get
the right total amount? Some people would welcome the detail. The
Minister said earlier that perhaps records are not what they should be,
so we need to ensure that people understand.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000345">&#160;</a>

Christmas bonus continues for pensioners and those on selected other
benefits—another thing that the right hon. Gentleman left me
with. It has not been uprated since 1974 or something—certainly
not for a while. There are an awful lot of corners of the system that
could probably be looked at.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000347">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The point about
consolidation is that we are trying to give people a statement of their
rights in a single figure. It will be far more meaningful to them than
saying, “You have a graduated retirement benefit of this; a
gross additional pension of that; a COD of this; this bit is indexed by
that and your scheme will index it by that, but it all depends on which
period of service we are referring to.” The way we do it at the
moment is not informative. It is baffling and, crucially, it is not
fixed. That is the key point. The letters that we send to people say,
“We think this is what your pension is going to be, but it might
be higher or lower or might even be zero.” When we put
consolidation in place, we can say, “We have taken all your past
rights, converted them into a single number and this is what it is
going to be.” The way we propose to do it will be much more
informative than what is currently done.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000348">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">To answer the
right hon. Gentleman’s question in full if I have not already
done so, clearly, we need to explain to people where the numbers come
from. We will not just produce a number and say, “This is it; go
away.” They will have to know where that number has come from
and we will be able to do that. Most people will welcome the clarity
that clause 3 and the associated schedule will bring.<a class="bkMark" name="1107084000349">&#160;</a>
