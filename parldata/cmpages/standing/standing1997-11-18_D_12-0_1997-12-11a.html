<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): I beg to move amendment No. 67, in page 13, line 18, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`; provided that no extra charges either for registration or arising after a sale shall be imposed on existing holders of stock on the National Savings Stock Register, and that the overall level of charges is not increased.'.<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 68, in page 13, line 34, at end insert`, and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(d) provision related to any redundancies arising under the closure of the Register.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 72, in clause 40, page 16, line 5, leave out `annulment in pursuance of' and insert `approval by.'
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am pleased to see you in the Chair, Mr. Butterfill, on another bright and sunny morning. It may be possible for us to conclude the Committee stage of the Bill today. It is good to see the Paymaster General in Committee and for him to have found the time to respond to our important debate when, clearly, he has several other matters on his mind.
<P>
The clause should not go undebated. I accept that my amendments are fairly narrow in scope, although my right hon. and hon. Friends may wish to go wider in the clause stand part debate. The purpose of the amendments is to probe some matters in connection with the transfer of securities gilts on the National Savings stock register to the main gilt register. We do not object in principle to such a transfer, but I should be grateful to receive the Paymaster General's comments on the important change of practice that facilitated it. We must consider the importance of national savings and ensure that those involved in the transfer receive satisfactory assurances.
<P>
It has not escaped our notice that the Government are fond of using the appellation ``the people's'' when describing some activities. It was suggested in a scurrilous journal, which I read from cover to cover, that the Bank of England Bill should rename the Bank, ``The People's Bank of Britain''. However, it would be inappropriate to bring the article to the attention of the Committee, as such a suggestion is too jocular and below the standards of the Committee.
<P>
The origin of national savings, as with the Trustee Savings bank to which I referred briefly in earlier proceedings when the Economic Secretary was in Committee, was concerned very much with the people's savings. As the Paymaster General knows, we take a critical view of the Government's consultation proposals on TESSAs, PEPs and ISAs. Nevertheless, there is a common interest in the Committee of ensuring that people of relatively modest means can save economically and conveniently and one such facility in the past has been through the National Savings stock register.
<P>
The particular technical factor that has now fallen, which I welcomed when we debated the Finance Bill, is that, as part of the package small savers--but not insignificant savers--could purchase stocks through the National Savings register and could obtain interest paid gross on the gilts. Under the Finance Act 1997, as the Bill now is, all savers may receive interest gross in normal circumstances. At the time we welcomed that, and I do not dissent from it now. A particular operational distinction for keeping a separate register has now fallen, and I have no problem with that. However, the Paymaster General must give us assurances about the likely consequences of that proposal. While bearing in mind the frame of the amendments, perhaps he could range a touch wider and explain the role of gilts, its interaction with national savings, and so forth.
<P>
Our concerns, as set out in the amendments, are pretty explicit. Amendment No. 67 relates to charges. Charges will be imposed on the purchase of gilts one way or another--either through the National Savings stock register or through what I shall give the shorthand name ``Bank of England gilts register''. Will the Paymaster General comment on the harmonisation of those charges? I flag up the inevitable concern that there may be some degree of creep, the net effect being higher charges for small savers than currently apply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross Cranston </B>(Dudley, North): My hon. Friend the Paymaster General will, I am sure, explain that the idea is to bring down costs. Will the hon. Gentleman explain a puzzle for me? I realise that he is a one-nation Tory--an old Tory--but the amendment proposes a system of price control. That is inconsistent with his usual beliefs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My word, the hon. Gentleman did get up early this morning.
<P>
I wish to seek assurance from the Paymaster General--if he can give them--along the lines of the hon. Gentleman's intervention, that charges will magically come down because the system will be smoother, more electronic, or more up to date. The hon. Gentleman is right that it would be an interesting relic of price control. You, Mr. Butterfill, would not wish me to dilate too far on the different flavours of Conservatism; if I were to do so, I would have to mention the yawning gulfs that have recently opened in the parliamentary Labour party. Perhaps that is why several Labour Members are absent this morning.
<P>
Let us return to the subject of national savings. Will the Paymaster General assure us that charges will not be set at an unreasonable level; that they will not be increased for those who already have securities on the National Savings stock register; and that that will not be used as an excuse to ratchet up the overall level of charges? If he will assure us that the overall level of charges would fall, I shall be delighted.
<P>
Amendment No. 68 refers to redundancies. The hon. Member for Dudley, North, being an acute person, will have read the Bill and the explanatory financial memorandum. He will have noticed that the memorandum contains the prediction that the merger of the registers will result in 60 fewer jobs at National Savings; however, there will be some additional jobs in the registrar's department. Taken with what the hon. Gentleman said a moment ago, I construe that to mean that not quite as many people will be employed overall. That, I suppose, is a necessary part of rationalisation. I have no problem with that, but will the Paymaster General say whether there will be a reduction in the total number employed, and what the overall impact will be?
<P>
Amendment No. 72 would alter the nature of parliamentary scrutiny, requiring a positive resolution of the House. The hon. Member for Dudley, North (Mr. Cranston), will concede that some of these matters are raised to trigger a debate. It might be called a probing amendment, but it reinforces the need for proper scrutiny. An assurance is required on the nature and extent of costs or savings to individuals and to the Bank of that rationalisation. No one who has worked hard and effectively in serving the small saver should be made redundant unless it is absolutely necessary. If they are to be made redundant, what would be the terms?
<P>
Taking my remarks a touch further, I invite the Paymaster General to speak about the role of National Savings. We sometimes read that it is not reaching the targets that it should. It has always been something of an anomaly that National Savings should handle gilts; for the reasons that I mentioned, it markets a variant on the gilt product through the National Savings stock register. It is important both for the Government's financing targets and for our public consideration of the Bill that we understand what role the Government envisage for National Savings in the conduct of gilt business--the specific subject of the clause--and, more widely, in debt management, which it may be more appropriate to discuss later.
<P>
Our concerns are both micro--how the change proposed under the clause should be handled--and macro, in that we want to give a greater context to what I am sure the whole Committee will feel is an important aspect of Government financing policy, which could serve the small saver.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Ruffley </B>(Bury St. Edmunds): I support the amendment and endorse what my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) has said. Will the Paymaster General enlighten the Committee on an additional matter? On 28 October, in a press release about the transfer referred to in clause 33(1), the Economic Secretary said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Gilts will still be able to be bought and sold by the private investor in the same way as via the NSSR now and for the same charges.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment as tabled to clarify the Economic Secretary's statement. Its aim--like that of the press release, I suspect--is to protect the small investor.
<P>
As the Government have made great play of governing for the many, not the few, and have gone to great lengths to say that they are keen on supporting small savers and investors, I believe that the amendment is sensible and deserves the Committee's support.
<P>
<B>The Paymaster General </B>(Mr. Geoffrey Robinson): Conservative members of the Committee have asked a number of questions, which amount to requests for reassurance on the clause. Very largely, we can give those reassurances, especially as the hon. Member for Daventry said that he had no objection to the clause in principle.
<P>
The small losses are currently incurred on National Savings stock register transactions because the commission charged on the service does not cover the costs. Without a merger, there would be pressure on National Savings to increase charges, and we should consider the clause against that background. When the transfer has been implemented, the economies of scale that the Bank can bring to bear mean that charges to customers using the official brokerage services can be contained. That is precisely stated, and I do not want to be drawn any further on it. The hon. Member for Daventry will be pleased to know that we are not speaking about reductions. We are saying that the losses that the NSSR currently incurs will be eliminated through the merger and that there will be no increase in charge for the services.
<P>
We can give an absolute firm commitment that there will be no compulsory redundancies in the move. There may be a small drop in the overall employment level, but that will be on an entirely voluntary basis. The explanatory memorandum explicitly states that National Savings plans to offer jobs elsewhere in the organisation to all staff affected by the merger. One could not want better reassurance than that.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) sought more general reassurance on what my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary said. The system will operate, to all intents and purposes, in the same way but through a different organisation and with a contained-cost level. That is no mean achievement.
<P>
The clause represents a simple organisational change, aimed at efficiency and at maintaining both service and the interest of the relatively small saver. On those grounds, I commend it to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I apologise to the Paymaster General for having to miss a moment or two of his response. He has given the assurances that we sought, and we shall hold him to them. Given those assurances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> At lightening speed, I ask the Paymaster General to consider the somewhat wider points on the role of national savings and the Government's transfer of responsibility for debt management. We have not debated those matters much, but some of my hon. Friends are especially interested in them and might want to do so. Although the Paymaster General has described the change under the clause as technical, it might be convenient briefly to rehearse--if not to make a meal of--the Government's policy on debt management because it is important to the management of the macro-economy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): I seek clarification from the Paymaster General on the debt management policy and on whether that role will be transferred from the Bank of England to the Treasury. I have searched through the Bill for the specific provisions that might do that. I am using this debate to probe the Government on whether their policy is to transfer debt management from the Bank of England to the Treasury.
<P>
Concern has been expressed in academic literature and in the Treasury Committee report about whether that transfer will occur. There is a feeling--the conservative view--that the Bank has conducted the country's debt management for three centuries and has acquired expertise in doing so. There are more fundamental concerns, especially those expressed by Professor Gowland. In a Politeia pamphlet, he states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``No one has advanced any persuasive arguments for transferring this function to the Treasury. Once more the new arrangements closely copy those in force in the USA. Yet almost all commentators believe that the US suffers from a lack of co-ordination in this area between the Federal Reserve System and the US Treasury.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>That relates to the concerns which my right hon. and hon. Friends and I have expressed about what happens when those functions are split and the Government conduct a management policy under the exchange rate policy. Indeed, I understand that the Treasury will conduct a debt management policy, which has monetary policy implications.
<P>
Professor Congdon is concerned that how debt management is conducted--whether it is funded or unfunded--has a direct effect on money supply. In his memorandum to the Treasury Committee, Professor Congdon states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The main objectives of debt management--as of monetary policy as a whole--should be to smooth the rate of money supply growth over time and to keep the rate of money supply growth low enough to prevent inflation. If the transfer of executive power to a new agency were to weaken the perceived connection between debt management and monetary control, it would be a retrograde step.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>He then urged the Treasury Committee to ensure that that does not happen.
<P>
Professor Congdon's technical concern is about whether investment in this country might be ``crowded out'' by financing the budget deficit from the banking or the non-banking sector.
<P>
I am not 100 per cent. sure that the issue is applicable to clause 33, but I raise it now due to lack of knowledge as to when else it should be raised. I mention it because it is a matter of great concern to people who have submitted evidence to the Treasury Committee and I should be grateful for some elucidation from the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) continues his crusade against the Bill and all its works, as he perceives them. It has been said before, but I am happy to tell the hon. Gentleman again, that the measure is about restructuring the Bank of England--the biggest restructure in its 300-year history.
<P>
There were three principal objectives. We wanted to have a much more focused, more widely established and professional approach to monetary policy, involving the Monetary Policy Committee. It was felt that in recent years the Bank's reputation had not done a great service to London and the Financial Services Authority will be a separate, professional and competent body involved in supervisory activities, which will restore the integrity and pride of the City after some unfortunate incidents that have tarnished the throne.
<P>
I heard what Professor Congdon said about debt management, but note in passing that if one always followed what he said, there would not be too many consequences for the economy. I do not know whether he is better on this topic, but the matter of insider information could be argued either way. He argued it one way; let me do it another. If one authority were responsible for setting short-term interest rates and providing advice on debt management, the market might read monetary policy signals into debt management decisions. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton argues that that would be a good thing, but it could be argued the other way; if the two functions were split, it would be a good thing. The market may also charge a premium if the debt management is believed to be influenced by insider information on interest rate decisions and could be used to the detriment of investors.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton mentioned conflicts of interest and that debt management may be a distraction from the Monetary Policy Committee's central counter-inflationary task. I am sure that it would be. The message seems to be getting round and there is waning opposition to the changes that have been made in the Bank. People see a group of full-time professionals who are able to get involved in the issues with a depth and professionalism that did not previously exist.
<P>
Conversely, if debt management policy advice were to be influenced by monetary policy considerations, that would conflict with the debt management objective of minimising the cost of Government financing, subject to risk. I would not expect Opposition Members immediately to accept those proposals, which will be covered by the Official Report. We can return to the matter on Report and at other stages if the hon. Gentleman likes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> As I have already confessed to the Paymaster General, I do not regard myself as a technician in that area and I do not know whether his concluding remarks were indirectly or inadvertently an attempt to patronise me, but his argument seems a strong one for creating a function that is separate and independent from the Treasury, if he is concerned about conflicts of interest. Perhaps he will consider that as an alternative, although I freely admit to being something of a sceptic and am happy to wait for the progress of events before deciding my final position.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> All I can say is that we always reflect on the helpful suggestions from the hon. Member for Daventry and we shall do so in regard to that one.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): We have touched on something important. The Paymaster General said that we might return to the matter on Report, but we need to discuss it in Committee. The clause is appropriate as it describes the transfer of gilts registration and therefore covers the issue of where debt management will be undertaken. We heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton that the way in which Government borrowing is financed affects the quantity of money in circulation. For example, if the Government were to sell less than they expected to the non-bank sector, that would increase the money supply, with obvious effects on the general level of prices in the long term--how long term depends on what sort of monetarist one is and whether the money can be parked in various intermediary assets. However, everyone now accepts that there is a link between the stock of money and the price level and, as Opposition Members have pointed out, there is an effect coming from upstream on how debt is managed and to whom debt is sold. We believe that the Government intend that that should not just be taken back into the Treasury but given to an agency or quango. Opposition Members are becoming increasingly alarmed at the proliferation of quangos and it would be appropriate to remind the Government of their consultation paper, ``Opening up Quangos''. It appears that not only are the Government breeding quangos, but they are not training them in the way set out in that document.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The right hon. Gentleman's comments go wide of the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I accept that, Mr. Butterfill, so I shall return to the quango which the Government intend to set up. Will the Paymaster General confirm that, as a consequence of the clause, debt management will be transferred, slightly away from direct ministerial involvement or even accountability? It should be undertaken by an agency. Where does the Bill provide for that? Is it in the Bill or is there an extra-statutory provision, about which we have not yet been enlightened? Those are important matters and if they are not covered in the Bill, why not? If they are covered in the Bill or elsewhere, will debt management be as accountable and open to public scrutiny and publication of details as required by the Government's document ``Opening up Quangos''?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I am grateful for those remarks. The right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) is correct that there will be a separate agency in the Treasury. It is important that that should be so, and the Committee will be reassured to know that key Bank staff will move to the new agency.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The agency's objectives will be set out clearly in a framework document and in its annual publicised remit. Ministers will not be involved in the day-to-day running, but will agree the broad strategic objectives. That is a sensible arrangement. More fundamentally, we can work towards transparency of operation. There is always a danger that insider information in the Bank will spill over into market knowledge and cause problems, but I believe that the agency will work extremely well in the Treasury.
<P>
It is perhaps even more important that we ensure that the Monetary Policy Committee works well and that the new regulatory arrangements restore London's image. With the Bank, we are achieving a whole package of reforms. Moving the funding operation to the Treasury, where it will remain separate, is a small tidying-up measure, but a necessary third element in that package.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I thank the Paymaster General for that helpful response. I think that he will concede that we have touched an important issue. The establishment of the agency is not an incidental matter. Its actions and policy, although not under direct ministerial control, will have an impact on the conduct of monetary policy and, eventually, on the inflation target. Although monetary policy is ostensibly being transferred to the Bank of England through the Monetary Policy Committee, the Treasury will retain an important influence in several ways, not only through its remit to the committee but because the actions of the debt management agency--if that is what it is to be called--will affect the quantity of money in circulation.
<P>
The Paymaster General said that a framework document would be published in due course. Can he say more about that? When does he intend to publish details about the agency? Who will be members? How will it report? To what extent will its action and work be available to public scrutiny? If he answers those questions, it would help us in our deliberations on the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> We all know that the right hon. Gentleman has some strong and arcane views on economic policy, but the debt funding agency is not meant to control monetary policy; its sole function is to raise money to fund the Government debt. In the mismanagement of the 1980s and early 1990s, huge debts had to be funded. The Committee will remember that, just before the 1992 election, there was a public sector borrowing requirement of some &#163;50 billion or &#163;60 billion. If the economy is mismanaged to such an extent, funding arrangements can indeed be seen as a further element of monetary policy.
<P>
As to the agency, I will provide details on all the points raised by the right hon. Gentleman, if he can be patient enough to allow me to do so, and I shall revert to him and let him know the current state of play.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Paymaster General characteristically sets out to soften his remarks, but I cannot leave him unchallenged on the question of the previous Government's management of debt. Is not our debt ratio significantly below many--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have been very tolerant and allowed the debate to range considerably wider, but I cannot allow it to go further.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I hope that I am not out or order, Mr. Butterfill. The Paymaster General clarified a number of matters that I raised earlier. The Bill purports to give independence in monetary policy, yet two key elements of monetary policy--the conduct of debt management and of exchange rate policy--are retained in the Treasury. That will give rise to significant conflicts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Earlier in the debate, the hon. Gentleman extolled what happens in the United States. I think I heard him correctly when he said that he wanted Alan Greenspan to be Governor of the Bank of England. The Bill proposes a replication of what happens in many other countries, not only the United States, where debt management is handled by the Treasury or the Ministry of Finance.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We must remember that clause 33 is about the closure of the National Savings stock register to gilts. We are ranging very widely on matters of broad economic policy. It has been a fascinating discussion and I have been interested to hear it, but it has gone on long enough.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 33 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 34</center></H4>
<H4><center>Provision of brokerage service in connection with gilt registration</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 69, in page 14, line 9, after `make', insert `reasonable'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 70, in page 14, line 11, after `make', insert `reasonable'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> We now return to calm waters, reintroducing our old friend ``reasonable''. Before the hon. Member for Dudley, North rises to say so, I realise that the import of the amendments is not to leave a power to set prices in the hands of Ministers, as in the previous group of amendments, but to put an indirect power to regulate prices and conditions in the hands of judges, should Ministers act unreasonably.
<P>
We invite the Paymaster General to say a little more about the consequences of amalgamating the stock registers. The consequential effects are explained in the notes on clauses, which say that clause 34 provides that the residual brokerage function, which was handled by National Savings when there was a separate register, should go to the Bank of England.
<P>
That can work in a number or ways. The Bill sets up a new body, which, in a loose sense--the Paymaster General should not hang too closely on this--is in competition with the private sector; the Government do not conduct such brokerage operations for the individual retail investor. I have no objection in principle, beause it is intended to reproduce a function that previously resided in National Savings.
<P>
We therefore need to be assured at two levels. First, we need to know whether the Government see it expanding to rival well-known City brokers. I cannot imagine that that is what they seek, but we need that assurance. Secondly, we need to be assured that the changes will not lead to a large increase in the brokerage element of charges as opposed to the registration element, which is swept up in the conduct of registration activity.
<P>
It will not make a big difference to the small saver who wants to buy gilts and put them on the register, and it should not hugely affect the amount that the register should be entitled to take through brokerage arrangements in any one day. I anticipate the Paymaster General saying that it is not his intention to make significant changes to the charges or to the maximum amounts that can be bought under the mechanism. However, it will be useful for the Committee if he can define the Government's postion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> There is no reason to depart from the current daily limit of purchases of &#163;25,000 per person, per stock. There is no current limit on sales and we have no plans to introduce one. As with any commercial operation, we shall keep such matters under review. I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that reassurance.
<P>
I also assure the hon. Gentleman that there is no question of setting ourselves up as private sector competitors. By inserting into the clause the word ``reasonable'', the amendments would add nothing to the Bill. I accept that they are a means of obtaining reassurance. People will judge the amount of money that is to be paid. Given those two assurances and the fact that the hon. Gentleman is a reasonable man, I hope that he will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> It is not always the case, but we have now received a reasonable and satisfactory response from the Minister. In those circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 34 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 35 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 23</center></H4>
<H4><center>Disclosure of information: minor amendments</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 71, in page 14, line 43, at end add--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(5) The Authority shall at least once in every year make available to the public a list of all authorities in a country or territory outside the United Kingdom (other than another Member State) with whom the Authority has entered into an agreement or formal memorandum of understanding which provides for the disclosure of information by the Authority in accordance with subsection (4) and the Authority shall, unless it is under a legally binding obligation not to do so, make available to the public with or without payment a copy of each such agrement or memorandum of understanding.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We return to issues that have plagued the Bill--disclosure and openness. We have more than once been startled by the degree to which the Government have forgotten their previous promises about the public's right to know and the presumption in favour of openness. The Economic Secretary has made almost a fetish of Government secrecy. In each sitting she finds new reasons for keeping everything under wraps and for not disclosing the responses to consultation exercises. I hope that the Paymaster General will be more sympathetic to my argument that, unless information needs to be kept secret, it should be made available.
<P>
Amendment No. 71 highlights the concerns raised by the British Bankers Association about the fact that memorandums of understanding govern the regulatory status of financial institutions. Unless, they are made available, regulators will be unclear about their obligations and the requirements made on them under the Bill. The association concedes, as I do, that regulators must have access to the necessary information to do their job. They must know what is going on and be able to obtain that information from the banks.
<P>
Much of the supervisory role concerns foreign banks that are based here, perhaps coming from outside the European Union, and United Kingdom banks that operate outside the European Union. The City makes its living by openness in both directions: foreign banks located in this country and British banks located and operating elsewhere. Therefore the supervision and regulation of those institutions obviously depend very much on the exchange of information with foreign regulators trying to do a job in their own countries.
<P>
Global supervision is becoming a reality and institutions are increasingly governed according to memorandums of understanding drawn up by the Governments concerned. In a few cases, it may be necessary to keep the contents of those memorandums secret and, provided that the system is not abused, we might be persuaded that there are sound reasons for that. But we are presently concerned with all the other memorandums of understanding and we believe that they should be made available to those affected because without that the banks will not know what is required of them.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I therefore ask the Paymaster General, on behalf of the British Bankers Association, and also in response to concerns that the Opposition have expressed on more than one occasion, to put into practice what we understood to be the Government's general stance on the matter: to make things available unless there are clear and compelling reasons for keeping them secret.

<P>

<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I can see what the right hon. Gentleman is driving at and would have some sympathy for it were it not that the White Paper on freedom of information will be published this afternoon.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman will know that the Financial Services Authority has generally referred to the memorandums of understanding that it has signed in its annual reports, so regardless of the proposals in the White Paper, we expect the FSA to be prepared to publish and update a list of its current memorandums of understanding. I do not see a great problem with that, but it is more sensible to wait to see exactly what the White Paper has to say and to ensure that the documents are brought into their appropriate category for release and availability to the public. The freedom of information Bill will be an important step forward in the more open society that the right hon. Gentleman, like myself, wishes to see. However, I see no purpose in proceeding with the amendment. I shall consider the memorandum of understanding about which the hon. Gentleman is concerned in relation to the details of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> This would be a good opportunity--on White Paper day--to strike a modest blow for freedom by accepting the amendment. We engendered last night a cross-party consensus on several other matters, such as the future of the welfare state, and it would be nice if we also found ourselves voting the same way in Committee. Perhaps I should not strain to those areas of policy, other than to say that we do not need a White Paper to tell us that that has much sense behind it. However, I detect a degree of sympathy in the Paymaster General's words, so we shall probably wish to return to that on Report, if that is in order. In that hope and expectation, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 36 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 37 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 7</center></H4>
<H4><center>Restriction on disclosure of information</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 73, in page 40, line 7, leave out from ``2'' to ``and'' in line 8 and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(either obtained pursuant to a notice under that provision or tendered voluntarily by an institution).''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is another of the amendments that my hon. Friends and I have been anxious to put before the Committee which examines adequate safeguards in the disclosure of information. I cannot recall whether the Paymaster General was present when we debated clause 17, but the Economic Secretary gave us some useful assurances about the way in which the Bank was set up to extract information.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment, which I tabled myself because it appealed to my lay eye, is to try to get some assurances on the handling of information by the Bank. The wording is such because, if the Bank has made a proper order and issued a notice that it wants information to conduct its monetary policy, that is all well and good, but there could be occasions when the Bank, through exercising its powers, might acquire information that it did not strictly need. It could, for example, even include information that had come to it inadvertently or by accident. We are all familiar with the phenomenon where documents are occasionally annexed to other documents and go to the wrong address--I am sure that there is a body of law about that.
<P>
But, I am concerned simply that the institution, which may be quite small and relatively unsophisticated, should not have information used against it or in any other way unless such information has been obtained properly under a notice for that purpose, or unless and until the institution has tendered it voluntarily. In other words, I am referring to information that comes to the Bank contingently as part of an order or requirement in another context, or information that comes to it by accident, which is useful and which it might want to use, but which had not been obtained with the consent of the institution. The Bank should not be able to use it without the permission of the institution.
<P>
It is a small, modest but important point about civil liberties and the proper conduct of the exchange of information, which should be either by notice or with consent. I should be grateful if the Paymaster General would give us some assurances on that matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I congratulate the hon. Member for Daventry on tabling an amendment entirely on his own untutored intelligence in such matters, which, I think is reflected in it. The amendment would have the effect of making the stated policy of the British Bankers Association less rather than more in line with what it wants.
<P>
I can give the hon. Gentleman a commitment on information. He has in mind matters such as leaked information, the wrong postal address, and so on. I do not know whether such a provision can be fitted easily into a Bill, but the usual conduct of the Bank of England and the honourable people who run it--he knows that we have recruited David Clementi--will ensure that the Bank is a properly run commercial organisation. If, inadvertently, the Bank receives information that it has not asked for, but which is of use in its deliberations, I am sure that it will go back to the organisation for permission to use it. I hope that the hon. Gentleman has the same level of confidence in the Bank as I have. I, therefore, ask him not to press his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> It could be that some of us would be prepared to give the benefit of the doubt to Mr. Clementi and his team, but might wish to withhold it from Ministers. However, I shall not dilate on that.
<P>
It is important to table such amendments to get assurances from Ministers and in the light of what the Paymaster General has said, we shall obviously watch the Bank's conduct carefully. In the circumstances, it would be unreasonable to press the matter, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 74, in page 41, line 37, after `authority', insert `within the United Kingdom'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 78, in page 41, leave out lines 41 to 45.
<P>
No. 77, in page 42, line 12, at end add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, provided that the obligation has been specified by Treasury order; but no such order shall be made unless a draft thereof has been approved by each House of Parliament.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> In golfing terms, we are moving even deeper into the rough with these amendments, but they are consistent with the sort of assurances that we have been seeking systematically. I hope that the Paymaster General will wish to maintain his good strike rate this morning.
<P>
Given that the jurisdiction of the Treasury and Her Majesty's Government extends to the limits of the United Kingdom and not beyond, it would be peculiar indeed if the Treasury were to amend the table of relevant bodies to whom information can be disclosed to include agencies outwith the United Kingdom. That is an important point because we have a single system of law and, ultimately, Ministers are accountable for the laws that they pass, and even for those that they fail to consider passing. We wish to tie the disclosure of information to the areas that are within the jurisdiction. There could be a body outside the jurisdiction that requires information, but it should not be disclosed in the way that it would be formally done in this country, unless we in Parliament are in a position to control the process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> In his earlier amendments, the hon. Gentleman raised important points, but I think that he is misfiring in this instance. Given the debate that we have had, does not he concede that it is difficult for central banks and regulatory authorities to act in isolation on a simply national basis? The institutions are themselves multinational and the regulatory bodies and central banks have to act across borders. If there are severe problems, it might be necessary for central banks to co-operate in the provision of liquidity, for example, which I understand occurred in 1987.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I fully understand the point that the hon. Gentleman makes about the mutuality of interest between central banks and institutions. I am just taking a somewhat flat-footed and midlands view of the detailed and complex schedule, which tells me that a series of legal powers set up various authorities with certain functions for which they are ultimately responsible through Ministers of the House of Commons and nowhere else, and that those functions may require the transfer of information. That is set out in a table in paragraph 3 of schedule 7 and it extends only to United Kingdom agencies. I do not think that it should be extended extra-territorially without an explanation.
<P>
I am sensitive to the point made by the hon. Member for Dudley, North about the need to exchange information more generally. He will have heard the remarks of my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells on the previous amendment. Of course, it is right that banks and others should be able to exchange information for the conduct of their specific responsibilities, but this is a rather wider matter.
<P>
Paragraph 1 of the schedule gives general permission to disclose information; it is a specific list, and it should not be amended to include agencies outwith the United Kingdom without explanation.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 77 deals with a Community obligation, which is consistent with what we have said about there being no problem in that it might be necessary, appropriate and desirable for the Bank to exchange information with Community partners. As is stated in the Bill, that might be a legal objection, so the Bank might not be able to prevent itself from disclosing information, even if the Bank thought it undesirable to do so.
<P>
Under amendment No. 77, and under amendment No. 78, which includes a tighter order-making procedure, we are anxious to ensure that, effectively, the Bank cannot disclose information beyond our jurisdiction without that being clearly stated. There must be a clearer understanding that potential ``disclosees'' included in the table should be within our jurisdiction and ultimately accountable to the House.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> The hon. Gentleman rightly says that the Bank will be obliged to disclose information to European institutions, but does not he concede that to incorporate a restriction such as that under the amendment would create problems in time of crisis, when it would be necessary to disclose information quickly? He is proposing a complicated procedure.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Hon. Members should be aware that the reading of newspapers in Committee, other than for the purpose of eliciting information on the debate, is out of order, so I should be grateful if the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hall Green (Mr. McCabe) would desist.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am obliged, Mr. Butterfill. The newspapers do not always cover such important but essentially technical matters in the way they should.
<P>
The hon. Member for Dudley, North is right: we do not want a cumbersome procedure that fouls up our relations with Community partners. He is much stronger than I am on legal matters. It is interesting that this is a matter of legal obligations rather than information which might be disclosable under particular heads of conduct, but I shall not go further into that matter.
<P>
The list should not be widened, especially not extra-territorially, without explanation to Parliament. We need a fairly good filter and, therefore, we suggest a beefed-up procedure for approving an order, so that such matter can be debated.
<P>
The hon. Member for Dudley, North might well have a point in that emergency action might be needed, and that it would be helpful if the Paymaster General were to explain the Government's policy. I hope that he will assure us that there will be no widening of disclosure beyond that which is strictly necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I shall focus my remarks on amendment No. 77. When I first read the phrase,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in pursuance of any Community obligation''
<P>
</UL></FONT>I presumed that it meant the local community--then I noticed the capital C. Does the Bill contain a definition of the word ``Community''? If not, is there a general legislative convention that the word ``Community'' refers to the European Community. My understanding is that the European Community's technical title is the European Union. It would be helpful if that were clarified, although it is a minor point.
<P>
One of the main reasons why I oppose the Bill so strongly, as the Paymaster General said, is that I believe that Parliament should control the rules on public and private life. I also strongly believe that Parliament should adjudicate on matters that affect public policies such as the control of the money supply.
<P>
What looks like a harmless sub-paragraph in a schedule, however, incorporates into United Kingdom law anything that is an ``obligation'' of the European Union, without giving us an opportunity for parliamentary scrutiny. Such obligations could be a general whim of the European Commission. The sub-paragraph does not use the word ``regulation'' or ``directive'', which would require a parliamentary procedure--albeit inadequate--that has been agreed by the House. ``Obligation'' is a general word, which has little meaning; it could refer to any desire of the European Commission.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Does not the hon. Gentleman understand that an ``obligation'' must be in compliance with law; it could not be pursuant to a whim.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I shall give the hon. Gentleman an example. Last week, it was agreed that we would sign up to a voluntary code of conduct on harmonisation of European tax policy to end harmful tax competition in the European Union. The Financial Secretary repeatedly said that the code was voluntary and would not be part of United Kingdom law. It may be voluntary, but it becomes an obligation when the Financial Secretary says that we will stick to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the wording of the sub-paragraph also implies a moral obligation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that question, which I hope the Paymaster General will answer. In the use of the word ``obligation'', the Government seem to be creating a new level of regulation. Not only have the memorandum of understanding and letters to and from the Chancellor become new forms of statutory instrument subject to no parliamentary scrutiny, but the European Union, which already issues regulations and directions, now sets out ``obligations''. I should be grateful to learn what the scrutiny procedure is for such obligations and how they are translated into Executive action and legislative force.
<P>
The table under paragraph 3(1) is, I presume an exhaustive list of authorities and functions not precluded under paragraph 1, which relates to restricted information. Why have not the parliamentary draftsmen included in that exhaustive list all the obligations referred to under paragraph 5(c)? Is that a result of laziness--the draftsmen and the Government cannot be bothered--or is it because there are too many obligations to list?
<P>
My main fear is that they are not listed because there are so many that no one is clear what they are. Regulations, directives and obligations from the European Community, and from the House of Commons itself, have proliferated over the years to such an extent that specialists cannot corral them all into one place. I know from when I was in private practice before I became a Member of Parliament that there were so many regulations relating to the Inland Revenue that few people could, hand on heart, say that they had a full grasp of them.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Kidney </B>(Stafford): Having traipsed through the Lobbies at a late hour for the past two nights, I understand how the words ``European'' and ``Community'' in a piece of legislation can lead to a lengthy debate, although I had thought that our proceedings were drawing to a close. Provisions similar to the one mentioned by the hon. Gentleman exist in the Banking Act 1987--introduced by the Conservative Government--which allow for the disclosure of information to assist an authority in a country or territory outside the United Kingdom. Perhaps at that time the drafter avoided the use of the words ``European'' and ``Community'' to ensure that there was no rebellion on the Government Benches. Nevertheless, territory outside the United Kingdom includes the European Community. It includes the rest of the world.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I presumed that the Bill would set out those particular obligations. It does not give a broad general phrase, such as ``any obligation coming from the European Community''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am most interested in this line of argument. If the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) is right, should not the Paymaster General explain to the Committee why--perhaps it is by accident--the provisions are narrower and more confined in that they relate only to Community obligations and exclude other obligations under international law? We need to be clear exactly what schedule 7 is about.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> That is an important point. The fear is that the European Union often behaves like a fortress Europe and tends to exclude countries outside Europe as if they did not exist. It would help if the Paymaster General responded to the points raised by my hon. Friends the Members for Daventry and for Bury St. Edmunds.
<P>
It is important that the House should be able to scrutinise changes to our law. We should not incorporate into legislation seemingly innocuous phrases such as that to be found in paragraph 5(c). That phrase drives a coach and horses through parliamentary scrutiny--and through another concept that I have always held dear, which is that there should be certainty in the law. When reading an Act, people should be able to understand the full extend of the obligations, responsibilities and duties that it imposes on them and the private sector. They should not have to worry that such phrases leave them open to other obligations, which they have great difficulty in determining.
<P>
From my vague recollections of my legal studies, I understood that if those who used to be known as subjects, but who are now called citizens, find it difficult to ascertain the law because the Government have not made a statutory instrument sufficiently available to the public, they are not obliged to abide by it. The same applies to the provisions imposed by the Bill. Even if I am wrong in my understanding of the law, it is only right in a parliamentary democracy that our laws should be set out carefully and not obscurely hidden in such damaging phrases as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in pursuance of any Community obligation''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I am grateful for that series of rather technical queries, some more serious than others.
<P>
I shall deal with those relating to the Community, which seemed to pose problems for the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. Following his sustained scrutiny of the Bill, the hon. Gentleman will have noticed that the Interpretation Act 1978 provides that the terms defined in schedule 1 of the European Community Act 1972 should have the same meanings when used in other legislation.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman should bear in mind that ever since a certain Tory Governement took us into the Common Market, the law has been evolving and growing at a pace. That is one precise reason why we could not list the obligations in the fullness and detail that the hon. Gentleman wants; but that is not the main reason. They were not included in the Banking Act 1987 either, for the very good reason that EU law continues to evolve. It is important that the Bank does not find itself in breach of the law, yet we have to allow for the steady evolution and interpretation of European Statute.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Does the Paymaster General know of any other statute where the phrase ``Community obligation'' is used as a term of art, as I believe it is intended in paragraph 5(c)?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I shall do my best in what remains of this morning's sitting to come up with another. One is arriving as I speak. The note that I have just received states, ``Banking Act 1987, section 85(1)(h)''. I pass to the hon. Gentleman that further vital clarification.
<P>
It was said, more in jest, I think, than seriously by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, that the European Union obligations could be a whim. However, such matters must be made an obligation under the law. They could be in the form of a directive or a treaty obligation. Any new obligation would be considered in the usual way by Parliament and such practice covers obligations that have already been created.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Would the process include a voluntary code of conduct?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Speaking off the cuff, I do not think that it would.
<P>
My hon. Friends have been especially entertaining in the past quarter of an hour talking about technical matters under schedule 7. I cannot think of a point that has been made, serious or otherwise, that I have not covered and I am grateful to have had the opportunity to do so.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The Paymaster General has let us down rather spectacularly. He has not dealt with the seriousness of the issue. The schedule is concerned with restricting the disclosure of information by the Bank of England. In discharging its functions, the Bank will receive a great deal of information from the private sector about private individuals. Such information may be disclosed to assist the authorities in their specified functions, and the schedule places limits on that disclosure. Paragraph 3 sets out a table that may be added to by Treasury order from time to time, which is a sensible and open way of proceeding.
<P>
The authorities are listed in the schedule and range from the Treasury to familiar institutions, such as the Building Societies Commission and the Office for National Statistics. Also listed are the functions that derive from statute. The object of paragraph 3 is that information is disclosed to the authorities to enable them to discharge those functions. I approve of that.
<P>
It is important to note that the functions are derived from Acts of Parliament. That is why we picked up on the fact that there are no such requirements under Community instruments. That is a serious omisssion. The national supervision of Community instruments was raised during the Amsterdam summit. The treaty now asserts that national Parliaments should be given enhanced powers of scrutiny. That is another reason why there is a gap between the Government's intentions at Amsterdam and the reality of the position under the Bill.
<P>
Instead of a European Union institution having to be listed in paragraph 3, there is simply the requirement that information may be disclosed in pursuance of any Community obligation. That is all. There is no reference to the Community bodies to which the information is to be disclosed--will it be the European Commission, the European Parliament or any other organ of the Union, the European Court of Auditors, the Economic and Social Committee or the Committee of the Regions? Under what powers do they derive that status and those obligations?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Why, then, did the right hon. Gentleman's Government pass a mirror provision in the Banking Act 1987 which provided that the Bank could disclose information whenever it regarded that to be in the public interest, without any limits whatsoever? The schedule provides that the disclosure must be in compliance with Community law. Why the inconsistency?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I detect an ally in our argument because the hon. Gentleman is suggesting that the information should be required by Community law. I therefore invite him to join us in questioning the Paymaster General about whether sub-paragraph (c) requires information to be divulged under Community law, because the word ``obligation'' has a completely different meaning.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> The Paymaster General helpfully answered the first part of my question and said that the term of art was used in section 85 of the 1987 Act. Would my right hon. Friend ask the Paymaster General whether there are any examples, following the implementation of that section of the Act, that describe an obligation--in other words, what is the evidence and what is the practice? Since 1987, do we include, as has been pointed out, Committee of the Regions obligations or Commission directives? Are those the kind of obligations that have arisen under the Act? What is the case history?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend. We are still waiting to hear examples of where such a general provision has appeared in previous Acts. The Paymaster General will have heard my hon. Friend's question and will no doubt respond to it when he has been refreshed by his advisers. My hon. Friend touches on the more general point that we all have obligations that are not necessarily legal ones. I have obligations to my family, friends and constituents which are not necessarily enshrined in statute. I could not necessarily be taken to court if I failed to discharge them, but they are none the less obligations and, in the normal course of my dealings, I would abide by them. So it is clear that the word ``obligation'' has a very different meaning from that of a legal duty. The hon. Member for Dudley, North perceptively put his finger on that distinction. He clearly requires us to legislate this afternoon in such a way that restricts us further and makes sure that the Bank will respond only to Community legal obligations.
<P>
I wish to draw attention to several features of EU law which go very wide and to which the Bank could be required to respond. If a request came from an institution or an organ of the European Union for information and the Bank said that that information seemed much too wide or was private information that it was collecting simply to discharge our own obligations under the Act, the EU could refer the Bank to the extremely wide legal obligations that are already contained in the treaty of Rome, as amended. For instance, article 3A(1) requires member states to adopt
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an economic policy which is based on the close co-ordination of Member States' economic policies, on the internal market and on the definition of common objectives''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Article 102a states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Member States shall conduct their economic policies with a view to contributing to the achievement of the objectives of the Community, as defined in Article 2''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Article 2 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Community shall have as its task, by establishing a common market and an economic and monetary union and by implementing the common policies or activities referred to in Articles 3 and 3a, to promote throughout the Community a harmonious and balanced development of economic activities''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Although the constant cross references make it difficult to find out our obligations, it is clear that we are already required by treaty law to pursue some extremely general objectives, including the internal market and economic and monetary union. If the Bank of England refused to disclose some information, it could be asserted by the European Commission that it was obstructing the attainment of those general requirements, including the obligation on us to conduct our economic policy with a view to contributing to the Community's broad objectives.
<P>
Article 103 paragraph 1 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Member States shall regard their conjunctural policies as a matter of common concern''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The European Union would say that almost any financial information that was requested would be used to further the general objectives. If the Bank, on our behalf, refused to disclose the information, the Commission could say that we were failing to regard our economic policy as a matter of common concern.
<P>
On the face of it, anything that we do in the economic sector is, according to article 103(1), a matter of concern to other member states and the European Commission. The law is intolerably wide. A legal obligation is not required under the schedule. Even if we could restrict the policy to a legal obligation, it is so widely drawn in treaty law that almost anything would be included. That is why the Opposition request that the obligations be approved by the House.
<P>
I fail to see why our proposal is a bold or radical departure. Directives are already transmitted into English law through the activities of Parliament. It is true that certain regulations are not; they are directly binding. But, in the spirit of the Amsterdam treaty and all that was discussed before it, we should enhance the powers of this Committee and ensure that, at the very least, if information is to be disclosed to a foreign jurisdiction, it should be with the agreement of the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Putting aside all the right hon. Gentleman's verbiage that we are becoming so familiar with, he has still not covered the point that, in some circumstances, information must be disclosed quickly so that monetary policy can be operated efficiently. How could that be done under the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> If the hon. Gentleman dismisses the treaty of Rome as verbiage, he is in for a nasty shock because he will discover before he is much older that every word in the document--which runs to 245 pages--is superior to anything that he might say in the House. It is superior law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> In an effort to dissuade my right hon. Friend from reading the whole treaty to the Committee, perhaps I can help him on the specific point made by the hon. Member for Dudley, North. Under paragraph 2, the Bank can disclose information relating to its functions as a monetary authority. That is a parallel power to the Community obligation under paragraph 5, which is causing my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells and other such offence. They are not alternatives, nor is there a hierarchy between them. It will still be possible for the Bank to carry on its urgent monetary business without having to avail itself of paragraph 5.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon. Friend makes a powerful point. I assure the Committee that I do not intend to quote all the treaty on European Union, but I have read it, which puts me into an elite category, and it makes me especially anxious to protect the rights of the House. I detect an ally in the hon. Member for Dudley, North. He is clearly impressed by our arguments and is driven to the sole remaining argument that, on grounds of expediency, there might be occasions when information might have to be disclosed quickly in a crisis. I want to be generous: the hon. Gentleman has put his finger on a real possibility. In order to satisfy the hon. Gentleman and myself, the Government should produce a separate provision to deal with such an eventuality and, therefore, delete paragraph 5, which is general; it simply permits disclosure in pursuance of any Community obligation and is restricted to the circumstances to which he has drawn our attention.

<P>

<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> I cannot accept either of the helpful suggestions of the right hon. Member for Wells. He digressed into European law and its relationship to British law. Although he might dislike it, as might many other Conservative Members--even some Labour Members might dislike it--it is a simple fact that, where such obligations arise out of European law at whatever level, we must accept and incorporate them appropriately. We must do so after carrying out scrutiny appropriate to the level of obligation that we are incurring under whichever directive or EU legal measure is being issued.
<P>
Several subsidiary points have been made, some of which have been slightly more relevant to the narrow matter under debate than others. On the point raised by the hon. Member for Daventry, we are dealing with information pursuant to a notice under the provision, and it will have to be treated appropriately.
<P>
There was concern about passing information outside the United Kingdom jurisdiction. Under paragraph 4, it will be mandatory for recipients of information to obtain the Bank's consent before onward disclosure. Without obtaining consent, such disclosure will be unlawful. I doubt whether any overseas authority that we might include would disregard the law in that way. Of course, if an overseas authority did so, it would be removed from the gateway forthwith.
<P>
On extending the table to include overseas authorities, the schedule is drafted to ensure that there is no need to have specific gateways to overseas regulators. We believe that it is enough to rely on gateways to United Kingdom regulators. As the Financial Secretary might have to move more globally--a point to which, I think, my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, North referred--we must leave open that possibility; it would be crazy to close it off in the Bill.
<P>
No serious case has been made for the Opposition's arguments or the amendments, none of which we can accept. I have given assurances on all those points that I could, and covered most of the worries that were raised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> On one specific point, section 85 of the Banking Act 1987 includes that term of art, European obligation. We should not be involved in theoretical discussions as to whether an obligation was imposed by the Committee of the Regions or the Commission. Bank officials should have concrete examples of European obligations imposed since the 1987 Act. It is a matter of fact. The Opposition would be enormously grateful if we were given a list of those European obligations that have come into operation under the terms of the 1987 Act. That is why the amendment is so important. A descriptive list would help enormously.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I am not sure that I can provide information out of a hat at this stage of our debate, but if the hon. Gentleman is serious in his wish for such a list, I am sure that one can be obtained.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman raised a specific point, to which I did not reply. I apologise for that and reply now. Section 85(1)(h) of the Banking Act 1987--about which the hon. Gentleman is pretty well-informed--includes the identical provision. It is clearly necessary to an obligation under Community law. That is how the 1987 Act has been consistently interpreted. It was, of course, a Conservative Government who enacted that provision. We have no problem with that.
<P>
We have had a full and wide-ranging debate. With your customary patience, Mr. Butterfill, you have indulged us all. However, we cannot accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> This has been a wide-ranging debate. I would not wish to reopen it even if you, Mr. Butterfill, allowed us to debate schedule 7. This is one of those rare occasions--not unique--when a small spark is ignited which flies into the thatch and causes a great conflagration that burns down the building. Reflecting in an entirely dispassionate and modest way--as I often do--I find myself in a dilemma. The arguments put forward by my right hon. Friends have been more convincing than the converse and the Paymaster General's response was inadequate.
<P>
The Paymaster General said that these are technical matters; and I understand the context in which he said that. Schedule 7 is very technical. But when it comes to the disclosure of information affecting individuals, or institutions in which those individuals may have deposits or other business, it is extremely important that the House, as governor of the people's liberties, should get it right. What we have heard so far is not quite sufficient to achieve that.
<P>
I have recently been dealing with the problems of a constituent--we all have to deal with such cases--who has been given the run-around by her former husband, who has made various assertions to the tax authorities about his income in connection with a Child Support Agency case. From the papers that I have seen, the chap has been evacuating his income in order to prove that he cannot support his child. I notice the hon. Member for Eastwood, (Mr. Murphy) smiling, and I am sure that we are all familiar with such distressing cases. Although the tax authorities are grateful for any information that I tender to them, it is impossible for me directly to persuade the tax authorities to tell me what that gentleman is or is not disclosing as his income. That is an important safeguard, which we should bear in mind, and it is relevant to our debate.
<P>
Amendment No. 74 seeks that disclosure should be made within a jurisdiction and have a purpose as defined in the table in paragraph 3 of schedule 7. It is important that it should refer to United Kingdom legislation, because although we have huge international opportunities and our business and commerce ranges widely--as do the interests of individual citizens--this is the one thing that Parliament can control, monitor and gateway.
<P>
One does not have to travel far offshore to find places, such as the Channel Islands, that are under obligations to the Crown but not subject to United Kingdom legislation--they have their own legislation. That enables them to establish offshore financial structures. I shall not dilate on that, but it is an important principle that whatever lies in the jurisdiction should be tied within it. Amendment No. 74 would ensure that that happened and allow for proper parliamentary procedures.
<P>
I come to the concerns of my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells. When one unpacks such legislation--it is not easy to do so--one becomes more and more concerned. Immediately before the reference in paragraph 5(c) to a Community obligation, mention is made of a matter that we have not discussed at all. Paragraph 5(b) refers to permitted disclosures
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``for the purposes of . . . any criminal proceedings, whether under this Act or otherwise''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That sounds commendable, but I am concerned--I promise not to dilate on this--that it does not specify what criminal proceedings. It could, for example, cover a case in which the car of the Governor of the Bank of England had been run into in a road traffic accident and whether the offending person should be prosecuted.
<P>
It is not made clear whether the measure applies beyond United Kingdom jurisdiction. There might be criminal proceedings under a legal system that we find uncongenial, such as the dreadful case in Chechnya of the woman who is to stand before a firing squad after the birth of her child. I do not know whether the measure would embrace such a case, and I doubt whether the Paymaster General will want to respond on that now, but it is the sort of provision that we let through.
<P>
As to Community obligations, my right hon. Friend has said enough. I merely add that the difficulty with disclosure of information is that it is an irreversable process. Once the Jack is out of the box, it cannot be put back in; information that has been disclosed cannot be undisclosed. The Bank could act in perfectly good faith, believing itself to be under a Community obligation--even those of us who are reasonably warm towards the European Community accept that it can be a little less precise in drafting legislation than we try to be in the House of Commons--only for it to be disclosed that there was no Community obligation. That would be a nasty kettle of fish and Bank officials could be at risk of suit.
<P>
Part of the Committee's job is to be a guardian of the people's liberty, to be suspicious of the small print and reluctant to concede anything that Parliament cannot properly control. Because the Paymaster General has not given adequate answers to some of our concerns, I want to press the amendment to a Division, and my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells may also wish to call for a Division on a subsequent amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I, too, wish to give notice that, unless the Paymaster General can respond more adequately to our concerns, we shall press for a Division on amendment No. 77. The Paymaster General seems entirely unconcerned about the uses to which the information could be put or the circumstances in which it could be demanded. I do not know whether he is simply being innocent about European Union politics or whether he genuinely has not turned his mind to the implications of paragraph 5(c) of the schedule.
<P>
Conservative Members know perfectly well that information is power. Financial institutions and central banks in other parts of the world would love to have routine access to information collected by the Bank of England on exchange rates, the quantity of money in circulation or the individual activities of banks located in the United Kingdom.
<P>
We are all in competition. We may call other members of the European Union our partners--indeed, we can do many things with them--but an element of competition naturally arises between member states, which is widely conceded in the Council of Ministers. It does not create hostility or misunderstanding; it is just a natural order of events. If there is a market economy within a country that is competitive, we must extend that internationally. Therefore, we are engaged in competition with other member states.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Britain has been a member of the European Community for 25 years and the hon. Gentleman's party was in Government for 18 of those years. Does he know of any example of the Bank wrongly disclosing information to a European institution or being wrongly required to disclose such information? If not, his remarks are just hot air.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> It is a question not of the Bank wrongly disclosing something, but being required in future to disclose information in pursuit of an unspecified Community obligation. We are considering what may be required of the Bank of England under the terms of the Bill and can imagine a majority vote in the Council of Ministers to require information from a member of the EU that may, at that point, be outside the single currency zone, for instance. We well know that the French Government are already extremely concerned about what they call competitive devaluations.
<P>
We have heard about--indeed, we have debated in one of the European Standing Committees--the question of unfair tax competition, which was alluded to by one of my hon. Friends in this debate. One or more members of the Council of Ministers may well accuse us, in the nicest possible way, of running an unfair monetary policy or engaging in money market operations that appear to give sterling a competitive advantage against the euro. We would regard that as a matter for ourselves, but that is not the Council of Ministers' view. We have already signed up to the concept that all economic policies are a matter of common concern. If the Council of Ministers requested from the Bank of England detailed information about how it runs the United Kingdom's monetary policy or information about exchange rate movements and interventions, it would be considered to be a Community obligation. Without the House of Commons being asked or the Treasury being required to place an order before the House, that information could go to the Council of Ministers or the Commission. That is what we speculate and it is a perfectly reasonable matter to raise, but the Paymaster General appears to be oblivious to it.
<P>
Even if our fears are groundless, there is the question of the difference between an obligation and a legal obligation. The Paymaster General said that we were referring to obligations under Community law. It follows from what I said earlier that we are not satisfied with that because there are already obligations in a great many articles that are legal and could lead to disclosure against our interests. Even following the Paymaster General's logic, at the very least, he should table an amendment to restrict paragraph 5(c) to clarify what is meant by legal obligation. That extremely modest request is very much in line with the Minister's response. We would prefer, and we shall press the amendment to a Division shortly, that the obligations were specified by Treasury order and approved by Parliament. On reflection, the Paymaster General may wish to expand and specify that at the very least we are talking about legal obligations. We are not talking about moral obligations and so on, arising from wanting to get to the centre of Europe, and all the partnership waffle that we hear from the Prime Minister from time to time.
<P>
With those thoughts in mind, I shall invite the Committee to express its opinion by vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> Legal obligation not only means a legal obligation, but an obligation requiring the disclosure of information. I hope that that is clear to the right hon. Member for Wells.
<P>
In response to the hon. Member for Boswell--[Hon. Members: ``Daventry.''] I apologise. I am beginning to see parallels, but it may be better not to draw on them at too great a length.
<P>
I remind the hon. Gentleman that the same language was used in the Banking Act 1987. The most recent remarks of Opposition Members have been directed to amendment No. 77, but paragraph 5(c) has been included to ensure that the Bank can always meet any Community obligations placed on it. If new obligations were to be placed on the United Kingdom and the Bank, they would be considered by Parliament in the usual way.
<P>
It is unthinkable that the Bank should be put in the position of being unable to comply with the law, which would put us in breach of our obligations. Much as the right hon. Member for Wells has made clear again today that he does not like our UK obligations, and much though the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton made clear that he does not like the Bill, the fact is that we have obligations. The provision in paragraph 5(c) follows the example of section 85(1)(h) of the Banking Act 1987. If it was sensible then, why is it not sensible now?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I have finished.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Then, I can speak at greater length and the hon. Gentleman might be able to respond again.
<P>
Obligations are so generally drawn under treaty law that almost anything could fall within paragraph 5(c). I should like the hon. Gentleman to focus on the fact that, because by treaty law we have to regard our economic policy as a matter of common concern and because the law overrides anything that either House of Parliament can subsequently dissent from, it is open for the EU to claim that any request for any financial information could fall under that general obligation. That is the point that I want the hon. Gentleman to address.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman has now helpfully clarified that we are talking about legal obligations, but I should like him to make it clear in statute. The more general point, which it is important to grasp, is that legal obligations are extremely widely drawn in the European Union. Therefore, it would be difficult for the Bank of England to reject any request because the comeback would be: ``This is an obligation and your statute says that you have to comply with Community obligations, so the information must be provided.''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The right hon. Gentleman continues to be obsessed with his European crusade and to conjure up every form of imaginable or conceivable set of circumstances involving legal obligations and so on. As I said, the provision does nothing more than incorporate into the Bill what has been in the Banking Act 1987 since it became law. He said that anything can be an obligation under Community law, but that is wrong. It must be a specific requirement for the Bank to disclose. Any asserted obligation would be subject to the European Court, where such matters are decided. When we pass laws, we need courts because laws and their interpretation are challenged. That is normal procedure in every civilised society in every country. Unfortunately, it seems that the more developed society becomes, the more heavily dependent it becomes on lawyers. As we know, it is lawyers who always win out in any negotiation on the winning or losing side. The process is not simply something that the Commission can assert it to be; procedures exist whereby such matters are carried out. If we have to go to the European Court, we will do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I shall be brief and say, charitably, that the Paymaster General has not thought carefully about the interaction between the schedule and our general Community obligations under the treaty. I hope that we shall return to the matter on Report and that Madam Speaker, who will make the necessary decisions at that time, will realise that we did not get to the bottom of the issue in Committee. However, we have gone as far as we can now. We have argued about an important point and we can only express our dismay through a Division.

<P>
Schedule 7 agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 38</center></H4>
<H4><center>Offences in relation to supplying information to Bank</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I wish to speak against clause 38. I should be grateful for your guidance, Mr. Butterfill. In the provisional selection of amendments, clauses 38 to 42 are grouped together. Is it your wish that we debate the clauses as a group or one by one? My remarks relate to clauses 38 and 39.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We may have a broad debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Thank you.
<P>
The clauses concern fraud, although that word does not appear in them. In a previous sitting, I repeated the point first made by Lord Lawson, the former Chancellor, who said that there is rarely a failure of the supervisory system in which fraud is not involed; it is involved either from the outset of the failure or during the cover-up that makes the failure much more serious when it finally comes to light.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
As to clause 38, we must ask ourselves whether, when fraud is discovered, the penalties are tough enough. As was asked when we debated clause 17(1), are the powers strong enough to detect the fraud? We know that, even when authorities have detected fraud and misconduct, there have been considerable difficulties in securing a conviction.
<P>
The Paymaster General may say that those matters should be dealt with under the promised Bill on financial regulation. Our response to that must be that if, given the experience of the cases that have gone through the courts, he believes that there is a serious enough problem and that current law is defective, why is he delaying? If the matter cannot be dealt with in this Bill--lest it become a hybrid Bill--why cannot it be covered in a concomitant Bill that would simply strengthen the law, following the experience of recent cases?
<P>
As the Bill will create a super-SIB, should not we also create a group of super-cops in the City? We have had an enlightened debate on the dangers of framing too widely powers to draw information. A balance must be struck between individuals' rights--the protection of their legitimate business activities to give them the confidence to use London as their chosen market and centre--and the need to ensure that people who use the London financial services centre know that they are dealing with entirely upright institutions where right is right and wrong is out.
<P>
Lord Lawson's comment applied first and foremost to the Bank of Credit and Commerce International but also to Barings. It would be helpful if the Paymaster General could say whether he believes that clause 38 and 39 would have enabled the authorities to pursue prosecutions against the people in those organisations who were based in London and fell within the ambit of United Kingdom law. If the clauses would not have allowed that to happen in such clear cases of fraud, they will not strengthen the authorities' position, so why are the Government not taking this opportunity to strengthen the law? The Bank of England Bill deals with the banking sector, so such measures would not make it a hybrid Bill.
<P>
One can think of other cases where both the authorities' attempts to obtain information and prosecutions have failed--for example, the Barlow Clowes case and the Maxwell case. Those cases are distinguished by the fact that they involved frauds carried out not just in this country, but overseas and at offshore financial centres. We must also ask whether, where fraud involves such offshore financial centres, there is a strong case for making the range of penalties greater. I should be grateful if the Paymaster General would comment on that. It seems difficult to secure convictions in such cases. If it is difficult to secure a conviction, one could make the penalties even greater and the element of deterrence may succeed in ensuring that such activities are kept out of London, thereby preventing London from being tainted by them.
<P>
I should be grateful for some clarification from the Paymaster General, particularly in respect of clause 39, which I welcome because it attempts to broaden the ambit of the law to include those who work for a body corporate so that they cannot hide behind it and individually escape prosecution. In regard to offshore centres, the shape and form of body corporates can be very variable and flexible. Again, we would welcome the Paymaster General's comments on that. The Opposition always welcome hon. Members who bring outside experience to the House and we know that the Paymaster General can draw on his experiences and knowledge of the area in that regard. We very much look forward to him using that expertise and hope that he will not argue that it somehow prevents him from commenting; we very much want him to comment. However, it seems that there are vehicles offshore such as trusts--I believe that in Liechtenstein they are called anstalts--which I cannot claim fully to understand. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman can help us with that. I should like to know whether clause 39 covers the trustees or operators of such trusts and anstalts? Subsection 39(2) seems to be aimed at those who are shareholders or beneficiaries of such bodies. Would it cover the beneficiaries of such an operation, whether or not they were discretionary, if they were based in this country and the anstalt or the trust were based offshore? That is not an idle inquiry. There was a case in the 1980s of someone who worked for an American bank who obtained privileged information about a bid for a company. He rang up his offshore trust on his mobile phone and asked it to buy shares in the company at the opening of dealings, before the bid was announced. He later sold the shares and made a profit of at least tens if not hundreds of thousands of pounds.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am following the argument with some interest. My hon. Friend says that the person in question rang up the offshore trust. Was that a trust of which he controlled the investments or was it a discretionary trust in the hands of independent trustees--or does my hon. Friend not know?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am not certain, but I believe that it was a discretionary trust because in that way he could avoid paying any capital gains tax on the gain.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> The clause has nothing to do with fraud; it is about the failure to comply properly with the Bank's request for information which it might need for monetary policy purposes or for cash ratio level purposes. That is all it deals with.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am sorry, but I disagree with the Paymaster General's view. Banks that operate against the law may be acting in contravention of the cash ratio deposit requirements, particularly now that the cash ratio deposit regime is compulsory. One can imagine why they might be induced to become involved in fraud. A bank that is involved in fraud in one area of its operations is, as we saw with BCCI, liable to be involved in fraud in many aspects of its operations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman aware that clause 38 is a mirror provision to a section in the Statistics of Trade Act 1947 and that the words of clause 39 appear constantly in legislation? It is a standard provision. Can the hon. Gentleman make more manifest the ulterior reason for raising the matter today?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am always grateful to the hon Gentleman. He underlines my point. Why are the Government not taking this opportunity to advance the legal framework under which such matters are dealt with? Why are they just sitting on it and failing to take account of various court cases? Day by day, we laymen learn more about the peculiarities of the financial system. I was about to mention a case that illustrates that point.
<P>
A gentleman who bought shares and sold them at a profit was convicted only because he did not realise that his mobile phone calls were being recorded--as all calls are now recorded--and his illegal activity uncovered. The time and place of calls can be demanded of mobile phone companies and called as evidence. Today, such a man would be more aware of those factors and it would be much harder to catch him. Surely a case can be made for increasing the term of imprisonment or the level of fine on those whose activities embrace institutions or connected parties in such offshore centres. Nothing in the Bill deals with the possibilitiy of super-cops. I question whether the Treasury considered strengthening the powers of those who investigate fraud. If it did not, why not?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I had not intended to speak, and will do so only briefly because the principle of clauses 38 and 39 is entirely acceptable to us. My hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) has performed a service in raising some of those issuses, but until he spoke I had not focused closely on the implications.
<P>
Will the Paymaster General assure us that any accident, or contrivance of legal form, of an entity offshore of the United Kingdom, whether located in a Community country or elsewhere, should not preclude the authorities obtaining the information; and they should not be able to hide behind a fictional screen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Could the hon. Gentleman explain the inconsistency? On a previous amendment, he was concerned that anything going outside the United Kingdom. Now, all of a sudden, he is talking about entities in foreign parts. I remind him that clause 38 is about obtaining information for monetary policy reasons. What the hon. Gentleman said is completely irrelevant to that.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I decide what is relevant to the debate. I have been tolerant in a number of areas, and I am being a little tolerant now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful, Mr. Butterfill. The hon. Member for Dudley, North--we all think of him with a degree of affection--has the habit of premature intervention. The points that he raises are ones that I was about to concede.
<P>
It is important that we acknowledge the dilemmas of legislation. The Government were faced with those dilemmas, which is why we ask how they dealt with them. We are in a world where there is much greater ability to move funds around or hold them in one place and control them from another de facto. Sadly, as part of that process, but by no means all of it, there is an undercurrent of fraud and malpractice and the authority should be able to reach out on a proper basis, which is equitable and fair to the individual investor.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I did not want to dilate on those aspects, but to ask a few questions about the clauses. Whether I speak as Dr. Jekyll, Daventry or Boswell, I want to stand up for the individual and say, ``I notice from the notes on clauses that such issues are new criminal offences.''. My immediate reaction to a new criminal offence is to ask why it needed to be created. Is it because of monetary policy information--as the hon. Member for Dudley, North rightly said--or other matters?
<P>
The Bank dealt with such matters in the past, not quite under the same structure that has now been devolved to it, but it did not require the same powers to do so. It could now be required to have such powers because of the structure of the new Monetary Policy Committee. Perhaps the Paymaster General will respond to that point.
<P>
Speaking again in what could be described as a Dr. Jekyll mode, I should like the Paymaster General to satisfy the Committee that the offences and tariffs are sensible and that they have been run past the Attorney General or whoever looks collectively at such matters. Is the scale of the offences in line with the Statistics of Trade Act 1947? I am glad that the provision embraces misleading as well as false information. Can the hon. Gentleman assure us that it is not widely out of line or anomalous with other legislative provisions?
<P>
I shall revert for a moment to the rigorous pursuit of malpractice in my Mr. Hyde mode. The Paymaster General may care to reflect on my genuinely constructive suggestion concerning a series of convictions for particular offences that may or may not be repeated. I recollect that for certain offences it is possible to impose an escalator clause running at so much per day for a failure to comply, with the inference that it would be penally foolish to persist with the offence.
<P>
The Paymaster General might like to consider an escalator clause for people who were cocking a snook at the Bank in its reasonable request for information, under which it might cost them more by the day if they persisted in the offence than it would under the provision of continuing conviction. I do not stand firm on that point, but it is worth considering. I emphasise to the Committe that I understand the remit of the clauses and their concern with information on monetary policy. It is important that the provisions produce proper and proportional responses and that they are sufficiently tough to do the job for which they are intended.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Robinson:</B> The clause has nothing to do with fraud, but with supplying false or misleading information about an institution's eligible liabilities that are broadly deposit based, and the penalties that would ensue. The information required for the supervisory purpose is specified in the Banking Act.
<P>
I take on board the points made by the hon. Member for Daventry. It is right that the penalties have been marginally tightened. As he said, that is in line with the Statistics of Trade Act. The criminal sanctions have not been put on a drastic scale, but fraud is not involved. Given that the clause deals with the refusal to supply information or the supply of misleading information, sanctions must be in place.
<P>
It seemed sensible to include with the provision relating to the supply of misleading information the offence of providing false information. In that respect, the measure is not similar to the Statistics of Trade Act. The hon. Gentleman said that clauses 38 and 39 were acceptable to the Opposition and that was a sensible judgment to make.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Surely the Paymaster General is wrong to say that this is not a matter of fraud. For example, in the Barings case, vast sums could not have been transferred from London to Singapore without the bank changing its cash ratio deposit requirements under the new regime. Therefore, there would have been a statutory requirement on Barings to keep the Bank fully informed as to what it was doing and why. Under these provisions, Barings would have been asked precisely why that money was going to Singapore. Under clauses 17(1), 38 and 39, the bank could have been prosecuted for any criminal negligence on its part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> If the Bank obtained any information to suggest that such things were happening, it could use it. However, that is not the purpose of clauses 38 and 39. If the Bank receives such information, schedule 7(5) provides the necessary gateway through which it can be dealt. I know what the hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) is trying to do.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am mystified by the Paymaster General, who is not only my constituent but a near neighbour of mine in Bramley. The Opposition wish him nothing but well. If there is to be a Labour Government with a large majority for some time, the more their members have fundamentally Conservative sympathies, the better for the country.

Question proposed, That this schedule be the Eighth schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> There is one matter to which I wish to draw the Committee's attention. As I said in a previous debate, paragraph 6 provides that any consultation by the Financial Services Authority in connection with the banking supervision fee regulations undertaken prior to the Bill's coming into force is taken to satisfy the requirement to consult. That is simply to avoid doubt.
<P>
On reflection, we have concluded that similar provision should be made in relation to the other order-making powers in the Bill that impose an obligation to consult. In particular, we have in the mind the obligation on the Treasury to consult before making orders specifying the information that the Bank may collect for monetary policy purposes under clause 17.
<P>
On cash ratio deposits under schedule 2, for example, we do not wish there to be any suggestion that our consultation does not satisfy the statutory requirement. Therefore, the Government will table an amendment on Report to make the necessary provision.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoate-Amory:</B> I am grateful for that notice. We shall scrutinise the exact provision more closely on Report. Does the Paymaster General intend the consultation to be open? In other words, will all potentially interested bodies be notified of such a document's publication? Submissions--unless made in confidence--and summary results should be published and made available to the House before the Government take further action.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I can give the right hon. Gentleman the reassurance that he wants on the openness of the consultation period, but I doubt whether we can satisfy him on his other points.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 76, in page 16, line 17, after `may', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`after consulting the Governor of the Bank of England.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When an Act comes into force is of some importance. I am aware that it is not the end of the matter when Bills become Acts; often, it is not the start of it. Frequently, the implementation of the provisions is properly delayed, so that various plans can be laid and other arrangements made before the law takes effect. It is important that the major players in the implementation are ready.
<P>
The thinking behind the Bill is that the Bank of England be given additional responsibilities, some of which are entirely new. Other responsibilities are to be taken away--we debated at length the banking supervision functions. There is a two-way traffic, and the Bank is closely involved.
<P>
When the Government came to office, the Governor of the Bank of England was reported to be rather displeased at the proposed pace of change and the way in which he seemed to be taken for granted. The press contained rumours that he was near to resignation. I am sure that he is now fully satisfied with the Bill's main provisions, but the details are extremely important. Even today, we have come across details about which we remain dissatisfied and which are still unresolved. Government thinking about the relationship between the Financial Services Authority, the Bank of England and the Treasury is still rather embryonic. Some matters are for consultation, so by definition much thinking and planning has to be done before the Bill's main provisions are ready to be enacted and implemented.
<P>
Amendment No. 76 would ensure that the Bank of England is formally consulted about the commencement of the Act. The Government should consider that from their own point of view. I can promise them that, if there is a major regulatory failure concerning a bank, it will be alleged that it arose partly because the Bill had been implemented too quickly, without being properly thought out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does my right hon. Friend agree that it would be grossly improper and unhelpful if the transfer were to take place during any regulatory failure? The Governor would have a useful view on whether things had settled down enough for the transfer to take place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon. Friend is right and gives added weight to the request that the Governor be formally consulted. We all know that the Treasury is closely in touch with the Governor about a range of issues, but that is rather different from a statutory requirement. The amendment would give the Governor a lever to pull if he becomes seriously alarmed at some of the transfers or the speed at which they are being accomplished; he will be able to flag up his concerns more publicly.
<P>
If the amendment is accepted, Parliament will want to know that the Governor has been consulted. It may even be appropriate for the Governor to write to the Treasury outlining the precise steps that he has taken to ensure that the transfer of powers and the new arrangements are working to his satisfaction. That would be of considerable assistance to the Treasury and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
