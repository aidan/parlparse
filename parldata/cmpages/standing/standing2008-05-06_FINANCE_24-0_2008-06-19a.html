<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000750"></a>The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Jane Kennedy):</b> I can
clarify that there are 16 double taxation agreements. None are A8
countries; I was asked a specific question about that. The only one
that may be cause for concern is the double taxation agreement with
Fiji, but we anticipate that very few taxpayers would be affected as a
result.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000751"></a>The

am sure will be the order of the rest of this

Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): I think that small amounts of
chocolate are apparently the best quantities to eat.</div>
<a name="080619103000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are all
relieved that it is Fiji, but there are Fijian soldiers serving in Her
Majesty&#146;s armed forces, so I am sure that the MOD will be
reacting to that news and rushing forward with advice for Fijians
enlisted in the armed
forces.</div><a name="080619103000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have listened to the arguments advanced by the Minister about personal
allowances. We do have a difference of view here. It was never part of
our proposals on the charging of a levy on non-doms to remove their
personal allowances. We think that the impact on taxpayers could be
quite significant, and it will lead to complexity. The Minister is a
great advocate of choice for individuals, and we welcome that
conversion to choice, but it is going to be challenging for some people
to comply with the rules. It would have been more reassuring for all
those engaged in the debate if the preparations of Her Majesty&#146;s
Revenues and Customs had been further advanced to assist those on low
incomes to comply with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column822" />Column number: 822</div>these rules, but I do not wish at this point to push the amendment to a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000755"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> This is an extensive group of amendments and the
nature of them means that there are a number of issues to be discussed.
All of them are of interest to outside bodies in terms of seeking
clarification on the way in which the Government would interpret the
rules around
residence.</div><a name="080619103000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 363 picks up an issue that we will come back to in a later group of
amendments, as there is a Government amendment that covers that area.
Therefore, I will keep remarks on that point relatively brief and talk
at greater length later.</div>
<a name="080619103000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 363 deals with the issue that, where fees are incurred, the rules
at the moment focus on where the services arise. The amendment shifts
that focus from where the services are performed to where the services
are enjoyed. Under current rules, where a UK-based investment manager
manages an offshore trust, the payment of his fees is treated as a
remittance and therefore subject to tax.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column825" />Column number: 825</div><a name="080619103000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our amendment
would say that, as the trust is offshore, when fees are settled they
are not treated as remittance and therefore do not form part of the tax
liability of the UK resident non-dom. There may also be a remittance if
trustees of an overseas trust pay fees to investment advisers in the
UK, or pay for UK legal accounting or other professional advice
provided in the UK. In all those cases, the individual has not
benefited, and those are not the circumstances, I believe, that the
Government had in mind. I understand that the Government amendments
that introduce new section 809SA seek to address those issues and I
will come back to that when we debate the relevant amendments
later.</div>
<a name="080619103000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The changes
created widespread concern among the investment management industry and
elsewhere. I know that British Bankers Association wrote to the
Minister on 20 March highlighting its concerns about the extended
definitions of remittances as set out in new section 809H. It indicated
that one of its private banking members was considering moving a
significant part of its operations overseas as a consequence of the
effect of new section 809H. We want to try to refocus that by saying
that, rather than looking at where the service is performed, we should
look at who is enjoying the service and where those services are
enjoyed. That is why we believe that any fees paid by an offshore trust
would not be deemed to be a remittance.</div>
<a name="080619103000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is an
important issue. In the UK we are very skilled at providing investment
management expertise and there was a concern that as new section 809H
was drafted that would significantly impact on the effectiveness of
London as a place to do business and would potentially affect the
investment in equities in the UK and other assets. As a consequence, we
seek to shift that focus from where the service is provided to where it
is enjoyed, in a relatively simple way, to avoid a tax being charged on
remittances to pay those fees.</div>
<a name="080619103000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">I move on to
amendments Nos. 364 to 374. As well as introducing a &#163;30,000
charge for non-doms who have been in the UK for at least seven of the
last 10 years, the Bill makes radical changes to the way in which the
remittance basis will operate. It allows individuals who are resident
for tax purposes in the UK but not domiciled here to be taxed on income
and gains from outside the UK only to the extent that such income and
gains are received or enjoyed&#151;that is, remitted to the UK.
Clearly the Government have taken the opportunity of the introduction
of the charge to deal with various loopholes and anomalies, which they
consider would allow remittance users to bring funds into the UK
without paying UK tax on their overseas income and gains. In
particular, the Government have sought to change the law to prevent
individuals from giving away overseas taxable income and gains to a
third party, such as a relative, who can then arrange for the
individual to use or enjoy those funds in the UK without a tax
liability arising.</div>
<a name="080619103000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">To deal with
that potential source of mischief, in proposed new section 809L on page
157, there have been wide-ranging changes so that where such funds are
brought to the UK by a relevant person, which is defined to include
many of an individual&#146;s relatives as well as trusts and
companies with which the individual 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column826" />Column number: 826</div>has a connection, that will be treated as a remittance by the individual
of income or gains and therefore may be taxable.</div>
<a name="080619103000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
some practical issues around that that I want to explore. It leads to a
situation where there are transactions taking place which are not
intended to achieve a tax advantage, and I think that that partly stems
from the fact that the definition of a relevant person is too wide and
results in a number of problems. As a consequence, our amendments Nos.
364 to 374 seek to narrow the definition of who a relevant person is
and restrict the definition to close family members only.</div>
<a name="080619103000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me give
some examples where the current rules give rise to some problems. The
first is grandchildren under the age of 18. A relevant person does not
include a child over the age of 18 but does include a grandchild under
the age of 18&#151;that is in new section 809L(2)(d). That could
impose considerable burdens of compliance, since an individual will be
taxed by reference to the actions of others, of which the individual
will be completely unaware. For example, it would require an individual
who has given funds to their adult child outside the UK to report a
remittance if that adult child provided a benefit to their own minor
child in the UK. One example has been given&#151;funds to purchase a
railway ticket for them&#151;but clearly there are much wider
examples than that. It means that the grandparent would be responsible
for reporting transactions that his grandchild might undertake, without
necessarily having knowledge of what the grandchild&#146;s parent, or
the child, will actually do. There is an issue there about compliance
that we need to think about
carefully.</div><a name="080619103000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
charitable trusts, new subsection (2)(g) adds a further new category of
relevant person:</div>
<a name="080619103000662"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the trustees
of a settlement of which a person falling within any other paragraph of
this subsection is a settlor or
beneficiary&#148;</div><a name="080619103000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
again could cause a number of problems. I will focus on one now which
will create particular problems for charitable trusts established by
non-domiciled, but UK-resident settlors. The concern is that that would
deter the trustees of such a charity from investing in UK assets, so as
not to give rise to a remittance for the settlor. From a practical
point of view for the settlor, they are in an invidious position. They
could never be in a position to complete a self-assessment return
without having had detailed information regarding the investment
activity of any trust that they have established since 5
April 2008 and where they have used unremitted foreign income or gains
to do so.</div>
<a name="080619103000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure
that I could come up with further examples, but I do not think that it
is necessarily in the interests of the debate to go down that route.
However, it shows that the current definition of related person in new
section 809L is very widely drafted. I understand that it is drafted
widely to prevent new loopholes arising, but it creates problems for
compliance in the two examples that I have quoted. That is why
amendments Nos. 364 to 374 replace the broader definition of relevant
persons to one that covers immediate family members, so that the tax
liability will arise only in circumstances in which that individual,
his spouse or other minor children receive a benefit other than an
incidental, or otherwise minor, benefit.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column827" />Column number: 827</div><a name="080619103000690"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div><a name="080619103000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
now turn to amendment No. 374 on mixed funds. The schedule sets out a
particular order in which funds should be deemed to be remitted and
that is a change from the previous guidance on mixed funds. Mixed funds
are derived from various sources such as funds from before the
individual became a UK resident, gifted funds, funds derived from UK
income and gains and funds derived from foreign income and gains. In
the tax years prior to 2008-09, there were no statutory rules on the
treatment of remittances from mixed funds and one followed the
prevailing non-statutory practice. Now we have the statutory provisions
in the Bill which will apply to transfers from mixed fund accounts
where the foreign income or foreign gains have arisen after 6 April
2008.</div><a name="080619103000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will not go through the order in which these funds are remitted, but
they start with employment income subject to UK tax, relevant foreign
earnings where there is no foreign tax credit, foreign-specific
employment income where there is no foreign tax credit, relevant
foreign income where there is no foreign tax credit and so on. Towards
the end of the list, in (f), (g) and (h), the funds are deemed to be
from sources that are subject to foreign taxes. My amendment changes
the order so that where there is income or gains from overseas that has
been subject to foreign tax, it is deemed that they are remitted first,
in preference to the untaxed income or gains. This reflects the current
treatment and was set out in statement of practice 5/84. That statement
of practice is more favourable to the taxpayer than the current order
set out in new section
809P(4).</div><a name="080619103000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do not believe that this unfavourable change has been adequately
highlighted in the explanatory notes. We think that it is
counter-intuitive and that it is penal to tax previously untaxed income
before income that has already suffered tax. There is also a risk that
taxpayers will not understand the rules. Well advised taxpayers will
not operate mixed accounts, so it will be unrepresented taxpayers and
those who make mistakes whose tax liability will be increased under
these
provisions.</div><a name="080619103000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Leaving
aside the problems with the order of identification in new section 809P
(4), I believe that the proposals are over-complex. The record keeping
required to identify all sources of funds so as to categorise them
correctly will present a problem for the unrepresented taxpayer,
identifying remittances from mixed funds has always been extremely
difficult, but codifying a rigid set of matching rules takes away the
flexibility and ability to be pragmatic that existed previously. There
is, therefore, a significant danger of inadvertent compliance, which is
heightened by the fact that the rules apply from 6 April 2008, so there
is no time to educate affected taxpayers in advance&#151;by the time
this Bill receives Royal Assent, we will be a quarter of the way
through the tax year and people may well have made remittances from
mixed funds without knowing and understanding the new rules. It would
be helpful if HMRC would publish a statement as to how it plans to
assist taxpayers with the additional compliance burden that this brings
about.</div>
<a name="080619103000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
weakness in this area is how overseas expenditure transfers between
overseas accounts or gifts made overseas from mixed accounts is to be
treated. I think that this has already been raised with HMRC and I do
not know whether there will be further amendments, but we hope that the
Minister will be able to clarify  that the interaction of new
section 809Q(2) and new 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column828" />Column number: 828</div>section 809P means that the amount of income or capital of the
individual for the relevant tax year in mixed account immediately
before the transfer does not include funds that have been removed from
the account by earlier transfers or payments either to the UK or
overseas.</div><a name="080619103000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to the treatment of mixed funds and the change in the order in
which they are to be remitted, our proposal would put in place the
concession that has existed in statement of practice 5/84 and reflects
the fact that that treatment was more favourable to the taxpayer than
the new rules are designed to
be.</div><a name="080619103000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment No. 495, it is not clear what happens if overseas earnings
from employment income are used to pay the &#163;30,000 remittance
charge by means of a cheque payable to HMRC drawn on an overseas bank
account. This is quite a technical point, so I will go slowly. On the
face of it, such an example would not be a remittance under new section
809S. However, while amendments to the Income Tax (Earning and
Pensions) Act 2003 specifically import new sections 809K to 809Q of the
Income Tax Act 2007 into it, no mention is made of new section 809S. As
those are two separate Acts, that suggests that new section 809S does
not apply in determining whether relevant foreign earnings have been
remitted. Is that
clear?</div><a name="080619103000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000756"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b><b class="B"> </b>The hon. Gentleman is getting his own
back.</div><a name="080619103000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000757"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am indeed. If that explanation is right, it would
have been highly misleading of HMRC not to have made that point clear
when it said that the direct payment of &#163;30,000 would not create
a remittance. It may be that new section 809S is for reassurance only
and that the direct payment would not in any event create a remittance
under new sections 809K to 809Q. The payment is not a remittance of
cash by the taxpayer, HMRC is not a relevant person and the payment is
not a gift to the UK Government. Perhaps the Government would like
there to be more gifts like that, but it is certainly not the case in
this
example.</div><a name="080619103000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
also doubt whether in this example the amount will be a relevant debt,
as it will be brought into the UK by HMRC for the benefit of the
Exchequer, not for the benefit of the taxpayer. HMRC will not be
providing a service to the
taxpayer.</div><a name="080619103000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
position is unclear. It would be helpful if the Financial Secretary
could provide clarification. Amendment No. 495 would provide some
clarification by inserting &#147;and 809S&#148; after
&#147;809Q&#148; on line 30 of page 202 in schedule 7. I hope that
she will comment on that and provide clarification and
reassurance.</div><a name="080619103000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000758"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> It would be great if the immediate answer to that
question was simply yes or no, but I fear that it will be somewhat more
lengthy.</div>
<a name="080619103000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before I get
into the detail of the group, will the hon. Member for Fareham permit
me to give a more substantive response to his questions about fees when
we come to discuss Government amendment No.
354?</div><a name="080619103000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government amendments in this group deal with a number of issues that
were raised in consultation. First, Government amendment No. 483
narrows the scope of the definition of &#147;relevant person&#148;.
Under the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column829" />Column number: 829</div>original wording, trustees of settlor-interested trusts were
automatically treated as relevant persons, even if the individual or
his close family members were not beneficiaries. This change will be
particularly helpful for charitable trusts, a point that the hon.
Gentleman asked about specifically. Following representations, we are
amending the definition of &#147;relevant person&#148; to ensure
that remittances to the UK by genuine charitable trusts will not be
taxable upon a settlor. The change we are making removes the risk that
the existing legislation might catch donors who did not arrange to make
a donation in a particular
way.</div><a name="080619103000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 486 prevents tax arising on remittance to the UK in certain
circumstances where items are remitted to the UK before the income or
gain to which they relate is treated as arising. Under the original
wording, such payments might in certain circumstances become chargeable
before the tax year in which they arose. The amendment ensures that
that cannot now happen. Amendments Nos. 463 and 465 to 468 change the
mixed funds rules, clarifying how transfers between offshore funds are
treated. This change is being introduced in direct response to
representations
received.</div><a name="080619103000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000759"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="080619103000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000760"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I am going to say more on mixed funds rules in a
moment.</div><a name="080619103000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000761"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I have a quick question on Government amendment No.
468. The Minister may well be coming on to this, but could she tell us
how people are meant to self-assess as a consequence of that
amendment?</div><a name="080619103000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000762"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I shall come to that. Amendment No.
468 is a direct attempt to deal with potential anti-avoidance
risks.</div>
<a name="080619103000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendments address issues that have been raised,
some of which we have already sought to address. We have some sympathy
with their aims. I realise that the &#147;relevant person&#148;
provisions have caused considerable debate. It has been said that the
changes will harm UK investment. I do not believe that our response to
those concerns has meant that that is still the case. If there was a
risk, I believe that we have reduced it substantially. The fundamentals
of the remittance basis remain in place. Non-domiciles can still bring
into the UK underlying capital and any taxed income and gains without
incurring a charge under the remittance basis. Our changes make the
remittance basis more sustainable.</div>
<a name="080619103000086"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080619103000763"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Greg Hands</b> (Hammersmith and Fulham) (Con): Has the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000764"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I have not seen that article, although I looked
at the <i class="I">Financial Times</i> today. I am aware of the concerns that
have been expressed, but I am also aware 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column830" />Column number: 830</div>from my informal discussions with representatives of the City of London
and so on, that there is now a great deal less anxiety than there was
when we first introduced the detailed draft clauses for consideration
in January. I will look at the article and the
report.</div><a name="080619103000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should like to comment briefly on the question of fees paid by offshore
trusts and whether they should count as a remittance. If the fees paid
were exempt, it would be possible for UK residents to fund their UK
lifestyles, such as school fees, medical fees&#151;I hesitate to say
nanny&#146;s fees&#151;which non-remittance basis users patently
could not. I believe that that is an unfair outcome, but neither would
it make any clear contribution to competitiveness, which the Government
amendments
do.</div><a name="080619103000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000765"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I just wanted to touch on the issue of fees. My
amendment, which leads the group, says that because the services of the
driver, the nanny, the cook or the butler happen to be undertaken and
enjoyed in the UK, they would still be covered by the remittance rules.
However, where services are enjoyed offshore, for example if a trust
managing UK-based investments is based offshore, they will not be
covered. Services enjoyed in the UK would be caught, but not the
investment fees charged to an overseas trust. We may have a longer
debate on that
later.</div><a name="080619103000691"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30
pm</div><a name="080619103000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000766"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I would rather do that later, and it is likely
that we
will.</div><a name="080619103000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
changes in response to representations make the remittance basis more
sustainable. Following consultation, we have made some changes. For
example, we have introduced certain exemptions for existing funds.
Those set up before 6 April will continue to be able to invest tax free
with their existing funds, as long as the individual does not provide
further
funds.</div><a name="080619103000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
argument about the definition of &#147;relevant person&#148; is
interesting. The relevant person rule prevents a significant amount of
tax avoidance, whereby people could simply give something to another
individual to import. Stopping that abuse was always going to be
unpopular, but we had to strike a balance. We have got the balance
right by focusing the rules on close individuals and immediate family,
rather than using the much wider definition that we originally
proposed. The inclusion of a minor grandchild as a relevant person
follows broadly the same approach as that used to determine whether a
non-resident trust is settlor-interested, except that the non-resident
trust rules also include adult grandchildren. Individuals giving
unremitted money or assets offshore to a relevant person would need to
make arrangements with that person, to enable them to keep track of any
remittances to the UK. I acknowledge that there is complexity there for
the
taxpayer.</div><a name="080619103000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 374 would cut across the Government&#146;s amendments in this
area by changing the ordering rule within the mixed-fund rule. There
are various ways in which the mixed-fund rule could be ordered, and the
way we have chosen again strikes a balance between fairness and
simplicity. The ordering treats employment income as arising first and
is therefore favourable to the taxpayer, as the hon. Member for Fareham
suggests. That income has already been taxed and cannot be taxed again.
However, it discourages avoidance by making 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column831" />Column number: 831</div>untaxed income and gains come out next. Representative bodies obviously
would prefer the ordering rule to treat untaxed and already taxed
income and gains as remitted first, but that would prolong an
avoidance. Taxpayers still have the choice about whether they use a
mixed fund. If they do not, the rule does not
apply.</div><a name="080619103000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000767"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Well-advised taxpayers&#151;the sort of people
who might seek to use the rules for avoidance&#151;would tend not to
have mixed funds. I am particularly concerned that those people who are
not represented, who know what the previous rules were, would find it
potentially more difficult to comply with these rules. Changing the
ordering may make it more difficult for the unrepresented taxpayer to
comply.</div><a name="080619103000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000768"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. My
understanding is that the vast majority of those using the funds would
not be in that position; they would be getting good advice. However, I
would want to consider whether his point is
valid.</div><a name="080619103000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand the purpose of amendment No. 495, and would like to assure
hon. Members that the exemption in new section 809S applies to untaxed
foreign employment income as it does to other untaxed foreign income,
because of the provisions in new section 809J(1). I knew that it was
not a yes or no answer. As long as the payment is made directly to
HMRC, it will not be treated as taxable remittance. The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendment is technically deficient as it would be
made to the accrued income scheme provisions. However, I realise that
the legislation on that point might justifiably be described as a
little unclear. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his suggestion,
but if he will withdraw his amendment, I shall give serious
consideration to whether an amendment on Report would bring the desired
clarity to this
point.</div><a name="080619103000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall make one or two final points. The ordering rule, on which he
pressed me earlier, applies to funds remitted to the UK and so it is
irrelevant whether funds have gone elsewhere&#151;as long as it is
not within the UK. On amendment No. 468, I do not really understand why
he believes that there is a problem with how people are supposed to
self-assess. If he has examples of where that might be a problem, he
can write to me and I would be happy to give that some detailed
consideration and reply to him in relation to a more specific
case.</div><a name="080619103000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
the hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham drew my attention to the
article in the <i class="I">Financial Times</i>, and I know that others have seen
both that article and the report. However, on the survey, I shall
simply say that a survey by Barclays Wealth states that the residence
and domicile tax changes as they now stand, have not led to non-doms
leaving the UK&#151;that has not come from Government sources but
from independent sources. The report to which he is referring states
that the UK remains the most attractive place in the world for
non-domiciles. I hope that he will accept that reassurance. We are
conscious of the concerns in the business community about the changes
that we have proposed. I believe that our response has been measured
and responsible and I hope that the Committee will acknowledge
that.</div><a name="080619103000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000769"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Although I do not wish to trade reports with the
Minister, having read the press coverage of the Barclays report, my
recollection was that one of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column832" />Column number: 832</div>reasons for non-doms not leaving the UK was the difficulty they were
having selling houses in this troubled housing market. We understand
the issues, but we are concerned that there is still a lack of clarity
on some of the measures and that some work will have to be done to
produce guidance to help taxpayers achieve their
goals.</div><a name="080619103000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000770"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I do not wish to prolong the debate, but on the
point about clarity, will he accept that the remittance basis remains a
complex area. We have gone a long way to try to help clarify that, but
there will still be many instances where people with complex
arrangements will probably need a lot of professional advice on how
they manage their
affairs.</div><a name="080619103000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000771"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am sure that outside advisers will be delighted
to hear that people using remittance basis will continue to need to use
their services&#151;they will be reassured about that. I might touch
on some of these issues in the next group of amendments, but I suspect
that there is more work to be done in this area and that some of the
matters relating to the way in which this debate has developed in
recent months do give rise to some problems. I am grateful to the
Minister for agreeing to look into amendment No. 495 and how that might
be dealt
with.</div><a name="080619103000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment No. 365, although the Minister prays in aid precedents from
trust legislation, I still believe that we are in danger of potentially
creating quite a difficult regime for people to comply with. Although
the wealthier end of the non-dom market might be able to find advice
and put structures in place to ensure that their adult children report
to them gifts or transfers that they have made to grandchildren, the
legislation captures so many people that some taxpayers will
inadvertently be caught in this net&#151;through no fault of their
own, but because of the complexity of the rules. It would be better to
have a more restricted definition of relevant persons. I am
disappointed that the Minister has not moved on that. However, I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000774"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> There is one issue that I want to raise under
amendment No. 375; and then, under amendments Nos. 399 to 401, I shall
deal with some broader concerns about the handling of the
legislation.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column834" />Column number: 834</div><a name="080619103000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment
No. 375, the accepted position prior to 6 April 2008, where a
foreign-domiciled individual gifted foreign-sited assets, was that once
the deemed gain was realised, it could not be remitted, as the gain was
not represented by any money or money&#146;s worth in the hands of
the individual making the gift. Accordingly, provided that there was a
genuine gift, with the donee&#151;who could be the trustee of an
offshore settlor-interested trust&#151;assuming full and unfettered
control of the property gifted, the gain arising on the making of the
gift could never be accessible. The HMRC capital gains tax manual, at
CG25331, sets out the position as
follows:</div><a name="080619103000663"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where
an individual assessable on the remittance basis has gifted foreign
assets to another person and has not received any disposal proceeds he
or she may still be deemed to have realised a gain on the disposal. As
that gain is not represented by any money or moneys worth in the hands
of the individual making the gift, it is not possible for the
individual to remit the gain. The gain arising on the making of the
gift can therefore never become
assessable.&#148;</div><a name="080619103000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is, I think, a clear statement of where practice prior to 6 April 2008
led
people.</div><a name="080619103000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new section 809R set out in schedule 7 creates some uncertainty in the
minds of advisers as to meaning. The optimistic, preferred best
interpretation is that new section 809R does not apply in relation to
gains that arose prior to 6 April 2008. It is understood that that is
also the view of HMRC. Accordingly, the old legislation states that,
provided that there was a genuine gift, there would be no tax liability
on the gain that arose when the gift was made. While it has been
helpful for HMRC to have made its view known, doubt and concern still
remain.</div><a name="080619103000692"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45
pm</div><a name="080619103000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
potential sums will often be significant, and it is likely that
inadequate records will have been kept to establish the position since,
at the time, the law was clear that there could never be a tax charge
as a result of the gift. Accordingly, taxpayers who made gifts of
foreign assets offshore prior to 6 April 2008 will be concerned by the
split in opinion; some suggest that new section 809R could exist
retrospectively. Taxpayers who made absolute unfettered gifts of
foreign assets offshore prior to 6 April 2008 had a legitimate
expectation that the gain deemed to have been realised on the making of
the gift would never come into charge. The new legislation should be
clear, which is why amendment No. 375 seeks to
insert:</div><a name="080619103000664"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
section shall not have effect with respect to gains accruing to an
individual on the disposal of an asset if the disposal took place prior
to 6 April
2008.&#148;</div><a name="080619103000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
makes the position clear so it is beyond doubt that new section 809R is
not meant to have a retrospective impact. Advisers would be grateful
for that conformation, and would perhaps be even more
grateful&#151;as would I&#151;if the Minister felt obliged to
accept the amendment, but when she hears what I am about to say next,
she probably will not.</div>
<a name="080619103000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
concerned about the process that we have gone through to get to this
point, which is why amendments Nos. 399 to 401 seek to defer the
commencement of major parts of the schedule to the start of the 2009-10
tax year, with one exception. Assuming that my drafting is correct, the
amendments do not seek to defer the &#163;30,000 charge. We have
different views about the amount 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column835" />Column number: 835</div>of and the timing of the charge. Although we do not believe that it
should be deferred, the complex rules surrounding the changes should
be. Today&#146;s debate is proof of why deferral of commencement is
important.</div>
<a name="080619103000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Last
Thursday night the Government tabled, I think, 90 amendments to the
schedule, in addition to several earlier batches of amendments. Can the
Minister tell the Committee how many amendments have been tabled to
schedule 7 and whether that is a record number of amendments to a
schedule in a Finance Bill? The volume of amendments is indicative of
two things: first, the willingness to listen to the concerns raised by
representative bodies during this process, and I give credit for that;
and secondly, the state of the legislation when it was first published
a couple of months ago. I suspect&#151;I think that the Minister may
have confirmed it this morning&#151;that this is not the end of the
amendments to the schedule and that we will see more tabled on
Report.</div>
<a name="080619103000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The overall
volume of amendments tabled is, in a way, reflected in the volume of
amendments that I have tabled to the schedule. It reflects how the
changes to very complex areas of taxation have been dealt with in a
tight time scale. In October, the Chancellor announced a series of
measures in the pre-Budget report: on the charge, the denial of
allowances, changes to day-counting rules and on addressing anomalies
in the rules on remittances. He promised consultation, and a document
was published on 6 December 2007&#151;just four months before the
rules were to come into effect. Draft legislation was published on 18
January, which triggered much of the outcry about the
Government&#146;s intentions. John Cullinane of the Chartered
Institute of Taxation
said:</div><a name="080619103000665"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;but
one of the unfortunate things is the way in which these proposals came
in unannounced, caused brouhaha, and then were subject to a lot of
compromises and have generally gone off at half cock. The result of all
that is that any kind of genuine, rational, consultative look at the
whole thing, to see how we can best give effect to this principle, that
the greater your connection with the UK the more of a burden you should
bear, has just been ruled out and we have a very complicated regime
with as many anomalies as
before&#148;.</div><a name="080619103000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
are quite harsh words from someone who is known to be measured in his
comments about Government tax
policy.</div><a name="080619103000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Malcolm
Gammie from the Institute for Fiscal Studies said that the draft
legislation</div><a name="080619103000666"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;apparently
went very much further and had a very much greater impact than had
generally been
anticipated&#148;.</div><a name="080619103000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
summarised the problem as
follows:</div><a name="080619103000667"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
think that really the general uncertainty it generated as to what
precisely the rules were going to be, how wide-ranging they were going
to be, really led to the degree of outcry that there was and the
publicity it
obtained&#148;.</div><a name="080619103000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that that is a fair statement. The volume of comment in the
aftermath of the publication of those draft rules was significant, and
there was a sense that they went further than the Chancellor&#146;s
original intentions. As a consequence of opposition from investment
managers, tax advisers and the art market, Dave Hartnett was forced to
publish a letter clarifying the changes on 12 February,
which was widely seen as yet another climbdown by the Government on
their tax policy.</div>
<a name="080619103000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
Budget, there were further concessions on assets to be remitted into
the UK and the applicability of the charge on children and spouses. The
de minimis 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column836" />Column number: 836</div>limit was increased from &#163;1,000 to &#163;2,000, as we discussed
earlier, and there were relaxations on CGT and offshore
mortgages.</div>
<a name="080619103000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">One might
have thought that that was a settled position and that after that the
consultation would be perfect, but from the moment the Bill was
published it was recognised that the content was incomplete. The
explanatory notes flagged that
up:</div><a name="080619103000668"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Some
of the clauses in the published version of the Finance Bill 2008 are
not wholly
complete.&#148;</div><a name="080619103000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is an understatement, given the volume and complexity of amendments
that have been tabled. The explanatory notes went further and stated
that there would be further discussions with interested parties, and
there was an open day for advisers at the beginning of this month. The
explanatory notes
stated:</div><a name="080619103000669"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Further
changes will be introduced by way of Government amendments during the
course of the
Bill.&#148;</div><a name="080619103000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is where we are today, discussing a long series of amendments that
arose from that process.</div>
<a name="080619103000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Institute of Chartered Accountants, when commenting on the schedule,
said:</div><a name="080619103000670"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
are however concerned that a significant part of the legislation
remained unfinished even as it came into effect on 6 April
2008. We understand that this is to enable the final legislation to be
comprehensive and workable but are surprised that it was thought
appropriate to lay before Parliament legislation that is admitted to be
&#145;incomplete.&#146;&#148;</div><a name="080619103000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
way in which the changes have been made has also caused concern. Ian
Menzies-Conacher from the British Bankers Association summed it up very
well when he gave evidence to the House of Lords Committee on Economic
Affairs, saying that</div>
<a name="080619103000671"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;on balance it
would have been better to have deferred [the proposals] for a year to
allow a lot of the detailed problems that they are now seeing emerge to
be resolved properly...we are rapidly running out of time in the
present Finance
Bill.&#148;</div><a name="080619103000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Here
we are, debating those two hours before the Committee is scheduled to
adjourn. Some constructive discussions are taking place with officials
and problems have been addressed, but late in the process. There is a
great danger in drafting against rigid timetables, as we are almost as
likely to create new problems as we are to solve old ones&#151;that
is the nature of drafting in a hurry. That concern was flagged up in
February when the Institute of Chartered Accountants
said:</div><a name="080619103000672"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;HM
Treasury confirmed to us in a meeting in February 2008 that the
overwhelming message from the representations that they had received
had recommended deferring the more complex measures to enable workable
legislation to be
drafted.&#148;</div><a name="080619103000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
the rules are finally determined, they will apply from 6 April 2008.
Yet no one knows what they are going to be, as they are subject to
further changes. This is an unreasonable situation for taxpayers. It
will lead to confusion as the rules settle down and could lead to
significant non-compliance in a system that is known for a very high
degree of compliance. Many taxpayers will be making remittances without
knowing their effect, which could turn out to be expensive if they make
the wrong choice.</div>
<a name="080619103000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Government are not willing to postpone the changes until 6 April 2009,
an alternative would be to ensure that the rules apply only from the
date of Royal Assent and that remittances prior to that can be ignored.
This is hastily drafted legislation which people have had relatively
little time to digest, and there is concern that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column837" />Column number: 837</div>even the amendments tabled by the Government in response to concerns
raised by tax advisers do not appear to address adequately all the
underlying
concerns.</div><a name="080619103000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
fear that, by the time we get to Royal Assent, some issues will be left
unresolved, and we will then be in a situation where we rely upon
guidance being generated. People will look to the &#147;frequently
asked questions&#148; section of the HMRC website for answers. There
is a lot of work to be done to enable taxpayers to comply with these
rules, and the Minister gave an indication of the type of work that
needs to be done during the earlier debate about de minimis
limits.</div><a name="080619103000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">No
one underestimates the amount of work that has taken place so far and
the amount that needs to be done going forward to make this work. We
are in a situation, a quarter of the way through the tax year in which
the Finance Bill gains Royal Assent, where there has been significant
uncertainty about how the rules will apply. The Government should step
back from this and understand some of the concerns they have created by
the way the legislation has been introduced. There are lessons to be
learned about how these changes should have been made. Consultation in
this area has apparently been going on since 2003, and there has been a
sudden acceleration and pick-up in pace since the pre-Budget report. I
am not quite sure what triggered that interest in amending these rules,
but clearly a lot of work has had to be done and is not entirely
finished. It is a lesson that we should all learn, on both sides of the
House, about how not to make tax
policy.</div><a name="080619103000143"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080619103000775"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Field</b> (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con): My
hon. Friend the Member for Fareham is too polite to say that there has
been a little too much politics involved in some of these proposals.
While I accept that elements of this have been in play for five years
since the initial consultation process in 2003, breakneck speed has
apparently been required since October 2007 in order to get changes on
to the statute
book.</div><a name="080619103000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I mentioned earlier, I have considerable sympathy with elements of what
the Government are trying to achieve. I represent a constituency that
contains the City of London, and have therefore heard some of the
somewhat hysterical response to changes regarding non-doms. Some of the
points raised are true, but other elements have been overplayed, not
least because there is a level of uncertainty, about which I will say
more
later.</div><a name="080619103000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also represent a large residential population in some of the most
expensive real estate in the country, and it is a big concern, not only
in the City of London, Westminster and Greater London, but beyond, in
the home counties. There is real concern among people I speak to,
particularly those in their 50s and 60s, who worry about how on earth
their children are ever going to be able to have a quality of life akin
to the one that they themselves have been accustomed to, particularly
in relation to house prices. There is a sense that much of the concern
has been focused unduly and slightly unfairly on the non-dom community
as an extremely wealthy group, which is regarded as not paying its way.
There is an element of truth in that, and those of us in the political
world have to understand that that sense of inequality could be very
damaging to the country if it is allowed to persist for
long.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column838" />Column number: 838</div><a name="080619103000693"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2
pm</div><a name="080619103000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
a significant number of non-domiciled individuals who live and work in
this country do not earn huge amounts of money. Their voices have been
almost silenced in this debate because it has focused on
multi-millionaires. Their influence and the fact that they appear to
pay little in direct tax because of the arrangements that they are able
to work with HMRC are resented by an increasingly large number of
people&#151;not just the usual suspects, but relatively
well-educated, middle-class, professional people who feel that they are
being priced out of the property market and private
schooling.</div>
<a name="080619103000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">This matter
needs to be addressed. The Government sensibly began this process in
2003, but it should have been an ongoing process and not accelerated as
it has been in the past nine months. As my hon. Friend the Member for
Fareham has rightly pointed out, when the Bill gets Royal Assent and as
we approach the next Budget, we are still likely to have a whole range
of uncertainties as people are being taxed. The risk is that we end up
with the worst of all worlds and people will assume the worst rather
than consider what is actually happening.</div>
<a name="080619103000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have some
sympathy with what the Government have tried to do. My party suggested
a sensible and relatively straightforward approach at the last Budget.
Rather than potentially open a can of worms by looking at the
arrangements for individuals overseas, we should have had a simple,
straightforward, one-off or annual charge for those with non-domiciled
status. I fear that politics have played too big a part in this issue.
I understand that we live in a political world, but we are,
unfortunately, also at a time in the economic cycle when these things
matter rather more than might have been the case two, three or four
years ago.</div>
<a name="080619103000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many of the
changes have not been properly thought through. The real risk to the
Government&#146;s credibility and, more importantly&#151;dare I say
it&#151;to the marketability of the UK across the world, is the sense
of uncertainty and almost incompetence that seems to be an everyday
part of the way in which the Government are addressing this issue. That
is regrettable. Representing the seat that I do, I can see both sides
of the argument. Time and again, I hear from people in the City who
say, &#147;This is appalling; we are going to lose loads of
non-doms.&#148; I do not think that there has been much evidence of
that happening yet, although my hon. Friend the Member for Fareham
might be right that the rather stagnant state of the property market
could be playing a part in that.</div>
<a name="080619103000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is wrong
that we should be held to ransom by any group in society, such as the
very rich, or by any organisation. We need to get the balance right,
which means that we must think through the implications of this sort of
legislation. My hon. Friend has skilfully pointed out time and again
things that have not really been thought through. There will be a total
lack of certainty. We live in a world and have a global economy in
which labour has been at its most mobile in human history. We cannot
afford to lose some of the brightest and best people. Those affected
will not all be the richest individuals, although some inevitably will
be, and will make a contribution beyond paying tax. Some of the very
wealthy pay significant amounts of tax, such as council tax and VAT on
their purchases, and often 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column839" />Column number: 839</div>employ many people. The non-domiciled sector therefore brings a range of
benefits to our economy. That argument must be put forward if there is
to be a balanced approach, which the Government have slightly
lacked.</div>
<a name="080619103000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have made
some rather general points, and my hon. Friend has put his finger on
more specific points. I fear that we are putting in place an
ill-thought-through, rather uncertain framework, which will create the
worst of all worlds. It will probably raise relatively little money and
will dissuade people who would otherwise come to our shores from coming
here. One has to remember that there are 20 million people a year
emerging in the middle classes in India and China together. Those two
countries have 4 million graduates a year. We would hope to attract, if
only for a short period, some of the brightest and best of that talent.
The real risk is that we are perhaps putting in place an
ill-thought-through and uncertain programme on non-domiciles which will
dissuade those people from coming here. There are other options and
they might go to Singapore, New York or Dubai. Such places will seem
attractive in the short or even the medium term. That is our broadest
concern.</div>
<a name="080619103000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Government will give real thought to the timetabling. We can try to
put back the implementation of this so that there is a proper and
rigorous system that will stand the test of time. The worst of all
worlds would be for us to reassemble here next year and the year beyond
and have to rewrite many of these provisions, not least because of the
unworkability that may have been introduced. We will be advised by too
many tax advisers about the loopholes that should have been thought
through at the outset.</div>
<a name="080619103000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thank you
for your indulgence, Sir Nicholas. I am sure that we will not have a
stand part debate. I hope that the Government and the Minister will
give us some assurances about exactly how see they this playing out in
the months and years
ahead.</div><a name="080619103000154"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000776"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I can fully support what the hon. Gentleman has
said about a stand part
debate.</div><a name="080619103000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000777"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I am not going to detain the Committee for long
but, I want to reinforce what has been said by my hon. Friends. It
strikes me that the whole process has been deeply flawed. The
consultation has been extremely poor, especially in relation to the
data. Seven months later, we are not really any closer to having any
more robust data.</div>
<a name="080619103000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a
question for the Minister. Going back to the Institute for Fiscal
Studies report and the pre-Budget report in October, the IFS outlined
various questions. I want to see whether the Minister has any answers.
What is her current estimate of the number of non-doms? How many have
unremitted foreign income above &#163;62,500 or &#163;80,000? How
much foreign income do the remainder have? How many does she believe
would leave the country if these proposals came into
force?</div><a name="080619103000157"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080619103000778"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jeremy Browne</b> (Taunton) (LD): I wonder whether the
Minister will draw on the expert analysis provided by the Government
when they estimated how many members would come from new accession EU
countries.</div><a name="080619103000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000779"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> That is a very valid point. I represent a
constituency where the current estimate is that 6 per cent. of the
population is Polish. In the last year we had 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column840" />Column number: 840</div>7,300 foreign nationals apply for a national insurance number. The
effect that these new regulations might have on the flow of people
could be considerable, particularly in a constituency like
mine.</div><a name="080619103000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
October, the IFS said that no one really knows the answers to these
questions. I am assuming that, after seven months, the Minister, when
faced with questions from a body such as the IFS, would be able to
provide some reasonably good
answers.</div><a name="080619103000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000780"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> There have been 135 Government amendments. I
checked that quickly myself scanning through the amendment paper. I say
to the hon. Member for Fareham&#151;other hon. Members will be
interested in this&#151;that that is not a record. The previous
record for a Finance Bill is more than 200. Guess when that was. It was
in 1995.</div>
<a name="080619103000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000781"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b>
<i class="I">rose&#151;</i></div><a name="080619103000162"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080619103000782"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Bob Blizzard</b> (Waveney) (Lab): Do not give way on
that.</div>
<a name="080619103000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000783"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Perhaps it is a sign of a Government coming to the
end of their life when so many amendments are tabled to Finance
Bills.</div><a name="080619103000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000784"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> My hon. Friend was right. I should not have given
way.</div>
<a name="080619103000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the very
specific point about unfettered gifts of foreign assets offshore, HMRC
made its view very clear in a frequently asked question some time ago.
In simple terms, it is only when such gifts were made after 6 April
2008 that they would be taxed. I would like to answer a little more
broadly than I would have done on these specific amendments, Sir
Nicholas. Following the pre-Budget report, we have shared clauses in
draft at the earliest opportunity. We actively looked to respond
quickly to the concerns that were aired within our overall policy aim.
Following the PBR in October, there was relatively muted reaction to
the proposals on residence and domicile, but our response has been
swift to concerns raised once the detailed clauses were put out in
draft.</div>
<a name="080619103000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
sought at every opportunity to address those concerns. That has
resulted in several changes to our original proposals, and numerous
improvements and simplifications to the Bill as first drafted. As has
been pointed out on other occasions, when the Government respond to
criticism, it is simply presented as a U-turn. One simply cannot win
when one seeks to address proper concerns that have some basis, and try
to amend the proposals accordingly.</div>
<a name="080619103000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the IFS
report, we have stated in both the PBR and the Budget that we assumed
there were about 3,000 people who might leave, but our assumption has
now fallen by about 400 as a result of the Budget changes. However, it
is an area in which it is very difficult to make assumptions. We have
not seen any convincing evidence that the numbers leaving the UK might
be higher. As I have said repeatedly, the UK remains an attractive
place to live, work and do
business.</div><a name="080619103000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000785"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> It is certainly helpful to have some estimates of
these numbers&#151;3,000 and the latest estimate 2,400&#151;could
she tell us a little bit about the methodology involved in arriving at
those estimates?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column841" />Column number: 841</div><a name="080619103000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000786"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> The fact is that we do not have hard data on many
of these, simply because there has not previously been a need for
people to declare their income offshore. So the hard data that he is
seeking are not immediately available either to us or to other
sources.</div>
<a name="080619103000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000787"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> The Minister says that we have no hard data, but
figures of 3,000 and 2,400 sound as if they have a certain amount of
precision. Can she at least tell us what factor has been most involved
in downgrading that estimate from 3,000 to
2,400?</div><a name="080619103000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000788"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> In large part it was the debate we held with
representative bodies about the changes we have made that led to the
clarity we were able to bring to the concerns in the early days.
Although the hon. Gentleman dismissed the letter that Mr David Hartnett
published, it did go a long way to allaying many fears about what the
changes mean to individuals.</div>
<a name="080619103000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000789"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I thank the Minister for giving way&#151;she has
been generous&#151;but I do not think that she has come any closer to
saying where the figures of 3,000 or 2,400 have come from. Have they
come from a consulted body, which seems to be her implication? If so,
presumably that body must have said what was driving the change. Is it
the decline in house prices, or is it something
else?</div><a name="080619103000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000790"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> The hon. Gentleman should not try to put words
into my mouth. I know that he is not trying to do it in a deliberately
mischievous way&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>I am being generous here.
But for me to go into detail about the way in which we arrive at these
assumptions would entail a great deal of debate in this Committee. I
suggest that it may be of more value if I look in detail at the
questions he has asked and see what data I can make available to the
Committee. I will write to him and share the letter with the
Committee.</div><a name="080619103000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should like to make a more general point, Sir Nicholas, particularly in
view of your advice on the stand part debate. Hon. Members criticised
the fact that we had made the decisions and the fact that we had plans
to proceed with the detail. The hon. Member for Cities of London and
Westminster said that, on balance, he preferred the Conservative
proposal, but that would have been for the flat rate charge of
&#163;25,000. Once a charge had been paid, no more questions would
have been asked about an individual&#146;s worldwide income. Their
proposal would not have addressed the issue of fairness to which he
rightly
alluded.</div><a name="080619103000694"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div><a name="080619103000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
was without question a great deal of awareness within the House of the
complaints of unfairness, but it is also important to bear in mind that
the Conservative proposal, unlike our proposal, would have charged
people from the day they arrived. The hon. Gentleman referred to Indian
graduates who could come here for a short time and then return to the
Indian sub-continent. We very much want to encourage people of quality
from around the world to come here. We would want them to come and,
having worked here, perhaps to stay longer. That is why we believe that
beyond seven years  it is right to invite remittance users to
make a greater contribution.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column842" />Column number: 842</div><a name="080619103000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">That brings
me back to the other main difference between the two proposals. The
Conservative proposal would have raised in the region of &#163;3.5
billion from a group of people&#151;roughly 120,000&#151;whereas
the tax take already is around &#163;13 billion. It is around
&#163;500 million now. We were inviting a greater
contribution, but a much more modest one than the Conservatives
proposed. That may be why the hon. Gentleman preferred their proposal.
That is not widely
appreciated.</div><a name="080619103000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
current arrangements for the taxation of non-domiciled people in the UK
are very generous. They serve the British economy well. In terms of
attracting the world&#146;s best talent to the UK we have now arrived
at a balance which maintains that. It is important to recall that the
changes that we propose do not affect all non-domiciles. They affect
those who choose to use the highly advantageous remittance basis. I
have responded in a broader way to a debate that has gone slightly wide
of the
amendment.</div><a name="08062034000001"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000791"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I think all reasonable people would recognise that
the Conservative party&#146;s proposals were laughably ill-conceived
and put together in a characteristically amateur fashion. I concede
that point to the Minister. What still seems strange is that the
Conservatives succeeded in panicking the Government into coming up with
a corresponding set of proposals which, judging by the number of
amendments, do not seem to have been much better thought-out than the
Conservative
ones.</div><a name="080619103000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000792"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I have drawn attention to the comments of the
hon. Member for Twickenham on the matter. I would not have
characterised the proposals put forward by the hon. Member for Fareham
as laughably
ill-conceived.</div><a name="080619103000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000793"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> Because you copied
them.</div><a name="080619103000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000794"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> We acknowledge that there was some merit in the
idea of a charge, but we did not agree with the way in which it was
proposed to levy it. We have arrived at the right balance. Our
proposals are reasonable and proportionate. They allow the remittance
basis to settle at a point at which it is now sustainable for the very
long-term future, without the shallow and partisan criticism that we
occasionally hear from the Lib Dem
Benches.</div><a name="080619103000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000795"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I thank the Minister for her clarification of what
I was seeking to tackle in amendment No. 375. I shall not therefore
push it to a vote. Any lingering ambiguity should have been dealt with
by her very clear statement on pre-April 2008 gains.</div>
<a name="080619103000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
Minister&#146;s response to the broader issues, she highlighted the
fundamental difference between the approach of our two parties, and the
reason why  the Government are in the mess they are in. When we
consulted on our proposals for a charge on non-doms, we recognised some
of the challenges there would be in trying to unpick the details of
anomalies. It is a complex area. I return to one of the comments that
was made in evidence to the House of Lords Select Committee: the
Government have probably created as many anomalies as they have closed
down.</div>
<a name="080619103000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
know whether I will be sitting on the Finance Bill Committee next year,
but I fear that we may come back to revisit this matter, if not in
terms of primary  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column843" />Column number: 843</div>legislation, perhaps in the form of guidance or some other way of
getting around the Chancellor&#146;s commitment to avoid reopening
the
topic.</div><a name="080619103000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
way in which issues other than the charge were dealt with created the
weight of opposition to some of the measures. The Minister was right:
there was an immediate response to the change announced in
October&#146;s pre-Budget report. When we announced our proposals in
October, there was support for them because they struck the right
balance between fairness and making sure we did not create more
problems than we were trying to resolve. There was support for our
proposals because they seemed proportionate and
reasonable.</div>
<a name="080619103000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government got into trouble because of the broadening of their
proposals when the consultation document came out, and particularly
when the draft legislation came out. That is one of people&#146;s
concerns, and the problems with the proposals and their complexity has
resulted in the process we are going through today to deal with 135
amendments in the space of six hours, or however many hours there are
in today&#146;s two sittings. I do not think it has created much
certainty for
taxpayers.</div><a name="080619103000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000796"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> For the record, although the Finance Act 1995 may
have had slightly more amendments, it was not guillotined by the
Government of the day, and therefore there was a chance to discuss in
full detail the various amendments that had been put forward, which has
not been the case with this
Bill.</div><a name="080619103000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000797"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I have to correct the hon. Member for
Cities of London and Westminster. The Bill is not guillotined or
programmed. We have to make that clear. That does, however, give me the
opportunity to say that we have&#151;in expectation only, not
according to a programme motion&#151;just over an hour and 35 minutes
to go, although it looks to me as though we will go on
longer.</div><a name="080619103000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000798"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Thank you, Sir Nicholas. As you said, Finance Bills
are traditionally not subject to programme motions and guillotines. In
the interest of moving the debate on to the gripping topic of fees, on
which I would like to say a few more words, I shall draw the debate on
this group to a close. I think the Government are reaping the problems
of acting in haste by trying to close down loopholes and anomalies, and
I feel that in some shape or form we will relive these moments with
pleasure, not only on Report, but in subsequent Bills. With that, I beg
to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000800"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Government have tabled an important amendment
because it addresses the wider concerns about the impact of changes in
the Bill on the competitiveness of the UK financial services sector. It
is important we get these things right and I want to tease out some of
the issues from the Minister.</div>
<a name="080619103000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment introduces two new conditions which, if met, mean that a
payment for a service does not become a remittance and therefore is not
subject to tax. Condition A is that the relevant UK service relates to
property situated outside the UK, and condition B is that the
consideration is given by way of payments to one or more bank accounts
held outside the UK by the person who provides the relevant UK service.
What constitutes property situated outside the UK? I am clear in my own
mind that it includes shares in overseas companies held by an offshore
trust, but I am not clear whether UK shares held by an offshore trust
would meet the definition
as</div><a name="080619103000196"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;wholly
or mainly property situated outside the UK.&#148;</div>
<a name="080619103000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">If UK shares held by
an offshore trust do not meet that condition, investment management
fees charged by a UK fund manager will be a remittance. My amendment
No. 363 sought to get around that by saying that as the fees related to
an offshore trust, the fees paid would not constitute a
remittance.</div><a name="080619103000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
is a service? There has been considerable debate about what a service
is in the context of VAT legislation, but one example that has been
suggested to me is whether travel in or out of the UK would count as a
service performed in the UK? Clearly checking in for a flight is more
than an incidental activity, but it is not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column845" />Column number: 845</div>wholly, or indeed mainly the activity, yet there is an element of the
cost that would be a UK service. Would payment for that element
constitute a remittance? Would the treatment differ if the travel was,
say, to an overseas property owned by the non-dom?</div>
<a name="080619103000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">Condition B
states that the payment must be made to an offshore bank account. Will
the Minister tell us why a UK-based service provider needs an offshore
bank account. Surely the main point is that the payment for the service
should go directly to the service provider. I am concerned that the
Government&#146;s proposals are in danger of becoming unnecessarily
onerous.</div><a name="080619103000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
new section 809SA (1)(b), may I also raise an issue about the service
being provided in the UK? It is common in many multinational service
companies for a client to be sent a single bill for all the
firm&#146;s activities on their behalf, but the subsection would
require those firms to issue separate bills. Is that really what the
Government are expecting people to do? My understanding is that for the
convenience of their clients, large, multinational accountancy firms
would try to raise a single bill to a client for services rendered by a
range of offices across the world, including their office in the UK,
rather than separate bills. Their own internal accounting arrangements
would deal with the rest. Is the Government really expecting companies
to raise a series of separate
invoices?</div><a name="080619103000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are practical issues, too. For example, if a US citizen resident in the
UK asks a UK-based firm of tax advisers to prepare their US tax return
and their fees are paid from offshore income or gains, does that count
as remittance, even though the work relates to an
offshore&#151;non-UK&#151;tax return? How is advice on gains and
investment income that could be linked back to offshore assets treated,
compared to advice on earned income? Would a UK-based firm advising on
that tax return have to submit different bills for different parts of
the advice? Should work on assets as opposed to employment income be
billed separately? There is a conflict, which I think the Financial
Secretary is trying to address. She alluded to it earlier when we
touched on payment for services received in the UK, where a non-dom
might seek to establish a service company as a means  of paying
the costs of nannies, drivers and other  personal
staff.</div><a name="080619103000695"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30
pm</div><a name="080619103000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
can see that the Financial Secretary is trying to close that loophole,
on this side of the equation. I understand the purpose of that.
However, on the other side, she is making it complicated for certain
professional firms to comply with the rules in a way that is
cost-effective and efficient for their clients. There is a tension
there that we have not resolved. While new section 809SA may deal
satisfactorily with the concerns of people in the investment management
community&#151;the issue of UK equities is still to be addressed by
the Financial Secretary&#151;it may create a ripple effect in other
professional services firms, which may be important to understand. I
appreciate that there is a challenge there for the Financial Secretary
to
address.</div><a name="080619103000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Law Society has raised with me some points about private equity. They
include the management fee, how the fees paid to the general partner
might be dealt 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column846" />Column number: 846</div>with, and whether investing in property wholly or mainly situated
outside the UK might disadvantage UK investments, as people may be less
inclined to invest in a UK partnership or UK assets. I suspect that
those representations have also been made to the Financial Secretary,
so hopefully she will be able to offer some clarification, rather than
my expanding on the points at
length.</div><a name="080619103000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000801"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> The hon. Gentleman asks a number of questions. It
became clear only recently that the issue he raises might be a problem.
As soon as I became aware of that, I moved quickly to address what
might have become a significant problem along the lines that the hon.
Gentleman described. It has been longstanding practice that the payment
for professional services under new section 809SA must be made outside
of the UK. We specifically asked representatives of the financial
services industry whether that would cause a problem, and they
confirmed that it would not. The provision of travel is not the
provision of a service in relation to a property outside of the
UK.</div><a name="080619103000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked whether the fees exemption would apply to
individuals who used a UK-based firm to advise on completing US
returns. That could be within the terms of the exemption. However, it
would depend on the details of the individual case. I am not
deliberately trying to avoid the question; it genuinely will depend on
the individual circumstances when the work is
considered.</div><a name="080619103000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000802"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for the
honesty of that answer. Could she expand on what factors people should
bear in mind when thinking about these invoices? To say that it depends
on the circumstances of the case is not terribly helpful to
professional advisers in that area. Some clarity this afternoon would
be helpful. Perhaps she might be able to say how HMRC intends to go
beyond what she says this afternoon in terms of providing support to
professional
firms.</div><a name="080619103000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000803"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> The amendment&#146;s intention was to construct
a change that would address all the concerns of the financial services
industry, the British Bankers Association and the City of London
regarding the impact of fees potentially becoming tangled up in the
remittance basis and the possible damage that that might do to the City
of London and the financial services industry, who receive a great deal
of business from resident non-domiciles even under the rules as they
stand. I do not want to be drawn into too much detail in Committee
where I, as a non-expert&#151;I freely admit&#151;may give an
answer that is either wider than intended or may mislead. My intention
was always to provide a response that met the concerns of the BBA,
which was the first to raise these issues, as well as the other
organisations.</div>
<a name="080619103000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Fareham asked for the definition of property held offshore,
and if UK assets are involved. The key point is that the trust is
offshore and that its assets, in whatever form&#151;whether shares or
other property&#151;are also offshore. Property takes its natural
meaning but certainly does cover shares, real estate, investments and
other assets. Again, what constitutes a service takes its natural
meaning.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column847" />Column number: 847</div><a name="080619103000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have to
recall that this is a self-assessment system; it is not one where
definitions apply directly to cases, but there will be guidance
available. It will, however, be up to the individual to self-assess. As
I have said, our aim in reforming the remittance basis and tabling this
amendment was to address the concerns raised with us by
representatives, particularly when it became clear that the definition
of remittance had the effect of treating the fees paid to the UK
service providers in respect of, for example, offshore investments, as
a remittance. I am assured that our amendment fulfils my commitment to
address that concern. The payment for the service must also be made
outside the UK for the exemption to
apply.</div><a name="080619103000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000804"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> How much are we talking about here? Are there very
small sums of money in these remittances, or something really quite
large? It would be helpful for the Committee to get some idea of the
magnitude of the sums involved in the
amendment.</div>
<a name="080619103000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000805"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> It is clear to me that our original proposals
were very much wider than we originally intended. So, where we sought
to prevent the payment of services that included the payment of school
fees and fees for other services, where it could be defined as a
service, people were paying with offshore funds and avoiding tax as a
result. We sought to prevent that as we did not think that that was
fair.</div>
<a name="080619103000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our original
drafting caught the very proper financial advice being offered by the
City of London about the fact that UK advisers would have become
uncompetitive in comparison with other financial centres and financial
advice that could be obtained abroad. We shifted the definition in
response to that criticism. All I can do is repeat the fact that I am
assured that this amendment addresses those concerns.</div>
<a name="080619103000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">It does not
mean that we would allow the payment of fees for the types of services
that I have described, which I do not think that the constituents that
the hon. Gentleman and I represent, who pay their taxes through the
arising basis without having the opportunity to use the remittance
basis, would consider to be fair. I believe that the amendment is a
good one and hope that it sees its way on to the statute
book.</div><a name="080619103000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000806"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am not sure that the amendment goes far enough.
In addressing the concerns raised by the BBA about investment
management and private banking fees, the Financial Secretary has gone
much of the way towards tackling this issue. However, there are further
considerations, such as the issue of US tax returns. I am a little
uncomfortable with her answer about assets based wholly or mainly
offshore. It appears that her proposal will restrict the ability of
offshore trusts to invest in UK equities, properties and so on. That
was the sense that I got from her remarks, but I do not intend to
oppose the amendment. However, I will look at her remarks in
<i class="I">Hansard</i> and we may wish to retaliate and table amendments on
Report.</div><a name="080619103000215"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000809"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> The Government amendments, apart from No. 357,
arose from discussions about the rules for the remittance basis
treatment of moveable property brought to the UK. Government amendment
No. 357 ensures that a reference to &#147;the Commissioners&#148;
is supported by an appropriate definition. I say that as a brief
opening comment and look forward to listening to the
debate.</div><a name="080619103000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000810"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I rise to speak to amendments Nos. 376 to 380 that
stand in my name and those of my hon. Friends. Amendments Nos. 376 and
377 relate to new sections that exempt certain property from remittance
provisions. I have a number of concerns about the interaction of these
sections, particularly in the case of property brought into the UK for
personal use. My overriding concern is that, with the exception of
property 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column849" />Column number: 849</div>brought in for public display, the exemptions apply only if the property
derives from foreign income; that excludes things like
gains.</div><a name="080619103000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am unable to understand the logic of that restriction. It appears to
complicate the law unnecessarily, particularly for the unrepresented
taxpayer, who may well not appreciate the distinction. For example,
when a Polish builder flies into the country, he will have to think
about whether he is wearing a watch that he bought from the proceeds of
the sale of his flat, rather than with relevant foreign income. It
would aid compliance with the rules if he or she were able to exclude
clothing, jewellery and watches bought from any source of income. I
would like justification from the Financial Secretary of why relevant
foreign income is so important in this
matter.</div><a name="080619103000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment No. 378, the provisions on exempt property are currently far
too complicated. They are difficult to understand and are unlikely to
be workable in practice. I should like to illustrate, using a few
examples, some of the anomalies that might arise with items of personal
use property.</div>
<a name="080619103000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such
property, which is defined as clothing, footwear, jewellery and watches
costing under &#163;1,000, is exempted under new sections 809T(4) and
809T(5)(a). Under new section 809U(3), if the item is sold whilst in
the UK, there is remittance of the original cost at the time of sale
even if the item is sold for &#163;1. If it is sold in the UK while
it is physically overseas, there is no remittance. There is no
remittance if the item is scrapped or gifted in the UK or if it is
stolen. That remains the case even if it is insured and moneys are
received in settlement of an insurance
claim.</div>
<a name="080619103000696"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45
pm</div><a name="080619103000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
item of personal use property that costs more than &#163;1,000 is
exempt only under new section 809T(4). If it is gifted while in the UK
to anyone other than a relevant individual, even to a charity shop, the
cost of the item becomes a remittance at that date under new section
809U(4), but there is no remittance if the item is gifted to an
overseas charity shop while abroad. There is remittance of the cost of
the item if it is scrapped or stolen in the UK, but not if it is
scrapped or stolen overseas. If, however, it had been in the UK for
fewer than 275 days and the non-domiciled individual could show that it
was taken overseas after it was stolen, which is, admittedly, unlikely,
there will not be remittance.</div>
<a name="080619103000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a gift is
made of the item by a non-domiciled individual to their infant child,
there is no remittance as it continues to meet the personal use rule
under new section 809W(2). When that child reaches 18, however, a
remittance will arise if the property is in the UK, but not if it is
overseas on that day, even if it is brought back to the UK on the
following day. Those provisions are not very straightforward, and I
hope that my amendments would make them more comprehensible and
accessible to the taxpayer, although I suspect that my explanation
might not be particularly comprehensible or accessible to the average
taxpayer.</div><a name="080619103000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendments Nos. 379 and 380, many of the original rules on public
display, and in the Minister&#146;s amendments, mirror the VAT
treatment of relevant items. I should be interested to hear why the VAT

<div class="Column"><a name="Column850" />Column number: 850</div>treatment should be used as a basis. My amendment No. 380 would broaden
the location type beyond museums to any place where there is public
access. I understand that the Treasury runs a scheme for other assets
in which tax is waived or held over if an asset is available for public
access. For example, we have artwork in the House, which has
arrangements for people to visit, but it is not deemed to be a museum.
Could the exemption be extended to cover such arrangements? I should
like to go beyond the Government&#146;s amendment, which extends the
exemption to commercial auction houses. Could we go further than
that?</div><a name="080619103000233"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000811"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I thought that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
explanation was very clear, if I may compliment him.</div>
<a name="080619103000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
amendments, which we have tabled in response to representations that we
have received, clarify the conditions under which property that is
brought to the UK will not trigger a tax charge under the remittance
basis. The changes will ensure that the legislation works as intended,
and will make things clearer for taxpayers and their advisers in this
complex area. They will deliver the final parts of the new scheme that
we are introducing to allow people to bring works of art to the UK for
public display without triggering a remittance-basis tax
charge.</div><a name="080619103000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendments Nos. 376 and 377 would extend the
scope of the exempt property rules, which he has described to great
effect. He wants to extend those rules to cover assets purchased abroad
with any form of unremitted income or gains. I am not sure if he
appreciates what the effect of his amendment would be.</div>
<a name="080619103000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">Until now,
remittance basis users bringing into the UK assets purchased from
unremitted foreign employment income or offshore gains, have faced a
charge to tax in the UK. That has been a long-standing practice. Only
where the asset was purchased with unremitted relevant foreign income
was there no liability to tax when it was enjoyed in the UK. Relevant
foreign income is income such as bank interest, rental income or
dividends. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendments would remove a tax
charge in situations where one has always arisen. It would therefore
provide a new tax break for remittance basis users. I am not sure that
he knew that would be a consequence of his amendment.</div>
<a name="080619103000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate
that the amendments have been tabled in a probing manner, but the
Government have already proposed generous provisions to exempt property
bought with unremitted relevant foreign income where it is either of
low value or falls into certain categories of personal use such as
clothing and jewellery. We also have exemptions for assets bought with
unremitted relevant foreign income and temporarily imported into the
UK. Finally, in recognition of the importance of the UK&#146;s repair
and restoration sector, which is very significant&#151;there is a
centre of restoration in the city of Liverpool&#151;assets bought
with unremitted relevant foreign income can stay in the UK for an
unlimited time while being repaired or restored.</div>
<a name="080619103000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendment No. 378 proposes two additions to the new
section dealing with assets that cease to be exempt property. I
understand the point that he is making but the issue was not raised
with us during the extensive consultation on the new section introduced

<div class="Column"><a name="Column851" />Column number: 851</div>by the schedule. The amendment as drafted would lead to higher tax
charges in some circumstances. For example, if an asset cost
&#163;10,000 but increased in value and was sold for &#163;50,000
his amendment would tax &#163;50,000 rather than the &#163;10,000.
Furthermore, the amendments would provide new avoidance opportunities
for the enjoyment of exempt assets without a tax charge in others. The
outcomes are clearly at odds with the objective of schedule
7.</div>
<a name="080619103000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 379 and 380 seek to define the public access rule by reference to
where the assets are displayed. There are two reasons why those changes
are unnecessary. First, they remove the link between the public access
rule and existing schemes for VAT. We explained the reasoning behind
using that. The link between the public access rule and existing
schemes for VAT and import due to relief on importation has been in
place for some time. The alignment was developed in consultation with
key stakeholders in the art world and it was agreed that basing the
public access rule on those schemes was the most simple and
straightforward approach. I am aware that there is wider lobbying on
other types of what might be described as public access, but in
consultation a persuasive argument was made for extending the type of
venue from institutions such as galleries and museums to other
commercial properties, such as a commercial auction house&#151;the
example cited by the hon. Gentleman. Our amendment No. 356 provides the
framework to achieve what is needed to allow that to
happen.</div><a name="080619103000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
bringing forward this particular package&#151;it is a large group of
amendments, but they address genuine concerns about the handling of
movable property&#151;we have responded to the points raised during
consultation. I therefore press the amendments in my name. I am sure
the hon. Gentleman was probing, but he may want to press some of his
amendments. However I urge the Committee, if asked to consider his
amendments, to reject

explanation as to why the existing terms have been drawn up as they
are. It is not my intention deliberately to make the law less
restrictive or more lenient than it is currently. So I am grateful for
the clarification that she gave on personal use items and also for the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000814"></a>Jane

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000815"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
Government amendments Nos. 317 to 328, 331, 329, 330, 332 to 334, 271
to 274, and 335 to
338.</div><a name="080619103000251"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000816"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I believe the amendments will be widely welcomed.
I will wait to hear if there are any specific questions arising from
any elements of them. Again, they have arisen following our
consultations, particularly in relation to employers and employee share
schemes, share incentive plans and save-as-you-earn
schemes.</div>
<a name="080619103000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000817"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I, too, understand that the amendments will be
widely welcomed by those involved in the area. It would appear that the
Government, in a spirit of generosity, thought that as they were
intending to tax non-ordinarily resident employees more, they should
also give them the benefit of exemptions. An act of kindness and
gratitude has apparently led to all sorts of potential compliance
problems for employee share schemes, which the Government have tried to
address in the amendments, although the response I had from one of the
interested groups was:</div>
<a name="080619103000675"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Revenue listened to companies and advisers and so what has come about
is a return to the status quo ante...it is not simply enough to
rip up the original
amendments.&#148;</div><a name="080619103000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a wise comment on the difficulty of changing these things. However,
the Government amendments have not addressed the concerns brought to
light only relatively recently by the Quoted Companies Alliance, one of
many organisations&#151;as I found out during a debate on capital
gains tax&#151;with a particular interest in employee share
schemes.</div><a name="080619103000697"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div><a name="080619103000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to raise two points with the Minister to flag up the
alliance&#146;s concerns. The first problem that it identified is
that the principle should be that a relevant person should not be taxed
until a remittance is offered, in so far as share scheme income is
concerned. HMRC is saying that if a person, who could otherwise claim
the remittance basis for share scheme gains, receives income in UK
shares, that income will be remitted to the UK 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column856" />Column number: 856</div>automatically, and so be taxable in full. The alliance believes that
that is wrong on two counts.</div>
<a name="080619103000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, the
legislation can be interpreted that way in any event, as it requires
the shares to be used or enjoyed in the UK and, in many cases, the
shares will be transferred to the employee outside the UK only because
most companies use employee trusts, which are based outside the UK for
a variety of reasons&#151;not just tax. Secondly, there is a policy
issue. The stance is potentially extremely disadvantageous to UK-listed
companies, whether they are operating in London or elsewhere. It means
that if they are employing non-doms or non-ordinarily resident
employees, all of their share scheme gains will be taxed in full,
whereas, if their employee were working for, say, a US or German-listed
banking group, the non-UK employment gain would not be taxed unless it
is remitted to the UK, which is the broad policy intention.</div>
<a name="080619103000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
instinctively makes the UK-listed banking group a less attractive
employer for such a person, as that group can pay out bonuses and share
awards only in fully taxable form. Companies are being encouraged to
pay out more bonuses as shares, to align the interests of the employees
with those of the company as a whole. It cannot be right to
discriminate against UK companies in that way, given that they need to
attract talent to work in London. It goes back to the point about
competitiveness. The way that the changes are drafted appear to put
non-doms working for a UK banking group at a disadvantage compared with
those working for a foreign banking group.</div>
<a name="080619103000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
problem identified by the alliance is that HMRC is saying that there
will automatically be a charge up front when employment income is
received by non-dom employees, even if that income is not remitted.
That goes against the principle that there should be such taxation of
foreign income only as and when it is remitted. It could also lead to
large amounts of NICs being payable, even though the non-dom or the
non-ordinarily resident employee has only a very small amount of UK tax
to pay. That could create an extra expense for companies, which has not
existed previously, and it may lead to NICs being paid for an employee
with little or no UK connection, and so with no benefit to that
employee. The representation that I have received suggests that the
alliance&#146;s earlier understanding was that additional automatic
up-front NIC payments did not apply, but since it has discussed the
matter with HMRC it appears that those payments could
arise.</div><a name="080619103000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister take up those points? I have chosen to raise them on this
grouping, rather then in a clause stand part debate, since we are
dealing with the issue of employee share
schemes.</div>
<a name="080619103000259"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080619103000818"></a><b class="B">Jane
</b><b class="B">Kennedy:</b> The hon. Member for Fareham asked whether
it is fair to treat an automatic remittance for UK assets in this way.
The remittance basis specifically treats cases differently depending on
whether the employee is resident, ordinarily resident or domiciled in
the UK, whether the employer is UK-based and whether the assets in
question are used in the UK. Those distinctions exist in all contexts,
not just in the context of employment-related securities. If the share
is in the UK, taxing it as a remittance is in accordance with the
overriding principle that income and assets enjoyed in the UK should be
taxed as remittances. I do not see a case for making a special
distinction for UK employment-related securities, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column857" />Column number: 857</div>although I would like to read the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments and
the representations he has received in detail when they are published
in
<i class="I">Hansard</i>.</div><a name="080619103000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are a number of instances where national insurance contributions and
PAYE treatment differ so that a mismatch already exists. Although there
is a broad policy to align national insurance contributions and PAYE
whenever possible, there are necessary limits and alignment is not
always practical or desirable. For example, where an employee meets the
employer&#146;s secondary NICs liability on payments by way of
securities, the amount liable for class 1 NICs differs from the amount
accountable for PAYE.</div>
<a name="080619103000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendments Nos. 271 to 274 respond directly to representations from
employers by ensuring that they are not obliged to offer the schemes to
employees who are resident but not ordinarily resident. I anticipate
that they will be welcome. Government amendments Nos. 316 to 338 ensure
that the provisions of the schedule work as intended with relation to
employment-related securities, including for awards of shares and share
options.</div><a name="080619103000262"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000819"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> This is a simple question relating to the
regulations on share options or securities options. The phraseology of
Government amendment No. 323 seems a little odd. It
states:</div><a name="080619103000676"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000823"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The first amendment deals with a particular area of
tax planning that the rules on remittance facilitate. It is a concept
called source ceasing, which is an interesting way in which people can
tackle their tax affairs. For people who remitted to the UK an amount
of income for which the source did not exist in the year in which it
was remitted, it was untaxed. That enabled people to do all sorts of
tax planning. The fact that this sort of thing was possible was in
itself a revelation and an education. I do not think that there is any
great dispute with the Government&#146;s changes in the Bill. I get
no sense from talking to representative bodies and others that there is
any great outcry about the closure of that loophole, at least not in
principle.</div>
<a name="080619103000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">However&#151;this
is where my amendment comes into play&#151;there is concern about the
practical problems arising from the fact that HMRC has long recognised
and accepted the source ceasing provision. It has, I understand, been
widely used and it is a perfectly legal process. The problem that the
change will potentially give rise to is one of identification. As
drafted, any sum that is income would be taxed as income in the year in
which it was remitted. The argument is that it would be difficult if
not impossible correctly and accurately to identify these sums as they
might have been treated as capitalised, assimilated into other funds or
reinvested into other assets. How will it be possible for a taxpayer to
link up any incomes remitted to sources that may have ceased in
previous years? What happened when those sources ceased; where has the
money gone? All of those identification and record-keeping issues will
be raised.</div>
<a name="080619103000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem
is particularly exacerbated by the fact there was no requirement at the
time to keep records of those transactions and it might not be possible
for many taxpayers to comply with the provision and complete correctly
the self-assessment form. The Minister has said on a number of
occasions that it is a self-assessment process. We want taxpayers to be
able to do the best that they can in completing that form. However, it
may be that through no fault of their own, given that this is a
long-established HMRC approach to tax planning, they do not have
adequate records to enable their compliance. That is why my amendment
would delimit that situation by stating that the provision applies only
where the source ceased after 5 April 2007. The Minister might come
back and suggest that there are other alternative points at which that
delimitation might come into effect, but I propose 5 April 2007. It
would be easier for taxpayers to comply and for the self-assessment
process to work correctly. I would be interested in the
Minister&#146;s comments on how we might make this practice work,
given that it has been acceptable and legal to do it for some time in
the past. That is amendment No. 381, which is a straightforward
issue.</div>
<a name="080619103000698"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.15
pm</div><a name="080619103000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
turn to amendment No. 382. The position prior to  6
April 2008 was that deductions were not generally allowed from a
relevant foreign income charter tax on the remittance basis. One
exception to that rule was where the income in question was from a
trade profession or vocation carried out outside the UK. The
restriction and the exemption are in section 832(4) of the Income Tax
(Trading and Other Income) Act 2005. This provision is being carried
forward into new section 832B in the Bill. It would appear illogical
and unfair that deductions 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column861" />Column number: 861</div>are not allowed from overseas property income for legitimate expenses
that would have been allowed if the taxpayer were taxed on an arising
basis. Again, it is not appropriate that an unrepresented taxpayer is
expected to realise that he will be taxed on income received without
the benefit for deductions. It does not seem fair that this should be
so.</div><a name="080619103000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me give the Committee an example. Mr. X is UK resident and domiciled in
Switzerland. He has a cottage in France which in the year to 5 April
2009 he rents out at €600 a month. He does not have a French
bank account and the income is paid straight to his UK bank account.
When legitimate income deductions are taken into account such as for
the interest on the loan to purchase the property and agents fees, he
would have a taxable profit of €3,600 if taxed on an arising
basis. However, it is not in his interest to be taxed on an arising
basis as he has significant Swiss investment income and trust income
that he does not remit. Accordingly, he makes a remittance claim. The
consequence of that is not that he would be taxed on the taxable profit
of €3,600, but on the €7,200, which is the rental value,
not taking into account any
deductions.</div><a name="080619103000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
appears from the frequently asked question on the HMRC website that the
Government agree that the position is as I have set it out. Can the
Minister clarify this? We think that amendment No. 382 will make the
necessary clarification to this Bill to allow that interest and any
expenses to be offset against the rental
income.</div><a name="080619103000297"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000824"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> If people choose to bring income from a ceased
source, which is not a phrase that trips easily of the tongue, into the
UK after 5 April 2008, they should pay tax on that untaxed income. The
amendment would allow that any account closed before 5 April 2007 could
still be remitted tax free at any time in the future. I appreciate that
in some cases people may no longer have all the records to make a full
and complete return. In such cases the individual will need to complete
their tax return to the best of their ability and to explain their
problem in the white space that is available on the tax return for that
purpose. If HMRC inquires into the
return&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> Well, the hon.
Gentleman asked what they would have to do. The individual and HMRC
will need to work together to establish the correct figure, based on
the facts which the individual is
declaring.</div><a name="080619103000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am confident that such problems can be dealt with pragmatically by HMRC
and if problems arise in practice I am sure that they will be brought
to my attention. Amendment No. 382 seeks to clarify that certain
deductions are allowed in arriving at the tax amount of a remittance.
The hon. Gentleman uses the example of rental income. I can assure the
Committee that the current legislation already delivers what his
amendment seeks to achieve. For the sake of clarity, I should point out
that a deduction for expenses paid, such as interest on let property,
is already given in arriving at the amount treated as remitted to the
UK. It has been clarified in HMRC guidance. I am assured by my advisers
that there is no need for an amendment along the lines that the hon.
Gentleman has described. I know that it was a probing amendment, but I
hope I have addressed the concern that he
raised.</div><a name="080619103000299"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000825"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> In the example I outlined, the gross amount was
remitted&#151;the rent, because it was received into the UK and not
held in a French bank account. I  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column862" />Column number: 862</div>suspect that the interest payments on that mortgage would have been paid
out of the same UK bank account. I think that the Financial Secretary
is saying that the net will be the remittance, rather than the gross,
so I would be grateful for that
clarification.</div><a name="080619103000300"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080619103000826"></a><b class="B">David
Wright</b> (Telford) (Lab): That is

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000827"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> My hon. Friend the Member for Telford assures me
that the hon. Gentleman is right and I have no reason to doubt him. I
believe that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s description of the problem and
its treatment is accurate. When I read <i class="I">Hansard</i>, if I believe
that something needs further clarification, I will be happy to provide
it.</div><a name="080619103000302"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000828"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> With regard to amendment No. 382, I am grateful for
the clarification that the hon. Member for Telford gave. His talents
are wasted sitting behind the Minister. He could be either an official
or a Minister, and I think I know which he would prefer&#151;perhaps
that recommendation from the Opposition Front Bench has ended his
chances of ministerial office. I am grateful for that clarification,
which tackles a particular concern.</div>
<a name="080619103000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am less
comfortable with the clarification that the Minister gave on source
ceasing. I think we will be in difficult territory on a range of issues
that we have discussed. There will have to be discussions between HMRC
and the taxpayer in those situations, and I am anxious about where the
balance will sit in those discussions. I would feel instinctively more
comfortable with a hard and fast date than I would with having to fill
out white space on a tax form&#151;I am not sure what the on-line
equivalent of the white space is, but I am sure there is one. I would
rather have a delimitation on time than the Minister&#146;s
reassurance.</div>
<a name="080619103000304"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000829"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I hesitate to prolong the discussion, but cannot
see how shifting the date by a year would remove that requirement in
cases where an individual does not have the records to indicate that on
a return.</div>
<a name="080619103000305"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000830"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The taxpayer will be dependent on a discussion with
HMRC on whether it is comfortable with the explanation that is given on
their return, and I think that it is reasonable to expect a taxpayer to
have kept records that date back a year and from the previous tax year.
It would be unreasonable to expect a taxpayer to have kept records from
10 years ago, but there is a continuum between 10 and one and I chose
one year as a way of probing to get an explanation. The further back we
allow that to go, the greater the uncertainty and risk that the
taxpayer will have insufficient records to reassure HMRC that they are
being open and transparent about source ceasing, and that is where the
problem arises in having a cut-off point. It is more reasonable to
expect taxpayers to have records relating to more recent transactions
than records relating to historical ones, but it would be better to
have that in the Bill, rather than leave it as an area for negotiation
between HMRC and the taxpayer.</div>
<a name="080619103000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are keen
to see some certainty in a number of those areas, and I think that
source ceasing would be a good area in which to see some of that
certainty. Perhaps I have persuaded the Financial Secretary
to  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column863" />Column number: 863</div>come back on Report with an amendment to put that limitation in.
However, having had the explanation from her, I beg to ask leave to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000833"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I thought that I should give the Committee a break
from the 10th group of amendments on schedule 7, and so did
not seek any explanations from the Financial Secretary on amendment No.
491. Doubtless I will find out later today that there is something in
that group that we should have asked about, but we can tackle any such
issues on Report if
necessary.</div><a name="080619103000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is the 11th and penultimate group of amendments on the schedule. Group
12 is lurking. This group goes back to the issue of foreign property.
Just to clarify for the Financial Secretary, I have tabled two sets of
amendments in this group to tackle the same issue. Amendments Nos. 383
to 385 would provide an exemption for all property, meaning buildings
rather than the wider definition of property. Amendments Nos. 386 to
389 apply simply to residential property.</div>
<a name="080619103000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will give
some background. Prior to 6 April 2008, someone repaying a capital
element of an offshore-linked debt out of foreign income or gains
constituted a remittance. For that purpose, UK-linked debt
meant</div><a name="080619103000678"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
debt for money lent to the person in the United Kingdom, or for
interest on money so
lent&#148;</div><a name="080619103000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">or</div><a name="080619103000679"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
debt for money lent to the person outside the United Kingdom and
received in the United Kingdom&#148;.</div>
<a name="080619103000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">It could also be to
repay a debt lent initially to the individual in the UK or subsequently
received in the UK. If the funds were brought to the UK after the loan
was paid off, that would also constitute a
remittance.</div><a name="080619103000699"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30
pm</div><a name="080619103000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
settlement offshore from foreign income or foreign gains of the
interest as it fell due did not, however, constitute a remittance, as I
understand the existing legislation. However, the Government have made
it clear that, from 6 April 2008, the Finance Bill is to extend the
debt provision. As well as catching the  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column865" />Column number: 865</div>repayment of UK-linked debt, the payment offshore of the interest on a
UK-linked debt will constitute a remittance. That was not the case
prior to 6 April
2008.</div><a name="080619103000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have recognised some issues around that and introduced
limited transitional provisions. To fall within the scope of those
provisions, the loan must be a qualifying loan&#151;the funds were
lent prior to 12 March 2008, the date of the
Budget&#151;and must have been made for the sole purpose of enabling
the individual to acquire an interest in UK residential property. Also,
before 6 April 2008, loan funds must have been received in the UK,
applied to acquire an interest in UK residential property and the loan
itself secured on that property. Interest on the offshore loan must be
paid offshore from relevant foreign income. That does not include funds
representing the proceeds from offshore income
gains.</div><a name="080619103000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">Provided
that all those conditions are met, the payment of loan interest would
not constitute a remittance. Unless entitlement to the relief is
forfeited, the transitional period will last until the repayment of the
loan, or 5 April 2008 if earlier. Paragraph 86(3) provides
that all entitlement to relief would be lost should the following occur
after 11 March 2008: any term upon which the loan was made is varied or
waived; the debt ceases to be secured on the residential property; or
any other debt is secured on the residential property. The last point,
which corresponds to paragraph 86(3)(c), goes further than the Budget
day material, in that taking out an entirely new loan would mean that
the entitlement to transitional provisions was forfeited. There appears
to have been a tightening up from the Budget day proposals to the Bill
proposals.</div><a name="080619103000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem identified is that non-doms could have taken out
offshore-linked loans with the legitimate expectation that they could
service the interest costs from foreign income and gains without that
constituting a remittance. Given that, the transitional provisions
appear to be very restrictive. For example, if any term of the loan is
varied, the benefit of the transitional provisions will be lost and the
interest payment will be treated as a remittance. We are not sure why
the transitional provisions do not allow relief for interest paid
overseas from foreign earnings on capital gains, where those could have
been used under the old rules to pay interest on offshore mortgages
secured on UK property, without that resulting in a
remittance.</div><a name="080619103000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
we understand that a special economic case can be made for allowing
relief with respect to residential properties, that seems harsh on
individuals who took out loans, say, to fund a UK business, as they may
have borrowed more than they could normally afford, because they were
going to be able to pay that interest from untaxed foreign income or
gains. Even considering residential property, the subject of four out
of the seven amendments in the group, the provisions appear unduly
narrow, as they deny relief where there has been a remortgaging
exercise, or part of the loan funds have been used to repair, renovate,
decorate or furnish the
property.</div><a name="080619103000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
has been further suggested that there is a problem with paragraph
86(1)(c)(iii), which specifies that there will only be relief where the
debt is secured on the UK property. That is very restrictive, as in
practice many offshore lenders prefer to have security over assets
under management with them. Nevertheless, the loan 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column866" />Column number: 866</div>can be demonstrated as being for the purpose of purchasing the interest
in the land that was acquired. Therefore, the provisions in paragraph
86(3) seem a little unnecessary and could result in foreign
domiciliaries accidentally breaching the conditions to qualify for
relief. Again, that goes back to a problem that we have highlighted
previously. It seems unfair to tax those who perhaps do not have the
access to special advice and could inadvertently be caught out by the
provisions. It is the unrepresented taxpayers who could be the losers.
It is particularly harsh because the restriction was not announced on
Budget day.</div>
<a name="080619103000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">In summary,
my amendments Nos. 383 to 385 create much more flexibility for all
property, but amendments Nos. 386 to 389 create flexibility only in
respect of residential
property.</div><a name="080619103000335"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000834"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> Amendment No. 493 is our response to calls for
the provisions in the Bill to be extended so that relief is available
for remortgages. As paragraph 86 stands, loans only qualify for
exemption if they are made to acquire an interest in residential
property in the UK. There would be no relief if the individual had
switched the original mortgage&#151;perhaps because they had found a
better deal&#151;because the replacement loan would not serve to
acquire the interest in the property. Perhaps that is less of an
occurrence in the current climate than had been the case.</div>
<a name="080619103000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept
that some relaxation was needed and therefore amendment No. 493 extends
the grandfathering so that remortgages can qualify so long as the
remortgage took place prior to 12 March 2008. Amendment No. 492 is a
relatively minor technical change.</div>
<a name="080619103000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman proposes very extensive changes&#151;certainly in his first
group of amendments Nos. 383 to 385&#151;to grandfathering for
mortgages. They would remove many of the restrictions on relief that
currently apply. For example, they mean that relief would cover all
manner of loans not just those for acquiring residential property. They
would apply not just to relevant foreign income but to foreign
employment income and gains where a payment of this sort has always
been taxable as a remittance under existing law.</div>
<a name="080619103000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">His proposed
changes go too far. I suspect that the reason he has tabled two
different groups is to elicit why we have chosen the structure we have,
and why we have gone some way but not to such a generous extent as he
proposes. The relief under paragraph 86 is none the less generous and
the extension we are making to cover remortgaging under amendment No.
493 does strike a fair balance. Extending the grandfathering to all
loans would effectively reinstate the loophole under which remittance
basis users could enjoy tax-free loans which are not available to other
UK taxpayers. While it is reasonable to grandfather mortgages rather
than cast uncertainty over people&#146;s housing arrangements, it is
not reasonable to extend such relief to all loans.</div>
<a name="080619103000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked why relief is not allowed for interest paid overseas
from foreign earnings and capital gains which could both be used to pay
interest previously without resulting in a remittance. Payments out of
employment income and capital gains have always been treated as
remittance, so giving relief would be untaxing things which we have
always taxed in practice.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column867" />Column number: 867</div><a name="080619103000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">His second
group of amendments appears to be an alternative and rather more modest
in scope. Unlike the others, these amendments would not seek to cover
all manner of loans but would provide relief for remortgaging and home
improvement loans. The first of those is now covered by our amendment
No. 493 and, in view of my comments about paragraph 86 being generous,
I do not consider that it would be right to cover loans for home
improvement.</div>
<a name="080619103000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said
that, my officials are currently in discussion with a number of banks
about the status of certain offshore loans and mortgages and whether
those, too, should be covered by the grandfathering rules. I hope to be
able to provide an update to the House on Report. This is an area where
we are continuing dialogue and I will be interested to hear the outcome
of those detailed discussions.</div>
<a name="080619103000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
I have given the hon. Gentleman some of the answers that he seeks. I
ask the Committee to support my amendments and hope that the hon.
Gentleman will withdraw
his.</div><a name="080619103000343"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000835"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> This is a difficult area. The fact that the
Financial Secretary&#146;s officials are having a conversation with
banks at the moment indicates that we need to get this right. The
transitional provisions extend as far as March 2028 and indicate the
complexity and long-standing nature of some of these arrangements. It
is important to get them right. On occasion, we do not get the balance
right&#151;we try to close down appropriate tax loopholes, but at the
same time the phrasing is so wide that it can inadvertently affect
people. That goes back to my comment on the amendments about who would
be caught out by this measure, and whether there is any risk of
unrepresented tax payers falling foul of the arrangements.</div>
<a name="080619103000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
grateful that the Financial Secretary is considering the matter again
with the banks to try to get it right&#151;she has addressed a number
of issues in that spirit and tried to get a workable arrangement. One
of the great assets of the scrutiny process in this House is that it
provides the opportunity to get it right, either through the
clarification that Ministers offer in such debates&#151;and we have
had a number of those clarifications already today&#151;or through
the opportunity to revisit issues up to and including Report. The
Financial Secretary might throw those words back at me on Report if
confronted by another 100 amendments on schedule 7, so I should be
careful how fulsome I am when commenting on the effectiveness of the
procedure. Given the Financial Secretary&#146;s reassurance that the
Government are talking to the banks and that there will be further
opportunity to get the fine detail of the rules right, I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000838"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I almost say, &#147;Hurrah&#148;, Sir
Nicholas. This is the final group of amendments and the vast majority
of them are technical changes to ensure that the code on chargeable
gains of non-resident trusts, and its interaction with the code for
offshore income gains, works effectively. There are more substantive
changes following our discussions with external stakeholders on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column870" />Column number: 870</div>the draft Bill. I will not explore those further at this point, as I
would benefit from hearing what concerns are raised in Committee before
making more substantive
comments.</div>
<a name="080619103000366"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000839"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Before I talk to amendments Nos. 390 to 398, I wish
to make a couple of brief points about Government amendments Nos. 402A
to 462. Matters are not quite as bad as they are presented on the order
of consideration, but when we realise that the Government have tabled
60 amendments in the group under discussion, my own eight amendments
pale into insignificance in respect of number, although perhaps not in
points to discuss.</div>
<a name="080619103000700"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.45
pm</div><a name="080619103000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for Government amendments Nos. 402A to 462, we may return to such
matters on Report. External bodies consider that the volume of
amendments tabled in Committee, although they would affect their
understanding of matters from discussions with officials, show
continuing thought. We do not know whether they would address the
issues that they want dealt with, given that lurking in the amendments
is the use of our old friend &#147;just and reasonable&#148;, which
was dealt with an eternity ago. On new paragraph 108A under Government
amendment No. 432, I do not know whether the intention is for HMRC to
provide guidance about that or to discuss matters on a case-by-case
basis, but it would be helpful to know if that is the route that the
Government intend to take. It is also fair to say that some of the
Government amendments address issues slightly more elegantly than do my
amendments.</div>
<a name="080619103000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 390 and 391 deal with a matter that a number of people have raised
with me, which almost pushes people to use more complex structures to
manage their tax bills. I understand why people do that, but it would
be better not to drive them down that route. I am talking about the
treatment of capital gains tax. Offshore companies that do not have a
United Kingdom branch or agency are not subject to United Kingdom
capital gains tax. From the introduction of CGT, anti-avoidance
provisions have been designed to prevent UK-domiciled, UK resident and
ordinarily resident individuals from avoiding it by exploiting the fact
that an offshore company is outside the territorial scope of CGT by
holding its assets within offshore companies that they
control.</div><a name="080619103000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
93 to schedule 7 introduces new section 14A that extends the
anti-avoidance provisions to UK residents or ordinarily resident
non-doms. I wish to draw the Committee&#146;s attention to a
distinction and to present matters clearly. The current effect of the
anti-avoidance provisions is such that they attribute gains arising to
an offshore company that would be a closed company if it were resident
in the UK&#151;that is how companies are caught&#151;to a UK
resident or ordinarily resident person, or UK-domiciled qualifying
participators who were chargeable to tax on the gain attributed in the
year of attribution, and offshore trusts that meet the qualifying
participator
conditions.</div><a name="080619103000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Finance Bill extends the provisions so that gains will be attributed to
non-domiciled residents or ordinary residents. When the non-dom is a
remittance basis user, they will be taxed on the gains attributed on
the basis of UK gains subject to tax with respect to the tax year on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column871" />Column number: 871</div>which the gains arise. Foreign gains on a remittance basis will apply
such that they will suffer UK tax only if they are deemed to remit the
gain attributed.</div>
<a name="080619103000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part of the
problem appears to be that the Finance Bill contains no transitional
provisions, which means that the non-dom would be subject to tax on
gains that relate to the period prior to 6 April 2008 and, as has been
recognised by the Government, where trust structures are concerned,
non-doms had a legitimate expectation that they would not be subject to
UK capital gains tax with respect to gains and disposal of chargeable
assets held within offshore structures. There are transitional
arrangements in place for those non-doms who hold assets in trust
structures, but there are no transitional provisions for offshore
companies held directly by individuals in the same way as is provided
for in the Finance Bill for assets held within trust structures
immediately before 6 April 2008.</div>
<a name="080619103000372"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
understand it, if in one situation a non-dom has a house in, say, Eaton
square and that house is owned by a company, and in another, the
non-dom has the house in Eaton square, a company and an off-shore trust
on top of that, there are transition provisions for the offshore trust
to rebase the capital gains, but there is not a mirroring provision for
companies. That creates a bias in favour of complex trust structures
rather than a more immediate way in which a company may own an
asset.</div>
<a name="080619103000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 390 and 391 attempt to draw out that comparison. It was never
expected that foreign domiciled individuals would receive a rebasing to
6 April 2008 in relation to their direct holdings and
offshore companies, with respect to which they are qualifying
participators, but it is hard to follow the logic of allowing a
wholesale rebasing of assets within an offshore trust structure,
including assets owned by an underlying company, when there are no
comparable provisions to allow rebasing of assets owned by an offshore
company.</div><a name="080619103000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
amendments seek to bring about two changes: first, the gains attributed
to offshore companies should be taxed only if there is remittance to
the UK and, secondly, to introduce a rebasing election that can be made
by directors of offshore companies. The first group of amendments deals
with the transitional provisions and what is available for companies as
opposed to trusts. The second group comprises amendments
Nos. 392 to 398. Amendment No. 494, which is also in that
group, is an alternative way to address the issues that I have
highlighted in amendments Nos. 390 and 391. It does have a broader
impact as well, which relates back to amendments Nos. 392 and
398.</div><a name="080619103000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have already mentioned the rebasing election that trustees can make. I
have read the rules on rebasing&#151;I lead a sad life, when I spend
my afternoons doing things like that&#151;and I am not going to go
through them at this point for fairly obvious reasons. Trustees are
able to elect for a settlement that is non-resident at 6 April 2008 to
make what could be described as a rebasing election. The election is
relevant only where the trust has beneficiaries who are non-doms and
the election is irrevocable. It is an all-or-nothing provision,
applying to every asset within the trust structure immediately before 6
April 2008.</div>
<a name="080619103000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
legislation states that the rebasing
election</div><a name="080619103000680"></a><div class="hs_brev">"must
be made in the way and form specified by Her Majesty's Revenue and
Customs".</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column872" />Column number: 872</div><a name="080619103000377"></a><div class="hs_Para">and I am sure that
there will be a prescribed form on which to do that. I am sure that
disclosures will be required, but I am not yet sure what they will be.
The deadline for making the election is 31 January, following the end
of the tax year in which the first of the following take place: capital
payment is received or treated as received by a beneficiary regardless
of their domicile of a settlement, and the beneficiary is a resident of
the UK in the tax year in which it is received or; the trustees
transfer part, but not all, of the trust property to a new
settlement.</div><a name="080619103000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
this is a situation where well-advised taxpayers will receive the right
advice. The concern is that not all taxpayers may benefit from rebasing
elections if the trustees do not make the election in time. Prior to
6 April this year, offshore trustees did not necessarily
need much knowledge of the UK tax system to act as trustees. So, my
argument is that we should introduce into legislation a presumption
that the election will be made. Broadly, people believe that the
election is beneficial for the purposes of rebasing capital allowances.
What we are seeking is, rather than having an election to opt for the
rebasing, we have an election to opt out of the rebasing. It is
probably in the best interests of taxpayers to start on the basis that
they will be
rebasing.</div><a name="080619103000379"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I understand it, the Government thought that the arguments behind my
amendments Nos. 397 and 398 were rather good, despite not having heard
them. I understand that they tabled amendments Nos. 439, 440, 467 and
447 to address those
issues.</div><a name="080619103000380"></a>

<a name="080619103000384"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000842"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I shall be brief, Sir Nicholas, but may I start by
welcoming you to this extended sitting? I shall make a couple of
general comments. I do not believe that there will be a stand part
debate, but after our debate on the schedule I am struck by the number
of Government amendments that were tabled. My hon. Friend the Member
for Fareham counted 60, but I think it is only 59. We are embarking on
something very dangerous. There is an almost unbelievable level of
complexity involved in some of those amendments, particularly in
amendments Nos. 402A, 404 and 406. I am worried about the possible
effect, not only on the City of London, but on London as a
whole.</div>
<a name="080619103000385"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
constituency contains the second highest proportion of residents born
outside the UK. The highest is in Kensington and Chelsea. I am worried
about the effect of the schedule, the Bill and these 59 or 60
Government amendments. One third of my constituents are foreign-born.
It is not just a finance issue. I believe that skilled and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column873" />Column number: 873</div>semi-skilled labourers will struggle with these new regulations, both in
their complexity and their possible effect.</div>
<a name="080619103000386"></a><div class="hs_Para">It still
worries me that no real answers have been provided to the questions
posed by the IFS last October about how much money is involved, how
many non-domiciles there are, and the numbers who might emigrate as a
result. From what we have seen this afternoon, if anything, the
Government proposals are becoming ever more complicated. The situation
in the UK economy and in the City of London economy is extremely
delicate. I urge the Government in the remaining stages of this Bill to
think carefully about the impact, not only of the 60 Government
amendments, but of the whole set of regulations they are proposing, on
my constituents and on the wider London
economy.</div><a name="080619103000387"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000843"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> We have readjusted, in this modest group of
amendments, the interaction between trusts and offshore income gains. I
would be the first to admit that this is one of the most complex parts
of a complex area of tax law that I have had a rapid lesson in
learning. I would not pretend to be an expert. It is no surprise to me
that this area of tax law generates its own industry in terms of
advice. It is important not to confuse the complexity of the
legislation with the way that it will apply to individual cases through
the self-assessment system. Not to make the amendments that we are
proposing would be a very great disadvantage to the UK. The amendments
themselves have arisen from close and detailed discussions between
HMRC, the Treasury and experts in this field of law. I take a great
deal of comfort from the knowledge that they have done
so.</div><a name="080619103000388"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill, as drafted, changes the interaction between trusts and offshore
income gains. Except in limited circumstances, it has the effect of
denying the benefit of rebasing offshore income gains to the market
value as at 6 Apri 2008. Our amendments restore the previous
relationship between trusts and offshore income gains, so that rebasing
on offshore income gains would be more widely accessible. It would be
fair to concede that our proposals went much wider than we intended
when the detail of the clauses become available, and when we received
the response to them. I should add that the rules relating to offshore
income gains will be translated into regulations next year, so there
will be an opportunity for interested parties to make further
representations on the rules over the next few months.</div>
<a name="080619103000389"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have made
a number of changes to the way in which the rebasing rules for trusts
work. Those changes extend the application of rebasing to situations in
which the trustee&#146;s interest in a company have decreased since 6
April 2008, or in which an asset held at 6 April 2008 has been modified
since then. Amendments No. 390, 391 and 494 seek to apply the same
treatment to offshore companies as applies to offshore trusts. In
developing our overall package of reforms, we have drawn a clear
distinction between companies in which the shareholder or participator
has a direct interest, and trusts, in which the beneficiary&#146;s
interest is indirect. Trusts are different from companies, and
chargeable gains of non-resident trusts are taxed differently from
companies. When a company is caught by the anti-avoidance measure that
we are amending under schedule 7, the people who 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column874" />Column number: 874</div>control the company are treated as though a chargeable gain to the
company was their own chargeable gain.</div>
<a name="080619103000390"></a><div class="hs_Para">By contrast,
the beneficiaries of a trust have an indirect interest in a trust. They
do not have the control of a trust that the participators of a company
have, and the way that the non-chargeable gains of a non-resident trust
are attributed to a beneficiary reflects that fact. Instead of looking
at individual chargeable gains, as we do with companies, we look at the
aggregated gains of the trust. Those are very real differences in
approach between companies and trusts, and they mean that we cannot
assume that what works for a trust will also work for a company or that
they are in any way
equivalent.</div><a name="080619103000391"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is not the case that the proposals that we are making would, as the
hon. Member for Fareham put it, &#147;push people into more complex
structures&#148;. The rebasing rule relates to trusts that existed
before April. There is no scope for benefiting from rebasing by setting
up a trust
now.</div><a name="080619103000392"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000844"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I accept the Minister&#146;s comment. The
arrangement relates to transitional provisions, but the message that it
sends out is that if there are complex tax structures, there is an
incentive to use those structures&#151;not necessarily in relation to
the particular area that we are looking at today, but more generally.
Rather than a simpler, more straightforward means of holding the house
in Eaton square, or wherever it happens to be, people go down the route
of that more complex structure, because there seems to be this
arbitrage opportunity between a company and a
trust.</div><a name="080619103000393"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000845"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I have no reason to believe that the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s view is well founded. I have said this before, but I
want to keep this area under review. I am sure that he will appreciate
that the amendments have grown out of concern about the rebasing issue.
If trustees elect for rebasing, they have to disclose detailed
information about trust assets. It was made very clear to us during our
consultation that some trustees did not want to disclose anything more
about the assets that they held than they needed to. That can be
achieved only by making rebasing optional. I hope that that resolves
the problem that we he was probing in his amendments.</div>
<a name="080619103000394"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
amendments deliver the commitment not to introduce new disclosure
requirements. The practical effect of amendment No. 390 would be to
exclude entirely the non-resident company&#146;s gains from tax,
where a non-domiciled individual was using a remittance basis. That
would be unfair to non-domiciled individuals who use the arising basis,
and non-domiciled individuals who own an asset directly, rather than
through a non-resident company. Amendments Nos. 391 and 494 seek to
apply rebasing to non-resident companies, the effect of which would be
to offer individuals who own their own investments through offshore
companies the tax re-uplift on their investments, without any clear
rationale. The three amendments run counter to the overall thrust of
the reform, although I appreciate that they may have been tabled to
promote
discussion.</div><a name="080619103000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 392 to 394 and amendment No. 396 would together result
in rebasing being mandatory. I dealt with that issue in my comments on
the representations we received on maintaining the option not to
disclose, as it was feared our original proposals required. Under 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column875" />Column number: 875</div>the hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposals, there would be an opt-out for
trustees, with a longer deadline than we have specified and a limit on
the amount of information that HMRC could require. The amendments are
misconceived. They would not protect trustees from having to disclose
information on offshore assets. Whatever form election for rebasing
takes, trustees who use rebasing still need to disclose to HMRC
additional information about assets disposed of, to compute the gains
that will be left untaxed. Not all trustees will wish to make that
level of disclosure or to engage in the additional evaluation work
involved in rebasing, so the rebasing rules should be voluntary rather
than imposed, albeit with an opt-out. Amendment No. 394 extends the
deadline. The deadline already provides trustees with 19 months from
now to make the decision, and I see no reason to extend it as
proposed.</div><a name="080619103000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
amendments Nos. 397 and 398 seek to change a provision of the trust
rules that was brought up by many interested parties in discussions,
namely the restriction on rebasing where the trustee&#146;s interest
in a company has decreased between 6 April 2008 and the date of
disposal of the asset by the company. Our amendments Nos. 439, 440, 446
and 447 respond to calls for change in that area. Our approach is
different from that proposed by the hon. Gentleman, but it delivers the
same effect, with the advantage of guarding against avoidance and
applying to property transferred between settlements. He suggested that
our amendments were more elegant than his. Our amendments are not
always described as elegant, so it is good to hear it on this
occasion.</div><a name="080619103000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a complex area, and there is an argument that it is worthy of
detailed debate. Our brief debate has helped to clarify some of the
concerns out there. In my opening comments, I could not bring myself to
alert the Committee to the fact that there were 61 Government
amendments in this group. I skirted over it then, so I say it now, and
shall quickly sit
down.</div><a name="080619103000398"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000846"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for
tabling 61
amendments.</div><a name="080619103000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will focus on the election for rebasing. I wonder whether the issue is
the right way round. Rightly, after publishing the draft legislation
that gave rise to the concern about disclosure by trusts, the
Government listened to that concern and responded to it. We seem to
have produced a set of rules that benefited those who are particularly
knowledgeable about how trusts will function. They are the very people
who would be in a position to make the right decision about opting out
of rebasing, if we went down the route that I proposed of automatic
rebasing with the option to withdraw. I may have got the disclosure
wrong in my amendments, but the Government seem to have gone a long way
towards satisfying those who are very aware of the consequences and who
want to manage their clients&#146; affairs in a particular way,
without thinking about those people who are not so well advised and may
not have access to trustees who are aware of the detail of UK law, so
they might not recognise the importance of the rebasing
election.</div>

tackling one issue, we have created another that affects those who are

<div class="Column"><a name="Column876" />Column number: 876</div>concern is that we have got the balance slightly wrong. I liked the
Minister&#146;s description of this &#147;short&#148;

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000848"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I thought the Minister meant the debate that has
been going on since 9 o&#146;clock this morning. One of the things I
have tried to develop throughout my remarks today has been the question
of how we can ensure that the unrepresented taxpayer is not
disadvantaged by these rules. We should make it easy for them to comply
with them, and not create widespread non-compliance, particularly in
the self-assessment system. That is the thrust of these provisions, as
of
others.</div><a name="080619103000403"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000854"></a>The
Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury (Angela Eagle):</b> I beg
to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="080619103000488"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not intend to detain the Committee long, since this is a wholly
beneficial clause. The Committee will recall that in an earlier
sitting, changes to the research and development tax credit and vaccine
research relief were agreed, including an enhancement of the rate
of  R and D credit for large companies and small and
medium-sized enterprises. Those enhancements are accompanied by minor
changes to the rules governing the small and medium-sized R and D
credit and the vaccine research relief, which are notifiable state
aids, to comply with the state aids
framework.</div><a name="080619103000489"></a><div class="hs_Para">Following
further discussions with the European Commission, three further small
changes to the schemes are necessary. The new clause introduces those
changes, which are necessary to secure state aid approval. I can
confirm to the Committee that, subject to these changes, the European
Commission has now approved all the improvements to the R and D credits
scheme and the vaccine research relief scheme, increasing the R and D
credits generosity by some &#163;180 million per year. If the clause
is approved, we will implement the improvements from the earliest
possible date after Royal Assent, which we hope will be 1 August this
year. I commend the new clause to the
Committee.</div><a name="080619103000490"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080619103000855"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con): It is a
great pleasure, Sir Nicholas, to serve once again under your
leadership. It seems such a long time since I was last standing here
and even longer since we debated research and development and vaccine
research relief&#151;it was a whole Test series ago.</div>
<a name="080619103000491"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have only
a couple of comments on the provisions, the first part of which, as the
Exchequer Secretary said, relates to EU anti-discrimination legislation
and changes to make the Bill compliant with that. The issue relates to
allowing the equivalence of national insurance contributions paid in
the European economic area to count for research and development
staffing costs and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column890" />Column number: 890</div>ensuring that relief is available in the same way as it is within the
UK. Will the Minister confirm that this is for EU purposes and there is
no intention to make the provision worldwide? It will apply only for
the EEA and Switzerland, I
believe.</div><a name="080619103000492"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second point is on vaccine research relief. The provisions, as I
understand them, stop vaccine research relief being subcontracted to an
independent body by way of contribution to their research. In other
words, a company would not be able to pay a university &#163;100 to
do research on vaccines and get a &#163;150 deduction&#151;to use
those numbers as an illustration. Presumably the intention is to make
sure that research is subsidised only if it is carried out directly by
the company and under the control of the company. Presumably for the
benefit of universities and companies researching vaccines, the
Government want to encourage co-operation. We have a tremendous
resource in our universities and it is frustrating that sometimes our
companies may not use universities as much as they might. One could put
it another way and say that universities may not always be in a
position to assist companies as much as they could. There are strong
arguments for encouraging greater co-operation between those two parts
of our economy in fields such as vaccine research, but the new clause
appears to hamper that development.</div>
<a name="080619103000493"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government may argue that the vaccine research relief should be
available only when the research is done by the company itself.
However, if the best entity to do the research is a university or a
third party, why should the relief not be available? If we wish to
encourage expenditure on vaccine research, and encourage companies in
that field to grow through the quality of the research undertaken, why
make the way vaccine research relief works a barrier? That is my point,
and I would be grateful for clarification from the Minister on the
thinking behind the new clause. Does she recognise that there is
concern and that further explanation is
needed?</div><a name="080619103000494"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000856"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> First, I can confirm that the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s interpretation of the changes to the R and D relief
with respect to national insurance contributions is
correct&#151;relief will be paid for costs in EEA countries and
Switzerland, but not worldwide. He is right, as I mentioned in my brief
opening remarks, that it is a state aid issue and, therefore, there is
no requirement or intention to extend the changes worldwide.</div>
<a name="080619103000495"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman is wrong about the vaccine research relief, however. The
changes do not prevent relief for research that has been contracted to
universities or charitable companies. The change aligns the treatment
of those bodies with that of other subcontractors, and it moves the
relief available to them down from 100 per cent. of the costs to 65 per
cent. Again, that was a technical issue about state aid approval. It is
still possible for a company, charity, university or subcontracted
scientific research organisation jointly to elect to be treated as
connected parties and claim the full amount of costs incurred. It is an
alignment, not a ban.</div>
<a name="080619103000496"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000857"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am grateful for clarification that the provision
is not a ban as such; none the less, it is an alignment that makes
using universities for vaccine research less attractive. That is a fair
interpretation of the new clause.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column891" />Column number: 891</div><a name="080619103000497"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000858"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> It makes it slightly less attractive, but at
present nobody has used it in its more attractive state. Vaccine
research relief is a small and limited scheme, which deals only with
TB, malaria and certain strains of HIV. It is not a general issue, and
even at 100 per cent. relief we have seen no use of it. We are not
worried about the practical effect of the
alignment.</div><a name="080619103000498"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

helpful if I spend a brief time talking about the background as to why
the issue has arisen. I shall then talk about the picture at present,
beverages and food generally and then about why I think the mew clause
is important in that
context.</div><a name="080619103000503"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
let us talk about the state of the nation&#146;s health, which is
ultimately the background to our tabling the amendment. The provision
would obtain a fact base for the Government to understand to what
extent VAT could be used to encourage healthy eating. Across the
nation, healthy eating has risen up the political agenda dramatically,
certainly over recent years, for a number of reasons. The main reason
is many people&#146;s sense that the state of our nation&#146;s
health is getting steadily worse, particularly in terms of avoidable
ill health. The situation is worse than it has been for some time,
perhaps worse than it has ever been. One only has to look at some key
statistics for obesity on the Department of Health website to start to
understand the magnitude of the problem and its implications.</div>
<a name="080619103000504"></a><div class="hs_Para">The latest
statistics, which I think are from 2006, show that 24 per cent. of the
adult population in England is already classified as obese. Although
that is weighted equally between male and female populations, women are
more likely to be morbidly obese than men. My understanding is that if
current obesity levels continue to rise as they have done, about 60 per
cent. of men and 50 per cent. of women will be clinically obese by
2050.</div>
<a name="080619103000505"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know the
impact of obesity on people and on public finances. For the individual,
obesity unfortunately comes with a whole bundle of negative health
impacts. Conditions such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease and even, it
would seem, some types of cancer&#151;endometrial, breast and
colon&#151;can to some extent be attributed to excess body fat.
According to the Department of Health, 9,000 premature deaths each year
in England are semi-related to obesity. There are broader effects such
as the impact of ill health on people&#146;s ability to work
productively and the fact that they also have higher sickness
rates.</div>
<a name="080619103000506"></a><div class="hs_Para">More
worrying is the picture of obesity in children. Almost one fifth of all
children under the age of 16 are classed as obese, and the figure is
expected to rise to 25 per cent. by 2050 if these sorts of
trends continue. It is deeply worrying.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column892" />Column number: 892</div><a name="080619103000507"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem
is not just the lack of healthy eating. There is also a problem
regarding lack of exercise. The extent to which people are taking
regular exercise is declining, or at best static. Many of us who live
in London are hoping that the 2012 Olympics will be used as a positive
spur to encourage people to take exercise. Looking at the NHS
statistics, just 40 per cent. of men and 28 per cent. of women met the
minimum recommendations for physical activity in adults&#151;at least
30 minutes of activity on at least five days a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000862"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> As someone who regularly uses the House of Commons
gym, I can assure the hon. Lady that it is a very welcoming place, and
we would all be happy to see her
there.</div><a name="080619103000511"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000863"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> This seems to have become a debate about my
physical exercise. I am happy to tell the hon. Lady that in the Commons
versus Lords swimming competition two years ago, I won the prize for
fastest female. I exercise, but I tend not to be a gym person. I am
more of a swimmer, which I am sure Sir Nicholas is very relieved to
hear. I apologise for being slightly diverted. I will now return to the
nation&#146;s health rather than mine.</div>
<a name="080619103000512"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
discussed why physical exercise is important. It is fair to say that
our main concern in tabling the amendment, which relates to fruit juice
in particular, was to encourage healthy lifestyles. In an interesting
report in May, a senior medical director at Alder Hey children&#146;s
hospital in Liverpool said that &#147;significant numbers&#148; of
children aged between two and three were being classed as obese. He
said that they were experiencing conditions such as type 2 diabetes,
which would normally only be expected in middle-aged people.
Depressingly, the medical director, Steve Ryan, said that</div>
<a name="080619103000681"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it was almost
certain that surgeons will have to staple children&#146;s stomachs
within a few years.&#148;</div>
<a name="080619103000513"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is horrendous.
The same medical director talked about seeing breathing difficulties in
overweight children, which is a particularly depressing state of
affairs. That is one of the reasons why we must consider all the levers
that can be pulled, including ones in the tax system, to start
addressing such issues.</div>
<a name="080619103000514"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is fair
to say that the Government have made some efforts. There have been a
number of different initiatives including the five-a-day programme,
which included the school fruit and vegetable scheme. We are also aware
of the big debate and the improvements that were made to school
lunches. We can all pay tribute to people such as Jamie Oliver who put
the issue of healthy eating at school high on the agenda. I know that
the matter is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column893" />Column number: 893</div>important in my constituency. Last year, I visited Albermarle, one of my
local primary schools, which has a fantastic school kitchen that
produces healthy food.</div>
<a name="080619103000515"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000864"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. May I say to the hon. Lady that she is
going slightly wide of her new clause, which relates to VAT on
beverages and not food? I am not sure whether she is suggesting that
there should be VAT on food. I hope that she is
not.</div><a name="080619103000516"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000865"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> Thank you, Sir Nicholas. There is some
rationality in the way I am building up my argument. I know that I have
been talking about food, but I want to go on to discuss the contrast
between VAT on some food and VAT on fruit juices. We may expect to see
a different approach to the VAT rates on some food compared to some
beverages and fruit juices, but I will come to that very
shortly.</div><a name="080619103000517"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080619103000866"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Philip Hammond</b> (Runnymede and Weybridge) (Con): I listened
carefully to what the Chairman said, but I, too, have received a great
number of representations on that issue. At the root of them is concern
that fruit, which is generally regarded as a good thing, is not subject
to VAT as a food, but as soon as one squeezes it to make equally
healthy fruit juice, it becomes subject to VAT. That contrast is at the
heart of this debate, as I think my hon. Friend would
agree.</div><a name="080619103000518"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000867"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> My hon. Friend has expressed the point
perfectly&#151;better than I could have
done.</div><a name="080619103000519"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000868"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> Does the hon. Lady recognise that it became the
case because the previous Government in 1993 changed the rules to bring
fruit juices into the VAT
system?</div><a name="080619103000520"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000869"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> The Exchequer Secretary is right. It happened
following the decision regarding Tropicana UK Ltd, which found that
pasteurised orange juice was not a manufactured beverage. We are all
conscious that VAT law can be complex. This may be a good time to
discuss some of the
anomalies.</div><a name="080619103000521"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
draw the Exchequer Secretary&#146;s attention back to the purpose of
the new clause. For the first time, we want to put a fact base on the
table to show whether the tax system can be used to encourage healthy
eating. The proposal specifically uses VAT. I understand that the
Government are considering the issue; the Wanless report looked at
dietary-based taxes so there is clearly a debate to be had. We will not
be able to understand whether the idea is realistic or important or
whether it can provide real achievements unless we have a statistical
fact base. Only then can we understand the impact and take a
decision.</div><a name="080619103000522"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
lot of VAT law is set through case law. There is no doubt that there
are some oddities&#151;there is no other word for them&#151;in what
is zero-rated and what is not. When looking at healthy eating, such
oddities jump out. Chips, hot dogs, burgers, biscuits, tea and coffee,
yoghurt and a range of other foods are zero-rated, but fruit juice,
bottled water and some herbal teas are not. As my hon. Friend the
Member for Runnymede and Weybridge 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column894" />Column number: 894</div>said, we end up with the bizarre situation where a fruit that is still
intact has a zero rate of VAT, but the minute it is squeezed to become
a fruit juice, it has a standard rate of VAT. There are some questions
that need to be
raised.</div><a name="080619103000523"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have already started to debate the issue in the House. In this very
room, we have the hon. Member for Dundee, East, who tabled early-day
motion 558, called &#147;VAT on Fresh Fruit Juice&#148;, which
called</div><a name="080619103000682"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;on
the Government to investigate the possible benefits of reducing VAT on
fresh fruit juice to encourage children in particular to choose to
drink fresh fruit juice rather than other less healthy
drinks.&#148;</div><a name="080619103000524"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
received the signatures of 59 colleagues in the House. I spotted the
signature of the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall of the Liberal
Democrats. There is, therefore, some support for the issue in the
House.</div><a name="080619103000525"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is also evidence of support outside the House. A petition on the issue
was set up by Innocent smoothies, although it is fair to say that the
company has a business interest in the
issue.</div><a name="080619103000526"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000870"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000871"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Greg Hands&#151;innocent
smoothie!</div><a name="080619103000528"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000872"></a>Mr.
Hands:</b> I am delighted that my hon. Friend has mentioned
Innocent, as it is located in my constituency. She is right to say that
the company has launched  an extensive campaign. However, I
have received representations not only from that company, but from a
large number of constituents advocating a change. It is certainly very
popular in Hammersmith and
Fulham.</div><a name="080619103000529"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000873"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> I am not sure whether the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s constituents would describe him as an innocent
smoothie, but I am sure that he is a smoothie in his own way. The
campaign was backed by the British Soft Drinks Association, which I am
sure also has its own reasons for supporting it. When Innocent
smoothies set up the petition, it received 22,000
signatures.</div><a name="080619103000530"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080619103000874"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Todd</b> (South Derbyshire) (Lab): The new clause refers
to &#147;beverages containing fruit juice&#148;. That is
substantially different from a discussion of fresh juice, which I am
sure Innocent would advocate very powerfully. I drink Innocent
smoothies myself. The new clause does not make entirely the point that
the hon. Lady is dwelling
on.</div><a name="080619103000705"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div><a name="080619103000531"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000875"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> It does, but one of the key issues that the
Government need to look at is how broad would be the extent of any
reduction of standard rate VAT to a lower rate. A key debate would be
whether it would be restricted to pure fruit juice. One main reason for
the change in VAT law was a reaction to how fruit juice might be
defined. Those are all issues to be discussed.</div>
<a name="080619103000532"></a><div class="hs_Para">We seek to
encourage that debate but, most importantly, to encourage it in terms
of where we are now rather than in a fact-free environment. We do not
know the Treasury view on demand elasticity, health benefits or price
elasticity of fruit juice. The Treasury could look into many issues to
get a better understanding of where 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column895" />Column number: 895</div>the line might be drawn, such as whether fruit juice combined with water
or any other liquid might be included or whether it would be a more a
restricted definition of pure fruit juice.</div>
<a name="080619103000533"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
understand&#151;I think that the hon. Member for South Derbyshire was
alluding to this&#151;whether it is better to have a more restricted
definition or whether broadening it out would mean fewer health
benefits. Although drinks and beverages may have fruit juice in them,
they may also have other ingredients such as sugar, which may lessen
the health benefits. The hon. Member for South Derbyshire raised a very
good point.</div>
<a name="080619103000534"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I was
saying, the Innocent smoothie petition got 22,000 signatures. It is
becoming recognised that this nation has a real issue with obesity,
particularly childhood obesity. A Foresight report estimated that such
weight problems could cost the wider economy in the region of
&#163;16 billion.</div>
<a name="080619103000535"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is time
to start looking at whether we are using all the mechanisms available
to Government, including VAT law and tax. We will not get to the bottom
of this if we do not get the facts for Ministers to look at and for
this House to start debating.</div>
<a name="080619103000536"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our new
clause is designed to help do that. I look forward to hearing what the
Minister has to say. We should not hide from facts. In today&#146;s
Britain we are increasingly looking at our tax system to change
behaviour. This is not something that we have ever done as broadly as
we are now discussing, particularly with regard to green taxation. We
will not be able to understand how tax can change behaviour for the
better&#151;for the individual and the country&#151;if we do not
carry out the research and investigations and have the necessary
debate.</div>
<a name="080619103000537"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause
10 is about ensuring that we will lay a report before Parliament so
that it can have a debate and get to the bottom of these vital issues,
including fruit juice. I will listen with interest to what the Minister
has to
say.</div><a name="080619103000538"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000876"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I will respond briefly to what has been a short but
tantalising debate about some of the uses of tax instruments for
incentivising potentially healthy outcomes.</div>
<a name="080619103000539"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
think that any member of the Committee disagrees with the worries
raised by the hon. Member for Putney about trends in obesity, childhood
eating habits, nutrition and ongoing health. I suspect that those
concerns are shared across the House.</div>
<a name="080619103000540"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause
10 proposes that the Treasury should, within six months of the Bill
passing into law, lay before the House of Commons a report on the
potential revenue costs and health benefits of a VAT reduction for
beverages containing fruit juice. There is a bit of a difficulty in
that issue, as hon. Government Members have pointed out. As the hon.
Lady hinted after my earlier intervention, that problem led to the term
&#147;manufactured&#148; being dropped from the existing tax rules
in 1993, as that had meant that all fruit drinks, whether manufactured
or pure, were included in VAT rather than excluded.</div>
<a name="080619103000541"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
think that any member of the Committee is unaware of the worries
surrounding obesity and the challenge of ensuring that we can change
the nation&#146;s eating habits in a positive way. I thank the hon.
Lady for her observation that the Government have been doing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column896" />Column number: 896</div>good things in that area, such as the school fruit and vegetables
scheme, the five-a-day programme, the education issues that are being
raised and the move to much healthier school
lunches.</div>
<a name="080619103000542"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000877"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> The Minister is right that the Government have
been doing stuff&#151;I should say initiatives, rather than stuff.
However, one thing that I did not mention was that last year the
Government abandoned their target to halve childhood obesity by 2010
and set a goal of reducing it by 2020. Despite that action, there is an
issue regarding what progress will really be made. I caveat my comments
about what the Government have been doing with a concern about that
step back from what was an ambitious but obviously important target on
childhood obesity
reduction.</div><a name="080619103000543"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000878"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I do not want to get diverted by having an argument
with the hon. Lady about the Government&#146;s commitment to ensuring
that we have a healthy nation and that we teach our children, in
particular, how to eat healthily when they are besieged by all kinds of
temptations to do otherwise, because that is not appropriate to the new
clause. However, I hope that she will acknowledge, as I thought she
had, that all members of the Committee are interested in a positive
solution to those challenges. I am particularly interested in what we
can do to reduce the seemingly absurd positive correlation between
poverty and obesity, which I do not think many people would have been
able to predict would have been such a problem as we move
forward.</div>
<a name="080619103000544"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us get
back to new clause 10, which suggests that we look at the potential
revenue costs and health benefits of a VAT reduction on beverages
containing fruit juice. There are, however, many difficulties about
what those beverages
are.</div><a name="08062034000002"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000879"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="080619103000545"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000880"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> No, I want to develop this argument. The hon. Lady
admitted that fruit juice could be 100 per cent. pure, which many of us
know to have good health benefits, although one has to be careful that
children do not drink too much because the acidity is not always good
for their dental health. It is much better for them to eat the fruit
and get the fibre at the same time, so some issues need to be
considered. Also, beverages containing fruit juice could cover all
sorts of beverages that are completely unhealthy, so it will become an
issue of whether we can restrict the VAT reductions to the right kinds
of beverages. It was difficulty in that area that saw beverages brought
into VAT in the first place, with the 1993 changes.</div>
<a name="080619103000546"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are not
against thinking about the issue in principle, but some of the
difficulties with using VAT and tax rules to try to achieve healthy
outcomes are precisely those that were experienced in 1993. We have a
thing called fiscal neutrality in our VAT rules, which are EU-based,
meaning that there has to be equal VAT treatment of substitutable
products to the extent that any VAT difference could impact on consumer
choice. Whether one could argue that pure fruit juice and a fruit juice
made with higher levels of sugar were not substitutable products for
that VAT rule is part of the difficulty that was resolved in 1993. It
is not a boundary 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column897" />Column number: 897</div>that it would necessarily be possible for us to maintain. That is one of
the issues that we are having to consider as we think about whether we
could use reductions of VAT on particular beverages to incentivise
healthy eating or
drinking.</div><a name="080619103000547"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000881"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> I want to take the hon. Lady back to her earlier
comments about poverty and obesity. She commented on that link, a
positive correlation&#151;the greater the poverty, the greater the
chance of being obese. That may not be surprising, if things like
chips, hotdogs, burgers and biscuits have zero-rated VAT, when fruit
juice has standard-rated
VAT.</div><a name="080619103000548"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000882"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> It is also possible, Sir Nicholas, to eat your five
a day without incurring any VAT. The issue that we are dealing with is
that VAT is a purchase tax that has developed. We have zero-rating for
about 60 per cent. of food, because that is what we had when
we came into the EU. There are anomalies all over. There is the VAT on
particular foods. There is even an anomaly with water&#151;if one
drinks tap water, it is not VAT-able, but if one drinks it out of a
bottle, it is. VAT does not apply to tap water at all, but people still
do not drink enough water. I suggest to the Committee that whether VAT
exists on a product or not is not the only difficulty that we have
here. The result of reducing VAT might not have that positive a
correlation with the end that we all want to see. We have to think
about whether the instruments that the new clause suggests, and which
we are considering, would achieve the desired end. I do not think that
that is by any means proved at the
moment.</div><a name="080619103000549"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000883"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> The hon. Lady is putting her case entirely
reasonably. It is precisely because we agree&#151;we would agree with
every word she has said in that last paragraph or two&#151;that we
are not considering a prescriptive new clause, saying that VAT shall be
reduced on fruit juices. We are considering a new clause that asks the
Government to get at the underlying facts and set them out so that hon.
Members can consider
them.</div><a name="080619103000550"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
accept that the issue is complicated. We accept that there all sorts of
anomalies in the VAT system. She talked about substitution between
products. The essence of the argument is that there is substitution
between fruit and pure fruit juices. It happens, by and large, to be
easier to get children to take fruit in the form of juices than in the
form of solid fruit. I speak as one who has tried. However, she made an
interesting point about the negative dental effects of drinking too
much fruit juice. There are arguments on both sides. It is precisely
because we want to understand the balance of those arguments that we
are seeking to persuade the Government of the merits of looking into
that and setting out the answers in a way that all Members of the House
could
consider.</div><a name="080619103000551"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000884"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I do not disagree with that, but there are other
difficulties. It is possible to remain sceptical as to whether VAT is
the right instrument to achieve that, particularly given that it is
unclear whether we could draw the boundaries in a way that would be
sensible from a health point of view. We also have to think about the
opportunities to use the money in other areas that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column898" />Column number: 898</div>would be forgone if we had a reduction in VAT, such as extending the
school fruit and vegetable scheme to nursery education. That might be a
better use for the
money.</div><a name="080619103000706"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div><a name="080619103000552"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important to consider these issues carefully, and it is only right
that they are considered. It is appropriate also that we publish any
supporting information, but I would ask that this be part of the normal
Budget process rather than a completely separate process, which this
new clause suggests. We can then look at the case for a VAT reduction
in the context of the broader fiscal position and alongside alternative
tax proposals and other potential policy
instruments.</div>
<a name="080619103000553"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000885"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I think we are in danger of agreeing on
everything here. We agree with what the Minister said, and the new
clause specifically refers to the Exchequer costs as well as the health
benefits. They clearly have to be weighed, and we do not know the
outcome any more than she does. From the general tenor of her remarks,
the Government are doing work in this area. Can she give the Committee
any commitment as to whether it will be the Budget next year or the
Budget the year after when the fruits&#151;if I may put it that
way&#151;of that work will be delivered?</div>
<a name="080619103000554"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000886"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> We are doing work, and we are considering whether
this is an appropriate instrument. There was some consideration of it
in the run-up to this year&#146;s Budget. These things are still
under review, and it would be wrong of me to come up with a definitive
answer in the next month or two, but I can assure him that we are
considering all these issues. We share the anxieties, if I can put it
that way, of the challenge that is before us in terms of the trends in
childhood obesity. I note that the Department of Health is not in
favour of the reduction of VAT in this way, because it thinks there are
more focused ways of delivering these messages. But I can assure the
hon. Gentleman that we are not dismissing these concerns or interests
out of hand. There are some difficulties, and I have explained two or
three of them, in terms of fiscal neutrality and definitions. But I
hope that, with this explanation, the hon. Member for Putney will
withdraw her new clause.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000887"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for her comments.
It is helpful to know that the Treasury is actively reviewing this
area. I understand that, back in the Budget of 2006, there was an
announcement by the then Chancellor, now Prime Minister, of a review of
the taxation of non-alcoholic drinks, but it seems to have been lost
over time. It would be helpful to know what the deliberations going on
at the moment&#151;by the sound of it, in the Treasury and Department
of Health&#151;are turning up in terms of new evidence and
assessments.</div><a name="080619103000556"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
whole point of our new clause was to get facts on the table, as my hon.
Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said, so that we can
understand the trade-offs between these competing policy areas, and
where we might want to put resources and where they might be most
effective in terms of achieving healthy eating. So from my perspective,
this has been a really 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column899" />Column number: 899</div>helpful debate, and I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s comments. I

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000889"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to
discuss</div>
<a name="080619103000562"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause
14&#151;<i class="I">Report on impact of Finance Bill on people on low
incomes</i><i class="I">&#151;</i></div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;It
shall be the duty of the Treasury to prepare and lay before the House
of Commons, at the time of publication of each Finance Bill, a report
on the impact on individuals in the lowest income decile of the
population of the measures contained in that Finance
Bill.&#146;.</div><a name="080619103000563"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000890"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> New clause 13 would require the Treasury to lay
before Parliament every year, when the Finance Bill was published, an
assessment of its impact on people aged over 60, and new clause 14
would place a similar requirement in respect of people in the lowest
income decile.</div>
<a name="080619103000564"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clauses
or amendments requiring the laying of a report are often simply devices
for holding a debate. In this case, it is entirely substantive to
suggest that it would be convenient for Members of the House of Commons
if the Government were to table reports detailing these issues at the
time that the Finance Bill is published. We have had probably as good a
reminder as one could conceivably devise of the need to understand the
impact of a measure on different groups in our society over the course
of the last six months with the debate on the 10p rate&#151;more of
which in a
moment.</div><a name="080619103000565"></a><div class="hs_Para">Older
people are amongst the most vulnerable citizens in our society and any
Government have a duty to ensure that they are not unfairly treated.
That means, alongside the panoply of positive measures to try to
address the issues that particularly face pensioners, we need to ensure
that none of the general measures that we are introducing&#151;we are
looking particularly at taxation measures introduced in Finance
Acts&#151;have the effect, either inadvertently or otherwise, of
worsening the situation that those people find themselves in.
At the very least, we ought to ensure that Members of
Parliament scrutinising proposed legislation and debating these issues,
do so with their eyes open, so that if they introduce a measure that
may impact adversely on groups such as the over-60s&#151;there may be
occasions when sadly, for fiscal or other reasons, it is necessary to
do so&#151;they do so with their eyes open and in full knowledge and
understanding of the effects and implications of the legislation
that  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column900" />Column number: 900</div>they are passing. In other words, we should not introduce measures that
have unintended consequences that then have to be unravelled after a
political furore.</div>
<a name="080619103000567"></a><div class="hs_Para">Older
people, of course, face some very severe pressures at the moment, which
makes the introduction of this new clause, with effect for all future
Finance Bills, particularly pertinent. The soaring price&#151;I might
say, without wishing to resort to hyperbole&#151;of fuel and food,
while it affects all of us, even those who are relatively well-off,
clearly has a devastating and disproportionate effect on those living
on fixed incomes, and a significant proportion of those living on fixed
incomes will be pensioners.</div>
<a name="080619103000568"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Minister will accept that the purpose of both of these new clauses
is to avoid unforeseen circumstances and to ensure that Parliament,
commentators and the public debate are well informed. As I think she
will be among the first to acknowledge, unforeseen consequences of
measures in Finance Bills can have political as well as economic
impact. The Government would be wise to look at what is being proposed
here and consider whether this would not be a measure that could avoid
future pitfalls from unintended consequences of measures introduced in
Finance Bills.</div>
<a name="080619103000569"></a><div class="hs_Para">I must give
credit to the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field), who during
consideration of last year&#146;s Finance Bill tabled a provision
that was a little too restrictive for the taste of the official
Opposition. It would have required the Government to assess the impact
of measures in the Finance Bill on those at the bottom of the income
scale and, as I understand it, it would have prevented such measures
from being introduced unless and until offsetting mitigation measures
were also included. It would have severely restricted the
Treasury&#146;s ability to propose fiscal measures. As I have
acknowledged&#151;I am sure the Financial Secretary will
agree&#151;none of us would choose fiscal measures that
disproportionately burden the poorest and most vulnerable. The Treasury
needs flexibility to deal with the fiscal situation that it is in,
which frankly is not good and, from figures published today, does not
seem to be heading in a positive direction. The right hon.
Gentleman&#146;s proposal was a useful and helpful measure, as it
would have drawn attention to and clearly set out the likely impact of
the measures in the Finance Bill on those most vulnerable
groups.</div>
<a name="080619103000570"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
originally published, the Finance Bill contained a measure announced in
the 2007 Budget that would have left 5.3 million households worse
off&#151;the abolition of the 10p tax rate. A significant number of
those households, at least 700,000, would have been people between the
ages of 60 and 64. I say &#147;would have been&#148;, because the
Government have subsequently changed tack and, rather humiliatingly,
introduced a mini-Budget to announce further changes that reduce the
number of people placed at a net disadvantage by the measure. I am sure
that the Government would have preferred not to have needed to do that.
I am sure that Labour MPs&#151;many of whom, to their credit,
identified and vocalised their concerns between the Budget and the
Committee of the whole House&#151;would have preferred the potential
impacts of the measure to have been set out and understood earlier.
They could have made their feelings known discreetly to Ministers, who
would then have understood the scale of the feeling across the House on
those issues and something could have been done earlier with much 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column901" />Column number: 901</div>less fuss and bother for everyone, especially the Government. I hope
that the Minister is appreciative of my concern to spare the Government
embarrassment wherever possible.</div>
<a name="080619103000571"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even after
the compensation package, 300,000 60 to 64-year-olds will still be
worse off as a result of a 10p rate cut. An unfortunate fact,
inconvenient to hon. Members on both sides of the Committee, is that
the Government do not routinely provide any distributional impact
information on the measures as part of the Budget process. Although the
new clause talks of publishing such a report not later than the time of
publication of the Finance Bill, we envisage that a distributional
impact analysis could be published at the time of the Budget that
introduced the measure&#151;that is something that I hope will become
practice if the new clauses are accepted.</div>
<a name="080619103000572"></a><div class="hs_Para">In practice,
it is left to organisations such as the Institute for Fiscal Studies to
go through the small print and publish an attempt at distributional
analysis, which sometimes the Government decline to endorse. On other
occasions&#151;this year was one of them&#151;the Government
broadly endorsed the analysis of the IFS of the distributional impact
of the measure. The Treasury Committee also takes evidence on issues
including distributional impact and ultimately publishes a report on
the Budget measures which includes such an analysis and its comments
thereon, although that is usually some time after the critical
point.</div><a name="080619103000707"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div><a name="080619103000573"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are arguing for transparency. It is crucial that Members of Parliament
have the necessary information to scrutinise legislation properly. The
Financial Secretary will remember, and members of the Committee will
have very firmly in their minds, that no less a person than the Prime
Minister, at the beginning of his term of office, stated quite clearly
his intention to reinforce the role of Parliament in scrutinising the
Executive. If Parliament has an important role in scrutinising the
Executive, it is nowhere more important than in relation to the Finance
Bill, the premier piece of legislation in the Government&#146;s
programme each year. This new clause is designed to reinforce that
scrutiny process and thus to reinforce the Prime Minister&#146;s
desire to give more teeth to Parliament in its scrutiny and oversight
of the working of the
Executive.</div><a name="080619103000574"></a><div class="hs_Para">Pensioners
are currently struggling with higher food and fuel bills. Frankly, most
of them do not see much light at the end of the tunnel. They are
looking for some sign of relief from the Government. At the very least,
they are looking for a recognition that their specific vulnerability
should be taken into account when general revenue raising measures are
introduced in the Finance Bill so that mitigation can be put in place
if that is appropriate, or that the general measures can be tempered in
recognition of the impact that they will have on older
people.</div><a name="080619103000575"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
number of pensioners going bankrupt has more than doubled in the last
five years from just 900 in 2002 to 7,900 in 2007. That looks like more
than doubling to me. It is up nearly tenfold in those five years. That
is partly a result of the complexity of the means-tested pension credit
system. That is not just my analysis, but the analysis in an
independent report on why so many  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column902" />Column number: 902</div>pensioners miss out on the benefits to which they are entitled,
published by Wilkins Kennedy under the title &#147;Proportion of
Retired Bankrupts Rising&#148; on 27 September 2007.</div>
<a name="080619103000576"></a><div class="hs_Para">More people
are reaching retirement age in debt. Perhaps that simply reflects the
tendency in recent years for people to treat their homes as a sort of
piggy bank out of which they can draw equity when they find life
getting difficult. Many people have been tempted to do that. Borrowers
in their late 50s and early 60s owe four times as much as they did a
decade ago, according to a study by Barclays and Help the
Aged.</div><a name="080619103000577"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
10p fiasco is not the first time that pensioners have been adversely
affected by measures in a Finance Bill. It is not the first time that
measures that would have an impact on pensioners have gone initially
unnoticed, or at least with their significance unacknowledged. I remind
the Committee that as long ago as the Labour party conference of
October 1996, the now Prime Minister gave a pledge of</div>
<a name="080619103000683"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;fairness to
the pensioners under Labour.&#148;</div>
<a name="080619103000578"></a><div class="hs_Para">The truth is
that various fiscal measures that he has taken over the past 10 years
when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer have adversely affected British
pensioners and reduced security in retirement, often in a way that is
not clear at the time. Sometimes that has been inadvertent, and
sometimes it has been the result of a stealth measure. This
Government&#146;s first welfare reform Minister, the right hon.
Member for Birkenhead, summarised the Government&#146;s record by
saying
that</div><a name="080619103000684"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;when
Labour came to office we had one of the strongest pension provisions in
Europe and now probably we have some of the
weakest&#148;.</div><a name="080619103000579"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to talk about a matter on which this new clause 13 would have a
specific impact: the decision taken in 1997, and implemented in the
Finance Act 1997, to abolish the tax credit on dividends, costing
occupational pension schemes billions of pounds and undermining the
retirement security of millions of people. That measure, which has cost
pension funds an estimated &#163;5 billion a year since it was
introduced in 1997, has eroded confidence in pension savings and,
according to actuaries, has reduced the capital value of pension funds
by at least &#163;100 billion.</div>
<a name="080619103000580"></a><div class="hs_Para">Yet the
truth is that none of us&#151;even those who were looking for the
undeclared consequences of Government announcements and legislative
proposals back in 1997&#151;spotted the significance of the abolition
of dividend credits. Those lobbying for pensioner and pension fund
interests did not make the case loudly at the time. I accept that that
is partly due to the fact that, back in the heady days of 1997, the
concept of stealth taxes was an entirely new one. The convention had
always been that changes in taxes were announced in the Budget and then
enacted in the Finance Bill. At that time, we had not yet got used to
sifting through the small print, looking for the changes that were
unannounced but nevertheless of major significance. The truth is that
even if that measure had been announced later, when we understood the
concept of stealth taxes, it would have been difficult to identify its
significance, and certainly difficult to quantify its significance and
its impact on people aged over 60.</div>
<a name="080619103000581"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause would require the Government to bring out into the open the
distributional impacts of measures in the Budget, so that there would
never again 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column903" />Column number: 903</div>be an opportunity for a Government to sneak in a measure like the
dividend tax credit abolition without explaining and accounting to
Parliament for the impact it would have on this particularly vulnerable
group: people over the age of
60.</div><a name="080619103000582"></a><div class="hs_Para">You
will know, Sir Nicholas, some of the statistics around the situation
affecting pensioners. Five sixths of final salary pension schemes have
closed since 2007, &#147;under our watch&#148;, as the right hon.
Member for Birkenhead put it. Only a third of final salary pension
schemes are still open to new members. You will remember, Sir Nicholas,
the papers released under the Freedom of Information Act 2000, after a
long battle by the Treasury to prevent their release, which showed that
the then Chancellor, the current Prime Minister, was advised in very
precise terms in 1997 of the damage that the abolition of dividend tax
credit would do to pension funds. It is not the case that these were
unidentified consequences.</div>
<a name="080619103000583"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, if
new clause 13 had been in effect at the time of the Finance Act
1997&#151;I think it was Finance Act No. 2, since we had just had a
general election&#151;the Government would have had to set out in
very clear black and white terms the impact of this measure on pension
funds and pensioners, particularly poor pensioners. It was very clear,
and the Chancellor was advised very clearly, that the poorest
pensioners would be hit
hardest.</div><a name="080619103000584"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are trying to get the argument into the public domain in a way that is
conducive to good governance. At the time of the 1997 events, various
things were said. The current Secretary of State for Children, Schools
and Families claimed that the changes were</div>
<a name="080619103000585"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the best thing
for the long-term investment of the UK
economy.&#148;</div><a name="080619103000586"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
Derek Scott, who was an economics adviser to No. 10 at the time,
thought differently. He
said:</div><a name="080619103000685"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
thought it was a crackers thing to do. The policy came out of the
Treasury and I thought it was a mad thing to do and said so at the
time. The idea that it helps investment by hitting pension funds is
ludicrous.&#148;</div>
<a name="080619103000587"></a><div class="hs_Para">So we have these
tensions inside the broader Government machine, but we do not get them
out into the open. We need the facts set out in the open, we need all
the information out there, and we need the distributional impacts fully
spelled out so that we can understand them, discuss them openly and
scrutinise what the Government are
doing.</div><a name="080619103000588"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080619103000891"></a><b class="B">Stephen
Hesford</b> (Wirral, West) (Lab): The hon. Gentleman is making
an entirely bogus case. He knows that the pensions industry did not
suffer because of the reasons he suggests. There were reasons why the
pensions industry did suffer, but they had absolutely nothing to do
with what the then Chancellor, now the Prime Minister, did in the
Finance Act to which he refers. There were a number of reasons why the
pensions industry suffered, and I will ask him to ponder on three
indications.</div>
<a name="080619103000589"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
around 2000, there was the dotcom bust, which caused investments to go
down. That was one part of the story. Secondly, there was a
miscalculation by the actuaries about people&#146; longevity, so such
pension provision became unsupportable and expensive and therefore
unfashionable. Thirdly, there was a miscalculation
about  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column904" />Column number: 904</div>pension holidays&#151;contribution holidays&#151;and the catch-up
became too expensive. It was nothing to do with the then
Chancellor.</div><a name="080619103000590"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000892"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes his point, but it will
not surprise him to hear that I disagree entirely. It is difficult to
understand how anyone could think that &#163;5 billion per year could
be taken out of pension funds, making a &#163;5 billion hit on their
income, not once, but every year, without that having a negative impact
on the value of those funds and the future security of retirees who
depend on
them.</div><a name="080619103000591"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000893"></a>Stephen

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000895"></a>Stephen
Hesford:</b> It is a bogus issue. On one of the last occasions
that the matter was debated, it became clear that the policy&#151;the
withdrawal that the then Chancellor, now Prime Minister,
continued&#151;was started under the Conservative Government. The
reason that it was started under the Conservative Government was that
it was thought to be&#151;and was, based on the knowledge at the time
the decisions were
taken&#151;affordable.</div><a name="080619103000594"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000896"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> The problem with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
argument is that it is very clear now, but was not clear then, in 1997,
that Treasury officials identified the problems that would be caused to
pension funds, the Chancellor was advised of them, and the suggestion
that the measure was expected to be positive is itself bogus. We saw
that when eventually, after a two-year legal battle fought with public
money, the freedom of information request made by <i class="I">The Times</i> was
finally acceded to. However, I suspect, Sir Nicholas, you would not
want me to divert into a debate that, as the hon. Gentleman rightly
says, we have had before in this House. Indeed, I had the privilege of
winding up a debate on the disclosures under the Freedom of Information
Act to <i class="I">The Times</i> last April or May. We had a very good debate on
that occasion.</div>
<a name="080619103000708"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div><a name="080619103000595"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point that the hon. Gentleman would not disagree with me about, given
the disclosures that have now been made, is this: there were impacts on
pensioners, people over 60, as a result of that measure. Those impacts
were not well understood at the time. We did not understand them. He
and I were both brand new Members at the time, and I do not think that
he understood them either. If we had a principle that when measures
were proposed in the Finance Act, the distribution of the impact on
different groups of the population, particularly vulnerable groups,
would be set out in a report to Parliament then the debate would be
informed and hon. Members representing constituents who were to be
disadvantaged, as with the 10p changes, would hear the views of those
constituents and could in turn make those views known, either through
unofficial contact with Ministers and the Treasury or through open
debate in Parliament. That would be a good
thing.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000897"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> My hon. Friend is making some sensible points. Does
he agree that it is also a salutary lesson that any incoming Government
should not restrict their room for manoeuvre? To a large extent, what
happened in 1997 was that the Government came
in&#151;</div><a name="080619103000597"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000898"></a>The

history. Can hon. Members please deal with the Finance Bill that is in

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000899"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> The only reason I am raising the events of 1997
is to show that there are cases&#151;we had one last year, we had one
in 1997 and there have been others of a less significant
nature&#151;where the absence of a requirement to report to
Parliament on the distributional impact of a measure means that it goes
unnoticed.</div>
<a name="080619103000599"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000900"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> I certainly know the impact of there not being
such an obligation on the Government. I have been trying for nearly six
weeks to find out what the impact of vehicle excise duty is on those on
a low income, many of whom will be elderly, and I have singularly
failed to get one parliamentary question answered that I tabled at the
beginning of May. I have written specifically to the Ministers on this
and had no response yet, so I know well why the new clause is
needed.</div>
<a name="080619103000600"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000901"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I was just going to refer to my hon.
Friend&#146;s difficulty as another example. The vehicle excise duty
debate, which we have already had, is another
example&#151;</div>
<a name="080619103000601"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000902"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I am sorry, but I really must ask the
Opposition to deal with the Bill, and not vehicle excise duty, which is
not relevant to this particular debate.</div>
<a name="080619103000602"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000903"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> With respect, Sir Nicholas, this debate is about
a new clause that would require the Treasury to report on the
distributional impact of any measure included in the Finance Bill. If
new clause 13 were in effect now, the proposals in the Bill on vehicle
excise duty would have been reported on in terms of their
distributional impact on people over the age of 60 and, under the terms
of new clause 14, their impact on people in the lowest income decile.
My hon. Friend has been seeking that information from the Government
for some time, through parliamentary questions, which is the only route
available to us, and the Government simply ignored her request for
information. As we do not have such information about the impact on
particular groups, it is impossible for us to make the case fully
against measures that we believe are extremely unhelpful and wrong in
the current environment. That is why the new clause has been
tabled.</div><a name="080619103000603"></a><div class="hs_Para">Figures
released only last week show that pensioner poverty has risen by
300,000 both before and after housing costs. The need to address the
concerns and problems of people over the age of 60 is therefore even
more acute. As they face the rising pressure of price increases from
which we all suffer, and some of the burden of the taxation changes
that the Government are making, it is incumbent on us in the House to
ensure that the impacts on that vulnerable group of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column906" />Column number: 906</div>people are known to us, are manageable and are not excessive. The number
of pensioners living in poverty now stands at 2.5 million before
housing costs, and 2.1 million after housing costs, and we
all share the objective of ensuring that those numbers do not increase.
We must keep a close handle on such
matters.</div><a name="080619103000604"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have dealt with pensioners under new clause 13, and I shall speak now
about new clause 14 and explain why it is important for us to have an
analysis of the impact on those in the lowest income groups. We have
phrased the new clause in terms of people in the bottom income decile,
but I should be happy to consider a suggestion from the Government that
it might be targeted differently. The right hon. Member for Birkenhead
sought in his amendment to the Finance Act 2007 to look at the impact
on the lowest quintile of the income spectrum, and it would be
perfectly legitimate for us to debate which group we need to focus on
given the position
today.</div><a name="080619103000605"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are in a shocking situation. The United Kingdom has a higher proportion
of its children living in workless households than any other EU
country. The poorest fifth of households in the UK pay a higher
proportion of their income in taxes than any other group. Surely that
in itself is a reason why we must study carefully the distributional
impact of taxation measures proposed under the Finance
Bill.</div><a name="080619103000606"></a><div class="hs_Para">Social
mobility in this country is the lowest of any country in the developed
world. It has declined to the extent that a poor child born in Britain
in 1970 is less likely to escape the poverty of its upbringing than one
born in Britain in 1958. That is partly because of the
Government&#146;s insistence on tackling poverty by attacking the
symptoms rather than by attacking the causes, which are largely social
and family breakdown, addiction, debt and
worklessness.</div><a name="080619103000607"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why
focus on the need to identify the impact now? Again, in this
year&#146;s Finance Bill, the interests of the poor were sacrificed
on the altar of political expediency. It was a shameful attempt, and it
ultimately backfired on the Government. Clearly, when the now Prime
Minister announced his measures in the 2007 Budget, he expected to have
had the general election before the impact of the abolition of the 10p
tax rate became apparent to people. If new clause 14 had been in
effect, he would have had to set out precisely what the impact was and
explain the measures, so that low-income families would have seen the
impact and made their concerns known to their Members of Parliament.
Those worries would have been transmitted back, and we might not have
had all the problems that we have had
subsequently.</div><a name="080619103000608"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
case for considering the impact on those groups makes itself. The
Select Committee on the Treasury, in its report on the 2008 Budget,
said
that</div><a name="080619103000686"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
group of main losers from the abolition of the 10 pence rate of income
tax seem an unreasonable target for raising additional tax revenues to
fund these and other
initiatives.&#148;</div><a name="080619103000609"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
all know that the parliamentary Labour party agreed with the
Committee&#146;s view. I could&#151;but I will not&#151;give you
innumerable quotes on the issue, Sir Nicholas, from people of undoubted
stature who understand the importance of considering the impact of such
measures in general, and this measure in particular, on those at the
bottom of the income scale.</div>
<a name="080619103000610"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say to the
Financial Secretary that even after the Government&#146;s volte-face,
when they rewrote the Budget after telling us that they could not
rewrite it and found 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column907" />Column number: 907</div>&#163;2.7 billion after telling us in the run-up to the Crewe and
Nantwich by-election that they had no money&#151;not that it did them
much good; the cost was &#163;213,000 per vote cast&#151;1.1
million households are still worse off as a result of the measure. We
know who they are now, but only because of work done by organisations
such as the Institute for Fiscal Studies, not because of official
analysis by the
Government.</div><a name="080619103000611"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
still do not know whether the measures announced by the Chancellor a
few weeks ago to mitigate the impact on the 4 million adversely
affected are temporary and for this year only or permanent. If the
Financial Secretary can throw any light on that, it will be enormously
helpful&#151;mainly, I suspect, to those members of the Committee
from her own party. It will prevent such a situation from ever arising
again. It will prevent people such as the hon. Member for Blyth Valley
(Mr. Campbell) from having to pop up and say things such
as:</div><a name="080619103000687"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
don&#146;t know where we&#146;re going hitting the working man at
every corner&#148;,</div>
<a name="080619103000612"></a><div class="hs_Para">or the hon. Member for
Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) from having to say, as he did on the BBC
news on 27
May:</div><a name="080619103000613"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is a bombshell that will explode when it comes into force. We are
warning this will hit people and will hit the
Government.&#148;</div>
<a name="080619103000614"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is what
happens when people discover after the event, and after the opportunity
for them to have their say has passed, that measures will negatively
affect ultra-vulnerable groups in a way that they did not anticipate
when those measures were first announced. In an effort to be helpful, I
am skipping some points that I wanted to make, but I realise that the
hour is pressing, so I shall not detain the Committee for much
longer.</div>
<a name="080619103000615"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
fully that the Minister may not accept the new clauses. She may argue
against accepting them. That is fine, but it is difficult to see in
principle how one can make a case against a transparent official
analysis of the distributional impact of proposed legislative measures.
I believe that it is normal practice in many other jurisdictions. We
are considering measures to change how we make tax law. We have
announced a review under the chairmanship of Lord Howe to look at how
we make and scrutinise tax law in the House. There is a widespread
feeling, and not only on the Opposition Benches, that the Finance Bill
and the supply estimates, which are important parts of the machinery of
government, are not properly or adequately scrutinised. They are at the
heart of what we do in Parliament, and a necessary part of ensuring
that they are properly scrutinised is to make adequate information
available to all Members of the House&#151;information that can be
relied upon and quoted in debate, because it is official
information.</div>
<a name="080619103000709"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div><a name="080619103000616"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to ask the Financial Secretary a specific question. Whether
she chooses to accept the new clauses, and whether she accepts the case
for the publication of the distributional impact of tax measures, will
she at least assure the Committee that the Treasury makes such a
distributional impact assessment? It is one thing to understand that
the Treasury has done the work but chooses not to share it with
Parliament, so that Parliament cannot scrutinise the Bill properly, but
wholly another to suggest that the Treasury has not
done the work at all.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column908" />Column number: 908</div><a name="080619103000617"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the debate
on the abolition of the 10p tax rate&#151;perhaps I should call it
the doubling of the 10p rate&#151;I think that we got an
acknowledgement from the Treasury that it had done the analysis and
identified the number of people who would be losers, and how that total
number broke down into various sub-groups such as couples without
children, young people on low earnings, and people between the ages of
60 and 64 who were not able to benefit from pension credit. However, it
would be useful to be reassured that the Treasury does the work.
Therefore, we are asking, through the new clauses, for the publication
of information that is already held in the Treasury, not for additional
work or costs to the public purse. We want that information to be
placed in the public domain so that Parliament has the opportunity to
hold the Executive to account.</div>
<a name="080619103000618"></a><div class="hs_Para">You may not
agree with me on everything, Sir Nicholas, or even on much, but I am
sure that you will agree that it is our basic duty in this place to
hold the Government to account, and that we can do so only if we are
provided with the proper information and tools. It is not acceptable,
in the 21st century, with a Prime Minister who says that he wants to
strengthen the power of Parliament, for analysis to be made in the
Treasury and kept there so that Parliament has to guess. The evidence
of history is that Parliament, on all sides, sometimes fails to
identify the impact of measures on those groups that most need our
protection, most look to us to defend their interests, and most need us
to identify and protest about measures that have a negative impact on
them and their
families.</div><a name="080619103000619"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
look forward to hearing what the Financial Secretary has to say. If she
feels that the principle is acceptable, but the precise definition of
income groups targeted in new clause 14 is wrong, we have no
philosophical commitment to the lowest income decile&#151;it could be
a wider group that she feels is important. When she rises to respond,
perhaps she will bear this in mind: opposition is difficult, whether
from the Government Back Benches or from the official Opposition.
Perhaps the lesson of what has happened over the past six months is
that sometimes, what the opponents of a measure have to say, whether on
the Government side or the other side, has value and validity. She
might think about how difficult opposition is, because she might have
the opportunity to practise it some time in the not-too-distant
future.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000904"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before I ask the Minister to reply, I wish to
say that I am gravely concerned about the way in which the proceedings
are being carried forward today. I am conscious that, in the Chair, I
have a responsibility to hon. Members on both sides of the Committee.
We have already lost the Scottish National party Member, who has had to
return to Scotland. I am conscious of the position of the hon. Member
for South-East Cornwall, who needs to get back to the west country.
Looking at the Government side of the Committee, I see hon. Members who
need to get back to the north-west of England and the west midlands. I
was given a fairly clear undertaking by the Whips on both sides of the
Committee that we would be able to conclude our deliberations on the
Bill at a reasonable time today, and I mean at about 4
o&#146;clock.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000906"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Yes indeed. I am sorry. The hon. Gentleman was
not here a lot earlier this week, and I am afraid the understanding
that I had was that we would reach the conclusion of our debates at a
reasonable time. That will clearly not be the case. How the hon.
Gentleman can utter from a sedentary position what he has done, when he
has just spoken for 50 minutes on only one new clause, I fail to
understand. I have a responsibility to hon. Members on both sides of
the Committee and I am deeply concerned. I give notice that I intend to
suspend the Committee for a supper break at approximately half-past 7.
We have another nine debates on new clauses. That could take us until
11 o&#146;clock tonight. That is not the way in which I
believe the Committee should
proceed.</div><a name="080619103000623"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000907"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> On a point of order, Sir Nicholas, you have
referred to my comment from a sedentary position specifically. It was
my understanding that it is not usual to refer to discussions through
the usual channels, but as you have done so, I would like to say
something about the discussions that I have had. We on this side
understand that the Government&#146;s requirement is that the
Committee stage of the Bill be completed today and we have given the
Government an undertaking that we will allow that to happen. We have
not at any stage, as far as I am aware, given any commitment about the
hour at which that will occur, and I have not been asked by any Member
on the Government side to give a commitment as to the hour. It was
merely that, for the convenience of the Government&#146;s management
of the business of the House, it was necessary to have the Bill out of
Committee today, and I repeat our commitment to achieving
that.</div><a name="080619103000624"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000908"></a>The
Chairman:</b> If that is the case, the spokesman for Her
Majesty&#146;s Opposition might have had the courtesy to advise the
Chairman accordingly. I have sought to liaise with the Opposition Whip
and the Government Whip and I was led to believe on Tuesday that we
would complete our deliberations at a reasonable hour today. Clearly, I
am a servant of the Committee and I will remain here as long as is
necessary, but I give an indication that I have responsibilities. I
also have to have a meal. We have already instructed the House
authorities to keep the Tea Room open, so considerable costs are
involved in what is going on. I personally look in a rather bad light
at a gentleman member of the Committee speaking for 50 minutes on a new
clause, however important the
subject.</div><a name="080619103000625"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080619103000909"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Brooks Newmark</b> (Braintree) (Con): On a point of order, Sir
Nicholas, you have alluded to the fact that we said that we would
finish at 4. I just want to repeat the point that my hon. Friend the
Member for Runnymede and Weybridge made: we did not say that we would
finish at 4. Also, as you are well aware, we suggested, and agreed to
stay for, extra time on Tuesday, but that option was not taken up by
the Government. We gave the option. We gave an undertaking to give an
extra 45 minutes at least on Tuesday, but it was not taken
up.</div><a name="080619103000626"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000910"></a>Mr.

Forty-five minutes was offered, not 45 minutes &#147;at
least&#148;.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000911"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We have had enough recriminations. I can only
say that I am very saddened by what has happened. Previously, there has
been a constructive attitude and a very happy and genuine mood across
the Committee, but that has certainly been undermined. I think that it
has disappeared today and I deeply regret it. I call the Financial
Secretary.</div>
<a name="080619103000628"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000912"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I, too, am disappointed that after seven weeks of
what I believe has been good-natured debate, in which we have covered
many serious and detailed topics, we have hit the rocks at the last
minute. I certainly recall the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge
saying to me at 10.25 on Tuesday morning that the Committee would not
sit beyond 7 o&#146;clock on Tuesday whatever else happened. However,
we shall return to new clauses 13 and 14.</div>
<a name="080619103000629"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for Wirral, West is absolutely right about what
happened to pensions. The most significant downward effect on the
health of pension funds came from stock market falls during the boom
and bust years, which we were subjected to when the Conservative party
was in power; from decisions by many firms to take a contributions
holiday, despite facing a rise in liabilities; and from rapid increases
in life
expectancy.</div><a name="080619103000630"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have a strong record of helping pensioners, with spending around
&#163;12 billion more on pensioners than if all we had done was
uprate the policies in place in 1997. Half of that additional spend
goes to the poorest third of pensioners. Both the PBR and Budget
documents already provide full details on measures that impact on
pensioners. Another document would only repeat those details.</div>
<a name="080619103000631"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall move
on to new clause 14. Our strategy since 1997 has focused on getting as
many people back into work as possible. We believe that work is the
best route out of poverty and being a Labour Minister for work is the
best job in the Government. We are committed to making work pay,
through improving financial incentives to work.</div>
<a name="080619103000632"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for
requiring reports on impacts, the Chancellor&#146;s statement of 13
May, which increased the personal allowances for 22 million basic rate
taxpayers in 2008-09 and reduced the number of households that lost out
from the Budget 2007, made clear that our aim was to continue the
sustained support for those on lower incomes in the future. That is
what we will be returning to&#151;</div>
<a name="080619103000633"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000913"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> Will the right hon. Lady give
way?</div><a name="080619103000634"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000914"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I will not give way because I think that we have
heard quite enough of the hon. Gentleman during the
debate.</div><a name="080619103000635"></a><div class="hs_Para">Producing
a report would add little benefit to the aim of supporting those on the
lowest incomes. The new clauses would merely require the Government to
duplicate what we already produce. The hon. Gentleman can have had no
reasonable expectation that his new clauses would have been accepted.
On that basis, I finish my comments.</div>
<a name="080619103000636"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000915"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> The Minister did not reply substantively at all,
which is her privilege. She did not answer the question as to whether
the distributional analysis is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column911" />Column number: 911</div>available and undertaken by the Treasury, and the Committee will note
that accordingly. Of course, we cannot force her to give us an answer
unless we pursue it with written questions or a freedom of information
request, but it would have been helpful if we had known the answer.
Having listened to the Minister&#146;s response, and in view of the
hour, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000916"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div>
<a name="080619103000641"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
covers an important issue in the context of the future direction of tax
policy. I know that the Financial Secretary is engaged in the debate to
see a way forward as chairman of a working party of businesses&#151;I
think that there is a trade union member as well. I am grateful that
the Government have taken the issue seriously. When I raised it two
years ago in a Finance Bill debate, the reaction from Treasury
Ministers was that the companies were crying wolf, and that they were
not raising a genuine and serious concern, but seeking to put pressure
on the Government. I thought that the Treasury was unwise to draw that
conclusion, having learnt, from conversations with businesses and tax
advisers, that that issue had been on their agenda from an early stage.
Having renewed those discussions recently, I understand that businesses
are seriously considering relocating their headquarters owing to the
uncompetitive nature of the corporation tax regime in this country and,
in particular, the way in which it deals with foreign subsidiaries of
UK
companies.</div><a name="080619103000710"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30
pm</div><a name="080619103000642"></a><div class="hs_Para">Earlier
this year, Shire and United Business Media, which owns <i class="I">The Daily
Telegraph</i>, <i class="I">The Sunday Telegraph</i> and others, announced that
they would move their tax domicile from the UK to jurisdictions more
favourable 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column912" />Column number: 912</div>to multi-national companies with significant offshore interests. That
triggered a widespread debate in business circles, and a number of
companies indicated that they were seriously considering relocating
their tax domicile to other more favourable jurisdictions. That
announcement also triggered renewed interest in the Government and the
working party that the Minister chairs. The Government started a
consultation on the taxation of foreign profits and the participation
exemption, and debate in general revealed some of the complexities of
the issues involved in moving towards a participation exemption, where
UK tax is not charged on dividends remitted from overseas subsidiaries
to the UK. Of course, once the Treasury removes that tax, there is an
incentive for companies to move their operations to jurisdictions with
lower tax rates. Both we and the Government recognise that
concern.</div>
<a name="080619103000643"></a><div class="hs_Para">We could go
down one of two routes. First, we could build on the existing structure
under the control of foreign companies legislation, which has worked
relatively well, despite some of the challenges that it has faced from
the European Courts and companies seeking to use the provisions of
various European treaties to attack and undermine it. I shall not
rehash debates from previous Finance Bills, but the Committee will be
aware of cases involving Marks and Spencer, and Cadbury Schweppes,
which are symbolic of the way in which people have used European
treaties to undermine that regime. The concern of companies such as UBM
and Shire was triggered by the Government&#146;s consultation
document, which relates to subsection (3)(f) of my new clause, which
deals with</div>
<a name="080619103000688"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the extent to
which special measures would be needed to protect against diversion of
profits through countries with a low rate of corporation
tax.&#148;</div><a name="080619103000644"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
could go down a second route: the Government&#146;s consultation
document mooted the idea of controlled income, which we touched on in
an earlier debate on partnerships. Control of foreign companies rules
focus on entities, whereas the Government&#146;s proposals looked at
income streams and distinguished two different sources: the first was
passive income such as dividends, interest, annuities, royalties and
rents. That was because of the recognition that they are often sources
of income with operations more susceptible to being structured&#151;I
do not want to use the word manipulated&#151;in offshore low-income
jurisdictions. The other income stream is active income, where the
income arises from trading activity. Of course, that is a much more
difficult source of income to structure, and move into a low-tax
environment. There are many more issues in deciding where to locate
trading operations. Whether one is talking about factories, offices, or
plant, there are a whole host of considerations that one might want to
take into account. It is more likely that decisions on active income
are taken in the much broader context of a genuine commercial decision,
rather than in relation to a form of tax structuring.</div>
<a name="080619103000645"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
businesses raised concerns about that. The issue goes back to how
effective we need to be, and what we need to do to prevent a diversion
of income. Many businesses felt that the rules proposed by the
Government were intrusive and expensive, and went against the grain in
relation to how businesses structure their operations and how they
report income from overseas entities into the UK. That potential
administrative or compliance 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column913" />Column number: 913</div>burden prompted a number of UK companies to decide to move their
operations overseas in advance of what they saw as being the direction
of travel in Government policy.</div>
<a name="080619103000646"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we
debate the issue of participation exemption and the taxation of those
companies, we need to think carefully about how we put in place the
right structure to prevent the artificial diversion of profits to
low-tax jurisdictions. That is an important aspect of thinking through
these changes. I am sure that it is something that the Minister and the
members of her working party are thinking about. If we get the measure
right, it will strengthen the UK as a place to do business.</div>
<a name="080619103000647"></a><div class="hs_Para">In thinking
about the right reforms to introduce, we need to address the important
issue of the impact on public finance because, in the current
conditions, we do not want to introduce a series of reforms that cannot
be funded from tax revenues. It is difficult to think about the matter
carefully and understand what the likely costs will be. The challenge
is to understand what the cost of a participation exemption will be. A
few years ago, one firm of accountants estimated that it was about
&#163;1 billion. That would clearly be a significant loss to the
Exchequer. It has also been said that that cost has fallen to about
&#163;0.5 billion, and could fall further without Government
intervention. As the rate of corporation tax falls, the cost of the
participation exemption itself will also fall. It would be helpful to
hear the Government&#146;s explanation, as it is one of the issues on
which they must be able to report when they consider the impact of
moving to a participation exemption. There are other interactions, too,
in relation to how they intend to tax foreign
profits.</div><a name="080619103000648"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are two more matters that we would like the Government to address in a
report before the publication of the 2008 pre-Budget report are. I
shall draw them together for the ease of the Committee, and they appear
in subsections (3)(b) and (e) of the new clause. One concern that flows
directly from subsection (3)(e) is what is happening at the moment when
people choose not to remit foreign profits into the UK? If a company is
not prepared to pay the additional corporation tax on that remittance,
the profits it has made in overseas jurisdictions are in effect
stranded there. They are not necessarily used to benefit the operations
of the group as a whole. They may be stuck in a low-tax jurisdiction
where there are no investment opportunities to warrant the profits
remaining there, but the company is concerned that it will have to pay
an additional charge on that remittance, so it is not prepared to pay
the dividends into the holding company. The company will receive enough
dividends from other group companies to have sufficient reserves to pay
a dividend to its shareholders, but it will not go any further than
that.</div><a name="080619103000649"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
overseas jurisdictions that have gone down that route, there has been
an unlocking of those stranded funds, which have flowed back into the
parent companies. If my recollection is correct, that was tried in the
States. It was a temporary relaxation, and within a year something like
$1 billion flowed into the parent companies. In the case of the UK,
what would those parent companies do with the dividends? Would they
choose to invest them in UK operations, which would be a good way to
seed the growth of the UK economy? Would they feel able to use them to
expand in other jurisdictions? Would they decide, if the investment
opportunities in the UK were 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column914" />Column number: 914</div>already covered by their funds and they could not make better returns
with the remitted profits from overseas, to return the dividends from
overseas subsidiaries to their shareholders, in the form of the share
buy-back or a special
distribution?</div><a name="080619103000650"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important when looking at the changes that we understand their
impact on the behaviour of parent companies in the UK, because that
would provide a broader macro-economic backdrop against which to
consider them. In this country, we do not look at the dynamic modelling
of tax changes on tax revenues, and a static analysis is undertaken.
However, it would be helpful to understand what that macro-economic
backdrop is when justifying any decision to scrap the participation
exemption.</div><a name="080619103000651"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to touch on subsections (3)(c) and (d), which deal with the
competitiveness of the UK economy and the attractiveness of the UK as a
location for multinational headquarters. On both sides of the
Committee&#151;and in the discussions and meetings that I have
participated in with the Economic Secretary&#151;there is a
recognition that business is mobile, and that people, capital and
business can be moved around. The Economic Secretary and I see that
particularly in the context of the financial services sector, where
businesses can quickly move outside the UK, or into the UK. It is
therefore important that we have a tax system that reinforces our
competitive position and gives people a reason to come to the UK. Some
of that is about the headline rates, and some of it is about the
certainty, predictability and stability of the system. We have
elaborated on those themes in
Committee.</div><a name="080619103000652"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
also need to focus on the structure of taxation for multinationals. In
many of our constituencies, the bedrock of the business base is small
and medium-sized enterprises; all our constituencies have a long tail
of small companies. However, we are dependent on multinationals&#146;
help in growing our economy, and if we are able to produce a
participation exemption that helps to keep headquarters of
multinational companies here, that is to our benefit. It is easy to
dismiss companies moving their headquarters overseas as only a few
people and a couple of offices, but it changes the mindset of the
company. The company then thinks about where to locate operations.
Perhaps its preference would instinctively be the UK, but if the
company locates its headquarters in Ireland, it might think that that
is not a bad place to do more business. We then start to see an erosion
of our tax base. Part of the challenge is to broaden the tax base, by
getting more companies into this country and ensuring that those that
we have do not go
overseas.</div><a name="080619103000711"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000917"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I am sure that my hon. Friend has discussed this
matter with accountancy firms in the City; I certainly have. They tell
me that management may be very comfortable with being in the UK, but
that shareholders increasingly insist that regular analyses of the
options are conducted. I was quite shocked to be told by one of the big
accountancy firms at a meeting a few weeks ago that every single one of
its FTSE 100 clients had sought advice at some time in the past year,
or was currently seeking advice, on the options open to them. That did
not imply that they were all moving, but that they were all alert to
the need constantly to test the logic of their domicile in the
UK.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column915" />Column number: 915</div><a name="080619103000654"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000918"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> My hon. Friend makes two important points. First,
the debate has evolved over the past two or three years from companies
simply talking about that change to their spending serious money with
their advisers in looking at how they might effect the change.
Companies are much more up front about this matter. In the past, a
number of them have relocated their tax domicile overseas as part of a
wider transaction. The flotation of Experian is an example. It was
listed in the UK market, and used flotation as an opportunity to move
its tax domicile from the UK to
Dublin.</div><a name="080619103000655"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second important point made by my hon. Friend is that the barriers to
moving have become much lower. One of the arguments that shareholders
might have used in the past against changing domicile was that they
could not list their shares on the UK stock exchange. However, as
Experian showed, a company can have all the benefits of a London
listing, but seek a low-tax domicile for its place of incorporation and
its headquarters. It is much easier for shareholders to put pressure on
management to look at their overall tax charge and at ways of managing
it, in the knowledge that there are steps the company can take that do
not require it to lose its listing in London. We must remember that
important point, because it is another example of the mobility of
multinational
businesses.</div><a name="080619103000656"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the issue of the mobility of multinationals, the UK is the location of
choice for multinationals&#146; European headquarters. Google had its
European headquarters in the UK. We have a common language and a common
approach to many issues of regulation, so it was comfortable doing
business here. However, Google, too, has moved its headquarters out of
the UK and into Ireland. Kraft Foods has moved its headquarters from
the UK to Switzerland. There is significant evidence of companies
responding to those pressures and changing the location of their
headquarters.</div><a name="080619103000657"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept that we cannot have a tax system that is skewed towards
multinationals. We must have a level playing field. I well remember
people highlighting the benefits of other jurisdictions in my days as a
practising accountant. The example of Dutch mixer companies was trotted
out on a regular basis. I am not sure that we will ever get to the
situation where our tax regime is as favourable for multinationals as
the Netherlands or Ireland. However, we need to think about what we can
do to minimise the competitive disadvantage that we suffer, which is
why we are keen to understand properly, through the proposed report,
the impact of changes to the participation exemption on the
attractiveness of the UK as a location for multinational
headquarters.</div><a name="080619103000658"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am conscious that this has been a longish speech, but this issue
dominates the corporate agenda. It has been helped along by the
Minister&#146;s working group, but its importance means that we
should have a considered debate, which takes into account the full
consequences of the participation exemption. The area is clearly one in
which both major parties have expressed a desire to see some form of
change. It would be helpful for the long-term planning of businesses to
have a much more open debate than we have had so far. I hope that the
report that proposed in new clause 15 would create the backdrop for
that debate. It would also ensure that the Minister&#146;s working
party has a deliverable objective, and does not just become somewhere
where people have a chat about the issues. It could have an output,
which 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column916" />Column number: 916</div>could form part of the wider debate. With that in mind, I hope that the
Minister is inclined to accept new clause 15 or, if nothing else, the
spirit in which it was
moved.</div><a name="080619103000659"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000919"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> The hon. Gentleman alluded to the forum that I
chair and which met for the first time on 9 June. It allows
business representatives at the highest level to provide input into the
development of policy in the area. I am not going to be drawn on the
detail and direction of our discussions. Any changes to the rules for
the taxation of foreign profits will be taken forward in
post-consultation with businesses, to produce a consultation document
in due course. I am focused on that objective, and a report of the
nature requested in the new clause is not
necessary.</div><a name="080619103000660"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000920"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I understand the Minister&#146;s reluctance and I
am disappointed by it. I think this is an important issue, and there is
a lot of focus on it. I am concerned that the committee is a way of
kicking the issue into the long grass of
taxation.</div><a name="080619103000661"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080619103000921"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I am surprised by the Minister&#146;s failure
to take the opportunity to say something about the foreign profits
taxation problem, which is clearly recognised by the Government. There
is a feeling in the business audience, which the Financial Secretary
and the Economic Secretary may have picked up in their dealings with
it, that the Government have kicked the foreign profits taxation
consultation into the long grass, because it had too many
difficulties&#151;it had ruffled the feathers of the business
community&#151;on too many fronts. What we need to establish for the
interests of UK plc&#151;the matter is not about the Labour
party&#146;s relations with business, but about the UK&#146;s
attractiveness to business as a location&#151;is some clarity and
certainty. Effectively deferring the issue for another year or
18 months leaves business in the same uncertainty that it
has been in since the Government&#146;s intention to look at the
taxation of foreign profits was announced. For every person out there
who hopes that the result of the exercise is a participation exemption,
there is someone else who fears that there may be an even more
heavy-handed treatment of taxation of foreign profits than we
have
now.</div><a name="0806206000013"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806206000176"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> My hon. Friend made a series of points in that
intervention. The one that I would focus on is uncertainty, because we
are left in a degree of limbo. The Government had proposed some
measures in the consultation document. We had expected a further
consultation document to be published in June or July&#151;I am not
clear about the status of that consultation document now, given the
Minister&#146;s response. It is heard to see what lessons business
should take away from that, and what they could expect, in terms of the
future shape and direction of Government policy on the taxation of
foreign profits. To leave people in that degree of limbo and
uncertainty, given that the Government have progressed a certain way
down the route, is regrettable. I appreciate that the Government have
been facing some flak from business over recent months over taxation,
but progress could be made by having a proper public debate. I am sorry
that the Financial Secretary does not see the need to publish a report
like this, but I suspect that the absence of such a report will cause a
great deal more speculation, concern and uncertainty. It is
disappointing. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div>

17</h4><a name="0806206000001"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">PAYE
reporting</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;The Treasury shall
commission and lay before the House of Commons, within 12 months of the
passing of this Act, an independent report into the feasibility and
estimated cost of introducing a system of monthly reporting to HM
Revenue and Customs of payments and deductions through the Pay as You
Earn system.&#146;.&#151;<i class="I">[Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806206000177"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I beg to move that the clause be read a Second
time.</div>
<a name="0806206000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 17
would require the Treasury to commission a report and lay it before the
House within 12 months on the feasibility and estimated cost of
introducing a system of monthly reporting to HMRC of payments and
deductions through the pay-as-you-earn system. I strongly suspect that
the Government may already have done some work on that or are in the
process of doing so.</div>
<a name="0806206000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">The PAYE
system was introduced broadly in its current form after the second
world war. It was then an advanced system, but at that time all
payrolls were, by necessity, manually accounted. Most people changed
employment only rarely&#151;perhaps once or twice in a lifetime, and
there was no such thing as the migrant worker. We operated in a totally
different employment environment. All that has changed. Nowadays, it is
common for people to have many jobs during their working lives. In some
industries&#151;for example, catering and hospitality&#151;it is
not uncommon for people to have several jobs at the same time; and it
is not uncommon for people to move fairly rapidly between jobs, perhaps
making two or three moves in a year.</div>
<a name="0806206000169"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7
pm</div><a name="0806206000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
PAYE system has struggled to cope with the challenges of that changing
environment. I am sure that the Government will have been looking at
the architecture of the PAYE system and considering whether, in
general, there is scope to change the way that it works. It is a
fragile animal. I am conscious of what I know to be the guiding
philosophy of HMRC; we have a pretty high level of tax compliance,
based on the rather outdated PAYE system, and we must be extremely
careful before making any changes to a fragile but none the less
functional edifice.</div>
<a name="0806206000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">We could
probably have staggered on for decades with the PAYE system in its
present form without too much trouble. There might be trouble at the
margins over people who have frequent changes of employment, or very
short periods of employment, but there would not be too much
unmanageable trouble&#151;were it not for the tax credit system.
Although the scope of the new clause is more general, in introducing a
broad review of the possibility of monthly reporting, when I develop my
theme, it will become apparent to the Committee that the problems that
have arisen over tax credits are of particular concern. It is
possible&#151;I do not know the answer, so it is a genuine
question&#151;that those problems could be addressed by the change
suggested in the new clause.</div>
<a name="0806206000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the
convenience of the Committee, I should outline how the system works
now. It is not something that everybody appreciates, but when an
employee gets their pay slip at the end of the month and it shows the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column918" />Column number: 918</div>amount of pay they have received, the amount of tax deducted and the
amount of national insurance deducted, that information is not
communicated immediately by the employer to HMRC. All the employer has
to do on the appropriate date&#151;which is, I think, the 19th of the
following month&#151;is account to HMRC for the total amount of tax
and national insurance deducted. Not until the following July, the end
of the tax year, will the employer account to HMRC on an
employee-by-employee basis for the individual amounts of tax and
national insurance deducted during the course of the year.
<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> There seems to be another Member on his feet in
the Committee
Room.</div><a name="0806206000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806206000178"></a>The
Chairman:</b>
Order.</div><a name="0806206000023"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806206000179"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I cannot tell you, Sir Nicholas, how many
conversations I have had over the last few years, with Members of
Parliament in particular, but also with others who have not appreciated
that the situation is as I have just described. Whether it is about tax
credits or personal accounts, there is an understandable assumption
that when national insurance and tax are deducted, and the employee
receives a notification of that deduction, that information is
immediately available to HMRC. I have heard all sorts of suggestions
for improving the tax credit system, and indeed for improving the
operation of personal accounts, another area which would be affected by
this proposal. There is a real issue of understanding here, and I want
to focus on the way in which the tax credit system has been working, or
perhaps one should say not working.</div>
<a name="0806206000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">Last month,
HMRC released figures revealing that a further &#163;1 billion in tax
credits was overpaid in 2006-07, and &#163;500,000 was underpaid. To
be fair to the Treasury, this is not just because of incompetence or
error. It is because the Treasury, through HMRC, has no way of knowing
when people&#146;s earnings and circumstances have changed unless the
individuals concerned contact the authorities and make them aware of
those changes. Since 2003-04, &#163;6.7 billion has been overpaid.
Households are disrupted and sometimes put in dreadful situations,
particularly by the overpayments, which in many circumstances are then
reclaimed by HMRC and have to be repaid, so that by definition people
who may be under some income pressure are being asked to repay sums of
money.</div>
<a name="0806206000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">To put these
large sums of money into context, in terms of individual awards, last
year, 1.3 million awards were overpaid, and 838,000 awards were
underpaid out of a total of 6.5 million awards made. That means that a
third of all awards were wrong. The reported overpayments for last year
occurred even after the Government made changes to the system in 2006
in response to previous, even larger, overpayments.</div>
<a name="0806206000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Instead of
fixing the underlying problem, the Government increased to
&#163;25,000 the annual income increase that could be disregarded.
That has had the extraordinary effect that it is possible&#151;though
I admit it would be unusual&#151;for someone earning &#163;93,000
to be in receipt of tax credits for at least part of the year. That
person would have had a base income of &#163;68,000, which is at the
very top end of the range for tax credit taper and then, receiving a
&#163;25,000 per annum in-year increase, they would continue to
receive tax credits, although their income at an annualised rate would
be &#163;93,000.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column919" />Column number: 919</div><a name="0806206000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Treasury
has announced a review of the scheme, so it is probably timely to
consider if changes to the PAYE system are possible and affordable,
both in terms of the impact on costs of operating HMRC and, of course,
in terms of costs to business.</div>
<a name="0806206000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we were in
an environment in which most businesses produced their payrolls
manually and had to forward them manually to HMRC, I would not be
pursuing the question implicit in the new clause, because the answer
would be obvious; the new measure would impose a significant additional
burden on business. However, we are in an environment these days in
which most businesses, probably all businesses&#151;that would be one
of the issues that we would hope to discover from a report laid by the
Treasury under the terms of the new clause&#151;including even quite
small ones and perhaps even the smallest, process their payroll on a
simple computer programme. I would be surprised if there were very many
businesses running manual payrolls, because they are quite complicated
and time-consuming to
operate.</div><a name="0806206000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
thought behind the new clause is that, if most payrolls are now being
operated on computer software packages, would it really be a major
additional imposition on businesses to return that payroll data
electronically to HMRC on a monthly basis rather than on an annual,
in-arrears basis? Perhaps that is something that the Government have
already looked at.</div>
<a name="0806206000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">What would be
involved in gearing up HMRC to receive electronically monthly data on
PAYE deductions that had been made? What would be the potential for
using that data so that we have something much closer to a real-time
response to the changing income patterns of individuals in the way that
we operate things such as the tax credit system, so that HMRC, in
dealing with tax credit awards, has income data lagging only by one
month rather than income data lagging by as much as 15 months? The
Minister may wish to confirm this, but I think that that long time lag
is the essential underlying problem with the way that the tax credit
system operates. It is dependent on individuals notifying the tax
authorities, rather than being dependent on payroll deduction data that
are
reported.</div><a name="0806206000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed,
many individuals ask&#151;you will have dealt with such questions
from your constituents, Sir Nicholas, and I certainly
have&#151;&#147;Why are they asking me these things? They already
know&#148;. They assume that the data on their weekly or monthly
payslip are already available to the authorities, and they expect that
the authorities will have acted accordingly.</div>
<a name="0806206000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Then there is
the issue of personal accounts. The operation of the personal accounts
pension system, which will be introduced by the Government in 2012, has
been dictated, in significant part, by the constraints imposed by the
architecture of the PAYE system. It would only be possible if
contributions were collected through payroll to attribute them to
individual employees with a lag of as much as 15 months from the date
of monthly collection. That would probably give rise to some
insurmountable issues. However, if monthly PAYE deduction data were
available, it would be possible to attribute personal accounts
contributions collected through the PAYE system to individuals&#146;
personal accounts on a monthly basis, making the system much simpler.
As a result, the system would probably have a higher take-up rate and
it would be simpler to run for both employers and whoever was operating
the personal accounts system.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column920" />Column number: 920</div><a name="0806206000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">That seems to
be a pretty big win. I suspect that many other areas of policy could be
revisited if we had monthly income data. Given the priority that the
Government have attached to dealing with poverty, particularly child
poverty, I suggest to the Financial Secretary that having that data
available on something approximating a real-time basis could make a
significant new policy tool available to the Government.</div>
<a name="0806206000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause
is deliberately phrased in interrogative terms asking the Treasury to
commission a report and lay it before Parliament, because we do not
want to propose such a measure if it would impose significant burdens
that were not justified by the benefits. I will be interested to hear
whether any of that work has already been done in the Treasury, whether
some of my questions are answerable and whether the Minister will
choose to answer them. Has that area not yet been looked at, perhaps
because it is considered too
complex?</div><a name="0806206000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
ask the Minister to consider this proposal as a genuine contribution to
the debate on how we tackle targeting to deal with issues of poverty.
While we only know what people in work have earned a year or so after
they have earned it, we will always have the kind of problems that have
become apparent in the operation of the tax credit system when we try
to target financial support.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806206000184"></a>The
Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Kitty Ussher):</b> Picking
up from where we left off, I would like to place on record my thanks to
the hon. Gentleman who speaks for the Opposition for the thoughtful way
in which he outlined the issues. However, I urge hon. Members to resist
the new clause for a simple reason. I do not know whether the hon.
Gentleman is aware of this, but today HMRC published two papers and a
consultation document that will spawn an official consultation process
with the Government&#151;meetings, workshops and so on&#151;to look
at a number of issues in that area. That is the right way to make good
policy, rather than the independent report that is proposed, and I
encourage all hon. Members to resist the new
clause.</div>
<a name="0806206000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806206000185"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I know that conspiracy theories abound in the
Treasury. There are two possibilities&#151;either people have looked
at my new clause and decided to try to trump it, or we have a mole
buried deep in the network of HMRC. Which does the Economic Secretary
find more credible?</div>
<a name="0806206000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806206000186"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> On a point of order, I did not give way to the
hon. Gentleman, I sat down because I had finished. I presume that those
were his closing remarks.</div>
<a name="0806206000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806206000187"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> In that case, I am grateful to the Economic
Secretary for her words. I must be honest&#151;I have not seen the
publication of those documents today, for reasons that will become
apparent. One or two people will be getting a call from me in the
morning to find out why I have not seen them. I am intrigued and
perhaps it would be helpful if we had been given a little more
information. From what she said, I take it that the papers published
today cover precisely the area that is the subject of the new clause.
If that is the case, I am pleased to see that the Government are
thinking along the same lines as us&#151;we know that that happens
from time to time in the Treasury. I hope that she is doing it for the
reasons that I outlined, and as an attempt to explore the possibility
of creating a valuable new policy tool, which could be used in a much
more flexible way than the PAYE system currently allows.</div>
<a name="0806206000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Had I known
before, perhaps through an intervention, I might have curtailed my

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806206000190"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b><b class="B"> </b>Briefly, the new clause inserts into the
Finance Act 2004 the possibility for people to set up a retirement
income fund. New clause 20 covers the possibility of setting up a
dependant&#146;s retirement income fund. My right hon. and learned
Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind) took
the opportunity of a private Member&#146;s Bill earlier this Session
to float these issues. It is a concept that is available in Canada,
where it works very effectively. The issue the two new clauses are
trying to address is the ongoing debate about the appropriate use of
pension funds on retirement. Someone who retires with a defined
contribution scheme can defer buying an annuity until the age of 75 and
draw down income from that pension fund to that point.</div>
<a name="0806206000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the Finance
Act 2004 the Government saw fit to introduce the concept of
alternatively secured pensions, mainly to address the theological
objections of the Christian Brethren to annuities. Although that
measure was aimed at their particular needs, it had broad appeal to a
large number of people who felt that they wanted the choice as to what
to do with their fund at the age of 75. The debate has continued. The
issue was addressed on Report during the passage of the Finance Bill
last year and the House of Lords also considered it in some detail. My
sense is that there is growing consensus around providing more choice
for people retiring with a defined contribution scheme.</div>
<a name="0806206000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Baroness
Hollis, a former Minister in the Department for Work and Pensions,
argued in favour of relaxing the rules around compulsory annuitisation.
The only people who seem to be outside this debate are the Treasury.
There is a lot of support for the end of compulsory annuitisation, but
to get to that point some technical issues need to be addressed. The
debate is becoming more pressing. Lord Turner, who has chaired the
Government&#146;s Pension Commission and is now the chairman
designate of the Financial Services Authority, highlighted the need to
reduce some of the pressures on the annuity market in his report on
pensions. He suggested that the end to compulsory annuitisation might
be a way of reducing that pressure.</div>
<a name="0806206000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the pension
landscape changes, more and more people are retiring with a defined
contribution scheme. They then have to make some choices about where
they invest that fund. The more funds there are in defined contribution
schemes, the more demand there is for annuities. We need to find ways
to address the impact that that will have on the price of annuities and
the returns that they offer in the market. If we are to allow people to
opt out of compulsory annuitisation at 75 we need to ensure that they
do not squander their pension pot, spend it and then become dependent
on the state for the rest of their income in retirement. There have
been various ways of trying to deal with that.</div>
<a name="0806206000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The retirement
income fund is one way of tackling that issue. In effect it sets a
minimum income that people have to enjoy from a retirement income fund
so that the state knows that they are taking responsibility for their
own income and to ensure that they do not fall back on means-tested
benefits. New clauses 19 and 20 try to address
that&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>I am sure that this is more gripping
than the football result, although I am not entirely convinced given
the reaction of Labour Members to that information.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column924" />Column number: 924</div><a name="0806206000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the new
clause, the minimum retirement income level would be set by the
Chancellor of the Exchequer annually, by order. Having a Government-set
de minimis limit is the right way to proceed. The concept of
annuitisation would not be totally abandoned because people would need
to buy annuities that are linked to the retail prices index and that
would pay an income equivalent to the minimum income requirement.
Annuities would not be dead under the measure; they would still be
needed to provide the minimum income level, which would be set by the
Chancellor. That would partly relieve the burden on the annuities
market.</div><a name="0806206000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
has been some debate about whether the returns that could be earned
from such a system would be sufficient, and whether people would be
sacrificing some return by opting for what is seen as a potentially
more volatile set of assets, moving away from annuities to investment
in mutual funds, stocks and shares. The Investment Management
Association has made a significant contribution to the debate with some
research that it published earlier this year, which indicated that the
return from investing in securities and mutual funds could generate an
income in excess of that provided by a conventional annuity. There is
some merit, in terms of providing income for pensioners, in going down
that route and enabling them to have choice in retirement about where
they invest income and how they buy an income source for retirement.
The IMA&#146;s work has helped to give more weight to the argument
against compulsory annuitisation.</div>
<a name="0806206000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
always use the same argument on the issue. It was used in our earlier
debates on the pensions clauses and was used frequently by the previous
Economic Secretary, now the Secretary of State for Children, Schools
and Families. However, it was not a concern for his predecessor, the
current Secretary of State for Transport, who introduced the
alternatively secured pension scheme in the Finance Act 2005. The
concern is that people will use tax-incentivised savings as a vehicle
to provide inheritance for their
children.</div><a name="0806206000060"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806206000191"></a><b class="B">Emily

sympathy, with my hon. Friend. We are all making sacrifices to serve on
the Committee this evening.</div>
<a name="0806206000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps the
hon. Lady&#146;s son will be able to participate in future debates
about the impact of high and punitive taxation on people&#146;s
choices in retirement. I was getting to that point before she
intervened.</div>
<a name="0806206000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
punitive tax charge on people who opt out of buying
annuitisation&#151;it works out at about 82 per cent.&#151;which
acts as a disincentive for people to go down the route of alternatives
to annuities. Although I understand the Government&#146;s position on
the matter, there may be better ways of dealing with people&#146;s
opting out of buying annuitisation than simply penalising them. I do
not think that the Government&#146;s measure goes with the grain of
how people want to run their lives. People want more choice. Indeed,
they are being forced to take on board more choice by the move away
from defined benefit schemes and defined contribution schemes. It is
time that the options for people in retirement reflected the fact that
people want control and want to maximise their income in a way that
meets their needs and ensures that those things are balanced, at the
same time, with the obligations towards the Exchequer and that, in
making their own choices about retirement, people do not end up
becoming dependent on the
state.</div><a name="0806206000172"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">8.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806206000197"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I urge the Committee to resist the new clauses and
I shall explain why. This is an important subject and it is important
to debate it. However, the proposed new clauses will mean, as the hon.
Gentleman said, that any funds beyond those used to provide a minimum
retirement income via an annuity could be placed in a so-called
retirement income fund and taken out as required. We urge Committee
members to resist the proposed new clauses because they are unfair and
would mean that, by the time someone retired, due to the effect of the
favourable tax treatment, a significant proportion of their pension
fund would comprise tax relief: some &#163;17.5 billion, nationally,
in 2007-08. To allow better-off pensioners to take advantage of that by
spending that relief at will when others do not do so because they
cannot afford it, is simply not fair. To do so would be to take money
from the normal taxpayer to benefit the richest. That is why we do not
support
it.</div><a name="0806206000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
specific issues could also arise. For example, such a measure could
encourage tax avoidance, because somebody could become non-resident
just before they were 75, withdraw all the fund at 75, free of UK tax,
and return in the next year, which would lead to a cost for the
Exchequer and, potentially, boost inheritances in a way that is also
unfair. We urge all Committee members to oppose
it.</div><a name="0806206000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806206000198"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Minister&#146;s arguments have not advanced
the debate very far. The Treasury has deployed this line on a number of
occasions, but it does not recognise how some of the issues can be
dealt with. For example, it is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column926" />Column number: 926</div>possible to levy an additional tax charge on inheritance that removes
that element of the savings that is generated by tax revenue. It is
estimated that about 55 per cent. of the unutilised fund on death is
down to tax benefits. So there is a way of trying to square that circle
by applying a higher tax
rate.</div><a name="0806206000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government fail to recognise that, although at the moment only a
certain small group of people may benefit from this proposed measure,
the reality is that ever more people will go down the route of being
part of defined contribution schemes. Of course, in 2012 the personal
account, which is a defined contribution scheme, will come into place
and the defined benefits schemes will be closing down. More and more
people, even those on relatively modest incomes, who have saved under
defined contribution schemes throughout their lives, will find that
they have built up a pension pot on retirement that could benefit them
if they opted out of compulsory
annuitisation.</div><a name="0806206000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government are digging their heels in, but the tide is moving against
them on this policy and it is time that they started taking these
challenges seriously. I urge Treasury Ministers to listen to the logic
of the arguments. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
motion.</div><a name="0806206000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Motion

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806206000199"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div>
<a name="0806206000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 21
relates to missing trader intra-community fraud, an important matter
that we have considered in the past two finance Bills. The most common
or notable form of MTIC fraud is carousel fraud, which is, to use the
Treasury&#146;s words,</div>
<a name="0806206000166"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a circular
trading pattern that allows the same goods to be imported or exported
many times, with an unpaid VAT liability and a corresponding VAT
repayment being created in each turn of the
carousel&#148;.</div><a name="0806206000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">MTIC
fraud is significant fraud that has cost the Exchequer several billion
pounds a year&#151;last year, HMRC assessed the figure at &#163;2
billion to &#163;3 billion a year&#151;in recent years. Admittedly,
there has been a change in methodology for calculating that
figure&#151;it was somewhat higher, at about &#163;4 billion to
&#163;5 billion. Such is the significance of the fraud that the
Office for National Statistics believe that it distorts our trade
figures.</div>
<a name="0806206000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a hugely
important matter that has been the focus of attention from the Treasury
and HMRC, and I am sure that all Committee members recognise that it is
necessary to address it seriously. There is evidence, which I suspect
we will hear in a moment, of significant improvements in tackling MTIC
fraud. The new clause gives me the opportunity to ask for further
details about those improvements. We saw signs of them last year during
a debate on a similar new clause, when the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column927" />Column number: 927</div>Government showed signs of improvement in 2006-07. I should be grateful
for confirmation of the numbers, and for some assessment of what has
happened in 2007-08.</div>
<a name="0806206000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">One reason for
the improvement is the reverse charge, which we discussed at some
length during the debate on the Finance Act 2006. Essentially, the
direction in which VAT was paid was reversed to counter
fraudsters&#146; efforts. The revisions that we debated in 2006 could
come into effect only after certain derogations had been obtained from
the European Union. In the interests of time, I will not go into an
exposition of how lengthy and difficult a process that was, but it took
many months for the Government&#146;s proposals to be negotiated and
agreed. Negotiating difficulties arose, and it is widely believed that
the French used the UK&#146;s request as a rather strong bargaining
tool in other matters.</div>
<a name="0806206000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Three points
are worth noting from the negotiations. Amendments and concessions had
to be made to the Government&#146;s original plans. The reverse
charge was narrowly applied to mobile phones and computer chips. The
reason for choosing those particular goods is that they are the goods
most commonly used for MTIC fraud. However, fraudsters are cunning
people, and there is a widely recognised danger that the fraud can
mutate to other products. Is there any evidence that MTIC fraud has
mutated into other products, as per the concerns that were expressed
last year?</div>
<a name="0806206000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
concession was that the de minimis amount for which the reverse charge
could apply was increased from &#163;1,000 to &#163;5,000. That is
likely not to be too significant, but the third aspect is more
significant. The original request for a derogation made by the
Government was for three years, and instead we got two years. That
means that the issue is up for renewal relatively soon. Given the
difficulties in negotiating the original derogation, which I mentioned,
it would be helpful to have some indication of what progress is being
made.</div><a name="0806206000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
raise those points because this is an important matter and it is
important that Parliament has an opportunity to scrutinise and to gain
an understanding of what is happening. That is why we tabled new clause
21, which would require the Government to lay a quarterly report before
Parliament outlining the measures that have been taken to combat MTIC
fraud and the effect that those measures are having on VAT compliance
systems

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806206000200"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> Is my hon. Friend aware of the problem that has
befallen many new but legitimate businesses that happen to operate in
that area? The additional checks that HMRC is carrying out have led to
long delays in registration for companies operating in those types of
businesses.</div>
<a name="0806206000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806206000201"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I was going to touch briefly on VAT registrations,
but I first wish to complete my remarks on VAT repayments. The
Government presented a lot of evidence last year to suggest that the
extended verification procedures were extremely well targeted, and that
something like 95 per cent. of the parties involved in cases of
extended verification were somewhere in a chain&#151;perhaps they
were not directly involved&#151;in which MTIC fraud occurred. I would
be grateful for an assessment of whether the extended verification
process is as effective and as well targeted as the Government claimed
last year. Do they still hold that view after a further year&#146;s
experience?</div><a name="0806206000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend raised the important point of delays in VAT registration. I
am sure that the Minister will say, and we should acknowledge, that
there have been substantial improvements in registration times. I do
not think that anyone would disagree that they were frankly abysmal a
year or so ago. They have improved significantly, although it is worth
pointing out that the HMRC targets and figures that we see on the
matter relate to what are described as low-risk cases. There are still
high-risk cases. Any light the Minister is able to shed on what is
happening with the high-risk cases and the time it is taking to process
them would be greatly appreciated. We would also appreciate further
information on whether they are
targeted.</div><a name="0806206000173"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">8.30
pm</div><a name="0806206000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the course of my remarks, I have asked many of the questions to which I
would hope answers can be provided to Parliament on a regular basis.
That is the purpose of new clause 21, which deals with a matter of
considerable public concern to those who are interested in the public
finances and the fact that a substantial fraud needs to be tackled.
Equally, it is of concern to new businesses seeking to obtain VAT
registration and to existing businesses seeking to receive VAT
repayments. The matter has placed HMRC under considerable
strain.</div><a name="0806206000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the light of all those issues, we think it would be beneficial if
Parliament was provided with a quarterly report so that it is better
informed about the matter. In essence, the issue is not controversial.
I believe both sides of the Committee want to address it but not to
leave innocent businesses in an unfair and unfortunate position. We
think that we would be in a stronger position to address those concerns
if more information were made available to Parliament so that we can
have a better informed
debate.</div><a name="0806206000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806206000202"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> Annual estimates of MTIC fraud are published with
other indirect tax fraud estimates alongside the Chancellor&#146;s
pre-Budget report, and they show, as the hon. Gentleman mentioned, that
the level of attempted fraud reduced by around &#163;1.5 billion in
2006-07 on the previous year. The UK is the only EU country to produce
such annual estimates of this
fraud.</div><a name="0806206000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure the Committee will appreciate that exposing more information
more systematically and frequently about the operation of HMRC&#146;s
strategy to combat the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column929" />Column number: 929</div>fraud, as suggested by the new clause, could undermine the strategy by
giving information to fraudsters. I would love to engage with the hon.
Member for South-West Hertfordshire in further detail on the matter,
but now is neither the time nor the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806206000203"></a>Mr.

looking for 2007-08, but we are not going to get them, at least not
this
evening.</div><a name="0806206000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
I am not persuaded by the Minister&#146;s short rebuttal, I do not

aid averaging scheme</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;The
Treasury shall, before the publication of the 2008 Pre-Budget report,
prepare and lay before the House of Commons a feasibility study,
including an assessment of the cost and revenue implications, of
implementing a system of automatic refund of tax credits in respect of
gift aid contributions using an averaging
process.&#146;.&#151;<i class="I">[Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806206000204"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="0806206000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is an important new clause, and there is much that I could say about
it. However, in view of the Committee&#146;s evident desire to
progress, I shall try to be
brief.</div><a name="0806206000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have undertaken a consultation about the gift aid scheme. We
believe that the scheme is important. It encourages charitable giving,
and at a time when charities and voluntary sector organisations are
playing an increasing role in delivering public services and acting as
contractors to public bodies, it is important that they retain their
independence. Independence, of course, comes from having an independent
financial base. A substantial donor base for any charity means that it
can enter into publicly funded contracts without compromising its
independence and essential
ethos.</div><a name="0806206000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
argue that the gift aid system is in need of simplification to ease the
administrative burden on charities, but the link between tax relief and
donations is important to preserve the principle that charitable
donations should be made out of gross
income.</div><a name="0806206000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the new clause is to probe the Government&#146;s thinking
on the issue and to find out what assessment they have made of the
validity of the approach it suggests, which is an automatic refund of
tax credits in respect of gift aid contributions using an averaging
process. At present, every time a gift aid contribution is made, the
taxpayer has to complete a form. Those forms have to be processed, the
charity in question has to preserve the documents for a significant
period and there is a considerable burden of administration, both for
the charities in question and for HMRC.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column930" />Column number: 930</div><a name="0806206000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
consultation that I referred to earlier did not lead to any substantive
changes. It was sparked by the proposals in the 2007 Budget to reduce
the basic rate of income tax&#151;the other side of the coin to the
now infamous abolition of the 10p rate. Although a reduction of the
basic rate of income tax is welcomed by taxpayers, it also means that
charities receiving gift aid donations receive somewhat less in tax
credit for each &#163;1 of donation that they
take.</div>
<a name="0806206000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the then
Chancellor announced the consultation on the gift aid scheme, charities
had quite high hopes and they put forward a number of proposals, which
I shall not go into in detail because of the time. One of the proposals
that had wide support from the charitable sector was a revenue-neutral
averaging scheme. It would mean that instead of keeping individual
records for taxpayers who made charitable donations, charities would
receive from HMRC a tax credit based on an averaging of the tax credit
due, recognising that part of the donor base are taxpayers at the
standard or higher rate, part may be UK resident and domiciled
non-taxpayers who are on incomes that are too low, although it is
unlikely that they would be a significant component, and part may be
high earners who for one reason or another are not paying UK income
tax.</div>
<a name="0806206000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">I emphasise
the fact that the proposal was that the credit rate should be set at a
level that was revenue neutral. It was not an attempt to increase the
net income of the charitable sector or to deprive HMRC of any of its
tax revenue, but an attempt to create a win-win situation where less of
that valuable money is lost in administration costs. The charitable
sector was rather disappointed with the Government&#146;s response,
which was to announce a welcome but temporary transitional arrangement
to recognise the burden on charities of the reduction in the basic rate
of income tax, but with no guarantee that it would be
extended.</div>
<a name="0806206000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause
asks the Government to produce a report on the feasibility and the
costs and benefits of implementing such an automatic rebate-averaged
system. The purpose of tabling it is to probe the Government, to try to
understand whether they have any intention of going further with the
suggestions that were put to them during the consultation, and whether
the charitable sector might hope that over the next year or so the
Government will come forward with further thinking in this area. It is
with some consideration that I say over the next year or so, because it
is certainly an area that we, in government, would want to look at. I
do not expect the Financial Secretary to make a commitment today
because many issues would have to be considered, but we would be
interested to hear whether she at least accepts that the principle is
worthy of further investigation and whether she intends to undertake
such an investigation.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806206000205"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I welcome the fact that the hon. Gentleman has
tabled a probing new clause in such an important area. He is right that
we issued a consultation response in March this year containing several
proposals to make things easier and raise awareness of the gift aid
scheme, which has been welcomed thoroughly by the charitable sector. We
also say in the document that there are complex issues around the way
in which the gift aid system works. A number of points have been made
about how the mechanics of the system could be altered to make it
easier for some donors to give, and we continue to research the
issue.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column931" />Column number: 931</div><a name="0806206000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have worries
about the new clause because a specific solution would raise some
concerns among the charitable sector. By ending the tax relief system,
it could make charity income streams more dependent on Government
spending, which may raise concerns. More work needs to be done on the
whole matter of donor behaviour. We would not want to signal that we
were necessarily considering one particular solution without
understanding fully the effect of that signal on the market, so we
resist the new clause because it would be doing precisely that. It
would signal specifically a particular avenue that we wanted to travel
down, while we are still at the stage of undertaking broader
research.</div><a name="0806206000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806206000206"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for at least
confirming that the Government are doing more work in such areas. She
expressed concern that such a measure might increase the charitable
sector&#146;s dependence on Government income. I stressed in my
remarks that that is not our purpose. We see it the other way: we have
to reinforce the donor base to allow charities to feel confident that
they can tender for Government contracts and deliver public services to
Government bodies, without compromising their independence and their
essential ethos. I know, as she will from talking to charities, that
one of their worries is that if they take the Government
shilling&#151;although it is welcome at the time and allows them to
participate in new areas&#151;they run the risk of sacrificing some
independence. It is precisely to avoid that situation that we want to
explore possibilities in the area. However, I am happy that the hon.
Lady has said that she is open to the idea, among others, and will
undertake further research into the matter. I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806206000207"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I am happy to call Colin Breed, who has been
very
patient.</div><a name="0806206000112"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806206000208"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Colin Breed</b> (South-East Cornwall) (LD): I beg to move,
That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="0806206000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the new clause is to prompt an annual review of the mileage
allowance, the rates for which are contained in the Income Tax
(Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003. I suppose that most members of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column932" />Column number: 932</div>the Committee know that the current rates for a car or van are 40p per
mile for the first 10,000 miles and 25p per mile thereafter. Under
section 230(6) of the Act, the Treasury can alter the rates by
regulation, but the 40p rate has been static since
2002-03.</div><a name="0806206000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
background to the debate is a matter that I raised with the Chancellor
personally at a sitting of a recent Treasury Committee and, to some
alarm, I found him reasonably sympathetic. He had actually received a
letter on the same issue from a constituent who had referred to the
effect of increasing fuel prices on the mileage rates for volunteer
drivers. Those who operate within organised volunteer car schemes can
claim mileage allowances that only incur tax if they make a profit
through claiming expenses in the tax year. The HMRC guidance states
that the tax-free mileage allowances are intended to give tax relief
for amounts that represent fair reimbursement for car use. However, it
has become patently obvious that in many parts of the country
volunteers are finding it almost impossible to volunteer their services
and provide car transport, owing to fuel
costs.</div><a name="0806206000174"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">8.45
pm</div><a name="0806206000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
give some idea of the scale, in Cornwall, about 5,000 trips per week
are undertaken by volunteer car drivers using their own cars and
claiming mileage, and about 75 per cent. of rural parishes have no
daily bus service and no community transport scheme. Many people rely
upon non-emergency patient transport services provided by groups, such
as Help the Aged, the Red Cross, St. John Ambulance and Age Concern,
all of which enable people to access important services, such as
hospitals and doctors, and to get into town. The problem before us has
come about very recently owing to increased fuel costs, and many
volunteers are now leaving services, which are finding it almost
impossible to provide the transport for those who require
it.</div><a name="0806206000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
a volunteer receives payment above the 40p and 25p thresholds, their
status changes from volunteer to car hire operator, which makes them
liable for income tax. Furthermore, the AA has indicated that it
believes that it could invalidate motor insurance for voluntary workers
under the Public Passenger Vehicles Act 1981, so even if the rates were
raised in order to keep people volunteering, their insurance could be
invalidated and their status changed.</div>
<a name="0806206000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want
to go through all the fuel figures and everything else&#151;we are
all aware of them&#151;but the main thrust of my argument is quite
clear. The Community Transport Association has called on the Government
to consider fair reimbursement to volunteers in the light of what it
considers to be outdated regulations. In a recent survey, it found that
55 per cent. of organisations attributed the loss of volunteer drivers
to high fuel costs. That is happening now and everyday, and in many
parts of the country volunteer drivers are relied upon more and more.
If we cannot stop them leaving the service and providing essential
transport to places such as hospitals, doctors and clinics, we will
have a major
problem.</div><a name="0806206000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 22 would amend the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003
and has two clear parts: the first explicitly acknowledges the right to
mileage allowances of volunteer drivers. Section 229(2) of the Act
permits mileage allowance payments to be provided to colleagues 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column933" />Column number: 933</div>in reference to business travel, but does not explicitly reference
volunteers, which we think that it should. The statute should protect
their rights to claim those mileage allowances. The second
part&#151;subsection (3)&#151;would require the Government to
undertake a review of the impact of the current 40p and 25p rates on
participation in volunteer transport schemes. We have a crisis, and we
cannot wait much longer. We are losing huge numbers of volunteers all
over the country, and many people are finding it extremely difficult to
access public
services.</div><a name="0806206000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806206000209"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> I was very interested in the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s comments, and we support him, but volunteer drivers
are important in not only rural areas, but urban areas. In modern day
Britain, families are increasingly fragmented, for all sorts of
reasons, and therefore as people grow older they become dependent on
networks of volunteers to enable them to retain their independence. So
we have a great deal of sympathy with his aims, and if he pressed it to
a Division, we would support it. There is no doubt that, in line with
what he has just said, there are some rapidly rising costs of motoring
across the board. We need to take care to ensure that we understand how
that affects these key groups of people, who are perhaps most
susceptible to changing their decisions about whether or not to drive
as a result of increased motoring costs. There could be a much more
disproportionately negative impact on our communities as a whole than
on people&#146;s individual circumstances.</div>
<a name="0806206000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
believe that he mentioned the figures, but the AA&#146;s estimation
of the average cost of motoring per mile is now around 58p. I am sure
he is aware that only several months ago, people could buy a litre of
petrol for mid-80p per litre. The last time I filled my car up on
Sunday, I ended up paying &#163;1.17. There is clearly an issue in
relation to understanding the Treasury&#146;s assessment of how the
rates of mileage allowance impact on people&#146;s behaviour in the
context of rising fuel prices. I fully support what he is trying to
achieve and will wait with interest to hear what the Minister has to
say.</div><a name="0806206000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806206000210"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The new clause would add an additional but
unnecessary statutory definition to the scope of the approved mileage
allowance payments in section 229 of the Income Tax (Earnings and
Pensions) Act 2003. My understanding of the intention behind the clause
is that it is to ensure that people involved in voluntary work that
directly involves the use of their own vehicle are eligible for
reimbursement of their motoring expenses without fear of being subject
to
taxation.</div><a name="0806206000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause would impose an obligation on the Treasury to publish an
annual report assessing the impact of the mileage rates on the numbers
of volunteers participating in community transport schemes. Let me make
it clear that the Government have never wished to intervene in the
reimbursement of such people. Of course, we greatly value the work of
volunteers, but the new clause appears to suggest that the Government
are somehow deficient in their policy on reimbursement payments to
volunteers. Let me clarify the matter: it is right and proper that
those who freely give their time and vehicle over to voluntary work
should be able to reclaim their motoring expenses for the miles used.
For that reason, volunteers are not taxable on amounts they receive if
those amounts just cover their reasonable expenses. They can be
reimbursed for their actual costs 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column934" />Column number: 934</div>of driving with no tax consequences whatsoever&#151;and that is beyond
the level specified by the additional mileage allowance
payments.</div><a name="0806206000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
it can be shown that someone&#146;s expenses go beyond that, there
should be no impact on the level of participation of volunteers in
community transport schemes and no reason to publish a report. The
existing approved mileage allowance payments rates can be used by
voluntary organisations if they estimate their costs to be below the
AMAPs rate. Without the need to put this clause on the statute book,
that is already accepted by HMRC. The new clause would not serve any
useful purpose. For a start, it would be included in the Income Tax
(Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003, which relates solely to employment,
pension and social security income. Including a clause that relates to
the self-employed and volunteers in the Bill would be extremely
odd.</div><a name="0806206000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause is flawed because, as it stands, it would deny both
self-employed people and volunteer drivers the option they currently
have to claim the actual expenses that they incur as an alternative to
using the mileage rates as an approximation. The new clause does not
define the amount of mileage allowances that are approved and would
affect only the first 10,000 business miles. The new clause is silent
on what would happen if miles above 10,000 were used for the purpose of
volunteering.</div><a name="0806206000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman is right to reflect the concern about high fuel prices
and reimbursement, but he perhaps did not consider in his contribution
that volunteers&#151;I will repeat this point again&#151;are
entitled to claim their actual motoring costs, if they so wish. To do
so, volunteers merely have to collect the information about the mileage
they have spent and the costs they have incurred. If they do that, HMRC
will not tax them on reimbursements&#151;as long as they do not make
a profit on the money that they claim back. Once there is a reward of
that sort and it is above the mileage allowance in AMAPs, they would
have to pay income tax on that amount. However, people do have an
option; they can use the AMAPs scheme or they can be reimbursed with no
tax consequences for their actual expenditure. With that explanation, I
hope that the hon. Gentleman will see fit to withdraw the
motion.</div><a name="0806206000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806206000211"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> It seems quite remarkable that we even bother with
a 40p rate if everybody can just claim for whatever they need to be
reimbursed.</div><a name="0806206000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806206000212"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman might probe the
Minister about the detailed record keeping and paperwork that is
involved in a self-assessment income tax return to claim at a rate
higher than that permitted by
HMRC.</div><a name="0806206000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806206000213"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. That was my
second point. I was going to say first that a significant number of
organisations, many of them Government agencies, do not allow their
volunteers to claim more than 40p a mile, whether or not they want to
keep and submit all of the things required in the paperwork. We are
talking about some quite elderly people who are doing this for
retirement jobs. It would be difficult for them to demonstrate to HMRC
that they are being properly reimbursed, even if they could. The vast
majority have no chance to put in a claim that exceeds the permitted
40p. That is why they are leaving.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column935" />Column number: 935</div><a name="0806206000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Government are perfectly content with their current guidance and think
that everything is okay, they will have one hell of a fight on their
hands once again. If they ignore this and volunteers disappear out of
the door, leaving people in their homes because they cannot get to
hospitals and clinics, it will be the fault not of the volunteers, the
health centres or the hospitals, but of the Government because they can
see precisely where the responsibility lies. If the Government are
happy not to change this by the time we get to Report stage, they will
have only themselves to
blame.</div><a name="0806206000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am happy to use this as a probing motion and to withdraw it, but I hope
that the Government recognise my point. I felt that the Chancellor
responded more positively in the Treasury Committee than the Exchequer
Secretary has today. I think that the Government should look at this
issue again very quickly. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
motion.</div><a name="0806206000131"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Motion

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806206000214"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="0806206000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause is fairly simple. It should be possible to sort out the
provision within days. Quite remarkably, the Exchequer Secretary
responded almost precisely to what I sought with the new clause in a
written answer to a question from the hon. Member for Gravesham
(Mr. Holloway)
yesterday.</div><a name="0806206000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the new clause was to sort out once and for all the
assessment of taxation on bingo. On one hand, we are told by the Bingo
Association and others that unlike casinos and betting shops, bingo is
the victim of double taxation, with VAT payable at 17.5 per cent. and a
gross profits tax at 15 per cent. We are told that that is
significantly affecting businesses; clubs are closing, profits are
going down and even the tax take for the Government is going
down.</div><a name="0806206000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the other hand, the Exchequer Secretary wrote
yesterday:</div><a name="0806206000168"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government&#146;s assessment that tax is not at the root of the bingo
industry&#146;s problems is based on evidence from a number of
sources, including data on the number of bingo clubs and on bingo
stakes, commercial sector reports on the bingo industry, and
representations from the bingo industry. The assessment noted the need
for the bingo industry to adapt to the smoke free legislation and the
impact of the implementation of the Gambling Act 2005. It concluded
that the industry&#146;s problems are a product of a combination of
factors including greater competition in the leisure sector and
changing tastes in leisure activities.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official

that we now seek through the new clause is for the Government to
produce that evidence in a full report so that we can all analyse the
various representations and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column936" />Column number: 936</div>judge for ourselves whether the Government&#146;s assessment is
correct. The new clause would require the Treasury to produce a report
before the next pre-Budget report. Given that the assessment has
already been made, presumably it will be able to produce the report
sooner. I will be very pleased to see
it.</div><a name="0806206000175"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806206000215"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> We have a lot of sympathy for new clause 23 and
share the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concerns about the impact of this
double taxation issue on bingo halls up and down the country. A
well-known report has pointed out that around 180 bingo halls might be
at risk as a result of a variety of economic pressures. If my memory
serves me correctly, about 108 of them have unfortunately already gone
out of business, so that is a real issue that needs to be understood
properly, and that is precisely what the new clause is trying to
achieve.</div>
<a name="0806206000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The bingo
industry has faced a number of changes in recent years, not least the
smoking ban, the implications of the Gambling Act 2005 and the rise of
internet gambling, all of which have had a dramatic impact on the
clientele and the business and competitive environment in which bingo
halls now operate. Despite that, we should not underestimate the fact
that the industry still provides thousands of jobs across the country
and millions of pounds in tax revenue. The new clause is needed to
understand the impact of those changing circumstances, taxation and the
economic environment in the industry on the future prosperity of bingo
clubs.</div>
<a name="0806206000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although we
are talking about businesses, those of us who have bingo clubs in our
constituencies know that they are more than just businesses. In many
cases they are community centres. The hon. Gentleman did not mention
the second aspect of his new clause, which referred to the level of
social access to individuals aged over 65. The bingo halls that I have
come across in my part of London provide amazing social access for all
the community and I think there is nothing sadder than seeing a bingo
hall shut down. In the interests of time, I will end my comments there.
Suffice it to say, Sir. Nicholas, it has been a pleasure to serve under
your chairmanship.</div>
<a name="0806206000141"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0806206000216"></a><b class="B">Stephen
Pound</b> (Ealing, North) (Lab):

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806206000217"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North shouted
&#147;House.&#148; I was thinking that there is an empty House, but
a full
Committee.</div><a name="0806206000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
hon. Members have noticed, we have made no change to the taxation of
bingo in the Budget. We looked carefully at the evidence that the Bingo
Association provided on the state of the industry, including the data
relating to revenues and club closures as the industry adapts to
current challenges. Our assessment remains that tax is not at the root
of the bingo industry&#146;s problems, and we do not believe that
there is a tax solution. Bingo benefited from a generous reduction in
its effective tax rate in 2003. The average effect of the tax rate on
bingo, which is measured using the combined impact of VAT and duty on a
comparable basis, is in line with that on casinos, gaming machines and
the lottery. We agree that the bingo industry needs to adjust to the
smoke-free legislation, which to its great credit it supports, but we
do not think that a tax cut is the way to do it.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column937" />Column number: 937</div><a name="0806206000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The bingo
industry&#146;s problems are the product of a combination of factors,
including greater competition in the leisure sector and changing tastes
in leisure activities. The Gambling Act introduced measures that have
benefited the industry. The membership requirement and the 24-hour rule
for the period between joining and playing have been removed, clubs are
no longer required to return all stakes as prizes in the same game and
roll-overs are now allowed, creating the potential for much higher
prizes. Removing VAT from bingo participation fees would not be revenue
neutral, as the industry suggests, and would in fact cost tens of
millions of pounds. Our estimate is made in line with the general
approach to all costings outlined in the Budget book and looks at not
only the amount of tax paid by the industry, but the overall impact on
Exchequer revenues.</div>
<a name="0806206000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause
would require the Government to produce a report of our tax policy on
the bingo industry. As with all tax policy decisions, we will monitor
the full impact of the tax regime and continue to engage with the
industry as it adapts to the changes it faces. To that extent, the new
clause is superfluous. Our evidence was released on 28 May to the Bingo
Association at its request, so it is out there for the hon. Member for
South-East Cornwall to look
at.</div><a name="0806206000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806206000218"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> I thank the Exchequer Secretary for that response.
I have not seen the report, so I may not agree with the assessment, but
if she confirms that the report that has been released to the Bingo
Association is the one on which her assessment and that of her
Department has been made, we can get that report and will not need to
resort to freedom of information measures and suchlike. On that basis
there would be no need for the new clause, so I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
motion.</div><a name="0806206000147"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Motion

section 74 of the Finance Act 2003), as amended, to the
House.</div><a name="0806206000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806206000219"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> On a point of order, Sir Nicholas. Before we come
to the end of our consideration of the Bill, I put on record my thanks
to you, and your co-Chairmen, Mr. Cook and Mr.
Hood, for your assistance during these seven weeks. You have guided us
through some complicated debates, and your leadership has shed more
light than some light fittings have on certain occasions. I also thank
the Clerks, the <i class="I">Hansard</i> Reporters, the Doorkeepers and the
police officers for their assistance in ensuring that the business of
the Committee ran smoothly, not least when there was a sudden illness.
I also thank Revenue and Customs and the Treasury, and the
representative bodies that have worked with us during the Bill&#146;s
passage. Their assistance has been helpful. I offer my thanks to the
officials in the Treasury, Revenue and Customs and other Departments
who have helped us so much. I also thank parliamentary counsel, who
constantly work hard behind the scenes and without their essential work
we would not make such progress.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column938" />Column number: 938</div><a name="0806206000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank
Opposition Members for their contribution to the debate and for their
hard work in ensuring that the Bill received an excellent level of
scrutiny, up until this afternoon. I express my thanks to my stoic
friends on the Back Benches who have offered sterling support to my
hon. Friends on the Front Bench. I particularly thank my friends, the
Economic Secretary and the Exchequer Secretary, and my hon. Friend the
Member for Waveney for his assistance working through the usual
channels.</div><a name="0806206000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
look forward to further deliberations on another occasion. Of course,
the Bill does not now go to the Lords, but it has already had scrutiny.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> Indeed, Middlesex and Sussex will
be at Lord&#146;s this evening. They may have already pulled up
stumps, and I hope that we will do the
same.</div>
<a name="0806206000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806206000220"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> Further to that point of order, Sir Nicholas. I
add my thanks on behalf of the Opposition to you and your fellow
Chairmen for your excellent and diligent chairmanship. The right hon.
lady talked about the stoicism of members of the Committee. Speaking as
someone with the campaign medal from the Standing Committee on the
National Minimum Wage Bill, sitting until 9 o&#146;clock does not fit
into the category of stoicism by the standards of that great marathon.
I understand that Government Members feel frustration at the need
occasionally to prolong consideration of Government measures, but I ask
them to remember that Members of the Opposition, too, feel frustration
on the many occasions when consideration of important matters is
timetabled. The Finance Bill is one of the rare occasions when
timetabling is not imposed. At one time or another, frustration is
shared in equal measure on both sides of the Committee.</div>
<a name="0806206000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also offer
my thanks to the Clerks, in particular. Opposition Members, who do not
benefit from the official support that Ministers receive, are
particularly dependant on the advice from the Public Bill Office and
the Table Office, and we are grateful for that advice. I also thank the
<i class="I">Hansard</i><i class="I"> </i>writers, the police and the Doorkeepers. I join
the Minister in thanking the representative bodies. We have tried to
represent their concerns, and if Ministers have not picked them up, we
have tried to do so during the Committee&#146;s
proceedings.</div><a name="0806206000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
I thank the Financial Secretary, the Economic Secretary and the
Exchequer Secretary for their hard work in Committee and for their
generally good-natured responses to our many inquiries, some of which
were designed to try to develop a better understanding of what the
Government are about and where they are going. It would be fair to
say&#151;you and I had a conversation about it during the break, Sir
Nicholas&#151;that all of them have impressed us with their grasp of
the detail of their brief and with their readiness to engage fully in
the debate and to respond to the questions that were
raised.</div><a name="0806206000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806206000221"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> May I add my brief thanks to all of those who have
assisted Liberal Democrat Members in many ways? With the paltry
resources that we have at our disposal, we rely significantly on a lot
of professional help. While, at times this evening, some points made
about the new clauses were somewhat tedious and lengthy, I believe that
they were in fact important and might have had greater force if they
had been more succinct.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column939" />Column number: 939</div><a name="0806206000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Information
made available to us and to the general public is a key part of
providing the right sort of opposition and legislation. The Government,
having introduced freedom of information measures and everything else,
still seem to be reluctant to provide basic information to allow
Opposition parties, professionals and so on to assist Government, and
us, to introduce taxation legislation, which is important to
individuals, to the economy of the country and everything else. While
several of the new clauses were withdrawn, I nevertheless agreed with
their thrust in the sense of trying to get the right sort of
information out.</div>
<a name="0806206000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank you
personally, Sir Nicholas. Your delightful beginnings and endings to
most of our sittings were extremely humorous. All I have to say now is
that I have yet to work out how much I am going to charge my hon.
Friend the Member for Taunton for my volunteering to be here tonight,
and letting him go.</div>
<a name="0806206000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0806206000222"></a>The
Chairman:</b> The Chairman has the final word. It has been a
good Committee to chair&#151;enjoyable and constructive. There have
perhaps been the odd down and the odd incident, but on the whole it has
been an excellent Committee. I pick up what the hon. Member for
Runnymede and Weybridge said: I am hugely impressed by the way in which
the Ministers, shadow Ministers and party spokesmen have dealt with an
extremely 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column940" />Column number: 940</div>complicated Bill. They had a good grasp of everything that we debated.
From the Chair, I congratulate them on their
contribution.</div><a name="0806206000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Back
Benchers, who perhaps have not participated in any major way, have
shown patience. In the main you have shown interest, and you have
certainly shown forbearance. That has been appreciated by the Chair.
Like the party spokesmen, I am particularly grateful to the Clerks, who
are very helpful to Chairmen. <i class="I">Hansard</i>, again, is essential, so
that what we say here can be transmitted accurately, not only
throughout the country, but throughout the world. The police and the
Doorkeepers ensure that we have an orderly Committee and an orderly
debate. I am grateful to them for their
contribution.</div><a name="0806206000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am grateful for what the Committee has said about my co-Chairmen, Frank
Cook and Jimmy Hood. I will certainly pass on thanks and good wishes to
them. Thank you for being a good Committee. Thank you for what you have
done in scrutinising important legislation. Therefore, without further
ado, I shall put the Question
