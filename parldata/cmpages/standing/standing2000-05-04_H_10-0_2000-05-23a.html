Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments: No. 51, in page 25, line 9, leave out '</B>(9)' and insert '(10)'.
<P>
No. 52, in page 26, line 32, at end insert--

<P>
<B><p2>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury </B>(Miss Melanie Johnson): Good afternoon--
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Ottaway </B>(Croydon, South): On a point of order, Dr. Clark. I refer to the tonnage tax dealt with under clause 81 and schedule 22.  Paragraph 16 of the schedule, which is on page 416, relates to companies and groups that are eligible for the tonnage tax.  It lists three categories for qualification, but makes no reference to whether the ships should be British. The thrust of the tonnage tax is that it is designed to promote British shipping.
<P>
The Inland Revenue published its draft statement of practice at the end of last week.  It tried to beef out what is meant by paragraph 16(c), which refers to ships that are "strategically and commercially managed".  The statement suggested that whether the vessel is flagged in the United Kingdom is a key criterion.  I would not seek to bother you, Dr. Clark, or the Committee, but I have taken soundings in the City and it is impossible to analyse the tonnage tax without knowing whether it applies to British shipping exclusively or applies on a wider scale.
<P>
The matter is complicated by the fact that the consultation period for the draft statement of practice expires on 30 June.  That will be after the Committee has considered the matter. Under those circumstances, Dr. Clark, would it be appropriate for you to adjourn the Committee as far as clause 81 and schedule 22 are concerned and consider them at the end of the Committee in the beginning of July to enable the consultation period to close?  Then we would at least know in what direction the tonnage tax will take us.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Mr. Ottaway, that is an interesting subject.  The first part of what you said was not a point of order but a matter for clarification in debate.  The second part, about the fact that we may not reach schedule 22 until after the due date, was something close to a point of order. The Government should take note of it and I hope that they will respond to it in the course of the Committee.  Thank you for raising the matter.  As you probably know, it is not directly a matter for the Chair. The Chair is a facilitator and has asked the Government to consider the latter matter.<P>
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> It is always difficult to cast one's mind back to what was said before lunch on such matters, but I shall do my best.<P>
<P>
Amendments Nos. 51 and 52 would allow charities to reclaim basic rate tax on gifts of money by any individual, whether a taxpayer or not.  I see that the proposition would be attractive to charities.  It would allow them to obtain an extra 28p for every pound in the collecting tin.  Research shows that around 40 per cent. of donors are non-taxpayers, so a large sum of money paid to charities would not be repayment of tax but public expenditure.
<P>
I am more than a little surprised by the Opposition's sudden enthusiasm for public expenditure, particularly uncontrolled public expenditure.  Other areas of public expenditure would be forced to compete for a reduced share of the public cake as donations to charities increase unchecked.  A good deal of public money is going to the charitable sector through various arms of Government and those payments are more carefully targeted to ensure that we get the best use of public money.  We are not prepared to see the tax repayment scheme reduced to a random allocation of public money.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): Could the Economic Secretary tell us, in her definition of public expenditure, whether the proportionality rule that my hon.  Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr.  Flight) mentioned, under which the amount of tax that the charity can claim back is the assessed likely outcome of the distribution across all taxpayers, would enable the scheme to be rescued as a tax rebate or whether it would still count as public expenditure?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I have not addressed that question. Perhaps I could come to the point made by the hon.  Member for Arundel and South Downs this morning in a moment.  I was about to point out that the cost of the amendments is estimated at around £1 billion. It is obviously open ended--
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): indicated dissent.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The hon. Gentleman may shake his head, but I do not think that he listened to my point about the way in which the measure would work in terms of the many non-taxpayers who donate to charities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The Minister's figure of 40 per cent. refers to the number of people giving, not to the volume of money.  The estimate of the cost produced in association with the various tax laws is around £80 million.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> There we have another Opposition commitment to spend money without any source of funding.  I shall not embarrass the hon. Gentleman further by pressing him on where the money will come from because the Opposition are still looking for billions of pounds from previous Finance Bills as well as this one. I will give way to the hon.  Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) if he wants to dig an even bigger hole for himself.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Obviously, neither I nor my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs has made himself clear.  I shall try again.  The rule of proportionality might be applied, so that whatever the Treasury assessed as the net effect of the measure would be deducted as a proportion from each of the charitable receipts. Therefore, if a charity got, say, only 33 per cent. of what it currently gets--if it were assessed that the effect on taxpayers of allowing non-taxpayers into the bundle increased the total amount by the grossing up equivalent of 70 per cent.--there would be no extra tax loss. The next question that arises is whether the measure would also count as a tax rebate rather than as public expenditure.  It would be better if the Financial Secretary addressed herself to the proposition that we are putting rather than to an imaginary figure.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> If the hon. Gentleman were a little more patient, he would find that I was about to address the point that he has now made twice and which the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs made earlier.  I am well aware of the point, but I would have thought that there were considerable difficulties with it, not least the fact that, depending on the proportion of higher and basic rate taxpayers and of non-taxpayers who contribute to charities, one would need an empirical basis for working out such a formula, which would cause its own complications.  In addition--to address the point made by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs--part of the reasoning behind the amendment was apparently the complexity of all those matters with which charities have to deal. I can help him considerably with his anxieties about that.
<P>
I have in front of me the charity repayment claim form which, as members of the Committee can see, is a single sheet of paper printed on both sides.  It is an R68 (2000), if anyone is interested in getting an original of this exciting document to peruse. It is not a complicated form; it consists of a series of small boxes that must be completed.  The charity must simply fill out the form on both sides and send with it a list of the names of donors, the date of the last payment and the total of the donations. It is an extremely simple process; the paperwork can be completed in a way that is hardly arduous.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): What records will the Inland Revenue expect the taxpayer to keep?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Presumably, people will keep the sort of records that they would keep if they filled out their tax returns in an appropriate manner.  That would not be too difficult.  I shall explain the paperwork that is associated with the declaration, which is simple.  Once a record had been made, a taxpayer would not have to make a further declaration in respect of the chosen charity.  It will not be difficult for donors or charities; indeed, only donors claiming the higher rate relief will need to keep a record of the amounts that they give, the name of the charity and the date.<P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for that information. Will she confirm that the Inland Revenue will not expect non-taxpayers, especially those who are retired, to keep any records?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The scheme is not designed for non-taxpayers. The declaration applies only to taxpayers.  The point of the scheme is to offer incentives to giving by allowing the tax element to return to the charity.  If a person does not pay tax, he is obviously making a donation in the usual way, which will be welcomed by charities.  However, the proposal is not designed to deal with that.
<P>
I shall return one last time to public expenditure.  The advice from the Office for National Statistics is that a tax repayment means that more money must not be paid to the individual taxpayer by way of relief than had been collected from him by way of tax; it must be integral to the tax system. The situation envisaged by Opposition Members would comply with that.
<P>
My hon.  Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) referred to Christian Aid, which has welcomed the proposals.  It has said that the tax break has received much publicity.  The charity has received additional money, although not through the route of collecting, which my hon. Friend mentioned--it has already received £100,000 of shares. The Charities Aid Foundation was set up to boost the resources of British charities so that the new deal could bring in more than 300,000 new donors each year.
<P>
A small amount of paperwork is involved for individual taxpayers.  However, if people want Christian Aid or Oxfam, for example, to receive donations from them and to set them off against their tax liability, they need make only a one-off declaration to the charity and provide it with their name and address. Every year, when people come round collecting money, donors will simply put their name and address on the little envelopes provided.  No further declarations about their tax affairs will be necessary.  The information will automatically be fed through, as the charity will have the addresses on record and matters will flow from that. Charities will gain the benefit of the changes that the Government have introduced.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 130, which would be relevant only if the other amendments were accepted, would remove the requirement for the person and the charity to keep records when the donor is not a taxpayer.  For the reasons that I explained, we believe that the scheme should continue to link repayments to charities to the tax paid by  individuals. As I said, the scheme is not appropriate for non-taxpayers, so amendment No. 130 is unnecessary. I therefore ask the Committee to reject the amendments.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> My sympathies lie with the Economic Secretary for having to defend proposals that are obviously unjust and, in a sense, elitist.  The Bill will give charities tax relief on gifts from the wealthy, who can document them, but on gifts from the less wealthy, given in cash, it will be a case of "Hard luck, mate".
<P>
The magnitudes to which the Economic Secretary referred are completely wrong.  The Government have estimated that the total value to charities of all such giving measures is some £400 million. I do not know the source of the figure of £1 billion in relation to the potential tax cost on cash.  Charitable organisations estimate that tax has been paid at the standard rate on between 85 per cent. and 90 per cent. of cash received. We are therefore discussing 15 per cent. of charities' cash collections that would be eligible for a tax rebate that otherwise would not. That is a relatively small amount. It is some 50 per cent. of about £85 million to £100 million a year of tax--a paltry sum.
<P>
Without the provision, when we put money in boxes we shall be given envelopes on which to write our names and addresses.  Massive bureaucracy will be involved both for charities in collecting the money in envelopes and recording donations in order to qualify for the tax break and for the Inland Revenue in checking the information a formidable amount of paperwork for small sums. What is the point?
<P>
The Economic Secretary gave away the truth.  The system will be bureaucratic because the Treasury has not devised a way of permitting that commonsense approach, which would be miniscule in its effect on tax revenues, without allowing all tax breaks on charitable giving to fall under the definition of public spending, and therefore apparently affect the figures.  No regard has been paid to what is just and fair to charities; there is only a bureaucratic interest in the figures.  The route down which we are going will produce masses of paperwork and a lot of injustice, although little tax revenue is at issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Stunell </B>(Hazel Grove): I thank the Economic Secretary for her response and for having explained some features of the scheme.  However, we still have some anxieties, which I hope that she will allay.
<P>
The hon.  Member for Broxtowe gave a useful illustration of the difficulties and possibly rather small take-up that may follow, especially for house-to-house collections. Will the Economic Secretary comment specifically on his suggestion that a review should take place after, let us say, 12 months of operation to examine whether the criticisms and possible burdens that we foresee have proved illusory or need attention?
<P>
People will need to make a declaration to the charity involved. My house is in a normal suburban street, where, I estimate, six to eight different charities make regular annual house-to-house collections.  I would therefore have to make six to eight declarations, to separate charities, to maximise my giving and use my tax allowance.  As I am a higher rate taxpayer, that is good value for me.  However, it is not clear how pensioners on the state retirement pension who live in the same street will know what they are supposed to do, or, as the Economic Secretary said, how they will know that they are not supposed to do anything, as the scheme does not apply to them.  I can comprehend what I am being asked to do, and can therefore choose whether to fill in a declaration form.  However, if the collector visits Mrs. Smith a few doors away, and asks whether she is a taxpayer and whether she wants to fill in a form, I can foresee considerable difficulties--a lot of non-taxpayers will make declarations that clog up the system.
<P>
The merits or otherwise of amendment No. 130 are not relevant.  We want a practical way of ensuring that giving is maximised, and that people are not deflected from giving by the appearance of complexity.  That is in the interests of charities and the volunteer workers who make collections from house to house or in other ways.  In particular, how will those who are elderly and non-taxpayers, who may not be highly educated in financial affairs and tax policy, cope with the system?
<P>
I therefore hope that the Economic Secretary will respond to that point.  The Committee should try to improve this excellent scheme, so that it does the job that all hon.  Members would want it to do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Tyrie </B>(Chichester): On the basis of what I just heard, the sums involved do not seem large, and--unless something is radically wrong with the numbers that were provided by my hon.  Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs--the risk to the Revenue is not great.  If so, why are we creating such a huge bureaucracy? We have been told that the bureaucracy is not huge and the document is easy to fill in.  However, the requirement to fill in a form is itself a disincentive.  My hon.  Friend suggested a breathtakingly simple approach, which everyone could quickly grasp, whereby the money would go directly to the charity, with the minimum fuss and no bureaucracy. Why have the Government been so dismissive of the suggestion?  The scheme would be attractive--charities could say that every pound put in their boxes would result in extra money from the Government. As a result, there would be a sharp increase in charitable giving.  Therefore, a threat to the yield would exist, which is why the Government would prefer to the scheme that they have suggested.
<P>
I urge the Economic Secretary to consider something that I noticed when I considered questions of charitable giving--although the Inland Revenue is, in principle, always in favour of helping Ministers to introduce tax incentive schemes for charitable giving, there is always a fear in the back of its mind that such schemes will be much more successful than Ministers, or anyone else, dared hope, and that they will therefore become a threat to the yield.  Will the Economic Secretary examine whether the proposal by my hon.  Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs falls into that category?  If so, will she make a more considered projection of the revenue yield, based on a behavioural change and the conclusion that the measure would result in a sharp increase in charitable giving? If that is why the Government will not entertain that approach, we need to go back to the drawing board.  Instead of improving the situation for charities, we would create more  bureaucracy that would protect the yield and do little for charities except make pleasant-sounding announcements. That would not achieve the objectives.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I apologise for not being here this morning; I was in the Select Committee on the Treasury.  However, having heard this aftemoon's debate, I feel that I have caught up.
<P>
I am concerned about the Government's approach. In an otherwise excellent scheme, they are not thinking carefully enough about low-income donors and the bureaucracy that they must overcome.  Has the Minister read this month's Tax Adviser? It contains the article "Tax and the widow's mite" by Mr. Leonard Beighton, who is no less than the former deputy chairman of the Inland Revenue.  Labour Members in particular may want to read the article, which expresses the concern that the Government have not carried out their intentions.
<P>
Mr. Beighton says that low-income donors are effectively excluded from the new gift aid scheme, and he makes the pertinent point that the Inland Revenue's guidance note to charities on how to implement the scheme suggests that the warnings about records and other matters be given in a separate note.  He is worried that the warnings will be insufficient if such a suggestion is followed.  He advises adopting the practice that charities such as Christian Aid are considering, and which some hon.  Members may have mentioned.  It would place the warnings about tax requirements on the forms that the potential donor receives.  I hope that when the Minister finally replies to the debate, she will take on board the points made by the former deputy chairman of the Inland Revenue.
<P>
<B>Dr. Nick Palmer  </B>(Broxtowe): It seems that the speaker before last--whose constituency I have unfortunately forgotten--
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B>  Chichester.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> The hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) rather perversely criticised an innovation that the charitable world has universally welcomed.  We are discussing only whether we can improve some fine points of the scheme's administration.  The intentions that he suggested were behind the scheme were not generous.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I should have prefaced my remarks by making it clear that I welcomed the Government's proposals. We all want to get them into the best possible shape and reduce the bureaucracy to a minimum.
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I welcome the Minister's explanation of the limited amount of paperwork involved.  It is now clear that the taxpayer will have little to do.  It is hard to imagine how that could be further reduced.  The main question that remains is whether it is worth while to have the Inland Revenue check whether any taxpayers have exceeded the amount of taxation permitted.  I am happy to support the introduction of the proposals, but I hope that the Minister will talk to charities after we have gained some experience, to find out whether improvements are possible.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> We always examine how initiatives work, and we maintain regular dialogue.  I reassure my hon.  Friend that we will continue to talk to charities about how the scheme is working in practice.  We constantly examine new policies during their implementation.  We have already talked to charities a lot, and they have had considerable input into the scheme's design.  Indeed, they support many of the proposals.
<P>
May I respond to several points raised in debate?  The hon.  Member for Chichester said that the measure would not be expensive.  However, abolition of the requirement to pay tax would represent an open-ended public expenditure commitment.  That is a simple fact.  The hon. Gentleman may treat it lightly, but he may be aware that the Government have to run the country, and I, as a Treasury Minister, have to take such matters more seriously than he does.  I observed a rather flippant attitude on the Conservative Benches towards making open-ended public expenditure commitments, and I am not sure how that squares with the commitment of the right hon.  Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Mr. Portillo) to the tax guarantee.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Michael Jack </B>(Fylde): Could the Minister confirm that several aspects of social security expenditure, though demand-led, are also open-ended public expenditure commitments?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The right hon. Gentleman knows full well about all aspects of public expenditure because he was a Treasury Minister.  He also understands full well the point that I put to the hon.  Member for Chichester, who was a special adviser to the Treasury--a much reviled creature--in an earlier existence.  He would do well not to remind us of it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Not even to a reviled creature?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Not even to a reviled creature, I regret. I want to make progress and there is a danger of getting bogged down in trivial matters.  I want to focus on the overall scale of what is being achieved.
<P>
The figures show that £400 million of tax relief means approximately £1 billion of charitable giving and I have worked on the basis of those figures throughout. I clarified my view of the amendments earlier. The charities will decide whether it is worth reclaiming tax. There are many routes through which people can give money to charity and the provisions will help to open up and extend such routes.
<P>
Hon.  Gentlemen have concentrated principally on door-to-door collections or dropping cash into a box at the shops, but those are less systematic and less susceptible to our proposals than other methods such as payroll giving, or regular donations through gift aid or stocks and shares, for example.  Those are the prime routes through which we expect charities to gain benefits.  Many charities receive the bulk of their funds through such routes.
<P>
We cannot give tax relief to those who do not pay tax. Conservative Members are making an extraordinary suggestion in that respect.  It seems that part of their generosity in their generous charitable donation proposals is handing money back to people who do not pay tax.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn  </B>(Guildford): Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> No. Ours is a simple system for gift aid donations and payroll giving.  It has been widely welcomed by many charities and donors.  The changes will encourage giving at both ends of the spectrum-from small donations to large gifts. The joint promotional campaign that we are planning should boost payroll giving and we shall continue to work towards implementing non-tax changes arising from the review--including improved communications with the charity sector.
<P>
I have already fully answered questions about paperwork. Only the most minimal amount of paperwork that could be dreamt of is involved--a single sheet of paper, a single record and a single return from the taxpayer who wants to be acknowledged by the charity as having made a donation for tax relief purposes.  That works for a simple, non-bureaucratic system that will greatly assist charities. It has already been widely welcomed by them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I listened carefully to the Economic Secretary's remarks and was intrigued by her observation that the measure will be under constant review. If a great amount of information is going to the Economic Secretary, might I press her, before the matter reaches a conclusion, to give us an objective assurance that a report will be made to Parliament about the outcome of that constant review process?
<P>
Some hon.  Members suggested that experience might need to be gained on the proposals in the clause.  The charity world would also be interested to know when it might expect some kind of report or commentary from the Treasury as a result of the constant review process. Before the Economic Secretary folds up her papers on this, perhaps she might tell us whether we can expect a report in, let us say, 12 months' time, so that we know the outcome of the constant review.  That would save her the time, trouble and expense of having to answer a raft of parliamentary questions at great expense to the taxpayer, constantly probing how the monitoring process is progressing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The biggest change in the charity territory is to abolish the floor on gift aid and to establish the principle that charities can reclaim the tax on everything gifted to them and that individuals who pay tax can reclaim theirs.  Looked at from the other side of the coin, the measures, as the Government have cast them, simply mean that the charities will fail to recover the tax paid on some 85 per cent. of the gifts made to them in cash, on which tax has been paid.  For that matter, the same will be true for the individuals.  That side of the coin, in the Chancellor's words, is unfair.  It treats the widow's mite as small and unimportant compared with the large donation from the rich friend of the Government who gets to know people by supporting charities.  He will get his tax rebate and the charity will get theirs.  It is not satisfactory to say that the various problems make it impossible to give fair tax rebates on cash donations. Nothing that the Minister has said has addressed that problem.  As a result, we shall vote in favour of the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The working families tax credit is an example of a tax credit given to non-taxpayers in some circumstances. Could the Economic Secretary, who declined to give way to me during her speech, explain the difference between the principles of the working families tax credit, which her Government chose to score as a tax item rather than social expenditure, and the proposal that non-taxpayers should be granted a credit for their charity giving?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> First, the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs claimed that we were not concerned about smaller givers.  We are concerned that there should be small, medium and large donations and that they should be supported and developed widely.  We have given a firm commitment to that.  I was distressed to hear the hon.  Gentleman's inaccurate description of our intentions.  The scheme achieves our objectives.  The hon. Gentleman refuses to accept the fact that non-taxpayers cannot get tax relief, but that is not a runner.  Indeed, it would be expensive for the public purse and to no good effect.  He also refuses to accept the fact that the vast majority of donations come into the charities through routes that will be amenable to a limited amount of paperwork to make the scheme work.  It will work from the point of view of the Inland Revenue and the individual, as well as the charity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> If I keep giving way to the hon. Gentleman, it will simply prolong the debate.  I am happy for Opposition Members to make as many remarks as they would like to, and I will answer them.  However, if they come back for more after I have answered their questions, I shall cease to answer future questions.  That is the basis on which such debates have been prolonged since time immemorial.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Simpson </B>(Mid-Norfolk): This is like the Committee that considered the Financial Services and Markets Bill.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I know that it irritates--
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> On a point of order, Dr. Clark.  I felt that the purpose of a Committee considering a Finance Bill was to enable hon.  Members to probe the Government on points of detail in connection with individual proposals. If I am wrong about the purpose of our being here, will you enlighten me?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Mr. Jack, I confirm that you are correct.  The purpose of the Committee is to scrutinise the Bill. It is up to the Ministers and other Members who serve on the Committee how they debate the Bill, and I cannot oblige any one hon.  Member to debate in a style simply to suit another.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Thank you, Dr. Clark. I entirely work within those parameters myself. All I was suggesting was that if the hon. Member for Chichester wanted questions answered, it would have been better if he had asked them earlier instead of repeatedly coming back on other matters.  I do not believe in stringing out our debates ad infinitum.  There is sensible scrutiny, and I am happy to ensure that it is thoroughly carried out.
<P>
I know that it irritates the hon.  Member for Guildford (Mr.  St. Aubyn), but the WFTC counts as a tax credit in the national accounts. That has been explained many times, including in the Committee that debated last year's Finance Bill and on other occasions.  I am sure that you are about to rule me out of order, Dr. Clark, as that has nothing to do with what we are debating.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> On a point of order, Dr. Clark. If my remarks had been out of order, surely you would have called me to order.  Is it not relevant to ask why the Economic Secretary says that the working families tax credit can be treated as a tax credit even for those who have no taxable income, but also says that the same treatment cannot be applied to a taxable gift to a charity from those without taxable income?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Mr. St. Aubyn, you were not out of order when you spoke before.  As you rightly said, I would have called you to order had you been.  You are in order to mention another piece of legislation as an example.  You would not be in order if you discussed that legislation at any length, but so far you have not done so.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Thank you, Dr. Clark.  I do not feel that there is anything further that I need to say, except to reiterate the fact that the provision has been enthusiastically welcomed.  It will be a big boost to the charitable sector in the United Kingdom.  It went far further than many policies that charities demanded or requested in our consultation with them before the announcement, and it has been a big success so far.  We look forward--the Chancellor massively so--to enabling charities to do even better by seeing less revenue coming in from, or paying more revenue back out to, the charitable sector so that it can carry on its good work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am sorry to try the patience of the Economic Secretary--I do not expect her to respond--but I want to make a structural argument that she can reflect on at leisure.  It will make it clear that the admittedly welcome proposal could be improved.
<P>
My first question is, with what item are we dealing? The answer is, nothing but cash donations.  The quantity of them cannot be as large as the total quantity of £1,000 million that the Economic Secretary asserted was the total quantity of giving; it must be a relatively small fraction of that.  I do not know whether my hon.  Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs is right about its being £100 million or some comparable figure, but it must be a small fraction of £1,000 million. Therefore, the tax relief on it must be a small fraction of £400 million.
<P>
My second question is about the cost in net tax relief or public expenditure of the relief. The answer is that it will be zero if the Treasury correctly estimates the amount of the cash giving that comes from non-taxpayers as a proportion of the total amount of cash giving.  A proportional rule could be applied that the tax giveback to the charities would only be, say, 80 per cent. of that which they would otherwise be entitled to on the assumption that, say, 20 per cent. of the cash giving came from non-taxpayers. It must be a small proportion because most people pay tax and those who do so have more money than those ex hypothesi who do not pay tax.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
My next question is, who receives the money?  The Economic Secretary has talked repeatedly about the impossibility of giving back a tax credit to people who do not pay tax.  I am sure that when she has an opportunity to study the matter at leisure, she will recognise that she has made an error.  It is not part of the proposition that they should receive anything.  The charities that have not paid tax and will not pay tax will receive the credit.
<P>
Finally, I am concerned with the only serious issue raised by the Economic Secretary, which is whether it would be possible to count the giveback as a giveback--a tax deduction--and whether it would be necessary to count it as public expenditure if there were not an absolute item-by-item matching between the taxpayer and the amount of giveback.  My hon.  Friend the Member for Guildford scored a pleasant parliamentary bull's eye when he pointed out the discrepancy between the treatment accorded to the working families tax credit and that accorded to the proposal by the Economic Secretary.  Not only is there a discrepancy, there is complete incoherence.  Unfortunately for my hon.  Friend and the rest of us, the argument works in a different way, in the sense that we know that the WFTC is public expenditure and, if it were analogous to the provision, the provision would also be public expenditure.  If the Economic Secretary's logic were right, her Red Book would be wrong.  However, the sad truth is that she might be right because the Red Book is certainly wrong.
<P>
Is the provision analogous to the WFTC? I have put down a marker by asking the Economic Secretary to reflect on what would happen if the proportionality rule were applied.  Would the total amount not be classed reasonably as a tax giveback in the light of the fact that the amount that was being given back was directly tied to the expected tax take?  I do not think that the hon.  Lady has had time to reflect on the matter, but I hope that she will do so.  Will she write to us about that narrow point and let us know whether, if the proportionality rule were applied, within the definitions of public expenditure that are currently being applied by the Treasury and metaphysicians, it would count as a tax giveback--a negative tax--rather than public expenditure?  That would guide us on Report into not having the same argument.
<P>
We are a classic case of a Committee in action.  We agree with the aim of the provision and applaud the Government's ambition. It is not a matter of party politics; some of us earnestly believe that there is a way in which to improve the proposal and save public money in administration--without costing the Exchequer a penny--simply by attacking the matter in a slightly more reasonably way.

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Does not my hon. Friend mean in a slightly more rational way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I promised the Financial Secretary that I would not use the word "rational". I hope that the Economic Secretary will deal with the matter on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I may not have explained myself properly, because the Economic Secretary did not answer my point. The low incomes tax reform group of the Chartered Institute of Taxation is concerned not only about the principle that non-taxpayers should be able to reclaim the tax on their donations to the charities, but about the administration of the scheme and how it may affect the bureaucracy faced by the charities in connection with the marginal group of people who are on the border line and may or may not be taxpayers. They are not sure about their tax position or liability, and neither are the charities to which they donate; their position may change over the course of a year.  I am talking about the administration for that group and about the guidance that the Inland Revenue gives to charities on how they should receive donations from that group.  I am not referring to the underlying principle, because there is little disagreement between the Economic Secretary and ourselves on that.
<P>
If the Inland Revenue discovers that a charity has claimed back tax that was not paid, the Revenue will ask the charity to pay that money back before it approaches the taxpayer or non-taxpayer--the donor. That is the right way to go.  It would be wrong for the Revenue to try to chase the donor who is a non-taxpayer; that would be a crazy system.  To that extent, the Government have got it right but, when they issue guidance to charities about how donations are collected, they should ensure that the tax position is correct in the first place.  There should be no need for such clear-up schemes, which will involve a lot of bureaucracy.
<P>
Leonard Beighton, in his article "Tax and the widow's mite" in the May 2000 edition of Tax Adviser, makes the simple point that the Inland Revenue needs to change its guidance notes.  Those notes do not suggest that charities need to tell the donor that he or she should fill out a declaration on the slips of paper that they post through the door.  The Economic Secretary need simply tell the Committee that she will talk to Inland Revenue officials about the point made in that article and discuss a possible change to the guidance.  That is a point not of principle but of administrative detail.  However, such a change might prevent a lot of bureaucracy and a lot of difficulty and dispute between charities and the Inland Revenue. Therefore, I hope that the Economic Secretary can answer that simple administrative point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> We have heard some answers from the Economic Secretary, but I was disappointed with the tone and style that she adopted, which was at odds with the more helpful approach of the Financial Secretary. Members of the Committee share some common ground; we agree that the scheme is of real value to charities and helps donors of all sorts to maximise their contributions. The scheme will work well for those members of the public--professional givers, I was going to say--who set aside a proportion of their income for charitable giving and are systematic, thoughtful and do things in a preplanned way.  There may be some rough edges, but there may be consultations with charities to deal with that.
<P>
The debate has focused on the spontaneous or semi-spontaneous charity giver, who is not proactive but waits for someone to come along to ask them to donate.  I am not persuaded that the Economic Secretary's scheme will minimise the trouble and bureaucracy for that market.  I am bound to say that my hon.  Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr.  Davey) would want to test the Committee on that, in relation to the amendment.

<P>
</FONT><B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 49, in page 25, line 37, after 'exceeds', insert 'by more than £100'.
<P>
The amendment touches on territory similar to that of amendment No. 130. I will explain the background.
<P>
A considerable number of elderly people especially give modest amounts each year, often to their Church. Many do not pay tax.  They are unlikely to be hugely tax sophisticated and will probably feel disinclined to disclose their personal tax affairs and complete forms for such donations. When given a form by their Church, or a similar charity, they will merely put ticks in boxes.  The charity will then reclaim tax on the sum that it receives because such people will probably have ticked incorrectly as a taxpayer.  In those circumstances, when the Revenue has done all the paperwork and married everything up, it is empowered, under clause 39(8), to come after such little old ladies up and down the land every year, saying "'ello, 'ello, 'ello, there's £12 you owe us for the £30-odd you've given to the church." A potentially worse fate might be in store, in that it could lead to such people receiving a self-assessment tax form at, say, age 85 and probably committing suicide from the shock of it.  I said that only partly in jest: elderly people do not like being harassed with such things. All that would be for a minimal amount of money.
<P>
The amendment would allow the Revenue to reclaim further tax at the basic rate from an individual donor, under gift aid, only when the the amount of tax reclaimed by a charity exceeds by more than £100 the amount of tax paid by the donor.  The amendment provides a fairly simple route for eliminating the risk that elderly people will be pursued for modest amounts of tax at far greater cost than is worth while.  Amendment No. 130 came at the issue from a slightly different angle and I am not sure that it achieved the full objective, which was to introduce a degree of tolerance to avoid penalising the innocent and damaging the good will of donors.  The fact that a gift aid declaration must declare this risk is all right, but it might easily otherwise be forgotten in terms of a relationship with a charity that can run for many years. Without the de minimis exception, unpleasant occasions will arise that could have a negative effect on charitable giving by people other than the comfortably-off, who might fear pursuit by the Revenue.
<P>
5.30 pm
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> The amendment gives me an opportunity to ask the Economic Secretary to provide more detail about the operation of subsection (8).  How will it work in the real world? Someone in the first year of a three-year tax cycle who had a low tax liability might come into a large sum of money in year two, make a generous donation and find that the limits of liability have been exceeded.  If, in year three, the Revenue comes after him, as described by my hon.  Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs, how can the taxpayer be certain of his position?
<P>
My hon. Friend mentioned uncertainty for the little old lady, but the reverse situation could occur to someone with a cyclical income.  Someone could be unaware of the tax headroom in relation to a particular form of giving under subsection (8). I do not see how any taxpayer can approach this area with certainty, or can know for sure how his giving will impact on subsequent tax demands. When the Revenue pursues a case--the old lady may be asked to pay sums back--and the means of paying are unavailable because a person has no income, what will happen? That could be a real-world situation for someone with a cyclical income.  Will the Economic Secretary, in responding to the amendments, address the practical operations of subsection (8)?
<P>
<B>Mr. Roger Casale </B>(Wimbledon): I shall make a short contribution, having been contacted by the low incomes tax reform group. I am not speaking in favour of this unnecessary amendment, but I want to highlight the need for greater clarity regarding publication of the Inland Revenue's guidance notes in order to avoid two possible outcomes for non-taxpayers who regularly give to charities.  The first relates to people giving perhaps £2 or £3 a week through their Church congregations, who may have inadvertently signed a declaration, thereby making themselves liable to tax. The second problem may arise when someone who is a taxpayer subsequently ceases to be so.  If the person has signed a declaration, it will be valid indeterminately, which could lead to unjustified tax demands being made.
<P>
Throughout the tax system, the general approach is for Inland Revenue and the liable individual to get things right first time in order to avoid complicated corrections, especially of small amounts, which can be expensive to administer in the longer term.  As I said, I do not support the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B>  The hon. Gentleman is making a powerful point. Does he agree that there should be a mechanism through which the taxpayer can establish the given limit in any one year, without running into the problems of subsection (8)?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. May I remind the hon. Member for Wimbledon (Mr. Casale) that he said at the outset that he was not speaking to the amendment? He did not say that he was speaking against it.  His speech was only loosely linked to the amendment. I shall allow him to make a brief speech, but, strictly speaking, he is not in order.  It might be more appropriate for him to refer to the matter on Report.  In a spirit of good will, I shall allow him to finish his brief speech.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Casale:</B> Perhaps I should have made it clearer that I was speaking against the amendment because it is unnecessary.  I was grateful for the intervention of the right hon.  Member for Fylde (Mr.  Jack).  I agree that some sort of mechanism is necessary and it already exists in the form of Inland Revenue guidance notes. Would the Minister consider tightening up and clarifying those notes, which should make it clear that people who have signed a declaration must consider whether they remain taxpayers from one year to the next? It would be worth mentioning that in the notes, which do not include it at present.
<P>
My suggestion would not require amending the Bill, which is why I am speaking against the amendment. However, I urge the Minister to undertake further tightening of the guidance notes, as that could meet many of the concerns that led to the amendment being tabled in the first place.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The gift aid scheme was introduced by the Conservative Government in 1990. It was a requirement of their scheme that the donor must have paid basic rate tax equal to the amount repaid to the charity. The scheme was, therefore, not appropriate for people who did not pay income tax at the basic rate. If the taxpayer had not paid sufficient tax, an assessment would be made to recover the shortfall.
<P>
In clause 39, however, we have dropped the requirement that the donor pay income tax at the basic rate and extended the scheme to anyone who has paid an amount of tax sufficient to cover the tax reclaimed--whether at the starting or lower rate or on their capital gains. That will make the scheme accessible to more people, particularly those on lower incomes--to whom the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs referred--who will be able to see the value of their donation boosted by the tax repaid to the charity. The tax reclaimed must have been paid, and any shortfall must be made good by the donor.
<P>
The amendment would allow any shortfall, up to £100, to go unrecovered. That would undermine the tax repayment nature of the scheme by breaking the link between the payment and repayment of tax and lead us into further public expenditure of approximately £50 million. That is why it will be a requriement that the gift aid declaration, which each donor must give to a charity, should make it clear to donors that they need to have paid sufficient tax.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am concerned about the non self-assessment taxpayer, whose only awareness of how  much tax has been paid comes with the arrival of the P60. Could that form be modified to include a statement of what level of tax payment equates to the level of giving at which further tax penalties would not be incurred under the proposals?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> We have not done that, but I would be happy to discuss the possibility with officials. The declaration is straightfoward. The notes that explain the tax requirements state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Remember to notify us if you no longer pay an amount of income tax or capital gains tax equal to the tax we reclaim on your donations (currently 28p for every £1 you give).<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, most people should be able to calculate what is possible, given the simple equation of 28p for every £1 that they give. I hope that that deals with the points that the right hon. Gentleman made.
<P>
I assure the hon.  Member for Arundel and South Downs that older donors will not need to give the charity details of their tax affairs.  They will merely need to acknowledge by signing the declaration that they know that tax will be recovered.  A claim made by a charity for repayment on behalf of a non-taxpayer would be most unlikely to generate a self-assessment form for that taxpayer. The difficulty about which the hon.  Gentleman is worried is most unlikely to occur.
<P>
We have endeavoured to make the proposals more sympathetic than the original Conservative Government scheme, which dates from 1990, to the taxpayer who pays smaller amounts of tax, by relating the scheme to the amount of tax paid.  It is fundamental to retain the link between the money donated to the charity and the tax paid by the donor to at least that value.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> First, I should like to confirm that the figure that the Economic Secretary cited was £15 million, not £50 million.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Fifty million.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Secondly, my understanding is that the Revenue is likely to investigate such matters in the round and examine the total amounts that individuals claim in tax relief and that charities claim back and calculate whether the figures are significantly out before starting massive campaigns to chase up little old ladies.  In many circumstances, people may justly claim tax relief on charitable gifts, but as I pointed out earlier, if those gifts were made in cash, the charity would not be able to claim on them.  All sorts of swings and roundabouts will be involved.
<P>
As the Economic Secretary pointed out, the old gift aid regime was for the better-off, for whom tax deductibility was a certainty. People who could give £250 or more were clearly almost certainly taxpayers and, largely higher rate taxpayers. Although we greatly welcome the abolition of that floor, the proposals raise all sorts of tricky issues that the Government have not entirely thought through and which will cause problems.  In considering what people will have to declare, in the example that I cited, the person would need to declare that he is not a taxpayer.  Many old people have pride and do not want to declare that they are poor, which is what it amounts to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Although such people will not have to give their tax numbers, they will either have to declare positively that they have paid tax, so that the charity can claim it back--
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Such people need merely acknowledge that they know that tax will be recovered, not whether it will be recovered or whether it is applicable in their case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Minister. Unless the information makes it clear to the charity that it should recover tax, it is completely useless.  However the declaration is worded, it must tell the charity whether to seek to recover tax on that contribution.  The donor will therefore have to declare whether he is a taxpayer. Otherwise what is the point?  The measure could lead to everyone receiving a tax demand.  Whatever the wording, people must indicate on the forms that they complete for the charity whether it can recover tax on the donation--in other words whether they are taxpayers.
<P>
5.45 pm
<P>
We do not propose to put the amendment to a vote as we made the point on the last set of amendments. I simply ask the Government to think again about how to deal with this knotty problem, as it will not go away.  There may be objections in principle to our approach of setting a de minimis amount, but I cannot see that the principles matter particularly.  Unless the two gross figures that the Revenue monitors balance, large numbers of elderly people are likely to be chased for £10 of tax. Not only would that upset such people, but it would be a major disincentive to continue giving.
<P>
In the spirit of the Government's aims here, which we all support, it seems mean to allow the impact of nasty measures to fall on the least well-off. The grand principles used as an argument against having a de minimis exclusion carry little weight, but we have made our point and we hope that the Government will reconsider the issue, which a number of charities have raised with us.  I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We now come to clause 39 stand part. There has been a full debate on the amendments to the clause, but I shall not use the powers in standing orders to deny debate.  If there is a debate, I hope that it will be short.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(within the meaning of the Management Act)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>--[Mr. Timms.]<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 108, in page 27, line 8, leave out 'section' and insert 'sections 209(2)(b) and'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I wish to ask the Minister whether the Government amendment covers the same underlying point as amendment No. 108. I believe that to be the case, but the territory is technical.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman will have to repeat his question.  I was thinking about how to deal with a linked Government amendment and an Opposition amendment, and in the subsequent to-ing and fro-ing I missed it. I apologise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> It was a practical question. I suspect that the two amendments tackle precisely the same territory, but by different routes.  I merely seek confirmation.  If that is so, there will be no point in discussing amendment No. 108.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I do not think that that is so. It will probably help the Committee if I go through the matter quickly.  Government amendment No. 128 addresses an oversight in the Bill and puts beyond doubt the meaning of the expression "the Taxes Act", which is not defined in the Taxes Act 1988, by adding a references to the Taxes Management Act 1970, in which the expression is defined.  I ask the Committee to accept the amendment, which is even more technical than the hon.  Gentleman may have suspected.
<P>
On amendment No. 108, it is necessary to ensure that companies are not able to claim gift aid relief for payments that are really distributions of profit to a charity in its capacity as shareholder.  In the past, when companies deducted tax from payments to charities, it was not possible.  It is now necessary to have a provision that prevents companies from claiming gift aid relief on distribution.  The provision prevents the contribution from qualifying as a gift aid payment, but it does make an exception in the case of a payment that is treated as a distribution by virtue of section 209(4), which is a catch-all provision that automatically treats transfers by a company to a shareholder as distributions, even though they have not been made in respect of shares.  It is necessary to make that equation with section 209(4) distributions, otherwise gift aid would be denied in respect of payments made to a charity that happens to be a shareholder in the donor company, even though the payment is not made to the charity in its capacity as a shareholder.

<P>

<B>Mr. Stephen Dorrell  </B>(Charnwood): I want to probe a little. The hon. Lady said that if a charity was a shareholder in a company, it was not desirable that the charity be able to claim the benefit of gift aid on distributions by the company.  I wondered why.  If a charity invests in a company, why should the charity not benefit from gift aid through distributions?  The Economic Secretary asserted that that was undesirable. Why?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Perhaps I can come back to that in a moment. As to whether an exception is needed, or whether we would want one, for payments that are distributions under section 209(2)(b), as the amendment proposes, section 209(2)(b) applies only to payments that are made in respect of shares, to a shareholder, in his capacity as one. If the payment to the charity is made in respect of shares held by the charity, it is right that gift aid relief should not be available. I ask the Committee to reject amendment No. 108.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> With respect, the Economic Secretary said that it was desirable that gift aid should be denied if a company is distributing a dividend to a charity.  I do not pretend to have thought about this at great length, but as she was saying it, I wondered why it was undesirable.  An obvious example is the Wellcome Foundation, a huge shareholder in Glaxo-Wellcome. If the Economic Secretary's principle were changed and the Government provided gift aid cover from Glaxo-Wellcome to the Wellcome Foundation, the effect in that big example--I could give tens of hundreds of smaller-scale examples elsewhere in the economy--of turning the Economic Secretary's principle on its head, would be a substantial level of support from the Exchequer to some well-structured charities that do a wide variety of good work through the economy.
<P>
I shall speak a little longer to enable the hon. Lady to clear her mind on why the principle is undesirable.  I am sure that she has a killer argument of which, as she is now looking at me, I look forward to being the recipient.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> How could I resist the right hon.  Gentleman's invitation to return to this matter?  The new cost element of amendment No. 108 is the corporation tax relief that could be claimed by the company. Distributions by companies are not deductible in computing corporation tax, and there is no reason to allow them to be deductible on gift aid, because they are not gifts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Minister for making it clear that the Government amendment and amendment No. 108 cover different points, although an interrelationship exists.  Amendment No. 108, though fairly technical, would stop gifts from companies in which a charity may have a shareholding being disallowed as gift aid.  As my right hon.  Friend the Member for Fylde pointed out, that must be correct.  It would be crazy to prevent Glaxo, for instance, from enjoying the same tax treatment as any other company that supports the Wellcome Foundation.
<P>
The amendment received some input from the Law Society.  I shall point out the technical issues as I understand them.  Clause 40(2) provides that company distributions such as dividends cannot be gift aid payments, but exempts section 209(4) of the Taxes Act 1988.  The purpose of that exemption is to enable the transfer of an asset, including cash, by a company to a charity that is a member of that company--and for which the charity does not pay full value--to be a gift aid payment.  If section 209(4) were not mentioned, the amount of the undervalue--the difference between the value of the asset and the amount paid by the charity to the company--would constitute a distribution, thereby making it impossible for companies to make gift aid payments to charities that own shares in the company. The amendment is designed to ensure that a company can make a gift aid payment without falling foul of section 204(2)(b).  The latter is a general provision that distributions out of assets, in respect of shares in the company, are a distribution unless the member gives full value in return. For the avoidance of doubt, a company should not be treated as making a distribution under section 209(4), and should not find that it is still seen to be making a distribution under section 209(2)(b).
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Allen </B>(Nottingham, North): That sounded like the Law Society.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am not the beneficiary of the Law Society's briefing on the subject, but I want to enlarge on the question of dividend tax treatment and dividend distributions by companies to charity shareholders.
<P>
If a company makes a donation to a charity at the expense, effectively, of all its shareholders--all payments from companies are effectively at the expense of the generality of shareholders--gift aid provides a corporation tax benefit. If a charity makes an investment in a company, however, and the money comes to it as a dividend, the charity is denied the benefit of the corporation tax shelter that would be available if payment were made to the charity at the expense of the shareholder body in general.  I am not sure why that should be desirable in tax terms.  If a charity raises money and secures income that allows it to deliver its charitable objective more effectively, surely that is desirable and reinforces charitable activity and the not-for-profit sector in the UK. I do not understand why we should deny tax benefit to such a charity when we are apparently happy to give it to a charity to which corporate donations are made, not because the charity has put its affairs in order but because of shareholders' generosity.  I should be grateful if the Economic Secretary would explain, in addition to the technicality of what the Government propose--about which he has been clear--the public policy thought that lies behind it.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I have listened with care to the interesting line that my right hon.  Friend has taken.  Is the measure, as a matter of policy, an anti-avoidance one to deter companies from setting up a bogus charity into which they could put moneys via gift aid, which they would use to perform some kind of beneficial work, the profits from which would be put back into the company?  If it is not, perhaps she could respond to my right hon. Friend's question, because like him I am struggling to get to grips with the issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> It is fair to say that the Economic Secretary has not come back with a knock-out argument against that line of questioning. A fair amount of paper seems to be being passed along the Government Front Bench.  My right hon.  Friend asks a genuine question; he may have spent months thinking about it when he was Financial Secretary, although I freely concede that I did not.  However, as a former Financial Secretary, I know that a missive regularly goes round the Treasury asking whether something original and inventive could be done to reinforce the charitable sector.  I wonder whether the Economic Secretary has involuntarily offered the notion that it might be helpful if Ministers had the chance to go away and think about it and whether, if we table an amendment on Report, we might not hear that the Government are willing to consider it, if not in the context of this year's Budget arithmetic, then as a potential way of reinforcing the not-for-profit sector in the UK. That is not a party political issue but something that all parties in the House have consistently supported.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My purpose in rising to speak is much less ambitious than that of my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood, who has raised some deep issues about dividends and tax.  I hope--genuinely, for once--to assist the Committee. [Laughter.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Mr. Letwin, we have had reference to a genuine question from Mr. Dorrell; we are now having genuine assistance from you.  Can we assume that, unless the word "genuine" is used, everything is not genuine?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Perhaps we should say disingenuous. One can certainly assume that any offer to help the Committee as a whole is usually to be taken as a jest although it amazes me that I should inform you of that, Dr. Clark.
<P>
I think that we have been arguing at cross-purposes. Subsection (2) has the effect that a donation to a charity by a company of which the charity is a shareholder, which would normally count as a distribution if it was not recompensed by full repayment, is exempt from the rule under section 209 (4) of the Taxes Act 1988.  We have no objection--this is, for once, a matter of complete harmony between the Opposition and the Government--to that admirable provision. The issue raised by the Law Society is whether subsection (2), by being incomplete, inadvertently catches a company engaging in activity permitted under the subsection. Section 209(2)(b) of the Taxes Act, which is not mentioned in the subsection, contains another definition that could be used by an over-zealous inspector to catch a company that had made a cash donation to a charity that happened to be one of its members or shareholders. That would be unfortunate, because it is not the purpose of subsection (2). 1 would not adduce that as a serious point, but the Law Society knows a thing or two about how to interpret law and construct statutes.
<P>
There are two ways to proceed.  One is for the Economic Secretary to reflect and perhaps to table a Government amendment similar to ours on Report.  It would be equally good for her to assure us that the intention of subsection (2) is that no action should be taken against a company engaged in the manoeuvre that I described, under section 209(4), section 209(2)(b) or any other provision of the 1998 Act.  If that assurance were given, under Pepper v. Hart we would be all square and would be as happy as Larry, except my right hon.  Friend the Member for Charnwood. He raised the much deeper issue about whether genuine distribution of dividends should be an outlet for charitable giving.  That is not the purpose of subsection (2).

<P>

<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I think that I can assure the hon. Gentleman about section 209(2) of the 1988 Act.
<P>
I am not sure that I can answer the question asked by the right hon. Member for Charnwood. The tax benefit is being denied not to the charity, but to the company. He furrows his brow, which suggests that he does not find that that meets his requirements. I assure him that we shall consider his comments and write to members of the Committee.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B>  I beg to move amendment No. 48, in 27, line, 10, after '(3F)', insert' '(3G)'.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to enable corporate charities to make gift aid payments out of their taxable profits.  The existing gift aid regime prevents corporate charities from reducing their taxable profits by making gift aid payments.  Such charities can legitimately find themselves with taxable profits because they do not enjoy a blanket exemption from income tax or corporation tax.  That is especially relevant to museums' friends groups that carry out taxable fundraising events.
<P>
There was no problem when the covenant arrangement was in operation, as charities could use a deed of covenant.  However, relief on covenants is being abolished.  Surely it is illogical for a normal commercial enterprise to be able to make gift aid payments to reduce taxable profits, but for charities with taxable profits not to be able to do so.  The amendment is nothing more than the legitimate consequence of removing relief on deeds of covenant, and is proposed on the basis that the new gift aid regime should be an adequate replacement for what could be achieved in the past.  It is particularly relevant to charities such as museums.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> Section 339 of the Taxes Act is designed to give companies, in general tax, relief on their donations to charity.  Charities were not included under section 339 because they had their own extensive range of tax reliefs.  The majority of charities in England and Wales come under the supervision of the Charities Commission. It does not regard it as appropriate for charities to undertake a significant amount of trading on their own account, other than primary purpose trading, which is trading connected to the primary charitable objectives of the charity.
<P>
To do otherwise would be to put at risk the charity's assets.  Charities that want to undertake a measure of trading, other than primary purpose trading, operate through subsidiary companies.  Those companies conduct commercial activities on behalf of the charity and pass any profits to it.  As a result, the charity is not exposed to commercial risk, the subsidiary receives tax relief under section 339 against the money that it pays to the charity and the income is exempt from tax in the charity's hands.
<P>
The amendment would include trading companies that are themselves charities. No organisation that is supervised by the Charities Commission can operate in that way.  Some bodies, such as museums and universities--to which the hon.  Member for Arundel and South Downs referred--are exempt by statute from the supervision of the Charities Commission.  The issue is limited to a small number of exempt charities.  It would be relatively simple for those few bodies to operate in the same way as other charities and we do not see a compelling need to amend the Bill to allow them to operate differently from other charities.
<P>
Even if we were minded to alter the position, I could advise the Committee to accept the amendment. Any change would need to be more than a simple deletion of subsection (3G) of section 339.  Withdrawing the existing prohibition would open up avoidance opportunities through enabling funds to be passed between charities in ways that would circumvent the gift aid benefit rules.  We would need to add further provisions to guard against that abuse.  I urge the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> This is a technical amendment and we do not propose to press it to a Division.  I am sure that the Economic Secretary is aware of the limited number of situations in which the ending of the covenant arrangement will cause a problem.  I hope that I understood her response to mean that the Government will consider how that can be dealt with.  The standard arrangement of setting up a company to which she referred is not always relevant to corporate charities making gift aid payments. Surely the Government would not wish to change the law to the disadvantage of charities.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> All that we are expecting is for charities to set up subsidiary trading companies, as is currently undertaken by many well-known organisations, such as Cambridge university, the National Trust, Oxfam and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.  The existing mechanism will meet the needs of certain charities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I wish to make a wider point in relation to clause 40. It concerns the knock-on effects of the abolition of the previous covenant arrangements.  It has been put to us that, under clause 40, charities, especially when they receive corporate gifts, could have tax bills as a result of the changes. We consider that charities should enjoy under the law the comfort that, provided they remain within the revised benefit rules, a payment receipt from a close or non-close company can be treated as a payment that is exempt from tax.
<P>
6.15 pm
<P>
I am making a technical point, but charities should be reassured that, whenever they are dealing with a company, whether it be small or large, and follow the benefit rules, they will know that the income that they receive is not taxable.  The alternative to running such activities through a trading subsidiary would introduce unnecessary complications for fund-raising schemes, especially if part of them was run by the charity while another part had to be run by a single trading entity.
<P>
The Economic Secretary's previous comments were not a full answer to the points that have been raised.  The Government must look into such territory in more detail.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B>  I can give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he seeks.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take following: Amendment No. 43, in page 30, line 7, at end insert--

<P>
"3B any 'qualifying investment' as defined in section 83B.".'.
<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Amendments Nos. 42, 43 and 44 would take the new established principle of gifts of shares qualifying for gift aid and to introduce to it, as happens in the United States of America, the facility for donors of shares to charities to reserve the right to receive the income from those shares during their lifetime and that of their spouses, provided the principle is irreversibly committed to a charity on their death.
<P>
The use of such trusts in the United States of America has been a major factor in increasing charitable giving to universities and other institutions of higher education. The problem of relying on promises of money under wills is that it is not money certain and that there is no incentive on the donor when approached to make the will now. The amendment would introduce US-style relief for donors of shares and enable them to retain for their lifetime and that of their spouses the benefit of the income from the shares, but to transfer significant shareholdings to charities during their lifetime without the fear of being left with insufficient income prior to death.  Charities will have the immediate advantage of certainty, unlike arrangements that are made under a will.
<P>
The relief offered for the donor will be the same as that on an outright gift of securities and our three amendments would ensure that the gift was an effective exempt transfer for inheritance tax purposes, too.  That could be achieved under the Bill, but it is a separate matter from that of a straightforward donation of securities.
<P>
Amendment No. 41 would extend the new relief for gifts of shares to all shares, whether listed or not.  Several of my colleagues and I distinctly recollect that the Chancellor in his Budget speech advised that he had gone further than last November's proposals and would include unquoted shares.  However, we must have been mistaken, as something different appeared in Hansard.
<P>
There can surely be no objection in principle to including unlisted shares within the new regime.  There is a problem in achieving a valuation of unlisted securities, but it already exists on death and there are perfectly rational mechanisms for dealing with it and obtaining independent valuations.
<P>
The great mass of gifting of securities will take place when they are listed and pregnant with capital gains.  However, if unlisted securities are not included, there is little or no incentive in the early stages of new economy high-tech companies for an entrepreneur so inclined to give shares to a charity that may enjoy a tremendous benefit from them over time.  Historically, such gifts have been helpful to charities in the United States.  We can see no reason other than laziness for excluding unlisted shares.  We thought that the Chancellor had changed his mind from what he said in the Budget speech, and amendment No. 41 would therefore ensure that unlisted shares were included.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Amendment No. 43. I should have said amendment No. 42. We were both wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Amendment No. 41, in fact. Amendments Nos. 42, 43 and 44 deal with trusts.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I apologise, Mr. Flight. You were correct and I was wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Thank you, Dr. Clark. Amendments that cover different territories have been grouped together, which is somewhat tricky.
<P>
Amendment No. 71 would ensure that charities avoided risking the loss of tax relief on funds paid to a donor in partial consideration of some types of investment offered under the new relief.  Schedule 20 of the Taxes Act 1988 defines the types of shares and other investments that a charity can buy without losing tax relief on the funds used to make the purchase.  Currently, the list does not include all types of investment that can be offered to charities under the new relief, which, under the terms of that relief, the charity might buy at an undervalue and hold, instead of receiving the shares as an outright gift.
<P>
Without the amendment, charities would simply be unable to take full advantage of the generous new relief without--in the case of various classes of investment that they might offer to purchase at an undervalue--risking losing the tax relief previously afforded to the funds put up by the charity to make the purchase. I am sure that that is not the Government's intention.  This is a technical amendment and I hope that the Government will accept it.
<P>
Government amendment No. 129 seems sensible and correct.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I support my hon.  Friend's two principal amendments and pay proper tribute to the change being introduced by the Government in clause 43. I have referred to the missive that goes round the Treasury every year at pre-Budget time: "Has anyone got any bright ideas about how we can do something imaginative to support the not-for-profit charitable sector?" The Government are entitled to credit for the outline of the idea in the clause.
<P>
Incidentally, I should first have declared a non-pecuniary interest as a trustee of two significant charities, both of which are potential beneficiaries of gifts under the provisions.
<P>
There is no doubt that significant donors are interested in the share donorship arrangements.  Several charities will benefit significantly from the idea. I am generous in my support for the Government's idea and in my recognition of its importance.
<P>
In that spirit, I press the Minister to respond favourably to the two points that my hon.  Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs made. The important American parallel of providing an incentive now to give a capital sum later would reinforce the benefit that the Bill provides.  The provisions introduce a new idea into the donor's mind.  If the charity can say, "You can benefit from all these provisions, and we shall benefit too, but in the meantime, your income won't suffer," that will strengthen the interest already present among potential donors.
<P>
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs, I am at a loss to understand why unlisted shares will be excluded from the arrangements.  In fact, I am at a double loss, because in the charitable sector, a marketing tool for the provisions has drawn attention to those shares that are pregnant with large capital gains because of recent developments in the technology sector. Many technology shares are listed, but many more are unlisted.  More people might be prepared to focus their donorship intentions on those shares that have gained significant value in a short period.  It is an unnecessary diminution of a valuable idea to remove a substantial part of the potential share base from the benefit simply because it is unlisted.
<P>
I hope that the Government will think again about that plan.  I agree with my hon.  Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs: the proposition that unlisted shares are difficult to value is unsatisfactory.  Unlisted shares change hands every day, and the share valuation division of the Revenue exists to attach values to such shares.  There are well established principles for their valuation.  It is more an art than a science, but no new principles need be applied.  My hon.  Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs is being genuinely helpful, which relates to what my hon.  Friend the Member for West Dorset said earlier.  He has picked up a good idea from the Treasury, and made it into an even better idea.  I hope that Treasury Ministers will respond favourably.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The amendments would extend further the generous new tax relief that clause 43 introduces for gifts of shares and securities to charities. Our new relief will work by allowing people a tax deduction for the full market value of the shares or securities on the date that the beneficial ownership of the shares is transferred.
<P>
We want donors to be able to calculate their relief easily and we want charities to be able to make full use of the gifts of shares.  That is important.  The right hon.  Gentleman raised the issue of relief for unquoted shares. Our new relief is generous for quoted shares, but it is restricted to investments that meet the two criteria of being readily realisable by the charity and easy to value. Generally, unquoted shares do not meet those criteria. Despite what the right hon.  Gentleman said about valuation, there is no real market and such shares are frequently not easy to value. Many different types are available, and it is difficult to ascertain the value of unlisted or unquoted shares. Charities could not use the gift for charitable purposes as the shares could not be readily realised.  Those two factors have guided our thinking on the matter. In order to allow a charity to make an unfettered decision about whether to add the gift to its investment portfolio or immediately realise the gift and use the proceeds for charitable purposes, those two criteria are important.
<P>
6.30 pm
<P>
Amendment No. 41 would extend the range of investments that a donor can give to charity and on which relief can be claimed, to include all shares in a company. As I said, generally, unquoted shares cannot readily be realised and are frequently not easy to value, and in most circumstances no real market exists for them.  The amendment would constrain decision making on disposal and use of the money realised.
<P>
Amendment No. 71 arises from a misunderstanding of the interaction between section 506(4) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 and clause 43.  The amendment would extend the range of qualifying investments specified in schedule 20 to the 1988 Act to ensure that charities that receive shares and securities under clause 43 qualify for tax relief on those shares.
<P>
Section 506(4) of and schedule 20 to the 1988 Act apply only when a charity invests its own funds.  If shares were given to a charity, section 506(4) of the 1988 Act would not apply.  The charity would not be considered to have made an investment.
<P>
Arguably, if a charity purchased the shares at an undervalued price, section 506(4) of the 1988 Act would apply. However, the catch-all provision in paragraph 9 of schedule 20 to the 1988 Act would prevent shares acquired in that way from being classified as non-qualifying expenditure.
<P>
Charities will not lose out as a result of acquiring shares under clause 43. As schedule 20 will not be affected by clause 43, 1 hope that the amendment will not be pressed.
<P>
The new relief will apply when a donor transfers all his beneficial interest in a qualifying investment to charity. Amendments Nos. 42, 43 and 44 would extend that relief to include qualifying investments placed in a remainder trust, whereby a donor retains a partial interest in the investment.  The donor could qualify for an income tax deduction at the date that the shares were placed in the trust and continue to receive income from the qualifying investments until his death, but the charity would be prevented from selling and, therefore, realising the capital value of the qualifying investments until the death of the donor.  Again, it would not be suitable for this type of relief, because the shares could not be realised by the charity because they could not be sold until after the donor's death.  Nor would they be easy to value, because it would also be necessary to take into account the donor's remaining interest in the investment until his death.
<P>
In addition, we do not believe that donors should be able to benefit from an income tax deduction at the time that the shares are placed in the trust and continue to receive income from the shares.  That seems to conflict. The effect of the arrangement from the charity's point of view is the same as if the donor had left the shares to the charity in his or her will.  It is only on the death of the donor that the charity can realise the asset.  We have already provided generous relief to encourage such giving, and we do not believe that the provision is necessary.
<P>
Government amendment No. 129 relates purely to a typographical error that incorrectly refers to section 272(4) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992.  The provision should refer to section 272(5).
<P>
Charitable trusts and American parallels have been mentioned.  Several universities have welcomed the new regime because of the opportunities that it will give them.  Although I accept that it does not go as far as the American regime, Professor Duncan Rice, principal and vice-chancellor of the university of Aberdeen, has written that the Chancellor has given charities a welcome boost.  Other organisations will benefit from the provision. I have a copy of the London Unit Bulletin, published by the London Community Foundation.  Peter Jefferson-Smith, the foundation's chair, is quoted as saying that the foundation is richer, happier and has a happy and satisfied donor. He also hopes that there is a happy, if poorer, Chancellor of the Exchequer.  Those were the comments on the result of the moves on the gifts of shares.

<P>

<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> We recognisc that all that is true. However, we do not understand why that happy charity cannot be made a little happier by having some unlisted shares in its portfolio if it so chooses.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I have explained the thinking behind our decision on the unlisted and unquoted shares.  The right hon.  Gentleman has a different view, but I believe that we have made a generous move.  It is difficult to imagine that it would be easy for charities to benefit in the way in which we hope from unquoted shares and alternative investment market shares.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I do not want to detain the Committee indefinitely on the subject, but about 20 minutes ago I referred to the Wellcome Foundation.  Until four or five years ago, its overwhelming investment was in a single unquoted company.  The principle that the Economic Secretary espouses is one that says that the benefit is valuable to charities, which it is, but would not cover the establishment of the Wellcome Foundation.  Does she mean that, until the Wellcome Foundation was floated, it did not have a sensible basis on which to fund charitable activity?  With respect, that would be a bizarre position for her to adopt.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Miss Johnson, you still have the floor.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I think that I have finished, Dr. Clark.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We shall not press amendment No. 71, but on the basis of the Economic Secretary's position, the position is different for amendments Nos. 42, 43 and 44. Many universities have made the point that remainder trust arrangements would be a major benefit.  Some members of the universities promise money in their wills, and half the time the universities receive it and half the time they do not.  They do not know that the money is certain, so they cannot borrow against it for capital investment.  Although we appreciate in a sense that our proposals would be generous, we think that they are sensible and we want to put them to the vote.
<P>
The Government did not seem to listen to what was said about amendment No. 41. The logic suggested for not allowing unlisted securities to be given as a gift to charities and not allowing them to enjoy the same relief as listed securities seemed irrelevant, so we certainly want to press amendment No. 41.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sorry, Mr. Flight, but I did not hear your last words.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We want to press the amendment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The vote will be on amendment No. 42. You could request a special vote on amendment No. 41 after we have disposed of amendment No. 42 if you wish, Mr. Flight.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(2) After subsection (1)(c)(iib) of section 505 of the Taxes Act 1988 there shall be inserted--"(iic) from tax under Case VI of Schedule D save in respect of income which is chargeable to tax under that Case by virtue of section 30 of the Taxes Management Act 1970, sections 214 and 703 and paragraph 52(4) of Schedule 18 and paragraph 13(7) of Schedule 19 to the Finance Act 1990".'.
<P>
No. 70, in page 34, line 15, leave out 'or VI'.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Flight:</B> The amendments would all exempt from tax income that is received by charities and applied to charitable purposes that would otherwise be chargeable to tax under case VI of schedule D. I hope that the Goverment will respond that that is indeed their intent. Charities are not exempt from tax in relation to income or gains treated as income that falls to be taxed under case VI.  Case VI is a miscellaneous category, which includes income from the marketing of a charity's name and logo--a common occurrence these days in sponsorship arrangements--income and gains from investment in land and income from the sale of patent rights. Well-advised charities can avoid any charge to tax under case VI by carrying out the relevant activity in a trading subsidiary and then gift aiding that profit.
<P>
The provision is particularly relevant in the case of the marketing of a charity's name and logo, which commonly happens when a charity licenses the use of its name and logo to a commercial entity that will raise money on its behalf and derive some benefit from the association with the charity. Unless the payments by the commercial department are structured as annual payments, which they rarely can in practice, such income is taxable under case VI.  That could easily catch out charities, just when they are being encouraged to undertake active fund raising and being given, in the case of land, far wider powers of investment.  So our amendments seek to exempt from tax the income of charities under case VI of schedule D, except where that schedule backs up appropriate anti-avoidance provisions elsewhere in tax legislation.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The clause implements one of the ideas floated in the consultation document on charity taxation.  In that document, we said that we realised that many charities, especially small ones, do no more than sell Christmas cards or raise funds from occasional small-scale business activities. Charity law precludes charities from undertaking significant non-primary-purpose trading, so any charity wishing to raise funds by trading normally sets up a subsidiary company, which then pays over its profits to the parent charity.
<P>
The clause provides for charities carrying out small amounts of trading to have their income exempted from tax so that they no longer need to establish a subsidiary company solely for tax purposes.  We also thought that it would be helpful to extend the exemption to small amounts of miscellaneous income on which a charity might be chargeable under case VI of schedule D. Case VI is used in the Taxes Act 1988 to charge to tax various types of income and gains that would not otherwise be so charged. Many anti-avoidance provisions create a charge under case VI.  The amendments would remove that limited exemption and substitute a more wide-ranging general exemption from case VI income for charities. The Opposition's proposal to introduce an almost total exemption for charities' case VI income would open up avoidance opportunities for those who wish to misuse charitable status.  The exemption that we have introduced will simplify tax procedures for charities, and will not offer avoidance opportunities for the unscrupulous.  I do not know whether the hon.  Member for Arundel and South Downs is aware of those likely consequences of the amendment, but having explained our worries, I hope that he will withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I am aware of the avoidance territory and I referred to it earlier.  None the less, the underlying need for charities to be afforded some exemption under case VI income, in the context that I described, is necessary and I shall be looking to the Economic Secretary to introduce an alternative proposal if she does not like our amendments.  What the Government are seeking to do under clause 46 is clearly inappropriate.

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I have only two more points to make about clause 46. First, the majority of charities have constitutions that prohibit them from undertaking regular extensive taxable trading.  The clause will therefore be inoperable and most charities will not be able to take advantage of it unless there is some general change in the law that overrides the constitutions of charities that stop them being able to trade.
<P>
Secondly, zero rating on supplies of donated goods to and by the subsidiaries of charities often arises because the profits were covenanted to the charity. With the falling away of covenants, they may have VAT bills.  An agreed facility needs to be put in place by Customs and Excise to replace that, which resulted previously from the covenants scheme.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I have listened to the points made by the hon. Gentleman, the first of which related more to charity law than to the Finance Bill. I shall think about his second point.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
