Nick Gibb</b> (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton) (Con): It is
nice to be back after our short Easter break. My hon. Friend the Member
for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes) ably set out our
concerns about imposing school improvement partners on all schools,
including highly performing schools. One thing that irritates teachers
and head teachers alike is time-consuming bureaucratic demands, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column181" />Column number: 181</div>whether they involve form-filling, reading the latest lever-arch file of
partially relevant or irrelevant advice or attending meetings with
local authorities or imposed school improvement
partners.</div><a name="06041830000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">School
improvement partners are a good idea for raising standards in
underperforming schools, but they will put a huge burden on good
schools. I met the head teacher of one of the best-performing secondary
schools in London, who found her school improvement partner to be an
irritant that she could have done without. As far as she was concerned,
it brought no added value to the school. Sir Kevin Satchwell,
headmaster of Thomas Telford school, said to me that one of the best
things about his school being a technology college is that he does not
have to attend interminable meetings with the local authority. He
believes that a head teacher should be in the school, focusing on
raising and maintaining
standards.</div><a name="06041830000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">If all
schools are to have school improvement partners, those partners should
at least be well qualified and competent. Amendments Nos. 19 and 20
would introduce a mechanism to remove the accreditation of SIPs who are
not fulfilling their role effectively and whose advice is not resulting
in improvements to the school. Under amendment No. 19, if a school did
not improve within two years of the appointment of a particular SIP, he
would be replaced. If a SIP were replaced twice, he would lose his
accreditation. Nothing can be worse than being advised by someone who
is not up to the job. Amendment No. 19 would give the SIP a second
chance. To fail once may be regarded as a misfortune; to fail twice
looks like carelessness.</div>
<a name="06041830000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 20 specifies that
the Department should publish policies on school improvement partners.
I am delighted that the Government have published a statement of policy
intent, and I shall speak to that policy when we debate amendments Nos.
190 and
191.</div><a name="06041830000020"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06041830000213"></a><b class="B">Sarah
Teather</b> (Brent, East) (LD): In responding to the
Conservative amendments, I note that the answer to the question whether
all schools need a SIP depends, as we discussed during the last
Committee sitting, on whether its role is to be a critical friend
offering advice and support or to be the heavy hand of
Whitehall&#151;or perhaps I should say the heavy hand of the local
education authority.</div>
<a name="06041830000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">During the holidays, the
Department issued new guidance on schools causing concern. The
guidance, although relevant to amendments Nos. 46 to 60, is predicated
on the discussion that we are having now. I should like to place on
record my irritation that it was not sent to Committee members before
or even immediately after it was issued in the press. We have come to
expect things to be floated in <i class="I">The Times </i>before being sent to
most Members of Parliament, but we had a right to expect the guidance
to be sent to the Committee during the holidays. As far as I am aware,
it was not sent to any Committee members, although it was e-mailed to
directors of children&#146;s services.</div>
<a name="06041830000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that that will not be a
pattern for the rest of Committee consideration. The Government will
inevitably issue a variety of guidance, and the Committee has a right
to scrutinise and discuss it at the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column182" />Column number: 182</div>appropriate time. It would have been particularly helpful if we had
received this before we began clause 5. It is of some concern that we
did not and I should like to place that on the record. May I ask you,
Mr. Chope, to request that the Government do not do this in
future?</div>
<a name="06041830000023"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041830000214"></a>The
Minister for Schools (Jacqui Smith):</b> I welcome you, Mr.
Chope, and members of the Committee back to what I always think of as
the summer term. I suspect that any request to hold the Committee
outside in the lovely sunshine would be turned down, just as I turned
down similar requests from my pupils when I was teaching.</div>
<a name="06041830000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">We return to our discussions on
clause 5. I should like first to respond to the hon. Member for Brent,
East (Sarah Teather), who does not seem to have been imbued with the
sunshine like the rest of us. Given the wealth of regulations and
guidance that I have so far made available in ample time for the
Committee to consider them alongside the clauses, and as I will this
week make available the regulations and guidance relevant to part 4 so
that we can consider them when we get to it, her comments were slightly
churlish.</div><a name="06041830000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041830000215"></a>Sarah
Teather:</b> It would have been helpful if the material had at
least been published on the Department&#146;s website, but it is
still not available there, so it is impossible for us to get hold of it
unless a director of children&#146;s services provides
it.</div><a name="06041830000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041830000216"></a>Jacqui
Smith:</b> As I pointed out, I will, as I have done
scrupulously up to this point, make sure that it is available to the
Committee well in time for the discussion on that part of the Bill. It
does not directly relate to this
clause.</div><a name="06041830000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall start
with amendments Nos. 14 and 17, and Nos. 15, 16 and 18, which are
contingent upon them and which seek, as the hon. Member for Bognor
Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) identified, to limit the number of
schools that would have a school improvement partner. I am sympathetic
to an argument that might be made about the proportionality of
intervention and contact with schools and I will talk about that in
more detail later. School improvement partners come within the overall
context of the new relationship that we are developing with schools,
which is achieving its aim of removing the clutter of bureaucracy in
the system while maintaining a suitable level of challenge, alongside
the support for schools that I identified when we discussed the first
set of amendments on the
clause.</div><a name="06041830000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">SIPs will help
all schools to put in place plans for improvement. My hon. Friend the
Member for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Gwynne) made the important point
that even in very highly performing schools there can be groups of
pupils who are underperforming. SIPs will have an important role in
relation to the underperformance of particular groups of pupils within
schools. As we also said in the White Paper, SIPs should hold schools
to account for how well they support, for example, looked-after
children and improve their educational outcomes. Of course,
weare most concerned about schools that are underperforming
or not highly performing. SIPs will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column183" />Column number: 183</div>work with those schools to help build capacity and to agree priorities
and targets for improvement, but restricting SIPs to coasting or
underperforming schools or those that are not highly performing could
create problems.</div>
<a name="06041830000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, we need to be able to
respond when a school&#146;s performance is declining, even if it is
acceptable or highly performing in absolute terms. That is the point
rightly made by my hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon (Anne
Snelgrove), who pointed out the need for early identification and
challenge where schools are drifting into underperformance. Secondly,
even in the best schools there may be concern about the performance of
particular groups of pupils or about standards in particular subjects.
The purpose of this Bill and the next stage of reform is to ensure not
only that institutions perform well, but that every individual child in
those institutions has the opportunity to fulfil their educational
potential. We would be letting down under-achieving pupils if we did
not extend the SIP function to all
schools.</div><a name="06041830000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06041830000217"></a><b class="B">Mr.
John Hayes</b> (South Holland and The Deepings) (Con): The
right hon. Lady is right to say that there are few schools in which
something is not going right. Similarly, there are few schools in which
everything is going right, so she is correct to say that even in the
best schools there is room for improvement. Before Easter, however, we
said that there will not be a limitless supply of improvement
partners&#151;not, at least, of the standard we would all expect. In
focusing the limited supply where it is most needed, we should take
amore considered view as to where improvement is desperately
needed.</div><a name="06041830000031"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041830000218"></a>Jacqui
Smith:</b> Proportionality and focus, which I promised to come
to shortly, are not what the amendments imply. Instead, they imply that
there would be quite a large number of schools without any school
improvement partner. There may well be highly performing schools in
which certain groups of pupils are under-achieving, and support in
identifying and addressing that problem will be important for such
schools. Of those secondary pupils who are in the lower two quartiles
with respect to added value, some 39 per cent. go to schools that are
in the top two quartiles. We would let down many thousands of
under-achieving pupils if we did not extend the SIP function to their
schools.</div> <a name="06041830000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
measures elsewhere in the Bill&#151;in clause 47(3), for
example&#151;relating to schools that are a cause for concern, and we
have defined what should constitute low-performing schools in both
relative and absolute terms. So there is a valuable function for SIPs
in all schools which must be carefully focused on the issues and
challenges faced by every school. We shall look in more detail at
particular types of intervention for underperforming, coasting and
failing schools when we reach the relevant part of the
Bill.</div><a name="06041830000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06041830000219"></a><b class="B">Mr.
James Clappison</b> (Hertsmere) (Con): I am listening to what
the right hon. Lady says with some sympathy. What role does she
envisage for parents getting in touch with SIPs when they see the
problems 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column184" />Column number: 184</div>that she has described&#151;when the school is coasting or when some
groups of pupils are not doing as well as they could
be?</div><a name="06041830000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041830000220"></a>Jacqui
Smith:</b> I am not sure that there is a direct role for the
school improvement partner with respect to parents, although it is part
of the SIP&#146;s role to make a report to the governing body about
the head teacher&#146;s performance. We shall discuss later both the
ability of parents to make a complaint to Ofsted when they have
concerns about standards, and the requirement for more communication
with parents about the progress of their individual children, so that
parents may have an impact on overall standards and on their own
child&#146;s
achievements.</div><a name="06041830000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
pupil attainment data, which are now much richer than previously in
relation to the achievements of individual children, and are available
to the school and the SIP, will enable analysis to take place, together
with a focus on actions to address specific issues and challenges. They
will ensure that schools make the best use of the additional resources
that we are making available for greater personalisation of
learning.</div><a name="06041830000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
introduction of SIPs to all schools is also about learning from others
and sharing good practice. Each SIP will be allocated to a number of
schools&#151;maybe even in a number of different local authorities.
That will provide an important opportunity for good practice in
better-performing schools to be captured and shared in the
system.</div><a name="06041830000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I said that I
was sympathetic to the point on proportionality. I would not expect SIP
interactions with schools to be uniform. Our policy is that each SIP
should spend five days a year in their relationship with the
school&#151;approximately three days in the school and about two
outside the school in preparation&#151;but that is an average for all
schools. There is sufficient flexibility in the system to allow the
days allocated to each school to reflect the needs of the school, and
that allocation will not be dictated by my Department. Local
authorities will appoint SIPs and allocate them to schools to reflect
local context and priorities.</div>
<a name="06041830000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that Opposition Members
will feel both convinced by the arguments of the benefits of every
school having a SIP and reassured that I acceptthat the
scheme will need to be managed proportionately&#151;as we have
described it, inversely proportionate to success&#151;and to focus on
making the biggest possible difference not just to schools but to
individual
pupils.</div><a name="06041830000181"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041830000221"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> The Minister is making an interesting point and
concession. Will she be a little more expansive and tell us what the
range of days will be? She said that five days will be the average, but
how will the range of time reflect the degree of necessity for a SIP in
a particular school? Will it be from three days to 10 days, with 10
days being for a school severely in need of advice, or does she not yet
have a feel for the range of days that will be
recommended?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column185" />Column number: 185</div><a name="06041830000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041830000222"></a>Jacqui
Smith:</b> I was careful to say that the use of SIPs will not
be dictated by the Department; it will be for the local authority to
determine the deployment of SIPs and to allocate them to schools
depending on their priorities. There will of course be different needs
for SIP contracts depending on what point a SIP is at in their
relationship with the school. At the beginning, we would expect some
familiarisation visits, but later perhaps just a quarter or half a day
a term would be needed to keep up to date with progress and ensure that
the support and challenge offered by the SIP role continued to be
available to the
school.</div><a name="06041830000041"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06041830000223"></a><b class="B">Annette
Brooke</b> (Mid-Dorset and North Poole) (LD): I refer back to
an answer given to my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East concerning
academies. Will the Minister confirm that every academy will have a
school improvement partner? Who will pay for the SIP for an
academy?</div><a name="06041830000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041830000224"></a>Jacqui
Smith:</b> As I made clear when we discussed this point, the
maintaining authority, which is the Department in the case of an
academy, will ensure that academies have school improvement partners.
The two academies in areas covered by the first wave of roll-out of
SIPs will have SIPs provided for them and funded by the
Department.</div><a name="06041830000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 19 proposes that school improvement partners be replaced every two
years. I share the concern, expressed by the hon. Member for Bognor
Regis and Littlehampton, and implicit in the amendment and in amendment
No. 20, that SIPs need to take seriously their role in securing school
improvement. Our policy is that accreditation should be reserved for
SIPs who are effective. The amendment would put in the Bill detailed
requirements that would be inflexible and undesirable, and therefore
unsuitable for primary
legislation.</div><a name="06041830000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
outline the two ways in which a SIP&#146;s appointment or allocation
to a school could change. The first relates to local accountability for
school improvement. The SIP&#146;s role will not alter the statutory
responsibilities of a local authority, which will continue to be
responsible for standards and levels of attainment in schools. The SIP
will work to support that accountability under contract to the
school&#146;s maintaining authority and regularly reporting to it.
Authorities will need to manage effectively the SIPs who work with
their schools, and they will use a range of approaches to that task
according to their circumstances and needs. Those approaches will
include feedback from schools on such aspects as effectiveness in
providing challenge and support, advising the governors and working
with the head teacher. Authorities will seek evidence on the impact
that advice from the SIP is having on a school&#146;s performance.
The discontinuance of a SIP&#146;s deployment to a school could be
one of the available management actions if it was clear that the
relationship was not having the desired
impact.</div><a name="06041830000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
there will be robust national quality assurance to secure high-quality
school improvement partners, and engagement with that quality assurance
could be one of the requirements under the regulations to which
subsection (3) refers. The procedurefor maintaining or
withdrawing an individual&#146;s 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column186" />Column number: 186</div>accreditation is a key element of the measures to secure high-quality
challenge and support for schools. The continuing accreditation of SIPs
will depend on the quality of their performance and on their
participation in continuing professional development once they have
been accredited.</div> <a name="06041830000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
might help the Committee if I outline briefly what is involved in the
accreditation of a school improvement partner. The current process is
run by the National College for School Leadership. Individuals with
headship experience or who are link advisors in a local authority can
apply to become a SIP. The college takes up two references for
applicants who meet the person specification published in the SIP
brief. There is then a two-stage process that includes an online
assessment of an individual&#146;s ability to interpret a range of
school data and use them to identify improvement priorities. That is
followed by two days of residential training and face-to-face
assessment that not only builds on the use and interpretation of data,
but, importantly, tests individuals&#146; ability to work effectively
with a school to effect
change.</div><a name="06041830000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">In light of
all of the relevant available information, a person&#146;s
accreditation can be removed if their conduct or competence is
unsatisfactory. As I suggested, lack of progress in the school with
which they work could be an indication of lack of competence. Concerns
about a SIP could come from a school, a local authority or a regional
co-ordinator of SIPs. After concerns have been expressed there is a
fair and transparent process that leads to a decision on whether to
remove accreditation, which would be taken by a board made up of
representatives of the National College for School Leadership, of
national strategies and of the
Department.</div><a name="06041830000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope
that that reassures the hon. Gentleman that procedures for quality
assurance, accreditation, and in fact the ability to remove that
accreditation where a SIP is clearly failing, are already in place and
will play an important part in maintaining that quality assurance. In
addition to those measures, our policy on the allocation of school
improvement partners includes a requirement on local authorities not to
allocate a partner to the same school for more than three
years.</div> <a name="06041830000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">In such
circumstances it is neither the role of Government nor that of primary
legislation to manage education professionals directly. However, I hope
that hon. Members are reassured that we recognise, for example, the
possibility that a relationship between a SIP and a school might become
too cosy. Provision for that has been built into the
process.</div><a name="06041830000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
20 would add a requirement onthe Government to publish our
policies on the appointment of school improvement partners. I am not
unsympathetic to the objectives of the amendment, but I do not think
that that needs to be in the Bill because policies related to the
appointment of SIPs are published already by the Department, or on its
behalf. We intend to continue to do that, which will include publishing
the eligibility criteria and person specification for becoming an
accredited SIP. The condition of grant letter, which we send as part of
our arrangements for funding local authorities in order that they can
introduce and administer SIPs, includes 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column187" />Column number: 187</div>the main policies in relation to their appointment, such as the
proportion that we expect to be head teachers.</div>
<a name="06041830000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore, there are
requirements for information collecting and sharing, and obligations on
SIPs to participate in continuing professional development. I am more
than happy to send to members of the Committee a copy of the school
improvement partner brief to which I have referred. It identifies many
of the issues that I have
mentioned.</div><a name="06041830000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, we
have issued to the Committee already a policy statement on the
regulation-making powers in the clause which sets out examples of
policies that we may want to include in regulations if the need arises.
Of course, I am happy to provide further clarification in Committee. On
the basis of my arguments, I hope that Opposition Members are reassured
that we have developed a proportional yet sufficiently challenging role
for SIPs. They will have a new relationship with schools that will
remove bureaucracy and clutter and maintain the challenge and support
necessary to be confident that all children, whatever school they are
in, are given the support and ability to progress and fulfil their
potential. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Member for South Holland
and The Deepings will withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="06041830000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041830000225"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> It is good to be back after Easter and to welcome
you to the Chair once again, Mr. Chope, buoyed, no doubt, by a healthy
intake of buns and eggs and inspired by the risen Christ.</div>
<a name="06041830000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">In that spirit I note the
Minister&#146;s generosity in acknowledging that she sees sense in
some of the amendments. She is absolutely right to stress the
importance of the criteria by which school improvement partners will be
appointed, assessed and removed if they are not up to the job. I
acknowledge her acceptance of arguments advanced by my hon. Friend the
Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton about the importance of
ensuring that the very best people do the job, that there are proper
mechanisms to ensure that they are not coasting and that they can be
replaced as and when necessary.</div>
<a name="06041830000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister was less
convincing on the numbers of people who will be fit for that purpose.
In her appreciation of these matters there seemed to be a slightly
complacent view that such people will emerge from the ether and be
readily available, well equipped and entirely appropriate to perform
the demanding role that she rightly identified. I will not reprise the
very good debate that we had before Easter, but I am less certain about
that and, given the scarcity of those resources, I am convinced that
school improvement partners should be prioritised where they can make
the most difference, not only in underperforming schools&#151;we all
acknowledge that that is where real effort needs to be made&#151;but
in coasting schools.</div>
<a name="06041830000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I made it clear in my
intervention that I understand and support the Minister&#146;s
argument that there is room for improvement in every school. It would
be a very bold governing body or head teacher who said that they could
not improve their school. As we know from constituency and broader
experience, some aspects could be improved even in the best schools,
but that is not where we should prioritise scarce resources. Based on
the good analysis that can now be made because of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column188" />Column number: 188</div>value-added measurement, resources can and should be focused on schools
that are palpably coasting and those that are desperately
underperforming. The argument for the amendments is based not on
principle but on practice; it is about the bread and butter issue of
how many people will be found who are up to the job and how their
skills should be used to best effect.</div>
<a name="06041830000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall draw on one or two bits
of evidence to support my argument because the Committee, in its usual
demanding fashion, will want more than my rhetoric when deciding
whether to support Conservative Members in accepting amendment No. 14.
The trial of the school improvement partners goes back some way. As the
Minister said, the context for it is the &#147;new relationship with
schools&#148; scheme. The trial that took place in 93 schools in
eight local authorities between September 2004 and July 2005 is of
concern to all members of the Committee in judging this aspect of the
Bill.</div> <a name="06041830000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is true that
the overwhelming majority of schools were positive about SIPs, but a
significant number of head teachers&#151;nearly 40 per
cent.&#151;said that the scheme increased bureaucracy and made life
more difficult. There were also profound concerns that there would be
difficulty in recruiting heads with appropriate training, which relates
to my earlier argument. Indeed, the National Association of Education
Inspectors, Advisers and Consultants went further and warned that SIPs
could become a second Ofsted. In other words, by applying them as
broadly as the Minister wishes, she may be increasing bureaucracy even
though it is hard to defend that on the basis of proven
needas it might well be said to do in respect of
underperforming or coasting
schools.</div><a name="06041830000182"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="06041830000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Recruiting
school improvement partners is not plain sailing. There are real
worries about getting the right people. Under another group of
amendments, we shall debate who SIPs should be. Opposition Members are
committed to ensuring that they are of the highest possible
quality&#151;a view the Minister shares, I think. It does not make
good, practical common sense not to allocate the best people to where
they can make the most difference. For that reason, I shall invite the
Committee to vote on amendment No. 14&#151;the amendment that I moved
just before Easter. Although the Minister has moved some way towards
our position on such matters and, in the spirit of Easter, has adopted
a generous tone in her response to my comments and those of my hon.
Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, she is not right
about where and how we should introduce such an important feature of
the Bill.</div><a name="06041830000060"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041830000248"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 190, in clause 5, page
3, line 27, after &#145;unless'
insert</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;he has headteacher
experience
and'.</div><a name="06041830000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041830000249"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment No. 191, in clause 5, page 3, line 30, at end
insert</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;and has undergone training
in teaching children with special education needs and
disability.'.</div><a name="06041830000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041830000250"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> The lead amendment suggests that the people whom we
appoint to perform the important task of school improvement partner
should be head teachers, and amendment No. 191 proposes that they
should have undergone training in teaching children with special needs.
The Committee will know from earlier debates that the most
disadvantaged children are at the heart of the Conservatives&#146;
approach to the Bill and to education more generally. Children with
special educational needs are among the most disadvantaged
children.</div><a name="06041830000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me deal
first with head teachers. Debating the previous group of amendments, I
said that it was critical that the people who perform the important
role of SIP are of the best possible quality. There are many people who
are not head teachers whom we would not want to describe as being
anything less than of high quality, but it seems a useful benchmark to
suggest that, if a person is to be appointed to a school to make real
changes to its organisation, its teaching and learning practices as
well as to its management, that person should have been a head
teacher.</div><a name="06041830000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps I may
plug the school of which I am a governor. The head teacher of John
Harrox school in Moulton in my constituency, Mr. David Munro, does a
good deal of work advising other head teachers. He is an experienced
head and works with other primary heads to help them to improve
practice. I am sure that other members of the Committee know of similar
examples from their areas of the country. We know that there are
already good models of head teachers working with other head teachers
in collaborative ventures of one kind or another, to help them to
improve practice in their schools. In broadening the number of people
who could be involved in that work, we risk undermining schools&#146;
confidence in that provision.</div>
<a name="06041830000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">One reason why we want to focus
school improvement partners as I described a few moments ago is that we
are of the mind that there will not be sufficient head teachers with
sufficient time to perform the task. The provision entails former head
teachers&#151;they may have retired or moved on, or be doing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column190" />Column number: 190</div>something else entirely&#151;allocating significant time and energy to
the task. I suspect that the Minister will resist the amendments
because she knows that if she continues to say that every school should
have a partner, there will not be enough head teachers and it will be
necessary to broaden the net to draw in people without experience of
running a school&#151;people who are not former head teachers. The
amendments are consistent with our approach of maintaining that school
improvement partners should be of the highest quality. The right people
must be appointed to the job. The White Paper makes it clear, at
paragraph 2.62 on page 38, that a school improvement partner should
be</div> <a name="06041830000170"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a nationally
accredited expert, usually a
headteacher&#148;.</div><a name="06041830000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are,
therefore, not a million miles from the Government on that
matter.</div> <a name="06041830000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is made
clear in the White Paper that school improvement partners are an
extension of the idea of collaboration and federation that underpins
the Government&#146;s approach to the sharing of good practice. I
suspect that the Government are right that it can make a real
difference when a failing school federates with another, more
successful, school in its area. A school can benefit from that kind of
collaboration if there is good knowledge of the local circumstances, if
relationships between members of staff, governors and others associated
with the school are good, and if there is real knowledge of some of the
challenges facing the school. Such collaboration must be rooted in such
local expertise. I am very concerned that a school improvement partner
who has not been a head teacher and who may not be from the locality
may be parachuted into the school without that that sort of
understanding or knowledge of local considerations, and perhaps without
the &#147;nationally accredited&#148; expertise that a head teacher
would typically
have.</div><a name="06041830000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041830000251"></a>Sarah
Teather:</b> On a point of clarification, does the hon.
Gentleman mean that all SIPs should be serving head teachers, or that,
as the amendment specifies, they should have head teacher experience?
What he is saying seems different from what is in the
amendment.</div><a name="06041830000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041830000252"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> The amendment makes it clear
that both are possible. Of course there will be circumstances in which
an existing head teacher&#151;as in the example from my
area&#151;can play a useful part in supporting the work of another
school with challenges that he overcame in his own school. That is why
I made the point that it is best for a school improvement partner to
come from the same locality, so that he will understand the local
challenges and the character of the area and perhaps already have some
knowledge of the school. The idea of a serving head teacher travelling
to another part of the country and, perhaps, spending many weeks
working with a school that has profound difficulties raises all kinds
of questions. Where would that head teacher&#146;s priorities lie?
Would they lie with the school that he or she had gone to work with, or
with the school of which he or she is the serving head teacher? There
are issues about that, which is why I am sticking closely to the White
Paper. As I have said, the White Paper makes it clear that SIPs are
really a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column191" />Column number: 191</div>development of the idea of local collaboration and federation and good
communications showing best practice in a given area.</div>
<a name="06041830000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the case of former head
teachers, there is likely to be a great deal more flexibility. They may
have retired or be working part time in rather different professional
circumstances and they may be able to move round more freely, allocate
more time and play a more dynamic role in the process, without
compromising the integrity of this important part of the Bill by
diluting the quality of the people
involved.</div><a name="06041830000097"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06041830000253"></a><b class="B">Ms
Angela C. Smith</b> (Sheffield, Hillsborough) (Lab): The
amendment is rather prescriptive. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it
is important that a school should be effectively challenged by its
school improvement partner and that there should be reasonable
flexibility about who should be accredited to do
that?</div><a name="06041830000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041830000254"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Challenge is important, but it must be based on a
good understanding of the issues faced by schools. That is critical. It
is important that school improvement partners retain a degree of
empiricism&#151;they should be objective; they should be an
&#147;honest friend&#148;, as someone described them earlier. Yes,
there should be challenge, but it must be in the context of supporting
schools&#146; work in the areas where improvements need to be made.
The nature of that challenge will, to some extent, depend upon the
scale of the tasks faced by schools and their school improvement
partners. None of that, however, alters the essence of my argument that
school improvement partners should be of the highest quality. To make
the challenge that both the hon. Lady and I seek, school improvement
partners must have the respect of those whom they are challenging and
advising and with whom they seek to
work.</div><a name="06041830000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041830000255"></a>Ms
Smith:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman consider that former
directors of education, who may have produced extremely efficient and
high-quality services in local authorities, may be fitted to the
challenge?</div><a name="06041830000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041830000256"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> As a member of an education committee, I worked
with many local authority education officers and met many people of the
highest calibre. I do not disparage the expertise of and the good work
done by local government officers. Politicians too often go down that
road. However, it is important to make the case for school improvement
partners as persuasive as possible to schools that may be sceptical. In
coasting schools, for example, I suspect there will be a fair amount of
doubt that they need a school improvement partner at all. They are
coasting because they do not recognise the scale of the challenge that
they face. In making the case, the expertise of school improvement
partners in running schools and in, as it were, doing the business
locally, will be useful
tools.</div><a name="06041830000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
the hon. Lady&#146;s point and I do not disregard it entirely. I am
not unsympathetic to the admiration she has for the good work that is
done by many education officers in local government. However, I do not
think that it is good enough to broaden the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column192" />Column number: 192</div>net and trawl in a large number of people, not all of whom will be
equally competent in persuading the schools of the merit of school
improvement partners. If we are going to limit who can become a SIP, we
should limit it to head teachers&#151;people with experience that is
highly relevant to the work that they are to do in and with the
school.</div>
<a name="06041830000183"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="06041830000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth
talking about, in the pilot, the successful school improvement
partnership between George Salter high school and Shireland language
college, which is highlighted in the White Paper. Performance at George
Salter high school in Sandwell was improved when Mr. Mark Grundy, the
head teacher at Shireland&#151;I hasten to add that I do not know
him&#151;took over the strategic running of both schools and devised
a recovery plan for George Salter. However, the Bill does not stipulate
that school improvement partners must have real-life experience of
running schools. There is a great danger that if we do not specify who
SIPs should be, we will not get the right people, and will not persuade
schools that this part of the Bill is warranted or that the work that
such people do is desirable.</div>
<a name="06041830000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">According to <i class="I">The</i>
<i class="I">Times Educational Supplement</i> of 21 December 2005, heads who have
applied to become school improvement partners have complained about the
complex application process. I understand that it includes role-play
tests and a data evaluation examination that must be completed within
35 hours of opening the envelope. Will the Minister comment on that? We
must get the right people, and the criteria by which we test, appoint
and remove them should be rigorous, but if we are going to ask both
serving and former head teachers to be involved, we must make the
process by which they become engaged as clear and straightforward as
possible. We do not want to add bureaucracy where there is already too
much, particularly given that the point is made in the White Paper that
the Government&#146;s &#147;new relationship with schools&#148;
policy is</div><a name="06041830000171"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;designed to
reduce bureaucracy and streamline working
arrangements&#148;,</div><a name="06041830000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">so as to
release more energy to focus on local priorities.
</div><a name="06041830000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our doubts about the
Government&#146;s position are not doubts in principle. There is a
case for sharing good practice with underperforming or coasting schools
in which improvement is urgently needed. We are committed to the idea
that the people involved in that should be the best possible people and
that they should be able to perform their function by earning the
respect of the schools that they work with. That will in part depend on
their real-life practical experience, and I am therefore convinced that
it is desirable that they have run schools themselves as head
teachers.</div> <a name="06041830000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">As more
children with special needs are educated in mainstream schools, the
need to ensure that teachers have appropriate training and advice on
how to meet their needs is increasing. In this Committee, we have made
a case for the role of special schools. I am a staunch advocate of
their virtues for children with all sorts of special needs, but I
acknowledge that many children who are integrated into mainstream
schools 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column193" />Column number: 193</div>do well there. There is a good deal of good practice in integrating
children in mainstream schools where that is the best place for them.
We believe that such matters should be determined by the choice of
parents and the needs of children. The best educational opportunities
for children should be the driver of policy in that respect.</div>
<a name="06041830000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, if that is to be how
we move forward, it is vital that school improvement partners have a
good understanding of the requirements of children with special
educational needs. Conservative Members will not hesitate to advocate
the case for special needs children, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has done throughout his tenure of his
current post, as I did when I held that post, and as I continue to do
in my current role. We should not allow children with special
educational needs to play second fiddle either in our consideration of
the Bill or more widely. SIPs should be well equipped to deal with the
needs of those children and amendment No. 191 would make that a
requirement of the
Bill.</div><a name="06041830000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fastest
growing area of special needs is children with emotional and
behavioural difficulties. Such children present real challenges to
schools and head teachers and will present significant challenges to
SIPs. EBD children bring with them all kinds of problems, so it is
important that SIPs are well equipped to deal with them. There are
worries within the profession that teachers and heads are not
necessarily receiving adequate training to deal with EBD children or
with children with special educational needs more generally. There are
real doubts about the level of expertise and therefore about the way
that some of those children are being handled in mainstream
schools.</div> <a name="06041830000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 191 would require school improvement partners to have adequate
training. No doubt, the Minister will tell us why she thinks that they
should not be required to have such training and set out clearly how
she sees the alternative working out. If SIPs are not to be trained in
this area, we want to be absolutely certain that she has a plan
B&#151;another way of dealing with the needs of those children in
underperforming schools.</div>

Nadine Dorries</b> (Mid-Bedfordshire) (Con): Does my hon.
Friend agree that the number of children with emotional and behavioural
difficulties and special needs is increasing rapidly? That is not
simply because we can now detect those problems at an earlier stage;
there are other reasons too. The amendment is therefore essential. The
lack of mention of children with special educational needs in both the
White Paper and the Bill is worrying.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041830000258"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I mentioned that the number of statemented children
with emotional and behavioural difficulties has risen sharply. Of
course that is happening in the context of a growing understanding of
special educational needs and a recognition of such through the
statementing process. I still have real worries that the statementing
process is esoteric and bureaucratic and that many children are not
statemented quickly enough, with the result that we do not understand
their particular educational needs as clearly as we might. The parents
of such children often 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column194" />Column number: 194</div>find the system confusing and are bamboozled by the bureaucracy
confronting them. Despite that, it is certainly true that more
children&#146;s needs are being identified more clearly than was done
in the past, which makes my call for proper competence, real
understanding and adequate training for those involved in advising on
the education of those children all the more important.</div>
<a name="06041830000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, it would be
enlightening to know whether the Minister disagrees. I feel sure that
she must share my concerns because I remember debating the issues with
her at greater length on a previous occasion. If we are to get the sort
of education that we all want for the most disadvantaged children, we
must set the bar as high as possible for those who educate them and
those who work with the schools where they are educated. That seems a
reasonable case, which I am sure that the Minister will either counter
with a palatable and persuasive alternative, or accept by embracing our
amendments. Let us have head teachers and people who are properly
trained in dealing with children with special educational
needs.</div><a name="06041830000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041830000259"></a>Sarah
Teather:</b> I am sympathetic to the arguments made for
amendment No. 190. It is particularly important that we treat senior
management within education as a distinct profession that requires
skills distinct from teaching throughout the school and from other
forms of senior management, although it draws on both of those types of
experience. I will listen carefully to the words that the Minister uses
to explain why she does not support the
amendment.</div><a name="06041830000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am also
sympathetic to the argument advanced by the hon. Member for Sheffield,
Hillsborough (Ms Smith) that there are senior local education advisors
who may have particular expertise, but in many cases those people will
have had senior education management experience. That is where my
concern about the amendment&#146;s prescription lies. It is vital
that the people in question have experience of senior education
management, but that does not necessarily mean that they must have been
serving head teachers; they may have been deputy heads, for example, or
had another senior management role in a large school that has given
them overall
expertise.</div><a name="06041830000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment No. 191, I suspect that the training requirements of SIPs
will not be confined to special educational needs. They will need
continuing professional development in discipline and changes in child
protection law. I foresee SIPs from rural Hertfordshire finding it
difficult to understand the problems faced by a school in my
constituency, where tribal wars from Somalia continue in the
playground. The importance of continuing professional development is
raised in point 3 of the policy statement that has been issued by the
Government with the illustrative regulations. If the Minister puts on
record that such issues will be dealt with under continuing
professional development, I will be quite happy with that reassurance.
If not, wider issues will need to be addressed, not just those relating
to special educational
needs.</div><a name="06041830000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041830000260"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I rise in support of my hon. Friend the Member for
South Holland and The Deepings, who so ably moved the amendment, to
make not the same 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column195" />Column number: 195</div>points but one or two additional points. As he said, the amendments
relate to the quality and qualifications of the people who are to
become school improvement partners. I note from the statement of policy
on clause 5, to which the hon. Member for Brent, East referred and
which the Minister has helpfully circulated to members of the
Committee, that the Government have considered the point. At paragraph
3 it
states:</div><a name="06041830000172"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;SIPs
will be drawn from serving head teachers, former head teachers and
local authority
advisors.&#148;</div><a name="06041830000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">That statement
is welcome, except the part about local authority advisors, to which
the hon. Lady also referred. I am not sure how well local authority
advisors are regarded by head teachers, but I suspect that a head is
likely to take the advice of a fellow head more seriously than that of
an advisor who has never worked in a school or who has been the head of
a school only for a very short time before moving into local authority
administration.</div><a name="06041830000184"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="06041830000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 4 of
the note provided by the Minister
states:</div><a name="06041830000173"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
have not put these requirements into primary legislation because we
want to retain flexibility over the development and application of
these policies in the light of working with local authorities on their
implementation of the SIP
programme.&#148;</div><a name="06041830000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a
pity, because there is a distinct likelihood that unless the
requirements are explicitly set out in the Bill, there will be a flight
from quality as local authorities struggle to find head teachers or
former head teachers who are willing to take on the task, as my hon.
Friend has
said.</div><a name="06041830000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 3.1 of
the regulatory impact assessment says that</div>
<a name="06041830000174"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;SIPs should be nationally
accredited&#148;</div> <a name="06041830000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
that</div> <a name="06041830000175"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;three quarters of
an authority&#146;s secondary SIPs should have head teacher
experience.&#148;</div><a name="06041830000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why three
quarters, and why only secondary schools&#146; school improvement
partners? Surely the same should apply to primary schools&#146; SIPs
as well.</div><a name="06041830000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was also
interested by paragraph 3.2 on page
54:</div><a name="06041830000176"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;To enable
Ministers to enforce the implementation of the SIP function in
accordance with their policies, if necessary&#148;&#151;</div>
<a name="06041830000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">that is the purpose of the
legislation&#151;</div><a name="06041830000177"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;conditions
on SIP funding for local authorities enable the Department to recover
or withhold funding but as it is a contribution to costs this would
provide insufficient leverage over an authority determined not to
implement SIPs in accordance with ministerial policies or not to
appoint themat
all.&#148;</div><a name="06041830000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">I quote that
paragraph because the Minister often criticises me for being
over-prescriptive. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough made the
same point earlier today to my hon. Friend the Member for South Holland
and The Deepings. I have been criticised for being over-prescriptive
for wanting synthetic phonics to be used in the teaching of reading, or
more setting in the classroom, yet the regulatory impact assessment is
littered with hundreds of paragraphs on prescription&#151;how the
Government can enforce their policy on this or that body. The
Conservative approach is all about
exhortation.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column196" />Column number: 196</div><a name="06041830000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041830000261"></a>Jacqui
Smith:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman not understand that the
point of a regulatory impact assessment is to outline why legislation
is the most appropriate route in particular circumstances? Of course it
proposes a legislative route. Otherwise, the Bill would not be
justified.</div><a name="06041830000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041830000262"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> In that case, I extend the sentence by saying that
the regulatory impact assessment is littered with such paragraphs and
the Bill is littered with extremely prescriptive provisions. It is rich
for the Minister to accuse the Conservative party of being
prescriptive.</div><a name="06041830000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041830000263"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> It seems that the hon. Gentleman is attempting to
make the Bill even more prescriptive. Does he agree that some advisers,
directors of education, and head teachers&#151;although not all of
them&#151;are inspirational? Do we not want the very best for our
schools?</div><a name="06041830000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041830000264"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Of course we want the very best. It is up to
policy-makers to assess how to achieve the best school improvement
partners given the limited resources available to us as a country.
Amendment No. 191 seeks to do
that.</div><a name="06041830000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Good education
policy can often be implemented by exhortation and dissemination of
best practice. Only on issues of major importance&#151;such as
phonics, for example&#151;should it be necessary to change the
national curriculum by regulation. The Government&#146;s approach is
to pile on initiative after initiative that may or may not contribute
in some minor way to raising standards, but that will certainly impose
time-consuming activities on teachers and head teachers. That is the
point that I am trying to make. There is a distinction between
important measures that will deliver higher standards and those
measures that are burdensome to teachers and head
teachers.</div>
<a name="06041830000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041830000265"></a>Ms
Angela C. Smith:</b> There have been two references to the
need to disseminate best practice and the view that head teachers are
probably one of the best ways to do that. How does that square with the
Conservative party&#146;s policy during the last election of
abolishing the National College for School Leadership? Is the hon.
Gentleman telling us that that policy has
changed?</div><a name="06041830000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041830000266"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> All our policies are up for review, of course, at
the beginning of a new Parliament. We need to make sure that things
such as the National College for School Leadership are effective. If
they are not, they must be either abolished or reformed. We will
consider that in the coming
months.</div><a name="06041830000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like
to deal briefly with amendment No. 191, which, as my hon. Friend the
Member for South Holland and The Deepings said, would add the
requirement that school improvement partners should also have training
in teaching children with special educational needs and disabilities.
My hon. Friend focused on children with emotional and behavioural
difficulties. Such matters will be important for SIPs for mainstream
schools with pupils with special needs, and SIPs for special
schools. There will be little point having a school improvement partner
for a special 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column197" />Column number: 197</div>school if he or she lacks the specialised training that a teacher or
head teacher at such a school has had&#151;or the experience required
for such people to be
effective.</div><a name="06041830000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">I recently
spoke to a head teacher of an excellent special school catering for
children with severe learning difficulties. He explained how
specialised the training of his teachers is and needs to be using the
example of a child who not only has severe learning difficulties, but
is deaf and blind. He said that, in such circumstances, someone is
needed to help the child to develop her faculties. For example, in a
swimming lesson, the teacher will let the child hold her swimming
costume, so that she associates it with swimming. Once this knowledge
has been established in her mind, after a few weeks, instead of giving
her the full costume, the teacher will give her a small piece of the
same material. After a few more weeks, she will be given a shaped piece
of material attached to a card. In time, the shape will be associated
in her mind with swimming. The child&#146;s intellect is being
developed and she is beginning the process of learning to read. That is
one small example of the specialised pedagogy involved in teaching at a
special school for those with severe learning difficulties.</div>
<a name="06041830000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">A school improvement partner
for a special school should have such specialised training and
experience. A SIP for a mainstream school with a special needs unit
should also have some degree of training in the area of special
education. The Special Education Consortium, which is keen on amendment
No. 191,
says:</div><a name="06041830000178"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;School
improvement partners will need training and preparation for this role
and this is clearly envisaged, in clause 5, by the requirement for them
to be accredited...However, the role of school improvement
partners in respect of the quality of provision made by schools for
disabled pupils and pupils with special educational needs is
problematic. This is largely because the quality of provision in
schools is itself variable. Head teachers recruited as school
improvement partners are going to bring that variable expertise to the
school improvement role...The dearth of expertise in schools in
these particular respects makes training on SEN and disability crucial
for anyone becoming a school improvement partner....SEC believes
that this amendment is essential to ensuring that school improvement
partners are equipped to support the improvement of the quality of
provision for disabled pupils and pupils with special educational
needs.&#148;</div><a name="06041830000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 190 and 191 are important and will help to ensure that SIPs do not
just become tick-box encumbrances, but result in some real value added
to the schools
concerned.</div><a name="06041830000137"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06041830000267"></a><b class="B">Anne
Snelgrove</b> (South Swindon) (Lab): May I welcome you back
after the Easter recess, Mr.
Chope?</div><a name="06041830000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
demonstrate that the Conservative vision for SIPs is much narrower than
the vision reflected in the Bill. Our vision is much wider because we
want all schools to have SIPs, including those that are successful or
perhaps only superficially successful. In a speech on 13 April, my
right hon. Friend the Secretary of State set out the new interventions
intended for failing schools. SIPs are not part of those interventions.
They are to act as constant professional, critical friends to schools,
and are not merely to be parachuted in when schools are underperforming
or coasting. They are relevant to all maintained schools, not only the
failing ones. It is therefore relevant to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column198" />Column number: 198</div>involve a wider group of people in the SIPs initiative than the narrow
group envisaged by the Conservatives.</div>
<a name="06041830000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">My memory goes back to when
head teacher appraisal was introduced in the early 1990s. It was,
rightly, introduced rapidly, but sufficient experts were not available
and people had to be trained quickly. Some people involved in the
scheme were advisers and some came from outside the head teacher
profession, but despite the fact that not everyone involved had
experience of being a head teacher, the scheme was, and is, a great
success. I do not see that there will be any difference with the people
who will work as
SIPs.</div><a name="06041830000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schools that
have good leaders do not necessarily need identikit good leaders from
other schools to be their school improvement partners. They may need
different types of professionals&#151;perhaps those who have
experience of working with certain categories of children or in the
particular areas that may not be improving with the rest of the school.
It may not be a question of leadership, but a matter of drilling down
and considering the areas that may need to be
improved.</div><a name="06041830000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
considering a more complex issue than the small number of schools that
are either failing or coasting. We need a group of professionals, not
just one type of professional, to help schools. As was mentioned
earlier, the professionals must be accredited by the National College
for School Leadership, and it is that, not whether they have head
teacher experience, that should be the
test.</div><a name="06041830000142"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041830000268"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> The hon. Lady, as ever, is making a persuasive
argument, but does she not accept the view that people are more likely
to take advice from their peers? Can the hon. Lady think of a single
profession in which people would not be most likely to take advice from
those who had done their job? It is true of MPs, is it not? If I needed
advice on how I could do my job better, I would be more likely to speak

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041830000269"></a>Anne

to seek information and advice from their peers. However, I have
noticed that my constituents are very free with their opinions and I
cannot seem to stop them. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Laughter.</i><i class="I">]</i> There are a
number of people besides head teachers whom head teachers consider to
be their peers&#151;for example, the professional group of educators;
their deputy head colleagues; deputy head teachers in other schools;
and those whom they consider to be good advisers and
inspectors.</div><a name="06041830000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The peer
group of head teachers and deputy head teachers includes good
professionals, but we all know that when we visit schools, the head
teachers sometimes make comments about their head teacher and adviser
colleagues to which we have to close our ears, whereas they are full of
praise for other colleagues. The peer group is not confined narrowly to
head teachers. It comprises many different people, including
up-and-coming deputy head teachers, whom everyone within a group of
schools knows will be the next head teachers. Possibly, they are more
inspirational leaders than many of the head teachers in that group of
schools. We must be very careful about what we consider to be the peer
group.</div>

hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton mentioned advisers who

fact, I do not know any&#151;who have never worked in schools.
However, I do recall that when the Conservative Government quite
rightly introduced the inspection regime, it was mandatory for each
group to include an inspector drawn from industry&#151;someone who
had no prior experience of a school. That was very useful, but it was
useful within a group of inspectors who made a collective judgment on
how a school was doing. I can see reasons for involving advisors from
outside education, and ways of doing it, but I do not think that such
an advisor would be the sole person to be involved in school
improvement. In fact, I should be very surprised if such a person were
to get through the training given by the National College for School
Leadership.</div><a name="06041830000185"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45

191 is largely redundant, because I do not know of any initial teacher
training that does not include an element of training in special needs.
My own certainly did, and I know that many colleges provide that
training now. I should be very surprised to learn otherwise. In
addition, a huge amount of training in special needs has been provided
for teachers in the past 10 to 15 years, particularly with the move to
include more young people with special needs in mainstream schools and
colleges. People either agree with that or they do not, and I do not
intend to rehearse the arguments here, but it is of course up to the
National College for School Leadership to ensure that further training,
if necessary, is available and is part of the qualification for school
improvement partners.</div>

that many teachers have enjoyed&#151;her phrase &#147;an element of
training in special needs&#148; was an interesting one&#151;and I
wonder if she agrees with the large number of teachers who feel that
many children who have been integrated into the mainstream should not
be there. She will recall last year&#146;s survey that found that a
significant number of teachers and head teachers thought that about a
quarter of the children who have been integrated into the mainstream
should be in special
schools.</div><a name="06041830000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041830000271"></a>Anne

course if a teacher is training as a general primary school teacher or
is doing subject-specific training for secondary school it would not be
expected that the whole training programme would be about special
needs. I do not know the survey that the hon. Gentleman mentions, but
my feeling is that we need to consider a balance of what is right for
the child and what is right for the school. That is how we should
proceed. There are always issues to be considered about integration and
getting children into the mainstream. I also feel that we have in the
past held many children with special needs back by putting them and
keeping them in special schools when they could move faster and further
in mainstream schools.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041830000272"></a>Jacqui
Smith:</b> We have had a good discussion about school
improvement partners. Amendment No. 190 would, as we have heard, impose
restrictions on who could be a school improvement partner by requiring
that the individual concerned should have head teacher experience. I
agree that a central feature of the school improvement partner
programme should be the involvement of significant numbers of people
with head teacher experience. That is already established, and we have
been clear about it since January 2004.Of course, as the hon.
Member for South Hollandand The Deepings identified, we
reiterated that commitment in the schools White Paper.</div>
<a name="06041830000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee may be interested
to know that 70 per cent. of secondary school improvement partners
deployed in the first wave have head teacher experience, and that in
the primary phase local authorities already use significant numbers of
people with head teacher experience. A recent advertisement for primary
school improvement partner accreditation attracted 2,000 applications,
and 85 per cent. of those were from people with head teacher
experience.</div> <a name="06041830000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
some important points have been made, largely by my hon. Friends and
the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke), to
show that we should also recognise that some individuals who have not
been head teachers may have important expertise and experience to
offer. That case was made eloquently by my hon. Friends the Members for
South Swindon and for Sheffield, Hillsborough. For example, those
individuals could include current or ex-school improvement advisors. It
would be inappropriate and the system would lose out if we effectively,
in passing the amendment, outlawed those people from becoming school
improvement partners and therefore from contributing further to school
improvement.</div><a name="06041830000153"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06041830000273"></a><b class="B">Mary
Creagh</b> (Wakefield) (Lab): Has my right hon. Friend
analysed the potential impact of the amendments, were they to be made,
in opening the Government to challenges under the Human Rights Act 1998
or sex discrimination laws, given that fewer women are likely to become
head teachers, particularly at secondary level? Indirectly, the
amendments could be
discriminatory.</div><a name="06041830000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041830000274"></a>Jacqui
Smith:</b> I have to admit to my hon. Friend that I have not
made any analysis under human rights or sex discrimination legislation,
but she makes an important point&#151;as have other
colleagues&#151;about the impact of making legislation on the nature
of school improvement partners over-restrictive.</div>
<a name="06041830000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have been clear about the
significant contribution that we expect those with head teacher
experience to make, not least because the hon. Member for South Holland
and The Deepings is right&#151;head teachers might be more likely to
accept that challenge and support from other head teachers. I note as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column201" />Column number: 201</div>well&#151;not necessarily warmly&#151;that it was a Conservative
Government who introduced lay Ofsted inspectors, and, I understand, lay
inspectors into the police force. So his argument does not stack up in
the way in which he spelt it
out.</div><a name="06041830000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
confronts the question whether, despite the commitment to have large
numbers of people with head teacher experience, we want to outlaw
people who do not, from contributing to school improvement. Already,
many such individuals are serving successfully as school improvement
partners in our schools. To replace those existing SIPs with head
teachers and former head teachers would require wholesale change, and
in many ways it would be rash to lose the expertise of all of those
people.</div><a name="06041830000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">I reassure
hon. Members, however, that we have introduced a national system of
accreditation, that I outlined when I responded to the previous group
of amendments, that underpins the appointment of SIPs, and, indeed, we
have included that requirement in the Bill. I was slightly surprised
that the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings described as
bureaucracy what I think of as a rigorous accreditation process. I make
no excuse for the fact that we require individuals to pass the online
assessment and meet the person specification, and then to go on to be
trained and assessed for
accreditation.</div><a name="06041830000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a
moment I shall respond to the point made by the hon. Member for Brent,
East who identified&#151;rightly&#151;the need for not only
rigorous accreditation, but continuing professional development
training in some areas. Of course, we are prepared to insist, where
necessary, on head teacher involvement in the school improvement
partner programme by, for example, making such involvement a condition
of funding support. We would do that to help to achieve, as I have
said, the policy that we have set out whereby 75 per cent. of secondary
SIPs deployed should have secondary head teacher experience.</div>
<a name="06041830000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members have referred to
the policy statement that accompanies clause 5 in which I spelt out the
reserve powers for making regulations which would, if necessary, be the
place in which to legislate for more detailed requirements in relation
to the appointment of school improvement partners. On that basis, I
shall resist amendment No.
190.</div><a name="06041830000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
technical problems with amendment No. 191. As drafted, it would add to
subsection (2)(b) the requirement that a person should be trained in
the teaching of</div><a name="06041830000179"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;children
with special education needs and disability.&#148;</div>
<a name="06041830000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, that provision relates to the
person authorised by the Secretary of State to accredit individuals to
be school improvement partners, not to the partners themselves, so
technically the amendment does not achieve the aim set out by
Opposition Members.</div>
<a name="06041830000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I shall address the
intention behind the amendment, which was meant to refer to the people
being accredited as school improvement partners. I shall mention,
first, the organisation that accredits the school improvement partners,
secondly, the nature of the SIP role in relation to the children, and,
thirdly, our thinking on the role of SIPs in relation to special
schools&#151;a matter to which the hon. Member for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column202" />Column number: 202</div>Bognor Regis and Littlehampton referred. The initial training,
development, assessment and accreditation of school improvement
partners is undertaken by the National College for School Leadership,
whose future, at least under the present Government, is
secure.</div> <a name="06041830000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the points
made by the hon. Member for Brent, East on how SIPs are trained, school
improvement partners do not focus solely on the academic achievement of
the successful or the best. The training and accreditation of SIPs
focuses on data analyses of the performance of groups of pupils in
schools, in particular on identifying inequitable outcomes that might
occur in the school, the factors that contribute to them, and the
action that the school should take. That is supplemented by detailed
guidance on how the school improvement partnership focuses with the
school on issues that might affect vulnerable or disadvantaged groups
of pupils&#151;the sort of issues rightly identified by the hon.
Lady. I should be happy to supply members of the Committee with the
guidance, to identify the scope and the depth of the
training.</div><a name="06041830000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The guidance
includes advice that SIPs should consider in relation to special
educational needs, including the effectiveness of systems in the school
to identify pupils with barriers to learning; discriminating well
between those with learning and behavioural difficulties; whether
systems can be used to design appropriate curriculum and pastoral
support, monitoring success; responding to changing needs; and focusing
on whether there are effective links with other support agencies, to
ensure that integrated support structures, which are often so important
for children with special educational needs, are in place for pupils
with additional needs in the
school.</div><a name="06041830000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041830000275"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> Has the guidance been drawn up in association with
some of the main organisations such as the National Autistic Society,
which wants a special teacher with a full brief on autism in every
school?</div>
<a name="06041830000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041830000276"></a>Jacqui
Smith:</b> I cannot give the hon. Lady a commitment that the
guidance, which is about the training of school improvement partners,
has been drawn up with the National Autistic Society, but the
Department has done considerable work with the society about the
special educational needs training that my hon. Friend the Member for
South Swindon mentioned and how we can address such needs in
schools.</div><a name="06041830000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The guidance
is supplemented by a range of questions supplied to SIPs, specifically
whether there are effective systems to identify pupils with additional
needs and to monitor how well those needs are being addressed. SIPs
will therefore be required to identify underperformance of potentially
vulnerable groups and be equipped to deal with them. They will raise
issues of concern and probe with the head teacher their response to
them and the priorities for action.</div>
<a name="06041830000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">As well as considering academic
attainment, SIPs will also consider any over-representation of certain
types of pupils in a school&#146;s exclusion or absence data. There
are worries about the representation of children with special
educational needs in exclusions, and about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column203" />Column number: 203</div>the number of exclusions. The SIP will be armed with that information on
the school and trained to investigate the matter.</div>
<a name="06041830000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The training and professional
development of SIPs does not stop with the initial session provided for
accreditation. SIPs will take part in four days of professional
development a year, provided in part by the national strategies and in
part by the local authorities deploying SIPs. One of the important
elements of that training will relate to the analysis of the
school&#146;s self-evaluation. That is a key starting point for the
school improvement partner in the process of offering challenge and
support to the
school.</div><a name="06041833000129"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="06041833000003"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
specific special educational needs sections in the school
self-evaluation form. I can assure the Committee that the SEN
self-evaluation framework will form part of the SIPs&#146; continuing
professional development. The thrust of all the professional
development for SIPs, both initial and continuing, will be to stimulate
the improvements that each school needs. In many schools those
improvements include raising the attainment of pupils with special
educational needs. That does not mean that every SIP needs the same
training. I would argue against including the requirement in the
legislation, both for technical reasons and because of the reassurance
that I have been able to provide about the nature of the
training&#151;initial and ongoing.</div>
<a name="06041833000004"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me say something about the
identification and use of school improvement partners for special
schools, which the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton
raised. He is right to say that questions need to be answered about
specific elements of work with special schools, and that they are
worthy of careful consideration. That is why we are conducting a trial
of SIPs for special schools in 26 schools under seven local
authorities. That will enable us to consider issues such as how we use
and interpret data on the achievement of the pupils, what additional
training and development might be needed for the accreditation of SIPs
for special schools, and what the most appropriate background of the
SIPs should be if they are to be effective in and credible to the
sector. The trial is being evaluated independently and I hope to be in
a position to make decisions on national roll out, informed by the
results of that evaluation, later in the summer.</div>
<a name="06041833000005"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that, in light of the
points that I have made, hon. Members will recognise that our aim in
introducing SIPs is to strengthen our commitment to ensuring successful
outcomes for all pupils, irrespective of their special needs or
disabilities, and that we are putting in place both the accreditation
and the initial and continuing professional development necessary to
achieve that aim. On the basis of those arguments, and of the technical
deficiency of the second amendment, I hope that the hon. Member for
South Holland and The Deepings will feel able to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041833000133"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I am extremely grateful for the Minister&#146;s
comprehensive response to the amendments. Let us review where we are in
terms of the sort of people who we hope will become SIPs. There seems
to be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column204" />Column number: 204</div>agreement across the Committee that the role is vital and that SIPs
should be people of wide experience and the highest quality. There is
no disagreement about the need to ensure that schools welcome them as
such and understand the role that they can play in their
improvement.</div> <a name="06041833000007"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
said at the outset, I do not think that there is much debate about the
principle. There are, however, concerns about the practice. We are
concerned about the recruitment of SIPs. The Minister was critical of
my criticism of the bureaucratic nature of the process. I referred only
to comments that have been made independently by those who have been
part of the trial process. The test of a recruitment process is that it
is effective, not that it is burdensome. It does not have to be long,
drawn out and complex to be effective. We are talking about attracting
the right people and then assessing their suitability to do the job. I
was simply warning the Minister that if she does not get that right,
she will not achieve her objective. However, I understand her
acknowledgement that the matter needs to be taken into account, so
there is little disagreement between us on that.</div>
<a name="06041833000008"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed, there seems to be less
and less disagreement about who will become SIPs. In the early days, it
was not clear that there was to be much of a limit on who might become
one. As we have moved on, we have gathered that most SIPs will be head
teachers. Indeed, the regulatory impact assessment says:</div>
<a name="06041833000128"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;SIPs should be
nationally accredited and...three quarters of an
authority&#146;s secondary SIPs should have head teacher
experience.&#148;</div><a name="06041833000009"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
went further by telling us that 85 per cent. of those people who
expressed an interest in becoming a SIP are head teachers.</div>
<a name="06041833000010"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is an assurance that the
vast bulk of people involved in this process will be head teachers.
Moreover, there is a growing consensus on the Committee that they
should have relevant local expertise. That is not to say that they will
necessarily be drawn from the locality, but the hon. Member for Brent,
East made a sensible point that having some understanding and
appreciation of the local circumstances will be critical not just to
them doing their job but to their being accepted as the critical friend
that we all hope they might be. It would be entirely inappropriate to
bring in someone who had not dealt with the challenges of a very rural
or a very urban area and expect them to persuade head teachers and
other senior managers in the school that they could be a valuable and
valued critical
friend.</div><a name="06041833000011"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041833000134"></a>Jacqui
Smith:</b> I do not want to disrupt the consensus that has
broken out, at least in the early part of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
remarks, but although I agree with him about the need to understand the
local context in which a school works, there may be some benefits in
local authorities employing SIPs who come from other areas. A SIP will
not always work with a local
school.</div><a name="06041833000012"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041833000135"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Indeed, the balance is critical. It might well be
appropriate to bring in someone who was not immediately associated with
the school, or even associated by implication with the school, but who
had 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column205" />Column number: 205</div>experience of dealing with similar challenges in a different place. It
would be much harder to persuade a school to accept the advice of
someone who had done very good work, but in a very different kind of
environment. That is the balance about which I discern the Minister
shares my concern.</div>
<a name="06041833000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">The comment made by the hon.
Member for Brent, East about her locality&#151;we can all make
similar comments about our own localities&#151;is important in terms
of the kind of work that the SIP is likely to do on the ground in a
particular school. I acknowledge what the Minister said about that.
Although in a response to an earlier intervention I mentioned that I
accepted that good people are involved in LEAs who bring much skill to
bear, some LEAs are merely coasting. There are not just coasting
schools; sometimes there are coasting authorities. Sometimes schools
are coasting because necessary action has not been taken by education
officers. In acknowledging that there are good people in all kinds of
places who might become SIPs, we must be careful that we do not
perpetuate complacency by introducing people into the process who will
not offer the kind of challenge that the Minister mentioned.</div>
<a name="06041833000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">With the assurances that the
Minister offered in respect of her determination to ensure quality and
with the absolute certainty that we will continue to press her to
ensure that that quality is delivered in practice, we can buy her
arguments on amendment No. 190. However, I am less persuaded by her
arguments on amendment No. 191. Obviously I accept her technical point
because she has an army of civil servants behind her about whom I can
only dream. That dream is likely in a few short years to become a
reality. When the Minister is on the Opposition Benches, as she will be
when that happens, or, indeed, doing another job&#151;she may return
to the classroom; who knows?&#151;she will perhaps understand.
However, I still think it is important that, to illustrate the
Committee&#146;s absolute commitment to the interests of children
with special needs, we should go a little further with the
amendment.</div> <a name="06041833000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is of
course true, as the hon. Member for South Swindon revealingly said,
that teachers receive some training in how to deal with children with
special needs. She said that &#147;an element&#148; of their
training involved children with special needs. I do not share her
instinct about those children whose progress has been inhibited by
being in special schools. She said that they would have moved
&#147;faster and further&#148; in the mainstream, but I tend to
take the view of the majority of heads and teachers who are not in this
place but doing the job, and who suggested, in the survey that she said
she did not know about, that as many as 25,000 children in mainstream
schools in England and Wales would be better off in special
schools.</div> <a name="06041833000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">The survey,
which was published in <i class="I">The Times Educational Supplement</i>, was of
a very large number of schools. More than 500 classroom teachers and
more than 200 head teachers of mainstream schools took part, so it was
not a slight investigation. I am inclined to think that many of the
children who have been integrated could have moved faster and further
had they had the kind of dedicated attention that they would have
received in special schools. I take a different view from the hon.
Lady, but perhaps she has 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column206" />Column number: 206</div>not quite broken out of the old Warnock orthodoxy that permeated
thinking and distorted policy for so
long.</div><a name="06041833000017"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041833000136"></a>Anne
Snelgrove:</b> I said that some of the children in special
schools were held back, and in my experience that is true. I am not
talking about children with severe learning difficulties, but about
some of those who attended schools such as schools for the deaf or the
blind. The education of our very own right hon. Friend the Member for
Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) was blighted by going to a school
that recognised only his disability, not his abilities. That is how I
would put it&#151;we need schools that recognise abilities, not
disabilities.</div>
<a name="06041833000018"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041833000137"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Of course it is true&#151;and the amendment does
not mean that I demur from the point&#151;that many children
integrated into mainstream schools do extremely well. We should
celebrate their progress and revere the work of the teachers who
educate them. Indeed, where the particular needs of such children can
be met without compromise to their educational opportunity or to the
life of the school and the quality of the work done there more
generally, integration should happen. If it is best for them and it is
what their parents want, children should be integrated&#151;we are at
one on that. However, when more than 200 head teachers and more than
500 classroom teachers say that they reckon that one in four of the
children integrated into their schools should not have been integrated,
we must take that seriously, must we not? I wonder whether the hon.
Member for Brent, East takes it
seriously.</div><a name="06041833000019"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041833000138"></a>Sarah
Teather:</b> I do indeed. The hon. Gentleman made some
interesting points in the early part of his speech about the need for
training for teachers. I accept his point that many teachers feel that
their training is not adequate for them to deal with all the challenges
that are presented to them, but his point is surely about the training
of teachers, not the training of SIPs. As the Minister said, the
training for SIPs concerns identifying whether certain groups of
children are being failed by the system. Providing training to the
school is an entirely different question.</div>
<a name="06041833000020"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041833000139"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> The hon. Lady is right. They are different, but
they are both important.
<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i></div><a name="06041833000021"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041833000140"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. We cannot talk through the siren sound
because <i class="I">Hansard</i> will not be able to report what is going
on.</div><a name="06041833000130"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div><a name="06041833000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041833000141"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> As the siren sounds, I shall become quieter. Many
members on the Benches opposite would rather hear the siren than hear
me. [<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members</span>: &#147;No!&#148;] My
modesty is legendary, as you know, Mr. Chope. I am the siren voice for
the army of children for whom we all seek to do our
best.</div><a name="06041833000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Brent, East is right to say that the two things are different, but
both are important. The training of teachers to deal with special needs
children is of course critical. I tell her that when I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column207" />Column number: 207</div>trained as a teacher, which was not a million years ago&#151;there are
many still teaching who trained at the same time as me&#151;I do not
remember a single element of my training that related to children with
special educational needs. In the schools where I did my teaching
practice I was given no additional support or training in respect of
such
children.</div><a name="06041833000024"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041833000142"></a>Anne
Snelgrove:</b> Things have moved on. I do not know when the
hon. Gentleman trained&#151;it must have been several decades ago. I
reassure him that there is now such
training.</div><a name="06041833000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041833000143"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I trained in the early 1980s. There will be many
teachers still teaching who trained then and before. I freely
acknowledge that many of them will have had in-service training that
will have affected their abilities and skills in that regard. Things
have indeed moved on, but it would be monstrous to imagine a
circumstance in which a head teacher, without the specialist skills and
experience that my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton identified in his short example of special education,
were to become the school improvement partner for a special school. I
do not think that that is likely to happen, but it would be monstrous
if it did. The chances of persuading the senior management team in the
special school that that person was able to offer the sort of advice
needed to improve the school&#146;s standards would be very slim
indeed.</div> <a name="06041833000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">When I spoke
initially I made a case not about special schools but about mainstream
schools. If such circumstances would be bad in mainstream schools, they
are likely to be altogether worse in the kind of special schools that
my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton mentioned.
The Minister responded by saying that guidance supports identification,
curriculum support, pastoral support, monitoring, assessment,
relationships with support structures and a variety of other things. I
welcome those assurances; it is clear that they are indicative of an
understanding of the need to ensure that such matters are at the heart
of what SIPs do and of the self-assessment process, which was also
mentioned in our short debate.</div>
<a name="06041833000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is critical that the matter
is added to the Bill, perhaps in a technically amended form. That would
send a message from the House and the Committee that we understand the
critical role of teachers in helping children who are disadvantaged by
special needs to achieve their educational potential. To do less would
be to undersell the importance of the matter. I mention again children
with emotional and behavioural difficulties, who lie at the heart of
the &#147;Every Child Matters&#148; agenda that the Government have
put at the centre of their considerations in integrating the work of
various governmental and non-governmental agencies to help children who
face the challenges about which we have
spoken.</div><a name="06041833000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I
acknowledge that the Minister has indicated that she takes this matter
seriously, and although I understand that many of the people involved
in becoming SIPs may have an appreciation and experience of special
educational needs, I believe that it is critical for us to highlight
such training, in the strongest possible terms, as being a central
requirement 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column208" />Column number: 208</div>of what we expect of SIPs working in mainstream schools with special
needs children or in special schools. For that reason, we shall press

Edward Leigh</b> (Gainsborough) (Con): I beg to move amendment
No. 347, in clause 5, page 3, line 30, at end
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(2A) In the case of
a religious school of any denomination or religion, the person employed
or engaged by a local education authority under the provisions of this
section must be of the same denomination or religion as the school to
which he is
appointed.'.</div><a name="06041833000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is probing, but covers an important subject. I tabled it to
give the Minister an opportunity to reassure those concerned about
faith schools that school improvement partners will not interfere with
or affect the ethos of those schools. I have been in touch with the
head teacher at Our Lady of Victory school, the primary school that one
of my children attends, and Paul Barber of the Catholic Education
Service. This is a useful opportunity for the Minister to reassure the
Committee. The Catholic Education Service is extremely concerned about
the possible impact of SIPs on the ethos of its schools. The issue,
therefore, is
important.</div><a name="06041833000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Denominational
schools are voluntary of course, and the whole point of them is that
the governing body should have the final say. That is particularly
important for the protection of the ethos of those schools. At the
moment, a committee of the governing body, appointed by the school,
carries out the school appraisals and appoints an external adviser.
Various mechanisms ensure that those external advisers are properly
qualified. For instance, the committee can check a person&#146;s
expertise with the Cambridge Education Associates.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column209" />Column number: 209</div><a name="06041833000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">A missive has come from the
Department saying that those external advisers, who are appointed by
the schools and usually are&#151;I would imagine&#151;of the same
denomination as the schools, will be replaced by SIPs. I would be
grateful if the Minister could make it clear that there is no question
of the SIPs having a role in changing the ethos of faith schools, and,
indeed, that local education authorities will consult the governing
bodies of faith schools to ensure that any SIPs appointed understand
the ethos and will work with the
school.</div><a name="06041833000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Generally
faith schools have a very good record, academically and in every other
way. Many are over-subscribed, particularly in the London area, but,
presumably, some underperform academically. There might therefore be a
role for what used to be an external adviser and will now be a school
improvement partner to come in and give advice to a school on how to
improve its academic performance, which may have nothing to do with its
faith ethos.</div> <a name="06041833000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
we would not want these people to come in and change the ethos. The
Minister may say that that is unlikely, but it is a well known fact
that there are many in this House and in the education world who are
fiercely opposed even to the existence of faith schools. That is not
the Minister&#146;s position and when she responds to the debate she
will no doubt make clear her commitment to these schools and that of
the Prime Minister, who sent his children to a faith school. I am sure
the Minister will say that the Government fully support the schools,
want them to expand, and that nothing concerning SIPs will affect the
ethos of the schools. However, we need a pretty strong reassurance from
her in that respect, because her remarks will be looked at very
carefully in the world of faith schools.</div>
<a name="06041833000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not suggest that the words
in this probing amendment are correct, as I tabled it in an attempt to
be reasonable and constructive. It would probably be unreasonable to
insist that a school improvement partner was of the same denomination
as the school, although when Catholic schools were inspected in the
past, the inspectors, too, were usually Catholic, but that was changed
some years ago. I may table an amendment to enable us to discuss the
matter.</div><a name="06041833000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many people
involved with faith schools are concerned about what they perceive to
be a gradual attack on their ethos, worried that it may be the thin end
of the wedge. How can we ensure that they are reassured? I suggested
that SIPs should generally be of the same denomination as the school.
For example, in a typical education authority there might be a number
of Anglican or Catholic schools and it would not be impossible to find
a school improvement partner who was a Catholic or an Anglican,
supported the ethos of faith schools and was prepared to give tough and
useful advice. However, there would be no question that they were
opposed to the ethos of those schools in any way. I understand that the
Church of England appoints roving bishops to deal with certain
parishes. Perhaps we could have roving SIPs; I do not know how they
would work. There must be some way of giving us assurances on this
important issue.</div> <a name="06041833000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have said enough, as I want to give colleagues a chance to contribute.
This is not a complex issue but it is very important and I want the
Minister to take the amendment seriously. There is little point in
having a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column210" />Column number: 210</div>debate on technical deficiencies in the amendment; it was tabled so that
we could discuss the matter and assure the outside world that nothing
we do in this Committee will affect the ethos of these very successful
schools.</div><a name="06041833000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason
they are so successful is not that they cherry-pick middle-class
students, although that charge is often made against them, but because
they have a very strong ethos that is based on their
religion.</div><a name="06041833000067"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041833000167"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> My hon. Friend makes a powerful case for faith
schools, which I strongly support. It is the clarity of purpose that
differentiates faith schools and many others that is summed up by their
ethos and we should be loth to lose it, as it benefits large numbers of
children, as I hope my hon. Friend
agrees.</div><a name="06041833000131"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="06041833000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041833000168"></a>Mr.
Leigh:</b> Yes. It is always worth sharing one&#146;s
experience. The school that my son attends, because it is a Catholic
school in inner London, attracts children of a huge range of
nationalities and many children with great difficulties. Being
Catholic, the children are Portuguese, Spanish, Italian or French and
come from all sorts of different social groups. The first language of
many is not English, but the school has extraordinary success in
binding them together and achieving first-rate academic
results.</div><a name="06041833000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The school is
oversubscribed: people want to get their children in to it. That is not
because it receives more money, or because it particularly wants to
attract middle-class children. Interestingly, however, middle-class
people are happy to get their children into the school. If one is
concerned about state education in the cities one should be concerned
about creating schools that all types of people want to go to. The
school is a success because of its ethos of love, discipline, faith and
traditional values. That very delicate mixture has been nurtured over
many years by dedicated teachers and head teachers.</div>
<a name="06041833000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">That school and many others
like it want to get on with the job that they know best. They are not
failing or coasting; they get good academic results and they do not
want somebody appointed by an local education authority to come in and
interfere in the way in which they run themselves&#151;the Minister
must be aware of that concern. If schools are failing or coasting or
there is a problem, fair enough, there is a role for external advisers.
However, those schools already have external
advisers.</div>
<a name="06041833000071"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06041833000169"></a><b class="B">Meg
Hillier</b> (Hackney, South and Shoreditch) (Lab/Co-op): I am
puzzled by the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments. Is he suggesting that
a head teacher or chair of governors of a different faith or
denomination might not be good for a school? I can give him many
examples of good people coming in to help faith schools who are of
other faiths or of none. There seems to be a contradiction in what he
says.</div>
<a name="06041833000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041833000170"></a>Mr.
Leigh:</b> I am surprised by that intervention. I said for
that very reason that this is a probing amendment. I do not suggest
that the Committee accept my amendment and therefore insist that a
school improvement partner of a faith school be of the same 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column211" />Column number: 211</div>denomination. I made it clear that it is perfectly possible for somebody
to give a school good advice without being of the same denomination. We
merely want to ensure that the SIP appointed to a faith school that
promotes family and traditional values is broadly sympathetic to the
ethos of that school. He or she does not need to be of the same
denomination.</div> <a name="06041833000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Above
all, the SIP appointed must not have a hidden agenda. I do not suggest
that everybody should approve of faith schools&#151;I know that many
people do not like them&#151;or that anybody should be forced to go
to a school that has or does not have uniforms, or one that is or is
not progressive. I am in favour of a rich mixture of schools. All that
I am saying is that, particularly in difficult areas, there are schools
that are extremely popular with parents and we should let them get on
with the job that they know best. I hope that the Minister will
reassure the Committee that SIPs will approach faith schools with a
positive attitude of mind, so as to ensure that the best go on getting
better and there is no attack on those excellent
schools.</div>
<a name="06041833000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041833000171"></a>Sarah
Teather:</b> I accept that the amendment is probing.
Nevertheless, its broad thrust is that all SIPs should be of the same
religion or denomination as the school.</div>
<a name="06041833000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">To try to define
&#147;sympathetic&#148; is deeply unhelpful. As the hon. Member for
Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier) mentioned, not all teachers
or head teachers belong to the same denomination or faith as their
school, and we should not require them to do so. Concern was expressed
in earlier sittings about social divisions and the need to ensure that
all schools that teach in the context of a particular faith understand
the wider social context in which they exist. It is desirable to have
teachers in all schools who do not necessarily represent a particular
faith or
denomination.</div><a name="06041833000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
should think about what we mean when we talk about a particular
denomination. When we say a person is a Catholic, do we mean that they
must have been baptised a Catholic, that they have taken their first
holy communion, that they have been confirmed, or that they are
practising? How Catholic do they need to be? Are we talking Opus Dei,
or   la carte, like the majority of practising
Catholics?</div><a name="06041833000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041833000172"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> The hon. Lady has not yet mentioned the word
&#147;ethos&#148;, which was key to argument made by my hon. Friend
the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh). I think that he was asking
that the person in question be sympathetic to the ethos of the
school.</div><a name="06041833000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041833000173"></a>Sarah
Teather:</b> If the hon. Gentleman sits tight, I shall get to
the word &#147;ethos&#148;
shortly.</div><a name="06041833000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
various ethoi in the Church of England. An Anglo-Catholic, someone with
an evangelical approach, and a person with a more Protestant
understanding of the Church of England&#146;s teachings may have
different views on the sacrament or the interpretation of biblical
texts that would dramatically change the ethos of their approach to
their faith and, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column212" />Column number: 212</div>in that context, their understanding and practice of their faith in
education. It is impractical to deal with
everything.</div><a name="06041833000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not all
lessons in faith schools are taught in the context of religion. It is
difficult to believe that maths lessons would be dominated by faith or
religious teaching. Perhaps in Reg Vardy&#146;s schools biology might
be dominated by particular teachings, but on the whole religion arises
in assemblies or in lessons in other subjects on the curriculum. This
amendment is deeply unhelpful and needs to be
rejected.</div><a name="06041833000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041833000174"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> I join in welcoming you to the Chair, Mr.
Chope.</div> <a name="06041833000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
sympathetic to the amendment, which my hon. Friend the Member for
Gainsborough tabled in a characteristically moderate and constructive
way. I am slightly surprised by the response of the Liberal Democrat
spokesman, because there seemed to be a vigour and vim in her remarks
that did not quite catch the mood and spirit of the amendment as my
hon. Friend intended
it.</div><a name="06041833000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree with my
hon. Friend that religious schools generally perform well. Schools of
denominations of the Christian religions and of other religions perform
well and are appreciated by parents. That is not a universal trait, but
it seems to be a tendency. One of key factors in the appreciation of
those schools by parents and in their success is the ethos that a
religion or denomination helps to establish. I should have thought that
there was a great deal of common sense in my hon. Friend&#146;s
approach, which is that the school improvement partner should at least
be sympathetic to the denomination or religion in question. I should
have thought that such an SIP would, by virtue of their sympathy, have
a better understanding of the ethos and be in a stronger position to
make a constructive criticism of the school if one were needed and, if
necessary, could challenge its performance in living up to its ethos. I
should have thought that that was a common sense approach. I should
also think that parents could have more confidence in a person of such
a nature and that the school and its governors would be more likely to
listen to them.</div><a name="06041833000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment was tabled in a moderate and attractive way and I hope that
the Minister will seek to respond to it as such, not in the rather
knee-jerk way that the Liberal Democrat spokesman
responded.</div><a name="06041833000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041833000175"></a>Mrs.
Dorries:</b> It is no secret that I am an advocate of faith
schools. I was delighted to read in <i class="I">The Times</i> recently that the
UK is to have its first Hindu school. Whenever and wherever possible, I
have educated my children in faith schools, so I can understand the
desire of Hindu parents who felt the need for such a community faith
school where they could education their children. One of the reasons I
support the Bill wholeheartedly is that it will allow groups of
parents, such as those voicing the need for the Hindu school, to have a
voice, and it will enable and empower such parents to establish faith
schools with a greater ease than before.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column213" />Column number: 213</div><a name="06041833000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the Member for
Bognor Regis and Littlehampton made the case for SIPs who have
expertise or knowledge in special needs. In particular, he spoke about
a special needs child learning to read, stressing that only a teacher
with a vocation and infinite patience would have the necessary
sensitivity and deep understanding. The same argument must be applied
to faith schools. Spirituality is the essence of all faith in whichever
God. It requires a deep understanding and openness, if not
sensitivity.</div> <a name="06041833000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
those who do not have faith, the concept is difficult to understand. It
is so difficult that, as the hon. Member for Brent, East has just
demonstrated admirably, a lack of understanding can create fear that
can cause people to criticise or ridicule those who have faith. I am
not talking about chav ridicule; I am referring to academic ridicule. I
have heard many academics be condemnatory and derisory about faith and
faith schools.</div> <a name="06041833000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Faith
schools do not exist to be insular or inward-looking, which are
criticisms often levied at them. Their purpose is to protect the young,
who are moving forward in faith, and to help one generation pass to the
next the culture and religion of that particular group. Statistics show
that, quite often, faith schools have better academic outcomes than
non-faith
schools&#151;</div><a name="06041833000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041833000176"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I have given the hon. Lady a lot of
latitude. The amendment is about school improvement partners in faith
schools, not faith schools
generally.</div><a name="06041833000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041833000177"></a>Mrs.
Dorries:</b> I support the amendment to ensure SIPs who will
have an understanding of the deep spirituality and objectives and aims
of faith schools. I am worried that clause 5 might be used as a tool to
limit spirituality and how it is taught in faith schools by pairing
those schools with SIPs who do not understand or empathise with their
aims. The Minister said that 26 SIPs have been allocated in 27
authorities.</div><a name="06041833000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041833000178"></a>Jacqui
Smith:</b> <i class="I">indicated
dissent.</i></div><a name="06041833000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041833000179"></a>Mrs.
Dorries:</b> I wrote it down as it was said&#151;perhaps it
could be checked. Which of those SIPs were allocated to faith schools?
Has an assessment been made of the impact of SIPs on faith schools and
on how they will work with faith schools? Will the Minister assure us
that the ethos of faith schools and the way in which they operate and
imbue children with their spirituality, religion and culture will not
be affected by the allocation of SIPs who do not share that faith,
understanding or
spirituality?</div><a name="06041833000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041833000180"></a>Jacqui
Smith:</b> I shall respond to the amendment in the spirit in
which it was tabled. Even the has the hon. Member for Gainsborough
acknowledged that strict interpretation of the amendment, which would
impose a narrow requirement on local authorities, would limit the range
of SIPs that could be allocated to a particular school. It would go
against some of the arguments about flexibility that were made to a
previous group of amendments. However, I recognise 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column214" />Column number: 214</div>that the hon. Gentleman tabled the amendment as a means to probe the
relationship between SIPs and faith
schools.</div><a name="06041833000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can give at
least some reassurance. First, diversity has always been a major
feature of the English school system, and the present Government, far
from seeking to iron out that diversity, are keen to develop and make
use of it for the benefit of all pupils. That is part of what we hope
to achieve through the Bill. We expect all SIPs, whatever their
professional backgrounds and personal convictions, to understand that
and the way in which it is represented in the school
system.</div><a name="06041833000132"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="06041833000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">We expect all
school improvement partners in their work to be responsive to the
individual circumstances and characteristics, including religious
characteristics, of the schools with which they work. The national
assessment for people who seek accreditation as SIPs, about which we
have talked when debating previous groups of amendments, stresses that
expectation. It is designed to withhold accreditation from anyone who
might work with a school without taking account of its ethos and other
features, and it is therefore a key requirement of a SIP that he or she
should be responsive to the ethos and context of schools of any
type.</div><a name="06041833000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">At national
level the Department has worked with the representative organisations
of faith schools to make sure that Government policy developments take
account of their concerns and to keep them abreast of developments. For
example, my officials have discussed SIPs with the National Society for
Promoting Religious Education, which is the education body for Church
of England maintained schools, and with the Catholic Education Service.
SIPs and other aspects of the &#147;new relationship with
schools&#148; programme will be discussed at a meeting of the
consultative group that we convene for representatives of all faith
groups.</div> <a name="06041833000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those links
ensure general understanding between the faith organisations and the
Government, but of course for the SIP programme there is a specific
additional benefit: we are able to encourage faith organisations to
recommend that head teachers of faith schools apply for SIP
accreditation. That led the Catholic Education Service, for example, to
issue a note about SIP accreditation in one of its regular
communications with head teachers of Roman Catholic schools. I hope
that that will ensure the involvement of more high-quality head
teachers and more head teachers who are likely to have first-hand
understanding of the characteristics of faith
schools.</div><a name="06041833000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are asking local authorities, in their deployment and management of
SIPs, to pay attention to the preferences as well as the needs of
individual schools. In some cases those preferences may relate to
SIPs&#146; religious beliefs, although as I explained in the debate
on amendments Nos. 61 and 63 the choice of a school improvement partner
for a school rests ultimately with the school&#146;s maintaining
authority, because the SIP is part of the school&#146;s formal
external accountability mechanism. Therefore, although discussion is
appropriate, a veto or a choice by a school would not
be.</div><a name="06041833000099"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041833000181"></a>Mr.
Leigh:</b> I am very pleased with what the Minister has said
so far. She used the word &#147;responsive&#148;, which 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column215" />Column number: 215</div>is important. Does she also agree that a SIP appointed to a faith school
should, without having to be of the same denomination, be broadly
sympathetic to the concept of the faith
school?</div><a name="06041833000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041833000182"></a>Jacqui
Smith:</b> The hon. Gentleman is pushing me to go slightly
further than I have gone. I think that I made it clear that we expect
all SIPs going through the accreditation process to be aware of the
significance of diversity in the English education system and to be
sympathetic to the diverse ethoi and religious characteristics of
schools, so that they understand how such features affect a school.
However, it would be difficult to go further and to expect a local
authority, for example, to collect and maintain information about the
religious convictions of its school improvement partners, or to
determine their employment on that basis.</div>
<a name="06041833000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I have gone far
enough to reassure the hon. Gentleman that we recognise the important
contribution that faith schools make to the education system and that
we have been willing to work alongside representatives of faith
organisations to ensure that we recognise their concerns and the
relevant issues as we develop the new relationship with schools policy
and the SIPs
policy.</div><a name="06041833000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041833000183"></a>Mr.
Leigh:</b> I am very grateful for what the Minister has said.
This has been a useful short debate and we have made progress. As she
knows, there has been concern among some head teachers and in the
Catholic Education Service, but we have received some reassurances from
her. We know that the Minister believes that there should be a rich
diversity of schools; we all believe that. We know, as we have
presumably always known, that the Bill is designed to achieve that. She
has said today that she expects SIPs to understand that, and therefore,
presumably, not to have their own agenda. It would be wrong for a SIP
to have an agenda either in favour of or against a particular type of
school.</div> <a name="06041833000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
said that she wanted SIPs to be responsive to schools&#146;
individual characteristics. I understand that she does not want to go
so far as to say in upcoming discussions that particular schools should
have a veto or that local education authorities should have resources
to investigate a SIP&#146;s background, but she used an interesting
phrase. I hope that <i class="I">Hansard</i> has an accurate record of her
response to me. I think that she said that she would expect SIPs to be
sympathetic to the religious characteristics of faith schools. I have
achieved quite a lot today, and I am happy with what we have achieved,
and so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041833000186"></a>Mr.
Chaytor:</b> I am pleased to speak to the amendments,
particularly to amendments Nos. 183 to 185, which are probing
amendments designed to elicit the Minister&#146;s response to clause
6 on local authority functions respecting recreation. I hope that the
debate will be slightly less controversial than the debate on probing
amendment No. 347.</div> <a name="06041833000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
welcome the provisions in clause 6 that will strengthen and clarify
such functions and update the provisions of the Education Act 1996.
Local authorities&#146; role in providing recreational services for
young people is more important now than ever, especially in the context
of antisocial behaviour, a growing concern that all Committee members
have experienced. It is indisputably one of the most striking social
phenomena in the United Kingdom that for the past two to three years or
perhaps longer, as the level of serious crime has fallen, the level of
unpleasant, unacceptable antisocial behaviour&#151;particularly but
not only among young people&#151;has increased. It could be argued
that there is a link between the long-term decline in funding for youth
services, such as the provision of community recreation facilities, and
the declining capacity of some young people to occupy themselves
creatively and constructively without resorting to drugs, alcohol,
violence or personal abuse. That is the context in which clause 6 is
particularly
welcome.</div><a name="06041833000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
reservation about clause 6 is that it does not draw a sufficient link
between local authorities&#146; responsibility to provide
recreational services for young people and curriculum activities in
schools. We need to forge a stronger link between what individual
schools wish to provide for their young people as part of the national
curriculum and wider extra-curricular activities and what services and
facilities exist outside the school and need to be provided by local
authorities. We have not yet forged that
link.</div><a name="06041833000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall make
four brief points. With luck, I shall make them before we break for
lunch, to provide a convenient point from which to continue the debate
this afternoon.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column217" />Column number: 217</div><a name="06041833000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">London&#146;s
success in securing the 2012 Olympic games gives the UK a unique,
once-in-a-lifetime&#151;arguably a
once-in-a-century&#151;opportunity to encourage vastly greater
numbers of young people to take an interest in sport. The Government
recognise that and have already brought significant levels of new
investment into sport. I want to reinforce the absolute importance of
using the Olympic bid as the hook to transform attitudes to sport and
physical activity of a whole generation of young
people.</div><a name="06041833000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The current
requirement in our schools is a minimum of two hours a week of sport
and physical education. I am not sure that that is enough. We need to
build on it, and strengthening local authorities&#146;
responsibilities will be a small
encouragement.</div><a name="06041833000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041833000187"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> The hon. Gentleman refers to the minimum two hours a
week of sport. Does he have a feeling of what proportion of schools are
achieving
that?</div><a name="06041833000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041833000188"></a>Mr.
Chaytor:</b> I do not have a feeling of that, but the hon.
Gentleman asks an important question. It is something that we should
seek to flush out from the Minister. It is important to get an accurate
assessment, not just a feeling, of how many schools are fulfilling that
requirement and how many are falling short. Let us bear in mind that it
is a bare minimum requirement. If we are to transform attitudes among
our young people, two hours a week is not really enough. Of course, the
two hours a week in school needs to be supplemented by a number of
hours outside school. That is where the clause comes
in.</div><a name="06041833000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second point is
that within the national curriculum, to my recollection, there is an
intention that all young people will have learned to swim by the age of
11. I am not sure that we have yet achieved that. My feeling is that we
are some way short of it, but it is again important to identify
precisely the levels of achievement of young people. It is not just an
issue of recreation and pleasurable physical activity; it can be an
issue of life or death in certain extreme circumstances. The Olympics
give us an excellent opportunity to strengthen the role of swimming in
our schools.</div><a name="06041833000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly,
I wish to draw attention to the report of the Select Committee on
Education and Skills published last year entitled &#147;Education
Outside the Classroom&#148;. It contains a number of positive
recommendations to strengthen the extra-curricular work done by
schools, and I hope that it has contributed to turning the tide in
favour of a much more positive attitude towards taking children outside
the school, not only on longer-term expeditions but using the immediate
environment as the content of educational experience. One or two of the
amendments in this group refer to that matter. We need to open a much
bigger debate on the way in which the immediate environment outside the
school, school visits to places of interest, outward bound centres and,
in certain circumstances, overseas visits, can enrich the curriculum
and young people&#146;s
experience.</div><a name="06041833000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041833000189"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> In talking about the important role of sport in
schools, the hon. Gentleman draws attention to the amount of time that
is available in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column218" />Column number: 218</div>curriculum. Will he also say a word about access to facilities? Many
school playing fields have been sold, not only under the present
Government, but under previous Governments, and I suspect that public
open spaces are declining. Many houses are being built with small or
non-existent gardens, and the chances of children accessing public or
other open space to engage in sport seem to be less than they once
were.</div><a name="06041833000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06041833000190"></a>Mr.
Chaytor:</b> That is correct. I stress that far fewer playing
fields have been sold off under the present Government than under the
Conservatives, because the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column219" />Column number: 219</div>criteria for selling them off have been tightened, but the hon.
Gentleman makes an important point. We should also point out that in
every suburban housing estate, the streets in which children could at
one time play freely have been completely occupied by their
parents&#146; 4x4 vehicles. We need to look more carefully at the
question of land use
planning.</div><a name="06041833000126"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">It being
