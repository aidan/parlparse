<P>
<H5>1.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Maclennan </B>(Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross): I beg to move amendment No. 81, in page 8, leave out lines 6 and 7.
<P>
The amendment would delete subsection (1)(a), which allows an authority to charge for informing an applicant whether information could be the subject of a discretionary disclosure. It does not affect the authority's ability to charge for providing such information.
<P>
We discussed the matter on a similar amendment to clause 8(1); on that occasion the Government were not responsive to the points made. However, they recommended this amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Greenway </B>(Ryedale): I welcome the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department, the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Mr. Lock) to the Committee. We understand why he is here. He is the lucky one because he is in the warmth, comfort and good spirit of this constructive Committee, while his colleague, the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. Mike O'Brien), is left battling on the Floor of the House where, had I been able to split myself in half, I too would have been. The choice was mine, and here I am, but the depletion of our ranks suggests that there was not much choice in the matter.
<P>
I am anxious to make progress this afternoon, and I can tell the Parliamentary Secretary that the issue of whether people should have to pay to be told that information exists, but that they cannot have it, was raised in our debate on clause 8. We concluded that it was untenable, and would add insult to injury, if, when an individual asked a public authority for information, it responded by saying, ``Well, you have to pay a fee,'' and when the fee was paid the authority told that individual, ``Well, we're prepared to tell you that we've got it, but you can't have it.'' In such circumstances, if a constituent of mine or of the Parliamentary Secretary were involved, we would not be surprised if he turned up at our weekly advice clinic.
<P>
The Under-Secretary showed some sympathy with that point of view. He said that he would consider whether and to what extent the Bill could accommodate the problem. There are some circumstances in which it may, indeed, involve a public authority in a great amount of work to ascertain whether it has the information; having done so, it may then reconsider the matter and feel that it should not disclose that information because, exercising its discretion in the public interest, it decides that the case for not disclosing outweighs that for disclosing.
<P>
I have reflected on the matter at length since our previous debate and I believe that in such circumstances the public authority derives some benefit from having been asked for information. It may take time for the authority to discover that it has what is required, but at least it has the opportunity to exercise discretion and not to release it. In such circumstances, it would be wrong to charge the individual for being informed that the information exists but is not to be released. It is a matter of striking the right balance.
<P>
The amendment does not bear all five names, including those of the Liberal Democrat and Conservative home affairs spokesmen, by accident. The right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Mr. Maclennan) and I tabled the amendment independently. The order of the names on the amendment paper reflects the timing of visits to the Public Bill Office. Sometimes one party tables an amendment and members of another party add their names to it, but that is not the case with this amendment. We concluded independently that subsection (1)(a) should be deleted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Day </B>(Cheadle): No collusion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> There was no collusion. I am surprised that the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) looks perplexed. My point adds fuel to the argument that this provision should be changed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mark Fisher </B>(Stoke-on-Trent, Central): I, too, welcome my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary to our deliberations. We look forward to benefiting from the clarity of his legal mind. He might have been perplexed by the last comments of the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway), but it has been a constant refrain of our proceedings that the hon. Gentleman is slow to table amendments. He has repeatedly had to explain why Conservative amendments follow those tabled by the Liberal Democrats or myself. He should not worry. I was not perplexed but amused by his anxiety, which possibly says something about the fear that his senior spokesman, the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe), instils in people's minds.
<P>
It might help my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary to know some of the background. Just as the curious anxiety of the Conservative Opposition has been a refrain during our deliberations, so have the worries, concerns and, frankly, complaints by both Government and Opposition members of the Committee about the tone of the Bill, which is apparent in subsection (1)(a). When a decision has to be made that affects the balance between the rights of an applicant and the rights of a public body, the Bill is often friendlier to the public body than to the applicant. Simple matters, such as amending the Bill so that public authorities are obliged to assist an applicant to make a request orderly and answerable, have been resisted by my hon. Friend the Under Secretary. I am sure that my hon. Friend's brief also tells him to resist this amendment.
<P>
It is baffling to Committee members that the Bill should take a tone of passive hostility towards an applicant. Natural justice dictates that it is ridiculous to charge for telling someone that information exists but cannot be provided. It is fair enough to charge for information that has to be found, retrieved and put into a form that answers a question. Everyone concedes that that needs a charging regime, but it is not common sense to tell a member of the public that an authority has the right to charge for the onerous duty of merely saying whether information exists. That is a terribly small point but it is indicative of the colour and tone of the Bill.
<P>
The Bill does not seem to be on the side of the applicant. The Government are not saying, ``We're really proud of producing this legislation. We want it to work. We want people to have access to information when there is a proper case and it is in the public interest.'' I laud the Government for introducing the Bill, but its niggardly and surly tone puts us in danger of spiking the public's gratitude. I fear that the provision is another example of that attitude, which we may have to discuss time and again during our consideration of the Bill.
<P>
Such provisions are the most difficult to amend, as changes to them must be considered moment by moment. They are part of a colour wash that is spread through the Bill, rather than the result of a specific judgment that others think is wrong. We have seen one or two other examples of such judgments in other clauses, and we shall consider more. I am speaking, however, about a tone that applies throughout the Bill and will be self defeating in trying to achieve what the Government want. They want the Bill to open up the process of government and to excite the public about the possibilities that it provides. They should be saying, ``We're on your side, and, unlike previous Governments, we want you to have the information if it is proper and not exempt,'' but provisions dealing with little matters may undermine that good intention, limit the Bill's effectiveness and make it more difficult to put the proposals into practice.
<P>
I am sure that my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary has a brief that tells him to ``resist, resist, resist'', but I hope that when he goes back to ministerial discussions with my hon. Friend the Under Secretary and my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, he will be aware that, although the matter is small, it is indicative of a general tone in the Bill that is the subject of concern among hon. Members who want the legislation to work and to be effective.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (Mr. David Lock):</B> It is a pleasure to be here. I apologise to you, Mr. O'Hara, and to the Committee for not attending earlier sittings. I was unable to do so, as I was not in the country. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Ryedale and to my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central for their comments, and I appreciate their kindness in welcoming me to the Committee. I hope that they will bear with me if I speak about matters dealt with in sittings at which I was not present.
<P>
As the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross explained, the amendment would prevent a public authority from charging an applicant for telling him that information is held, if the fact that information is held is exempt from clause 1. A public authority is required to disclose whether it holds information that is sought unless the requirement does not arise by virtue of part II, or the cost of determining whether it holds the information would exceed the appropriate limit set out in regulations.
<P>
If an authority is required to disclose whether it holds information, any charge will be made according to regulations made under clause 11. The provision that the amendment seeks to change will come into play only when an authority can neither confirm nor deny whether it holds the information and provisions in part II apply, or when the cost of determining whether it holds the information exceeds the limit, which is expected to be set at £500.
<P>
The regulations will specify that the marginal costs of locating and finding information can be charged to the applicant. That deals with the point made by the hon. Member for Ryedale and to some extent with that made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central. Any member of the public who makes a request for information must recognise that he or she is inviting an authority to conduct a certain amount of work to provide an answer. Whatever answer is made, the charge will be made not so much for the answer but for the work that the authority has undertaken to provide it.
<P>
In most cases, the cost of determining whether information is held will be minimal and no charge—or at least only a minimal charge—will be made. If, exceptionally, the cost of determining whether an authority holds information is significant, it is right that the applicant should bear some part of it. That cost would not otherwise disappear into the ether but would fall on the remaining services of the Government body in question and thereby restrict its activity to carry out its other statutory functions. As the hon. Member for Ryedale rightly said, a balance must be struck between cost to applicants and to taxpayers in general.
<P>
<H5>1.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In respect of those matters and others, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has said that the Government will consider whether points made in debate can be properly reflected in the fee regulations, which are the proper means of setting the balance between the interests of applicants and of public bodies.
<P>
I understand that he hopes that the Committee will see the draft regulations in a few weeks' time.
<P>
At present, the Government believe that the balance set in the Bill gives generous subsidies to applicants and that the taxpayer should not be asked to bear a greater burden than is currently proposed. I take the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central about the tone of the Bill, but I draw his attention to the word ``may'' in clause 14(1), which is an enabling provision rather than a requirement. I suspect that a good deal of his concern relates to the balance between assisting members of the public and other considerations, and the application of the provision to all public bodies, irrespective of their identities. He was also concerned about whether codes of practice could provide greater flexibility and be properly toned to meet the needs of public bodies. There are, however, great differences between what we would expect of a major corporation and of a primary school. If he accepts that, I hope that he will accept that flexibility is required and that the code of practice and not the Bill is the right place for such provisions.
<P>
With those assurances, I hope that the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross will ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I should in my earlier remarks have welcomed the Parliamentary Secretary to the Committee on behalf of my hon. Friends and myself I do so now.
<P>
I have listened with attention to the Parliamentary Secretary's remarks and I welcome the Government's intention to review the balance between the individual applicant and the taxpayer in meeting the cost of applications. That is dealt with in the regulations, which we hope to see before too long. I would, however, prefer the matter to be dealt with in the Bill. The Government's approach appears once again to militate against the general thrust of the Bill, which should be to make information more readily obtainable. An authority seeking to charge for informing an applicant whether it holds information that could be the subject of discretionary disclosure will incur costs that depend on its own efficiency. It is hard to argue that authorities could not usually disclose such information without great difficulty, so inability to do so will tend to suggest inefficiency within their own operations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that when public bodies can charge they tend to do so? That is my experience, and although it may appear a rather world-weary and cynical view, I suspect that he will share it. We have been in the House a long time, and our experience tells us to be wary and chary of such matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I cannot believe that a permissive power of the sort in question, which benefits Treasury coffers, would be lightly disregarded by authorities considering whether to exercise their discretion to charge.
<P>
The costs of retrieval should usually be minimal if the information is properly stored and accessible. Information to which the public have a right of access should not be kept beyond easy reclamation by the authority responsible. The Parliamentary Secretary did not vouchsafe an example of a situation in which conforming with the requirement would be extremely expensive. Some hon. Members may be able to think of some, but they do not spring readily to mind. The subsection is oppressive and I would prefer it to be deleted. However, as the Government intend to return to the substance of the issue in discussions on the regulations, I fear that we may have to leave it at that today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I was pondering whether the right hon. Gentleman intended to withdraw the amendment, or whether, with our meagre resources, he might want to press the matter to a vote. Hence the concern for my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh), who is on another Standing Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I am loth to have the matter finally decided today in the light of what the Parliamentary Secretary has said about the shaping of his view of this matter. His mature consideration of the issue will have to be reviewed later. It seems improbable that we can take the argument much further today, so I hope that the hon. Member for Ryedale will support me when I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> The clause allows a public authority to charge a fee for the disclosure of information under the discretionary disclosure provisions of clause 13. The level of the fee is to be determined according to the regulations and I have made a commitment to consider the points that were raised in the debate, in the context of those regulations.
<P>
Subsection (3) provides that where another enactment specifies a level of fee, that will prevail. Clearly, the policy considerations that give rise to precise charging mechanisms under another enactment should not be overridden by the general purposes of the Bill.
<P>
It is right that the public should have access to information at a reasonable cost, but in most circumstances it is also right to charge a fee to discourage the frivolous exercise of that right. It is Government policy that fees should relate only to the marginal cost of providing information and we intend the regulations to specify that. The provisions need to remain, with a framework for more general aspects under clause 13.
<P>
Question accordingly agreed to.
<P>
Clause 14 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 15</center></H4>
<H4><center>Refusal of request</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 82, in page 8, line 30, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(d) describes the right to apply to the Commissioner for a decision under section 50'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would require authorities, when refusing a request on the ground that the information was exempt, to notify the applicant of a right of appeal to the commissioner. I am surprised that the Bill does not codify such a provision. Subsection (1) requires the authority to tell the applicant that information has been refused, to specify the relevant exemption and to state why it applies, but no duty is imposed to tell applicants that if they are dissatisfied they can challenge the decision by appeal to the commissioner. That is common practice in freedom of information laws in other countries. In Ireland, the authority must tell the applicant of his right of appeal when it acknowledges the request, which could be before a decision to release the information has been made. The Government might say that that is best left for the code of practice, but it should be in the Bill. We are trying not to obfuscate or obscure the rights that it contains. There should be a right of appeal and applicants should be told of its existence.
<P>
I, too, deeply regret the tenor of the Bill, which was mentioned by the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central. It is far from trumpeting the public's rights. Instead, procedural difficulties, caveats, exemptions and qualifications obscure the Bill's clear purpose. That may seem a relatively modest consideration, but it could be important to members of the public who are not familiar with dealing with a public authority. They may be anxious to know what their rights are and how they should make an approach.
<P>
I remind the Parliamentary Secretary that, under the code of practice, the ombudsman has taken authorities to task for not properly revealing to applicants that there is a right of appeal. In case A.36/99, which was reported in paper HC 21 of December 1999, the ombudsman roundly condemned the restrictive attitude of the Home Office immigration service towards the release of a paper that it classed as internal. The applicant wanted to know whether her statement had been properly recorded. The ombudsman decided that it was possible to extract the relevant sentences and that the date of the report should have been released. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``They should also have mentioned the appeal process available to her under the Code.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If we are to foster a new culture of openness, there is no case for not including the provision in the Bill. As the Bill will be more familiar to public authorities than to the public, that will help to induce the change of culture to which the Government are nominally committed.
<P>
<H5>2 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> It is inconceivable that a public authority would not provide the information to an applicant; the question is whether it should be in the Bill, and how it is to be enforced.
<P>
I have much sympathy with what the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross said, but I am willing to listen to the Parliamentary Secretary's explanation of why it was not in the Bill as drafted and how he thinks that it will be accommodated. I do not want to be hard on the Minister; I understand that he needs time to familiarise himself with some of the issues in the Bill.
<P>
If the amendment were accepted, the Bill would require the public authority to give the applicant a notice that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``describes the right to apply to the Commissioner for a decision under section 50''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is important, because clause 50(5) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``A decision notice''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
it is given to the applicant by the commissioner when she has taken a decision—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``must contain particulars of the right of appeal conferred by section 56.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is half a loaf—the bottom half. I am willing to be persuaded by the Parliamentary Secretary, but at the very least I hope that he will confirm that the Government intend, by whatever mechanism, that public authorities should have an obligation, not an option, to do what amendment No. 82 would require.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross for raising this important issue, but his objection is misconceived. Under clause 50(2)(a) the commissioner will have to consider whether an applicant has exhausted a public body's internal complaints procedures before coming to her. One matter that the commissioner must consider under clause 50(2)(a) is whether the complainant has exhausted any complaints procedure
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``which is provided for by the public authority in conformity with the code of practice under section 44.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If we made the amendment requiring the reference to the commissioner to be included with the notice, it would merely result in a large number of appeals to the commissioner, which would be dismissed, because the internal complaints procedure had not been followed.
<P>
The code of practice to be laid before Parliament under clause 44 must contain provisions relating to procedures for dealing with complaints. Those are best set out in a code of practice as the commissioner can interpret a code flexibly, according to the circumstances of the case. Flexibility on the issue is important, because the assistance that a Department should give to an individual might differ, for example, from what a general practitioner should give to an international drugs company. The code will provide that authorities should give information about how to complain about decisions that they have taken under the Bill—including details of the internal complaints procedure, which will vary from one authority to another—and, should that complaint fail, how to make a complaint to the commissioner. If we enshrine such matters in statute, flexibility is lost and the provision will either impose a serious regulatory burden on small businesses, such as general practitioners, or will be of little use to individuals trying to breach the bureaucracy of a large Department.
<P>
I agree with the right hon. Gentleman that it may be worth considering whether the notice informing someone that a request is denied should point towards the next step in asserting his or her right: invocation of the internal complaints procedure, which is necessary before applying to the commissioner. I ask him to allow the Government time to reflect on whether it is more appropriate to embody that idea in the Bill or, together with clear guidance, to include it in the code of practice. I invite him to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I was interested in my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary's reply. His main point, about wanting to avoid reference to the commissioner of items for which the appeal process had not been completed, is a good and serious one. However, it would not be beyond the wit of parliamentary draftsmen to reconcile that with the amendment, simply by inserting at the end a phrase such as ``once all internal and other procedures have been completed''.
<P>
I am glad that my hon. Friend intends to consider the matter further, but would like a more positive assurance that he will use his best offices in search of a solution. Rather ironically, in his response to the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross, he has given in miniature an example of exactly what we are discussing. He gave a fair response, but had he been sympathetic he could have found a way—and I hope that he will—to reconcile the right hon. Gentleman's point with his own fair and interesting immediate refutation. I hope that he will be rather more proactive about the matter and see that it is wrong not to help people to become aware of their rights.
<P>
The incident from the ombudsman's report that the right hon. Gentleman cited was amazing. It is rather worrying that a Home Office official was responsible. Mistakes can be made, but that shows that the amendment is necessary. Public bodies should be under an obligation, set out in the Bill, to be more friendly towards applicants and to explain that if they cannot provide what is asked for, and after internal complaints procedures have been completed, there is the right of appeal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I assure my hon. Friend that I shall reflect carefully on what he has said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I echo the comments of the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central about the fairness of the Parliamentary Secretary's first point in answer to my argument. I readily acknowledge that it would be unfortunate if the general public inferred that the reference to a right of appeal to the commissioner was deliberately or accidentally obscuring the right to have the matter handled by the internal processes of the authority. I agree with the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central that that could easily be taken into account in the Bill.
<P>
The substance of the amendment is that the public should know from the beginning, not after the processes of inquiry have rambled on, and whatever the internal arrangements, that there is a backstop appeal. It should be possible to draft an amendment to encompass the valid points made by the Minister and to achieve that objective.
<P>
The position is not hypothetical and I do not refer to just one occasion. The Home Office, alone of all Departments, has been taken to task for failing to abide by the code. Three times during the past year, the ombudsman had to rebuke that Department for failing to comply with it. Even while the Department was discussing the Bill it was offending against its very spirit. For such reasons, it is not sensible to rely wholly on the regulations, which is a fragile defence of a right. I hope that the Minister will reconsider the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Without wishing to lead the right hon. Gentleman, does he agree that his example demonstrates the weakness and fragility of relying on the code? The common position of Ministers' resistant briefs is that that is covered by the code, but the examples given by the right hon. Gentleman demonstrate that the code has not been a strong and ready support and there is no reason to suppose that it will be in future. We need to be sceptical about relying on the code and, when it is not difficult to do so, such matters should be in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I wholly accept that. The Government have spoken with considerable power on a number of occasions about the importance of changing the culture of the way in which things are done and they must take account of the difficulty of changing the culture of authorities. I was not trying to lambast the Home Office when I drew attention to the three instances, but it is striking that the Home Office, which is the lead Department in changing the culture, should itself fall so short. It would strengthen the Government's hand in changing the culture if such matters were in the Bill. People would not have to be reminded about them because they would be the law of the land.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The right honourable Gentleman cites three examples, but any decision under clause 15(1) to refuse information by relying on an exemption in part II, or because the information is exempt, would be a serious judgment. The Parliamentary Secretary told us that it would be rarely used and that the presumption would be in favour of disclosure, so the decision will presumably be taken at a senior level within a Department. One wonders to what extent the complaints procedure would produce a different result.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> The internal procedure may not be likely to produce a different result, but it would fortify the case for reminding people at the beginning of the process of their right ultimately to take the matter to the commissioner. I wholly accept the point of the hon. Member for Ryedale, but I think that the Minister was trying to be helpful in saying that the Government would reconsider the matter. I did not think that he would confine it to regulations. With that understanding, and I hope that I have understood him right, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<H5>2.15 pm</H5>

<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 83, in page 8, line 39, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`within such time as is reasonable in the circumstances'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`promptly and in any event not later than the twentieth working day following the date of receipt'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 84, in page 8, line 40, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, and in this section ``date of receipt'' has the same meaning as in section 9(5)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> The amendments would require authorities to notify applicants of the decision not to make a discretionary disclosure within 20 working days instead of the unspecified reasonable time permitted in subsection (3).
<P>
We heard considerable argument on the generality of this point earlier and I do not wish our proceedings to be unnecessarily protracted. Therefore, I am minded not to rehearse the arguments yet again, simply to invite the Parliamentary Secretary to respond favourably.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> The amendments would require a notice on a decision on discretionary disclosures given under clause 13 to be given within 20 working days of receipt. The amendment is related, as the hon. Gentleman rightly noted, to amendment No. 80 to clause 13. The arguments against the amendment are much the same as the arguments against amendment No. 80, and I am unable to accept it.
<P>
The Bill currently allows an authority up to 20 working days to reach a decision under clause 1(1 ) in order to decide whether the information requested is exempt. If the authority decides that the information is exempt, clause 13 requires it to make a further decision on whether to exercise its discretion to disclose, taking into account all the circumstances of the case and the desirability to communicate exempt information to the applicant, where the public interest in disclosure outweighs the public interest in maintaining the exemption. Clause 13(6) requires that this decision be made within such time as is reasonable in the circumstances.
<P>
There are good reasons for not specifying a time limit for decisions under clause 13. First, it is important to note that two distinct steps are involved. In making a decision under clause 13, an authority must have already determined that the information is exempt. While this decision must be made promptly, it is conceivable that it could take up much of the 20 days allowed by the Bill. For example, the authority may wish to consult those to whom the information relates or who would be likely to be affected by the disclosure, and the Secretary of State's code of practice under clause 44 will contain guidance for authorities in such consultations. In this case the amendment would leave no time for decisions under clause 13 to be taken.
<P>
Clause 13 also requires the authority to take all the circumstances of the case into account in balancing the public interest. Such a decision may be far more complex than the original decision as to whether the information is exempt. It is therefore impossible to specify a time limit for taking such decisions, because much will depend on the circumstances of each case. However, the Bill provides that the decision must be taken within a reasonable period in the circumstances.
<P>
The amendment would therefore not only disadvantage authorities by imposing an impractical time limit on them, but would disadvantage applicants and others affected by disclosure by causing decisions on the public interest to be taken hastily. If time is short, authorities will be more likely to withhold information than disclose it, on the basis that where a matter has not been properly considered it is better to be safe than sorry. Alternatively, authorities might decide not to consult those affected by disclosure on the basis that it would take too long, which would be equally inappropriate. That is why clause 13(6) provides for a decision to be taken within a reasonable time, in order to ensure that decisions are taken soundly.
<P>
I recognise the concern behind the amendment. To prevent authorities from stalling, however, the Bill gives the Information Commissioner power to issue an enforcement notice under clause 52(2), which requires the authority to make a decision in accordance with clause 13 within the time set out in the notice. Therefore, safeguards already exist in the Bill. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will accept that that is a far more practical and realistic approach. On that basis, I invite him to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> My first general point is that it is quite difficult to resist a clause that expresses that something should be done in a reasonable time. It sounds unreasonable not to accept it. The Committee had a good argument on the matter under a previous amendment, and it would be fruitless to repeat it. The Minister's instructions were firm, and, furthermore, I do not want to give the impression that he does not have a point. His point is worthy of consideration, and a tight timetable is a considerable advantage. The enforcement arrangements for the commissioner look, in some ways, like a sledgehammer to crack a nut. I hope that they will be used as an in terrorem power—not necessarily used with frequency, and not necessarily requiring to be used at all. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 85, in page 9, line 3, leave out `stating that fact' and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(a) stating that fact; and
<P>
(b) where appropriate (except in relation to a case to which section 12(1) applies) advising the applicant of the steps which he may take to make the request one with which the authority is able to comply, or offering to provide such advice; and
<P>
(c) describing the right to apply to the Commissioner for a decision under section 50'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 64, in page 9, line 5, after `l2' insert `(1)'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> This is a slightly more complicated matter. Amendment No. 82 sought to require authorities to tell applicants of their right of appeal when a request is refused on the grounds that the information is exempt. Amendment No. 85 deals with information that must be given when requests are refused on other grounds.
<P>
Clause 15(5) deals with the information that authorities must give when refusing a request on cost grounds under clause 11, or because it is regarded as vexatious or identical or substantially similar to a previous request. It requires the authority merely to give the applicant the reasons for the refusal. The amendment would require authorities to tell the applicants of their right to complain to the commissioner. It would also require authorities, where appropriate, to tell the applicant what he or she should do to make a request that can be answered. That would apply not only to the maker of a vexatious request but to persons presumably concerned to disrupt the working of the authority rather than obtain information.
<P>
Depending on circumstances, the duty to offer advice could involve a number of things. If the request exceeded the cost limit, it might involve explaining how the request can be brought within that limit. If the request were substantially similar to a previous request, it might stipulate what reasonable interval the applicant should allow before applying again. That is another example of trying to make the process of seeking information from an authority more consumer-friendly and genuinely comprehensible. Perhaps these practices and procedures will become more widely understood, but it will take time. The amendment would assist the learning process not only in this particular case, but generally.
<P>
Amendment No. 64 would provide for circumstances in which, under clause 15(6), authorities are not required to tell applicants why their requests have been refused, if the refusal relates to clause 12 and the reason given relates to a previous refusal. However, clause 12 will apply to vexatious requests and requests that are refused because they are identical to, or substantially similar to, previous requests. The amendment would waive a duty to give reasons for a vexatious request, as specified under clause 12(1) only.
<P>
I commend both amendments to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> Amendment No. 85 would specify the requirements on every public body to which the Bill refers to provide, or to offer to provide, assistance on how an applicant should reformulate a request that was refused because it exceeded the cost threshold under clause 11, or because, as the right hon. Gentleman has accepted, it was identical or substantially similar to a previous request by the same applicant. In theory, the Government have no problem with what the amendment seeks to deliver. Indeed, we agree with the Campaign for the Freedom of Information and the right hon. Gentleman, who flagged up the importance of advice on reformulating requests that have exceeded the cost threshold. My concern is not whether this is an important principle, but how the end is to be achieved.
<P>
Clause 44 will require the Secretary of State to issue the code of practice to which reference has been made. Matters that must be incorporated in the code include the assistance that should be given to applicants, and complaints procedures.
<P>
Putting such information into a code of practice will allow us to provide flexible advice that is tempered to meet the needs of the many different types of authorities that the Bill will cover. For example, the requirements for assistance that will be placed on primary schools or the Zoos Forum, a public body to which reference is made in the schedule, are clearly not the same as those that we could reasonably place on bodies such as the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority or the Home Office, which should perhaps give slightly more assistance to an applicant. It cannot be right to expect the school secretary to become an expert in freedom of information, or to require the school secretary or the primary school head teacher to give advice on reformulating a request. There must be flexibility. Flexibility is far more prevalent in the code of practice than it would be in the Bill, were such an amendment to be adopted.
<P>
Amendment No. 85 would compel authorities to describe to applicants the right to apply to the commissioner for a decision under clause 50. Again, for reasons that were given this afternoon, such advice in notice form would be somewhat premature. The first stage in the review process would not be an application to the commissioner but a request for the authority to follow its internal review procedure to establish whether the information could be disclosed. Guidance on that point is rightly given in the code of practice rather than in the Bill. Therefore, although I am sympathetic to the intention behind the amendment, the Government conclude that the Committee should not support it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> When my hon. Friend is reading his brief and explaining the Government's position, and as he relates that to the three examples that the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross gave of the Home Office ignoring the code of practice, I hope that it will give him pause for thought that to base his resistance on the code of practice is not necessarily to stand on the strongest ground. Perhaps he will ponder that in the weeks to come.
<P>
<H5>2.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I accept that point but, as my hon. Friend undoubtedly knows, the existing code of practice on access to Government information is a non-statutory regime, which will cease to have effect once the code of practice is issued under clause 44. The Government are confident that a non-statutory code of practice, for which there are limited remedies, is not the same—and will not be treated in the same way—as a code of practice issued under a statutory requirement passed by the House. Such a code would have the proper remedies specified in the Act of Parliament that flow from its being a code under a statutory provision. We are not, therefore, dealing with similar provisions, albeit they are both described as codes of practice. We expect the new code of practice to have considerably more bite.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> Is the Minister suggesting that the code of practice itself might provide remedies enforceable under the statute? The fact that the establishment of a code is required by the statute does not necessarily improve the remedy unless the code so provides.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I apologise to the Committee if I have misled them on this matter. The code of practice will describe procedures for public bodies to follow. If they fail to follow them, the remedies will be obtained either via the Information Commissioner or, possibly, through a judicial review application. The commissioner will have a statutory power to issue recommendations relating to practice and authorities under the code. The inter-relationship of the statutory remedies in the Bill and the code is far stronger than that which exists under the present non-statutory code.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> It is important to clarify this point, but I do not think that it will be easy, so I do not blame the Minister for not being able to get it absolutely clear to my thick mind straight away. The statutory basis of the code will not, of itself, provide a remedy. The only remedy that the Minister has described is the general power of the commissioner in respect of making recommendations as to how the code should be drawn up. I do not foresee that providing any remedy to an individual.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I understand the point that the right hon. Gentleman is making, but he is missing the point of the code of practice. It will exist to guide public authorities on how to act when facing information requests. We hope that they will accept and follow the recommendations of the code of practice, so as to carry through the principles of the Bill, which are to promote disclosure whenever that is possible and appropriate. The remedies are available under the Bill, through the commissioner, at the suit of the applicant against the public authority. The code of practice exists to guide public authorities on how to operate their obligations under the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> This is interesting, because I infer from what the Minister has said that any breach of the code of practice will not be actionable through the appeal mechanisms set out in the Bill. Therefore, any breach of the code of practice would provide a remedy to an individual complainant only if the complaint was made to the parliamentary ombudsman. I hope that I am wrong, but if I am not, the Government's argument that placing the matter on a statutory footing will be of advantage to individuals will collapse like a house of cards.
<P>
We have been told time and again in Committee and in the House that the proposal will provide statutory rights. To use the terminology of the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross, the Government have trumpeted that fact. If people cannot get information because the code of practice has been breached, what statutory rights will they have if their only remedy is to complain to the ombudsman? That is the situation as it stands.
<P>
The general commotion that my comments have spurred suggests that my intervention has been worthwhile. I look forward to the Minister's reply.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Lock:</B> Getting it wrong may constitute making a worthwhile intervention. I shall try to clarify the situation.
<P>
The Bill will for the first time provide a statutory right to information. If the existing non-statutory code of practice is breached, that will, as the hon. Gentleman said, be subject to an investigation by the parliamentary ombudsman. Clause 44 makes provision for a code of practice that will give guidance to public authorities about how to fulfil their statutory duties to give information. When those duties are breached, or if an applicant is dissatisfied and feels that the information has not been provided, remedies will be available, under the statute, through the Information Commissioner and, eventually, the law tribunal.
<P>
The breach of the code of practice will be subject to investigation by the commissioner. She could issue a recommendation against an authority with all of the force that such a recommendation entails. At that stage, it would not be legally binding for the reasons that were, no doubt, ventilated in earlier discussions. Ultimately, public authorities are accountable for their actions and different codes will be applicable. The present code involves the parliamentary ombudsman, but the system that will be involved with the code of practice will be completely different—the ombudsman will not have an appropriate remit because, under the Bill's statutory scheme, the remedy will involve going to the Information Commissioner.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the Committee that we should not currently be discussing the code of conduct. I allowed a brief reference to it to help our debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I have come to the same conclusion as you, Mr. O'Hara. What I thought was a settled position may not be as settled as I had thought. I expect that we shall return to this matter when we discuss clause 44. I am not convinced that the Minister is right, but we should let that matter rest for the moment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> As a non-lawyer, I am confused by the debate. Committee members may want to read carefully the Minister's comments in Hansard.
<P>
One or two points were not crystal clear. At one point, the Minister appeared to suggest that the code of practice—I refer to it, Mr. O'Hara, because it is relevant to the amendment—was different because it will have greater force. As I understand it, the whole point of a code of practice is that it is non-statutory. While such a code of practice may be brought about by clause 44, and therefore be empowered as an entity by statute, it does not have statutory force in itself. That is the whole point of the distinction between legislation and a code of practice. As we know, there are some advantages to a code of practice—but not in this case. When the Minister concedes that the code of practice is non-statutory—in its provisions, rather than its existence—and that the only recourse will be to the commissioner, I hope that he will go on to concede that the commissioner has no power to resolve matters; she has the power only to recommend. That structure is much weaker than it might at first appear.
<P>
I think that we may have taken the matter as far as we can this afternoon. As the hon. Member for Ryedale said, we have an opportunity—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are being drawn into a debate on the code of practice. It might be better to reserve that until we reach the relevant part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I look forward to returning to the matter in another context, and beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 15 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I seek your guidance on the way in which your selection of amendments bears on the relationship between clause 16 and schedule 2. We are invited to discuss schedule 2 stand part as part of the group of amendments, yet schedule 2 also appears on the selection list immediately afterwards. At what point would it be convenient for the Committee to discuss the general provisions of schedule 2?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> During the debate on the group of amendments. The amendments are grouped because they cover most of the content of the clause and the schedule. I, therefore, judged that separate clause stand part and schedule stand part debates would not be necessary. If members of the Committee feel that any matters in clause 16 or schedule 2 are not covered in the amendments, they should take the opportunity to make their points in the course of the debate on this group of amendments. I will then put formally clause 16 stand part and schedule 2 stand part.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Schedule 2 stand part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful for the intervention of the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central, because it enables me to make a point about amendment No. 109, which you did not select, Mr. O'Hara, for understandable reasons. The amendment sought to delete schedule 2, which amends the various Acts that have reference to the Data Protection Commissioner and the Data Protection Tribunal. Those are then entirely consequential, and to that extent innocuous, in relation to the proposal in clause 16 for the Data Protection Commissioner to have her existing remit extended to include information and for her to become known as the Information Commissioner instead.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Amendment No. 109 was not selected because it would have required a vote against the schedule. Such amendments are not chosen for debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I understand that, but if amendments Nos. 107, 108 and 110 to 113 were added to the Bill, schedule 2 would be superfluous because it provides for all the legislation that refers to the Data Protection Commissioner to refer instead to the Information Commissioner. We do not want to squabble over whether schedule 2 is necessary. If the Government have their way and the clause is unamended, schedule 2 is vital because that legislation would be wrong.
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Our fundamental difference, which arose on Second Reading, concerns extending the role of the Data Protection Registrar and the supporting tribunal to cover information. We would prefer an information ombudsman who is supported and scrutinised by a parliamentary Committee acting as an appellant authority. We may decide to press that alternative on Report. At this stage, however, we cannot allow the Committee to approve clause 16 without putting down our marker that the proposal is, for two reasons, misguided.
<P>
The first reason is one of principle. The Data Protection Registrar has a primary responsibility for ensuring privacy. A year or two ago, I had the huge pleasure of representing the Opposition on the Data Protection Bill. The Parliamentary Secretary also sat on that Committee and as a result of his contributions was moved from the back row to the front row, which is much to his credit and no doubt justified. He will recall the extent to which we delved into the role and the work of the Data Protection Registrar in the new world of data protection, which is to be brought on stream by the most recent European directive on data protection and the Data Protection Act 1998. It is clear, from the slippage of the dates, that the very process of bringing the new regime into effect has caused a huge amount of work and administration for hard-pressed officials in the Home Office and people in the Data Protection Registrar's offices in Greater Manchester. The Data Protection Registrar has enough work to do to implement the 1998 Act, and I shall discuss her work load in more detail later.
<P>
I cite the proceedings of the 1998 Act because throughout we were at pains to ensure that the rights of data subjects were adequately protected, to ensure their privacy. It is clear from our debates that the Bill's intention is to free-up information, not to protect privacy. That is the opposite of the Data Protection Registrar's current role. I appreciate the convenience of the marriage, but the two do not fit easily together. It is a marriage that time will show was a mistake.
<P>
For the sound reason of principle, the privacy role of the office of the Data Protection Registrar, an important public body, should not be confused or subsumed in a body that will force more information to be released. My hon. Friend the Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien) has passed me a note—that is a rare event on the Opposition Benches—stating that the marriage is of the poacher and the gamekeeper and I entirely understand his reasons for coming to that conclusion. It convinces me that I have made my point on the principle of the issue; I can now move on to the substance.
<P>
The Under-Secretary said that the Information Commissioner, who may be the present Data Protection Registrar, Elizabeth France, will have a lot of work to do. If the Government are convinced that the 2,000 or so annual demands for information under the existing, non-statutory code are but a flea bite in relation to the great volume of demands for information that will be sparked by the Bill, there is bound to be a great deal of work for the commissioner in considering appeals, determinations and the code of practice, which we discussed when we trespassed into clause 44 in a previous debate. The review of the code of practice looks like another major work load for the Information Commissioner.
<P>
The work load will be worse because the Bill requires the Information Commissioner to approve the publication schemes of every public authority. That is over the top, as much unnecessary work, for public authorities and for the commissioner, could be avoided. However, for the present let us assume from our experience in the Committee that, as the Government prefer to leave the Bill as it is, every public authority must have its publication scheme approved, continually updated and kept under review. What a huge work load. About 500 public authorities are listed in schedule 1, paragraphs 6 and 7. The Under-Secretary said that it was just a first attempt at the number that are likely to have to be included and acknowledged that eventually there will be many more.
<P>
We know from earlier comments by the two Ministers that many small businesses—every local authority, general practitioner's surgery, dental practice, school, hospital and many other relatively small organisations—will be caught by the Bill and come under the jurisdiction of the commissioner. The list seems endless. It is a massive number of organisations to be supervised by the commissioner.
<P>
Without further labouring the point, at the very least the Government should reconsider their idea of merging the role of the Data Protection Commissioner as the Registrar will become, and the commissioner's tribunal with the additional task involving information. They should instead think about whether there should be an independent and separate commissioner. We should prefer it if he or she were an ombudsman, but we shall have that debate later on the Floor of the House. The name of the role is less important than its nature.
<P>
The roles named in the clause should be separate; the Government may rue the day that they merged the two tasks, not least because it will mean a massive work load. More importantly, the two tasks that the merged commissioner will be asked to undertake are contradictory. One seeks to keep data private and upholds privacy, and therefore secrecy, while the other is expected to be the lubricant of the freeing-up of information, the like of which we have never seen in this country. That oil, and the water of privacy, will not mix.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I listened with interest to the hon. Gentleman and I was surprised by how much sympathy I had for his view. When the Select Committee scrutinised the Bill, I was convinced by the Home Secretary's well-put case that although he recognised that there were difficulties in combining the role of the Data Protection Commissioner with that of Information Commissioner, the advantages outweighed them, but as I listened to the hon. Gentleman I began to doubt whether that was the case, because of the clash of interest, and in spite of the fact that Mrs Elizabeth France is a skilful and witty person. The fact that the Select Committee accepted the Home Secretary's case owed much to Mrs. France's high reputation. It is possible that we got it wrong; the Home Secretary may wish to consider the matter again, especially in the light of the hon. Gentleman's second point about the sheer volume of work. He is right that the Under-Secretary spelled out, in no uncertain terms, what an enormous job it will be. I was unaware of it until I read the incredible list in schedule 1, which the Parliamentary Secretary tells us is by no means complete. I had not realised what an enormous job the new role will be. There may be a case for reconsidering the Government's approach, but I do not think that it reflects on the ability of Mrs. France or her successor to ride the two rather difficult horses involved.
<P>
I shall concentrate my remarks on schedule 2, which is I why I asked you for clarification, Mr. O'Hara. The schedule contains a genuine problem as it makes the commissioner subject to a new prohibition on disclosure of information, which is about to come into force under the Data Protection Act 1998. As I understand it, the Bill ensures that the commissioner and her staff could face criminal charges for the disclosure of particular types of information. It proposes that disclosures can be made only if they are necessary for functional reasons or in the public interest. The test of necessity is strict, and may prevent disclosure by the commissioner in many circumstances. Mrs. France, the present Data Protection Registrar, who will become the Information Commissioner unless the policy is reconsidered, has expressed concern about that. Under section 59 of the Data Protection Act 1998, the Data Protection Commissioner will become subject to a statutory prohibition on the disclosure of particular information. Paragraph 19 of schedule 2 extends that prohibition to the Information Commissioner, which may prevent the commissioner and her staff from disclosing information about how or whether they are handling complaints involving the release of information about identifiable businesses.
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman not only for his support for my line of thinking but because he has reminded me of questions that I asked during in Committee on the Data Protection Bill. During consideration of that Bill, I repeatedly expressed the concern that he has asked the Parliamentary Secretary to consider. The commissioner and her staff will have serious problems in releasing much of the information, but the Government refuse to change the criminal sanction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> If the problem is serious for the Data Protection Commissioner, who is responsible for confidentiality and secrecy, how much greater will it be for an Information Commissioner? In many ways, the role of an Information Commissioner is precisely the opposite of that of a Data Protection Commissioner, as the former must try to increase the amount of information available. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman intended to make that point, which illustrates the dichotomy between the two roles. The difference may become relevant when an authority has refused to disclose information about a company to an applicant. In some cases, businesses may be public authorities in relation to particular functions. For example, private bodies with public functions can be brought within the scope of the Bill by an order made under clause 4(2)(a) in relation to specified functions. Such an order might apply to bodies such as Group 4, which has contracts to run privatised prisons and will not be alone in having an odd, private-public role.
<P>
As I understand it, the Government maintain that they are obliged to create the offence by the data protection directive, a view that the current Data Protection Registrar has disputed. Whatever the legal position in respect of the Data Protection Act, surely the offence cannot be enforced in relation to the Information Commissioner's functions, as they do not flow from the directive or from other Community obligations. The rationale for extending the offence appears to be based merely on an unnecessary preference for consistency, flowing from the decision to conflate the Data Protection and Information Commissioners. The prohibition of disclosure is laid out in the Data Protection Act, and will apply to the Information Commissioner under section 59 of that Act. I shall not weary the Committee by reminding it of those provisions, especially as the hon. Member for Ryedale is so familiar with them, as is my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary.
<P>
I should point out that that provision exposes the commissioner to the risk of prosecution if she discloses information obtained under the Bill about an identifiable individual or business—the latter being the real issue—unless the information was supplied for her to publish, or the disclosure was for legal proceedings. In any other circumstances she would have to show that one of two conditions could be met. One condition would be that the disclosure was necessary for the discharge of any of her functions. That is a strict test. If the function could be discharged without releasing the information, disclosure might not be necessary. It might not be possible to show it to be necessary for the commissioner to identify a company that was opposing disclosure of information about defective products.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I do not want to cut short my hon. Friend's observations. I am sympathetic to his argument and the points raised by the Data Protection Registrar. The Government are well aware of the issue and are considering what amendments are needed to deal with it. I am happy to expand on the Government's thinking. In principle they accept that there is an issue to be tackled, but I am not in a position to table amendments today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> That is extremely helpful and I thank my hon. Friend for so readily and graciously conceding that there is a problem.
<P>
When the Government consider amending the provision, will they bear it in mind that one of the most contentious and difficult elements of the restriction—difficult in the sense that I object to it—is that it contains no harm test. The offence is not limited to the disclosure of trade secrets or commercially damaging information but could relate to harmless disclosure of information about an identifiable business. The perverse consequence of that would be that information about a business that an authority might well have to disclose under the Bill—because it did not reveal a trade secret or prejudice commercial interests—could, if disclosed by the commissioner, result in her conviction for a criminal offence.
<P>
I hope that my hon. Friend will bear it in mind that a harm test would be helpful. In view of his gracious and fulsome intervention, I need say no more on this point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> The hon. Member for Ryedale spoke about a proposal to divide the Data Protection Commissioner and the Data Protection Tribunal from the Information Commissioner and the Information Tribunal to be set up under the Bill. The Government believe that the Bill contains a common-sense, workable proposal for renaming the Data Protection Commission and Data Protection Tribunal and combining the functions within an integrated approach to the freedom of information regime and both personal and other requests under that regime. As the hon. Gentleman said, the amendment would divorce the roles of the Information and Data Protection Commissioners, and the Information and Data Protection Tribunals, and would breach the integrated approach that we believe is the sensible way of giving the public real rights.
<P>
Our proposal is sensible, because the two roles, under the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Bill, are interrelated and complementary, particularly with respect to the right of access to information about other people. The Bill sets up a clear framework of interaction which, as it must, respects our international obligations to protect personal information and privacy. I draw the Committee's attention to clause 38, which expressly exempts the disclosure of personal information about one person to another. The interrelationship between the two measures is important.
<P>
A significant number of requests for information will be for a mixture of personal and more general information. It makes sense to reflect that in the enforcement regulations. A request for information could technically fall into two camps, with the personal data covered by data protection legislation and the more general information covered by freedom of information legislation. The request would have to be pursued in two separate enforcement regimes, which would add inappropriate hurdles.
<P>
The amendments make no sense. For the ordinary member of the public, they would muddy the clear lines of responsibility. The Bill provides that an applicant who requests information does not need to know or think about whether it is for personal information or for something else. If an applicant believes that information to which he or she is entitled is not being released, there is a clear line of complaint to the Information Commissioner when internal complaints within the public authority have been exhausted. The Information Commissioner is empowered to take action in light of the circumstances and under the provisions of the legislation.
<P>
That would not be the case if the amendments were accepted. The applicant would have to deal with two separate officials, which may be of no great concern. It is possible that the correct route would become apparent or that the two commissioners would pass on relevant paperwork, but nothing would be gained and the complaint would be delayed, which would cause aggravation and annoyance for the applicants.
<P>
Unfortunate consequences could flow from the separation of functions. Instead of consulting one source—the Information Commissioner—for guidance on the interpretation and application of freedom of information legislation, public authorities would have to obtain advice from two sources. Those two sources should be complementary, but there is nothing in the amendments to require that. Given the independence that is essential for both offices, there is no way of building in a requirement that they are complementary. Instead of one source being responsible for promoting good practice in public authorities with regard to freedom of information, there would be two officials, each concerned with only a small part of the overall objective of delivering to members of the public real and realisable rights to information. Instead of achieving benefits and savings by tapping into the experience of the Data Protection Registrar, her office and an already functioning tribunal, there would be the additional bureaucratic costs of establishing a new office and a new tribunal.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Ryedale said, the Information Commissioner will be busy. We do not expect the Information Commissioner's work to be achieved with the existing resources of the Data Protection Registrar. We anticipate that additional resources will be provided. However, we can be confident, given the overlapping and interrelationship of the two roles, that savings will be made by funding one commissioner and one tribunal rather than two commissioners and two tribunals.
<P>
As for the hon. Gentleman's suggestion that we are creating a poacher-turned-gamekeeper role, much of the work of the Data Protection Registrar is to enforce openness by facilitating subject access. No one can say that she takes a lax view on the disclosure of information to the subjects of that information. Privacy is an important issue in freedom of information and disclosure to subject access is an important part of data protection. A balance must be struck, and it makes sense for one commissioner and one tribunal to do that. Two commissioners and two tribunals could have different ideas on where the balance should be struck on inter-related issues. We will resist the attempt to create two bureaucracies and two tribunals, because one will be more coherent and sensible.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am much more clear about the Government's approach and about why they thought of such a solution in the first place. I need to revisit in greater length the Select Committee proceedings to which the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central referred, as well as the Home Secretary's explanation. I suspect that the explanations offered were much along the lines of those just given by the Parliamentary Secretary. Many changes were made to the Bill that became the Data Protection Act 1998 in order to implement European Court rulings on data subject access to public records in housing departments, health authorities, doctors' surgeries—where they provided people with a right to see GPs' records on them—and so on. All those changes were made by significant amendments, some of which were tabled on Report. The Government appear to have approached the Bill from the same point of view: that of individuals seeking information about themselves. All that the Parliamentary Secretary says about the Data Protection Commissioner also having information responsibility probably makes sense in respect of such information.
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I understood, however, that the purpose of the Bill did not relate merely to individuals finding out what information about them their GPs, hospitals or housing departments have in their files, but was much more about freeing up the culture of secrecy in Government. With respect to the Parliamentary Secretary, I must say that that is a much wider and more important role than the one that he described and I have just acknowledged. In any case, if the 1998 Act has done its job, it will have provided individuals with the rights that the European Court judgments said we should have without the need for further legislation. We should already have those rights and they should be reinforced by the code of practice. We must revisit the matter. Indeed, the exchanges on it have been helpful because they have demonstrated that an important issue is at stake.
<P>
The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central spoke about confidentiality implications for the commissioner, which are dealt with in section 59 of the 1998 Act. His points were entirely valid, although I must confess that I had not approached the Bill from his standpoint until this afternoon. I shall do so now, because I recall making a fuss about the matter on the Standing Committee that considered the Data Protection Bill, although sadly to no avail.
<P>
I said that we did not intend to press the amendment because it was not our preferred alternative, but there is a case for separation of the two important roles of the Information Commissioner.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen O'Brien </B>(Eddisbury): At the outset of the Committee's deliberations, the Under-Secretary was keen to emphasise the need for a change of culture. The Bill falls short on background understanding of how such a change will occur in the behaviour of those who will be required to make it happen, especially at enforcement level. While the two horses are being ridden together, as the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central put it, with one administrative area responsible, it will be difficult to create the mindset appropriate to the culture change, while at the same time adopting the culture of protecting personal information within an organisation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> My hon. Friend makes a valid point. In a sense, the enforcement culture is another aspect of the matter. However, we need to reflect further. This debate was intended to test the issue, but I am encouraged to believe that we should revisit it and perhaps renew our efforts in support of the case for separation. I can now see why the Government have approached the matter as they have, but they are in danger of missing the real point of the Bill, which is to free information from within Government. That is outwith the issue of the individual subject seeking information about himself held by public authorities. That right has been accorded under the Data Protection Act 1998. The Bill is concerned with changing the culture of Government and obtaining information as a citizen, rather than about how information affects someone personally. There is a world of difference between the two.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> When the hon. Gentleman reflects further on the matter, I wonder if he will agree, first, that if we are to have a culture of openness and of providing information when appropriate, the same principles must be applied whatever the forum, and secondly, that we shall have a better chance of changing the culture and enforcing the change with one tribunal and commissioner applying the principles, rather than two, one of whom, according to his account, would primarily be concerned with secrecy, and the other of whom would primarily be concerned with openness. That would be a recipe for disaster.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am not sure that that is right. Far be it from me, as a Conservative, to suggest that more bodies than necessary be created for people to have to deal with. On the other hand, the more one attends to the implementation of the most recent European directive in the 1998 legislation, the more one understands that the core issue is protecting the interests of data subjects and ensuring that the principles of the directive are upheld. The point of that measure is privacy, not freedom of information. The 1998 Act and the existing code have more than adequately—or so we are led to believe—fulfilled our obligations under the European Court rulings, which led to the many late changes.
<P>
My subject is something more fundamental: providing an organisation and a commissioner or ombudsman, with, as my hon. Friend the Member for Eddisbury said, a mindset and enforcement mechanisms centred on the freeing of information. They should not be concerned with maintaining secrecy and protection rules. I do not wish to detain the Committee any longer. We have had an important exchange. It is clear that we will return to this again. I promise to reflect on what the Parliamentary Secretary has said. I will study the Hansard of this exchange. I ask him to do the same and the Government to have a rethink about whether they have approached this in the right way. We are bound to return to this. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

No. 116, in page 10, line 14, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, provided that it meets any reasonable requirements laid down by the Commissioner.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I alluded to this in my remarks on the previous group of amendments on clause 16. As I read it, clause 17 requires each public authority to adopt and maintain a scheme of publication that is approved by the commissioner. Clause 18 talks about the commissioner having an opportunity, rather than an obligation, to adopt a model publication scheme, which presumably a public authority could adopt. When I thought about the interaction of these two clauses, I got the impression that the Government intend that every public authority must adopt a scheme and that the commissioner will prepare some model schemes that they can all adopt.
<P>
We have estimated that tens of thousands of organisations will be public authorities for the purposes of the Bill; why does each one need to go through the bureaucratic process of approval? Is not formal approval over-egging the pudding when for the vast majority of public authorities it should be satisfactory that the scheme meets some minimum requirements laid down by the commissioner? Provided that it did, it would automatically be approved. That would bring in a degree of almost self-regulatory common sense to what otherwise might become an extremely bureaucratic process from which the public would gain little if any benefit. We are not sure that a formal approval is necessary. The situation may be much as we have tried to cover for in our amendments. That said, we shall listen to the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I wish to speak to amendment No. 66, which broadly complements the amendment proposed by the hon. Member for Ryedale.
<P>
Every authority has to publish and periodically review a publication scheme in accordance with clause 17. It must set out the material that it publishes and that it intends to publish, and the schemes must be approved by the commissioner. However, clause 17(4) opens up a dangerous loophole. Although the contents of a publication scheme must be approved, an authority would be free to publish its scheme
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in such manner as it thinks fit.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, it will not be subject to review by the commissioner. An authority could publish its scheme in an obscure form, which could make it extremely difficult to inspect. There could be a single copy, which could be held in the office of a chief executive and made available for perusal only by appointment and at an unacceptably high cost. The amendment would ensure that that does not happen because it would require the commissioner to approve the manner of publication as well as the content.
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen O'Brien:</B> In addition to what the right hon. Gentleman said, my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale spoke about bureaucracy. Additional costs would be incurred, which would exert greater pressure on the bodies to recover them. That takes us straight back to our earlier debate about fees, when we tried to persuade the Government to reflect further on the point at which fees are charged. There could be a disincentive to meet reasonable recommendations on fees.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I would not wish to add to costs. In most cases, it would be accepted automatically if the requirement were to meet the commissioner's approval. It is unlikely that anyone putting forward a scheme would not secure approval. Approving the substance as well as the manner of publication would be straightforward.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</B> We intend that the authority should consider adopting a model scheme, which would be approved by the commissioner. It would not need to go back to the commissioner for individual approval. As the hon. Member for Ryedale said, that would be impractical in view of the number of different ways in which approval can be sought in each individual case. We want to avoid as much bureaucracy as possible. I heard what the hon. Member for Eddisbury said, and we shall proceed on the basis of keeping the procedure as simple as possible.
<P>
Amendment No. 114 would require a publication scheme to meet ``any reasonable requirements'' of the commissioner. However, it would also have the unintentional effect that an authority would not need to adopt a scheme at all if it did not meet the reasonable requirements of the commissioner.
<P>
Amendment No. 66 would require the authority to publish its publication scheme in a way approved by the Information Commissioner, and amendment No. 116 would require the authority to publish it in a way that met the commissioner's reasonable requirements. However, amendment No. 116 is ambiguous and could allow an authority to publish a scheme if it only met the reasonable requirements. I assume that that was unintended.
<P>
As the clause stands, the commissioner must approve publication schemes, but amendment No. 114 would mean that the scheme had only to meet the reasonable requirements of the commissioner. That would weaken the provision. It could also accidentally provide a loophole to allow an authority to avoid adopting a publication scheme if it desired to do so. That seems to qualify the obligation on the authority
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to adopt and maintain a scheme'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
simply because its proposals did not meet the commissioner's reasonable requirements.
<P>
Those effects would clearly go against the Government's intention to develop a proactive regime and a culture of openness. I point out to the hon. Member for Eddisbury that there is a publication by the working party on openness in the public sector. I commend it to him, especially as I wrote its introduction and approved its draft. I assure him that he will find it interesting.
<P>
As the amendment would have an effect that I am sure was accidental, I ask the hon. Member for Ryedale to withdraw it.
<P>
The Bill allows the authority to determine how the publication schemes are published and by what media. Amendment No. 66 would require the commissioner's approval of the manner in which a scheme would be published. The intention—to ensure the proper publication of schemes—is well founded but would be unnecessary in practice. It is in the authority's interest to publish the scheme and make it widely available, as one of the scheme's effects would be to reduce the number of requests under clause 1 and reduce the burden on the authority. If the authority does not publish the scheme, it is likely to have requests made in ways of which the public are unaware, which would cause much more bureaucracy.
<P>
Once schemes are approved by the commissioner, I hope that they might give a member of the public the ability to find desired information. To require each authority to seek the approval of the commissioner about how it will publish its scheme seems unnecessarily bureaucratic. It would add considerably to the commissioner's work load if we expected her to approve the manner of scheme publication for such a wide range of authorities.
<P>
Amendment No. 116 seems to require the authority to publish its scheme provided that it meets the reasonable requirements. As I said, it is ambiguous. If that was intended, the amendment is unnecessary because the scheme would have been approved by the commissioner or, pursuant to amendment No. 114, would have met the commissioner's reasonable requirements. However, I imagine that the intended effect was that the manner of publication would meet the commissioner's reasonable requirements. In that case, the intention is well founded and the amendment seeks to ensure the proper publication of schemes that are aimed at helping the authorities as much as they are at helping the applicants.
<P>
I recognise the amendment's purpose, and the Government will consider whether the Bill achieves the purpose that we all want to achieve. We may need to study the wording of the clause, and I am happy to undertake that we shall do so although we shall not table any amendments at this stage. I shall consider the situation with some care.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Three comments are in order. First, I have always doubted that I would ever get a job as a parliamentary draftsman and the Under-Secretary has confirmed it. That is a great relief. Secondly, we welcome him back to the Committee, free now from the machinations going on in the Chamber. Thirdly, I am grateful for his confirmation of the Government's intent. As I said, I read the provision and thought, ``I'm sure this is what they intend, but I'm not quite not sure that that's what it says.'' I am also grateful to him for undertaking to see whether the drafting can be improved. I gladly beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 65, in page 10, line 8, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2A) It shall be the duty of every public authority to publish, subject to subsection (2B), any manuals, instructions, precedents and guidelines used by the officers of employees of the authority, for the purpose of—
<P>
(a) interpreting any enactment, or
<P>
(b) administering any scheme for which the authority is responsible,
<P>
and to make adequate reference to the existence of such information in its publication scheme.
<P>
(2B) An authority shall not be required by subsection (2A) to publish any exempt information unless the public interest in maintaining the exemption in question outweighs the public interest in disclosure.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would require authorities to publish the internal guidelines that are used by officials in their dealings with the public. It reflects an existing requirement of the open government code, which is already in place but which the Bill, rather surprisingly, has dropped, contrary to the commitment in the White Paper. As the Under-Secretary may be aware, such a provision appears in every English language freedom of information law throughout the world.
<P>
Paragraph 3.ii of part I of the open government code requires the authorities
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to publish or otherwise make available, as soon as practicable after the Code becomes operational, explanatory material on departments' dealings with the public (including such rules, procedures, internal guidance to officials and similar administrative manuals as will assist better understanding of departmental action in dealing with the public) except where publication could prejudice any matter which should properly be kept confidential under Part II [the Exemptions] of the Code.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The guidance on the code states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Departments should plan for the progressive release of all the guidelines and other material used in their dealings with the public. This need not mean publication where departments consider that the level of interest would not justify it, or where the guidelines in question are voluminous, but eventually the aim should be to make all guidelines available for purchase or inspection on request.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Annual reports under the code have described examples of the kinds of guidance that have been released under this provision. The 1997 second edition of the code of practice on access to government information, guidance on interpretation, states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``In 1994 the Inland Revenue set a target to publish their 45 main guidance manuals by the end of December 1995. Only 5 volumes failed to meet this deadline and these were published by the beginning of February 1996.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Health and Safety Executive's rolling programme for preparing existing internal guidance for release was completed on 31 March 1996.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It also notes that the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Home Office's Immigration Service Enforcement Directorate received 95 requests for internal enforcement policy guidelines in 1996, all of which were met'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Office for Standards in Education provided all nursery education providers with a copy of the Inspection Notebook used by its Inspectors in 1996'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``In March the FCO''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``published Guidance to Desk Officers on Export Licence and Arms Working Party Applications. This was superseded by the Criteria to be used in considering licence applications for the export of conventional arms which was issued in July''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The 1997 code further states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``All main Child Support Agency guides and manuals are now publicly available''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Freedom of Information White Paper made it clear that it was intended to continue those duties but, lo and behold, the Bill omits them. That is yet another retrograde step in the progress of the Government's thinking about the duty of disclosure. It is extremely disturbing that they are moving in that direction. If, on such a substantial matter on which the Government have given their assent on earlier occasions, they are not willing to make a concession, those who are interested in such matters will be driven to the ineluctable conclusion that what the Government have been saying about freedom of information since the Bill was published has no bearing on their earlier philosophy or policy statements. It will be thought that they have no intention to live up to their purported ambition to improve what we already have.
<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
If the Bill does not contain such a measure, it would be a clear step back from what was established by the previous Administration. It is a litmus test of the Government's good faith. Ministers tend to regard such proceedings as perfunctory, pro forma and an opportunity to let other people have their say and give advice for which the cost is no doubt expensive, but pay no attention what Members of Parliament have to say. I am not prepared to listen to bland words in response to the amendment. I want to know why the Government have done a U-turn, a volte-face, and stood on their head.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> On Second Reading, I recall upsetting the Under-Secretary, who has had to return to another part of the Palace, by saying that the Bill was a wolf in sheep's clothing. While it seemed in many respects to be well-intentioned, it contained provisions that made it nothing like what we were led to believe. That thought crossed my mind again when I re-examined the amendment. The proposed new subsection (2A) looks pretty reasonable and could add something to the Bill, while the proposed new subsection (2B) would deal with one of the three or four key issues, which, as I said at the start of our proceedings, the Committee should find some way of addressing before the Bill is discussed on Report. That reminded me of the time when we debated whether there should be a purposes clause, when I said that an amendment could be made to clause 17 to put that into effect.
<P>
I commend the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross on the force of the argument that he deployed, particularly in favour of the second part of the amendment. If that was another way of trying to persuade the Government to include a measure in the Bill that creates a greater presumption of disclosure, I would welcome that.
<P>
We are in many respects having a constructive debate on points of detail—we are examining whether the Bill says what we think it says—and that spirit characterised my most recent exchanges with the Under-Secretary and with the Parliamentary Secretary. The Government seem to be listening on whether the Bill means what they intend it to mean, but the amendment, with the amendments that we discussed on substantial harm, and the amendments that we shall discuss next week when we come to harm or prejudice and enforcement, are essential to the Bill's achievement of what the Government have trumpeted as its aim: the greater culture of openness and an end to the culture of secrecy.
<P>
I support the right hon. Gentleman's objective in seeking to strengthen the Bill in regard to that provision. The Parliamentary Secretary may say that that is not the way to do it and the Government are still considering the matter. I repeat what I said on Tuesday: there is a feeling abroad, from comments that Ministers have made, that they are aware of the dissatisfaction and the unease of many of their party's own members and supporters, including members of the Committee and Members of Parliament, that the Bill is not strong enough.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> The amendment is important, not only for the reasons that the hon. Gentleman gave but because the Bill repeals the valuable provisions of the codes that are operational. If the Government do not accept the amendment, far from freedom of information being taken forward, it will be rolled back.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Yes, I entirely agree with the right hon. Gentleman. That has been our position all along, from the moment that the draft Bill was published. The changes that were made did not take things anything like far enough. I am not at all surprised that many people who hold positions or political points of view that are wholly estranged from those of the Conservative party are making precisely that point, that the code provides greater protection and greater certainty of information than the Bill.
<P>
That is why the right hon. Gentleman is right to say with the vehemence that he did that it is time for the Government to produce a clear statement of intention, declaring that they themselves appreciate that the Bill does not go far enough in those key respects, and to accept the amendment—or agree to accept a differently worded amendment that has the same effect. That would be a major step forward. If the Parliamentary Secretary says, ``No, we are not convinced,'' . the anger that is brewing in respect of the provision will grow ever larger and the day of reckoning will come on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will reply in the same gracious spirit in which he replied to the debate on the previous clause. He surely acknowledges the common-sense concern in this regard: it is not merely matter of going back on the code, or indeed against the best practice of the public bodies to which reference has been made—the Health and Safety Executive, the Inland Revenue and, amazingly, the Child Support Agency. Hon. Members of all parties have plenty of constituency problems with the CSA. Indeed, Standing Committee F is discussing the CSA's future. I am glad that the Government are reforming the CSA, which has not been open in its dealings. If such bodies regularly publish their manuals and describe their internal workings and processes, surely that is not only best but standard practice.
<P>
It defies logic or common sense to resist the proposal. Surely the Parliamentary Secretary can understand the extraordinary contradiction of stating that, under this brave new Bill, an authority or a public body must disclose the information that it holds to the public, without explaining its procedures, which must remain under wraps. That does not make sense; it is a ridiculous provision for the Government to include in the Bill.
<P>
The Parliamentary Secretary might say that such small but important matters can be left to the discretion of the Information Commissioner. She could decide to require the bodies covered by schedule 1 to publish the information routinely, but she may not. Surely a matter of such simplicity and directness should be dealt with in the Bill. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will not try to give reasons why it would be wrong and onerous to require public bodies to do as I propose, because he would be hard pressed to produce a convincing argument, even with his legal skills. I do not want him to tie himself in knots.
<P>
There is no reason why those bodies should not be required to explain what they do. If the Parliamentary Secretary cannot confirm that that will happen now, I hope that he will say, in strong and clear language, that the Government will table amendments to ensure that it will happen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I have listened to the debate extremely carefully. The hon. Member for Ryedale said that the Bill would free up information like never before. I agree that that is the purpose of the Bill, and it will be its effect.
<P>
The amendment should be considered not in the context of a public body's duty to disclose information but in that of the duty to state in a publication scheme what information it will disclose without request. Clearly, there is a difference between the information that is made available on request and that which a public body publishes as a matter of course. Amendment No. 65 would place a duty on every authority, however large or small, that is affected by the Bill. I remind hon. Members that that definition of public authority goes vastly beyond the current code of practice, which primarily fastens upon Departments. It would include information of a public nature held by a wide range of public bodies, some of which have limited administrative resources.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> Before the Parliamentary Secretary develops that point, he should refer to the amendment, which refers to the publication of manuals, instructions, precedents and guidelines that the authority's officers or employees use. If a public authority does not have such documents because it is too small to have compiled them, the obligation will not bite.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I accept that those are the terms of the amendment, but the clause as drafted leaves it to the commissioner and the public authority involved to determine what information is of sufficient public interest to justify inclusion in the publication scheme. About half an hour ago, the Government resisted an amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Ryedale to water down the provisions of clause 17(1)(a). The amendment would have allowed the public authority to publish a publication scheme that in general terms seemed to meet the commissioner's requirements. We have instead insisted that a publication scheme shall either appear in a standard format under clause 18 as a model publication scheme, or receive the express approval of the Information Commissioner under clause 17(1)(a).
