<P>
Except clauses 1, 7, 10, 11, 25, 27, 30, 75, 119 and 147
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chief Secretary to the Treasury </B>(Mr. Alistair Darling): I beg to move,
<P>
That, during proceedings on the Finance (No. 2) Bill (except Clauses 1, 7, 10, 11, 25, 27, 30, 75, 119 and 147) the Committee do meet, with effect from Tuesday 12th May, on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.
<P>
I welcome you to the Chair, Mrs Dunwoody. I understand that Mr. Butterfill is to be your co-Chairman. It will be strange for those of us who have sat on Finance Bill Committees for the past 10 years to see Mr. Butterfill condemned to silence except, of course, during appropriate interventions, because he used to be an active participant in our proceedings.
<P>
A large part of the Bill has been taken on the Floor of the House, although a great deal more remains to be scrutinised. I think that both sides of the House will agree to ensure that it is considered properly and in appropriate time. I have something of a non-executive role. My hon. Friends the Financial Secretary, the Economic Secretary and the Paymaster General will, I am sure, look after the Government's interests, as will my hon. Friends on the Back Benches, all of whom will be admirably supervised by our Whip.
<P>
The Committee should be able to make fairly substantial progress. The Government, as always, are open to any suggestions on how our legislation can be improved and made more user friendly for those who have to operate under the Finance Bill's provisions. This substantial measure is part of a continuing programme of major reforms to the financial system. When the Bill reaches the statute book, it will greatly benefit the country. I commend the sittings motion to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory (Wells):</B> I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mrs. Dunwoody. We look forward to a constructive debate on what is a huge Finance Bill. Opposition Members approach the task with a sense of duty because it goes to the core of Parliament's function, which is to scrutinise the right of the Executive to relieve our constituents of their hard-earned money through the application of compulsory powers. We will be subjecting the clauses to detailed scrutiny, but only in a constructive spirit. I shall say more on that when we move on. 
<P>
I want to stress that the size of the Bill will mean a long Committee stage. I know that all members of the Committee are braced for that, but we will not prolong the proceedings unduly. Its size--400 pages--is slightly surprising because it leaves out the entire welfare-to-work proposal, which formed a centrepiece of the Budget speech. That is evidently not ready yet, and we hear that the Government are in some trouble over the details. A large number of tax provisions are also not included in the Bill. They are to be dealt with subsequently by Treasury regulation, and I shall have more to say on that later.
<P>
I welcome the large number of Labour Members. I think that the Committee is even larger than last year's. I genuinely hope that they enter into the scrutiny process, which was not always the case last year. Those of my hon. Friends who sat on the Committee that considered the first Finance Bill of the current Session will remember that Labour members became known affectionately as the nodding donkeys because they had little to say, except to wave through some draconian tax-raising measures, and seemed reluctant to criticise the new Government. That was perhaps just about understandable in their first flush of youth last summer but, more than that, they seemed reluctant to stand up for some of their constituency interests in the face of a good many letters and representations that we know had been made to them. A year later, they may be somewhat more battle hardened and we look forward to their contributions, so that we can drop that sobriquet of nodding donkeys, which was always meant in good humour. We hope that they will become instead parliamentary tigers, anxious to fulfil their duties as parliamentarians, which is one of the reasons why they were elected in the first place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. Would it be in order for members of the Committee to remove their coats during the proceedings, as is customary?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Well, it is not customary. Indeed, Madam Speaker has views about that. But if hon. Members want to look as if they are on the dealing room floor, then they have my permission. It is a question of how Members of Parliament see themselves.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That, during proceedings on the Finance (No. 2) Bill (except Clauses 1, 7, 10, 11, 25, 27, 30, 75, 119 and 147), the Committee do meet, with effect from Tuesday 12th May, on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have some business announcements to make before we proceed. Copies of the Ways and Means resolutions, on which the Bill is founded, are to be found in the Committee Room. In view of the resolutions of the House relating to the declaration of interests, right hon. and hon. Members are required to declare a relevant interest when they table amendments, as well as when they speak to them. Copies of the rules are available from the Clerk.
<P>
As usual, because of the quantity of paperwork on the Bill, green boxes are available to store papers between sittings. Members who make use of this facility should note that the filing cabinet that contains the boxes will be locked when the Committee is not sitting.
<P>
Finally, I should draw atttention to the fact that adequate notice must be given of amendments. Neither I nor my co-Chairman will as a rule call any starred amendments, including any starred amendments that are reached during an afternoon sitting of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> I beg to move, 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That the Order in which proceedings in Standing Committee on the Finance (No. 2) Bill are to be taken shall be Clauses 2 to 6, Clauses 8 and 9, Clauses 12 to 16, Schedule 1, Clauses 17 to 20, Schedule 2, Clauses 21 to 24, Clause 26, Clauses 28 and 29, Clause 31, Schedule 3, Clauses 32 to 35, Schedule 4, Clauses 36 to 38, Schedule 5, Clauses 39 to 44, Schedule 6, Clauses 45 and 46, Schedule 7, Clauses 47 to 57, Schedule 8, Clause 58, Schedule 9, Clauses 59 to 61, Schedule 10, Clause 62, Schedule 11, Clauses 63 to 70, Schedule 12, Clauses 71 to 74, Schedule 13, Clause 139, Clauses 76 to 84, Schedule 14, Clauses 85 to 90, Schedule 15, Clauses 91 to 106, Schedule 16, Clauses 107 to 111, Schedule 17, Clauses 112 to 115, Schedules 18 and 19, Clauses 116 to 118, Schedules 20 and 21, Clauses 120 to 124, Clause 138, Clauses 125 to 129, Schedule 22, Clause 130, Schedule 23, Clauses 131 to 135, Schedule 24, Clauses 136 to 137, Clause 140, Schedule 25, Clauses 141 to 146, Clauses 148 to 155, Schedule 26, Clauses 156 to 161, New Clauses, New Schedules, Schedule 27.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clauses are generally set out in order in which they appear in the Bill, except for clauses 138 and 139, which have been brought forward so that the clauses relating to venture capital trusts, enterprise investment scheme reforms and capital gains tax reforms may be considered together.
<P>
The welfare-to-work programme does not feature because it is not properly the province of the Finance Bill. On secondary legislation, we shall discuss many of the schedules attached to clauses but this Bill is no different from many others in that it provides for a fair amount of secondary legislation. Of course this is nothing like the longest Finance Bill with which a Committee has had to deal. That record is held by the Conservative party, and we have some way to go before we can even begin to compete. The order of consideration will enable the Committee to deal with the Bill in the appropriate and logical way. I therefore commend it to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> We do not intend to oppose the motion but we wish to record some observations about it and, in so doing, about the Bill.
<P>
There is a distinction between schedules--which have always been an important part of any Finance Bill--and the use of secondary legislation and subsequent statutory instruments. Despite what the Chief Secretary just said, such use is more prevalent and more marked in this Bill. Work is being done outside the House on the quantity and type of that secondary legislation.
<P>
I should like to draw the Committee's attention to page 142 of the Bill, which is almost chosen at random. On that last page of the first volume, clause 158(4) refers to regulations and states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The power to make regulations under this section includes--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) power to impose charges to taxation;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) power to amend or repeal any enactment; and<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) power to make such incidental, supplemental, consequential and transitional provision as appears to the Treasury to be appropriate.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It would be difficult to draft that part of the clause more widely, and such provisions are scattered throughout this legislation.
<P>
Practitioners have already spotted that the use of secondary legislation is now more widespread and causing real difficulties. We all know that all legislation makes use of secondary legislation; indeed, administrative details are frequently better left to regulations. It is not desirable to return to primary legislation to change details or make specific taxes work better. In this Bill, however, whole chunks of tax legislation are treated in that way.
<P>
Outside bodies are asking why, at this stage, it is not known when corporation tax payments are to be made under the new system. We understand that some draft regulations have been made available--my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) had to raise the matter persistently on the Floor of the House before they were found in the Library. It would have been at least courteous-- if not required--to supply members of the Committee with those draft regulations, as they constitute an important and central part of the Bill. Perhaps I could ask through you, Mrs Dunwoody, for the draft regulations to be sent to hon. Members serving on the Committee.
<P>
It is beyond dispute that Henry VIII clauses, in various guises, are a strong and regular feature of this type of legislation. That is a matter that we will want to pursue. It might have been easier for the Committee if the regulations had been drawn together to be scrutinised over a one or two-week sitting. That is not a complaint--I understand that that would be difficult to do. As the regulations are scattered throughout the Bill, however, we will have to return to the matter as if it were a Wagnerian theme as we progress through the Bill.
<P>
It is characteristic of the arrogant way in which the Government treat the Committee and the House in general that--as was widely noticed--some proposals in the Budget speech did not form part of subsequent legislation or the Finance Bill. Conversely, some elements of the Finance Bill were not covered by the Budget speech. The reason for that is that the Budget speech was an exercise in political presentation and packaging, which did not always connect with the realities of the subsequent legislation.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ross Cranston (Dudley, North)</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I shall give way to the hon. Member for Dudley, North (Mr. Cranston) who is always helpful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> It would help me in pursuing this Wagnerian theme if I knew whether the right hon. Gentleman voted for the deregulation and contracting-out legislation, which contained a range of Henry VIII clauses allowing the repeal of primary legislation.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Yes, that was founded on primary legislation. Indeed, a feature of the deregulation initiative, of which Conservative Members are immensely proud, was that it was carried through in primary legislation, which gave specific effect to the clauses about which the hon. Gentleman is now complaining. It does not surprise me that he is complaining about it, because that deregulation unit has now been renamed the better regulation unit, which means the more deregulation unit, so it was not something of which the hon. Gentleman would have approved.
<P>
I am sure that the hon. Gentleman and other members of the Committee will have noticed that the Budget speech made no reference to the end of bed and breakfasting as regards capital gains. It took effect at midnight on Budget day. It is unprecedented that something as important to so many taxpayers should not be mentioned at all in the Budget speech, but now features in the Bill.
<P>
To go the other way round, I can give an example of something that was in the Budget speech and is not in the Bill. The raising of the employer's national insurance threshold was announced as an intention in the Budget speech and gave rise to all sorts of expectations in the press the next day, but it is not in the Finance Bill--as it would not be, because we know that national insurance contributions are enacted elsewhere--and it is not in the legislation elsewhere either. Those are two examples where the Bill does not reflect the Budget speech.
<P>
Another issue--I come back to the helpful intervention from the hon. Member for Dudley, North--relates to general complexity and over-regualtion, a theme that we again find in various clauses of the Bill. Capital gains tax, which I know we will linger on for some hours--it has already been debated at some length on the Floor of the House--is a massive, complicating measure. There was a case for reform of capital gains tax, but no case for continuing indexation and a particularly complex form of tapering relief, which is already proving difficult for practitioners and taxpayers alike.
<P>
There is also the issue of record-keeping. The Inland Revenue has a justified need to require individuals and corporations to keep records, but that requirement has snowballed and is in urgent need of consolidation, particularly as the more traditional requirement to keep six-year records under the Companies Acts and for VAT purposes has now been augmented by the requirement for self-assessment of corporation tax and transfer pricing, which forms an important part of the Bill. If we add to that the requirement for other companies to keep records for excise duty purposes, we have an overlapping mass of requirements that need sorting out and consolidating. It might have been useful if the parts of the Bill touching on record-keeping and those requirements had been brought together as part of the order before the Committee.
<P>
That fits into a pattern of increased complexity that is found elsewhere. The Foreign earnings deduction, which we shall debate in due course, apart from being a rather mean-minded attack on those who go overseas to try to boost Britain's export earnings, is an increased burden on companies and individuals. They may have to keep unnecessary records of their salaries and time spent abroad, which other countries deal with by exempting anyone earning up to, say, &#163;50,000. That is common on the continent and in the United States.
<P>
There are also the mysteries of offshore trust legislation. We always miss the Paymaster General, the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson), when he is not here, but doubtless he will grace future sittings. One feature of the clauses that deal with such legislation is their complexity and probably their unenforceability. That, again, has been commented on and we will come to it in due course.
<P>
The final theme running thorugh the Bill is that it was a tax-raising Budget and this is a tax-raising Bill. It is unfortunate that the two main sectors feeling the burden of taxes are savings and businesses. It is stupid to tax businesses in the way that is contemplated, when they will have to provide the extra jobs under the welfare-to-work project. The Confederation of British Industry has already pointed out that there is a tax burden of nearly &#163;20 billion on British businesses during this Parliament.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Is the right hon. Gentleman citing the CBI in support of his view? Did he not describe the CBI last year as a bunch of Marxists or something like that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> No, I have never abused the Confederation of British Industry in that way. The hon. Gentleman would do better to pay more attention to its observations on the tax-levying powers in the Bill that he will doubtless support.
<P>
The attack on savings was signalled in the July Budget of last year, and nothing has been done to correct it. The shambolic launch of ISAs has added to the deterrent effect. Although the scheme has been partly amended and rescued, details of the ISAs are not in the Bill, because they are delegated to subsequent secondary legislation.
<P>
In those ways and others we are witnessing an arrogant approach to the House of Commons, additional complexity for those who are expected to pay taxes and, above all, a tax-raising Budget and Finance Bill that will do, and already are doing, grave damage to the sectors of the economy that are expected to provide the jobs and extra savings to deliver the Government's wider economic objectives.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): I also take this opportunity, Mrs. Dunwoody, of welcoming you to the Chair. I am sure that we shall have many hours of interesting debate in this Standing Committee.
<P>
I wish to address the motion because I want to highlight the unprecedented powers that the Government are giving the Treasury through secondary legislation, particularly in relation to clause 158 relating to transitional provisions on the single European currency, clause 87 relating to personal portfolio bonds and clause 30 relating to corporation tax.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) has already referred to clause 158(4), and its wide powers which I mentioned in my speech on Second Reading. The clause gives the Treasury huge powers in relation to our joining the single European currency. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Treasury may, to such extent as appears to them appropriate'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
adopt regulations relating to the single currency and any transitional measures. It goes on to say in subsection (7):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``References in this section to the adoption of the single currency are references to the adoption of the single currency in accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, if the Government choose to deny the opt-out granted to them in the Maastricht treaty, clause 158 gives them power to join the European currency without a single reference to Parliament by primary legislation: it could all be done in secondary legislation. It is a hugely wide clause.
<P>
The United Kingdom has an unwritten constitution that is based on the separation of powers and the supremacy of Parliament. That system was arrived at after three long centuries. Parliament--and this Committee--is the protector of sovereign rights, and its aim is to prevent oppression by a Government with a huge majority. That is why the Statute of Westminster Act 1931 gave the Opposition certain rights of representation on this Committee. I contend that the unprecedented transfer of powers to the Treasury by secondary legislation may be constitutional, but it is certainly highly undesirable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): I remind the hon. Gentleman that the Government intend to have a referendum on that matter, which means that his argument is, frankly, ridiculous.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising that point. If the Government did not like the result of the referendum and were determined to join the single currency, the clause would give them the ability to do so.
<P>
The clause's wide-ranging powers could be enacted by negative resolution. As you know, Mrs. Dunwoody, even if a negative resolution is prayed against--perhaps by large numbers of hon. Members--it can pass through the House without any debate whatsoever. If it is debated, that is done for only an hour and a half, no amendments can be made to it and there is no vote at the end. With a positive resolution, there has to be a debate of one and a half hours come what may and a vote at the end. The likelihood is that that debate will be taken in the full glare of publicity on the Floor of the House rather than in Committee. Clause 158's huge powers should at least be subject to a positive resolution.
<P>
Clause 30 is a wide-ranging clause that deals with corporation tax and it will give huge powers to the Treasury by secondary legislation. The Chartered Institute of Taxation no less said that there is no unearthly reason why the Government should not enshrine those powers in primary legislation and make them subject to the full scrutiny of the House. The problem with secondary legislation is that it is not subject to such scrutiny.
<P>
	I remind the Committee of the powers that clause 30 will delegate to secondary legislation. Proposed new subsection (1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Treasury may by regulations make provision, in relation to companies of such descriptions as may be prescribed''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Paragraph (a) states that regulations may make provision
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``for or in connection with the determination of amounts of corporation tax'';<P>

<P>
paragraph (b) states that they may do so

paragraph (d) states that they may do so
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in connection with the determination of the amount of any such payments'';<P>

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is discussing the order of consideration. I hope that we shall not examine in detail each of the clause's words. As long as the hon. Gentleman keeps his point general, there is not a problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody. I was discussing the wide powers that are delegated to secondary legislation by the three clauses. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells and I demonstrated that the powers contained in clause 158 are extremely wide, and I was arguing the same point in relation to clause 30.
<P>
There is a catch-all power in clause 30(2)(l), which states that regulations may make provision:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``for or in connection with the imposition of such requirements as the Treasury thinks necessary''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If it loses an appeal, it can alter the regulations under proposed new subsection (5)(a) which states that, in relation to the clause, the regulations
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``may make such modifications of any provisions of the Taxes Acts''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the Treasury does not get it right the first time, it can come back and try again.
<P>
I object to the fact that the clause will give Treasury officials such wide powers. If the Government cannot enshrine the regulations properly in primary legislation, it looks as though they do not know what they are doing, because they are delegating huge power to their officials. Why not enshrine it in primary legislation?
<P>
Clause 87, which relates to personal portfolio bonds, shows the same pattern of very wide powers being given to Treasury officials. They may by secondary legislation only specify the method by which to charge tax; the person who is liable for tax; the period for and in respect of which the tax is to be charged; rates at which the tax is to be charged; and the administration of the tax. It is a very wide power--and an especially unfortunate one, because personal portfolio bonds were a contract between the taxpayer and the insurance company. With the Bill, we are in effect passing retrospective legislation. We are breaking previously made contracts with taxpayers, making bargains with an insurance company under contract in good faith. We are breaking that good faith--the Government are breaking that good faith.
<P>
I ask the Committee to consider seriously whether all the clauses in the Bill that empower by secondary legislation--I have not yet had time to count them all; no doubt someone else, perhaps a practitioner outside, will--should be taken first, so that we can take as much time as is reasonably necessary. As has already been said, we do not want to prolong the Committee any more than is necessary, but we believe that such matters, which are important to constituents and taxpayers, should be considered with the seriousness and the length and breadth of deliberation that they deserve.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Ruffley </B>(Bury St. Edmunds): I should like to speak in support of comments made by my hon. Friend for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown). The Chief Secretary to the Treasury has a bit of a nerve to say that it is not the longest Finance Bill. We know why. It is not the longest Finance Bill because of excessive reliance on enabling powers for making regulations to effect proposals set out in the Budget. We already know what much of the practitioner community thinks of how proper parliamentary scrutiny will be bypassed by allowing many regulations to be made.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold has already touched on the specifics, particularly in relation to the clauses that effect a new corporation tax regime. It would be helpful if Ministers reflected on anxieties about that new regime as it relates to the excessive reliance on regulations and order-making powers.
<P>
Under the clauses that relate to corporation tax, regulations on corporation tax payment will be effective even before they have been laid before Parliament. It is ridiculous that those who want to effect administrative systems to deal with ISAs are not likely to see the regulations before April 1999 when such systems have to be in place.
<P>
Those are but two examples of the pernicious effect of the excessive reliance on order-making powers as set out in the Bill. Such reliance on secondary legislation powers has much to do with Labour Members' fear of producing long and wordy Bills that smack of excessive red tape. They were fearful, so the City practitioner community thought, of an 800-page Bill. That was more than rumoured in the City. In the past few days, we heard that KPMG was prepared to issue a press release adverting to what it thought would be the excessive length of the Finance (No. 2) Bill. Phone calls were made from Her Majesty's Treasury to the effect that that may not be the case. The reason why the 800 page Bill did not materialise is because so much of it has been--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hesitate to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but we are debating something that has materialised--the arrangement of the clauses. It would be helpful if we could make a stab at restricting ourselves to what we are actually talking about.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I am grateful for your guidance, Mrs. Dunwoody, but I was drawing my remarks on the order of the clauses to a close. [Hon. Members: ``Hear, hear.''] Hon. Gentlemens heave a sigh of relief because they do not like what is being said. Perhaps they do not understand what is being said. My hon. Friends are right to say that it hurts too much.
<P>
<B>Ms Helen Southworth </B>(Warrington, South): On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody, the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) referred to hon. Gentlemens. Is he referring only to hon. Gentlemens, or is he allowing for the fact that women are also on the Government Benches?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Perhaps I can help. Members of the Committee should do two things to avoid getting into too much difficulty: first, they should ensure that they are heard, but only when they have been called to speak; secondly, they should refer only to hon. Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I am most grateful for that advice, Mrs. Dunwoody. I apologise to the hon. Member for Warrington, South (Ms Southworth).
<P>
Labour Members do not like what we are saying. They have a smaller Bill than should have been the case. Significant changes, effected through working families tax credit, have been stripped from the Finance Bill and shoved into a social security Bill, the form of which is unclear. Certainly, the Bill would have been huge and the order of clauses much longer had that provision been included.
<P>
Clauses referring to capital gains tax and ISAs, to take but two examples, should arguably not be in the Bill. Had the previous Administration won the last election, they would not have introduced them. The ISA and CGT proposals are, according to practitioners, messy, unnecessary and probably unworkable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Would my hon. Friend care to reflect on the fact that the Bill is shorter because of the amount of secondary legislation that it requires, but that it is also far longer than necessary? That is especially the case with schedule 20, which takes no less than seven pages to define a business asset for the purpose of CGT.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Indeed, my hon. Friend makes the point for me. The Bill is longer and the clauses more numerous than is necessary.
<P>
In conclusion, although we cannot necessarily remove pernicious clauses relating, for instance, to capital gains tax and ISAs, it remains the case that every member of the Committee should be expected to use all the powers, skills and abilities at their disposal to scrutinise the Bill line by line. We cannot remove the clauses, but let both sides of the Committee do their best to improve them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton):</B> I rise also to express deep concern about the quantum scope of the delegated legislation proposed in the Bill. The Government claim to be a listening Government. They will have heard the clamour of concern from the professions in the City of London, including the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners, the tax faculty of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and the Chartered Institute of Taxation, which are all worried about the amount of delegated legislation. The fact that the Government proposed measures in their Budget statement but do not have them ready to include in the Finance Bill demonstrates, as my right hon. Friend said, their arrogance, their contempt of Parliament, which has been demonstrated in other matters, or their incompetence. VAT place of supply, quarterly corporation tax payments, personal pension approval, personal portfolio bonds, European monetary union preparation, code stability and many other matters will be covered by delegated legislation and I am concerned that we shall not see that delegated legislation until after the Bill has been discussed in Committee. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold, I want the clauses to be debated as soon as possible to give the Committee scope and time for debate, but I also want the statutory instruments to be published before we debate the clauses.
<P>
I am also concerned about the scope of the clauses. I have listened carefully to my right hon. and hon. Friends and the examples that they have given. One that has not been mentioned arises in clause 30(1) which amends the Taxes Management Act 1970. New section 59E(5) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Regulations under this section--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) may make such modifications of any provisions of the Taxes Act . . .<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>as the Treasury think necessary or expedient''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If that is not the most draconian Henry VIII clause that ever existed, I do not know what is. It is important that Parliament does not pass legislation that will have such a wide-ranging impact.
<P>
The hon. Member for Dudley, North (Mr. Cranston) intervened in my speech during the Committee stage in the House on Monday last week and quoted John Whiting, a tax partner at Price Waterhouse. He is one of many senior tax figures in the City who are concerned about the growth of delegated legislation in the Bill. The hon. Gentleman misquoted--

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I thought that the hon. Gentleman's reference to clause 30 would be brief. That clause was discussed on the Floor of the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Indeed, Mrs. Dunwoody. I quoted clause 30 as an example of the sort of clause which introduces delegated legislation but does not set out in full the legislation that it purports to introduce. The hon. Member for Dudley, North implied that John Whiting was in favour of the result of clause 30 but he was not. As my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold said, Mr Whiting said that he could see no reason whatsoever why the corporation tax payment system should not be in the Bill. So why have the Government not introduced legislation in the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. The hon. Gentleman said that I misquoted John Whiting. I did not misquote him. I gave a copy of the quotation from the Financial Times to the Hansard reporter.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is not a matter for the Chair. It may be a matter for debate between the hon. Gentlemen and even the Financial Times, but it is not a matter for the Chair.
<P>
<B>Mr Gibb:</B> I have just come from a meeting with John Whiting, who said that he was misquoted during the debate and he probably knows better than the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
The proliferation of delegated legislation in the Bill is of enormous concern. Ian Barlow, head of tax at KPMG, where I worked until 1 May last year, said that such material should be in primary legislation. Richard Collier-Keywood, a partner at Coopers and Lybrand, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I think we are getting perilously close to some constitutional issues.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Institute of Directors said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The dates on which tax is payable and any associated penalties are fundamental matters which should be dealt with in primary legislation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is widespread concern and it is vital that we see the statutory instruments before we debate the clauses. Whether those statutory instruments are in draft form and out for consultation is immaterial.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Does my hon. Friend consider that cause for concern arises not only from the fact that publication of the secondary legislation will be made in the near future, but that the Bill confers powers which, until repealed, secondary legislation can make ad infinitum?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. Even if the Government have provided details of the delegated legislation, they could introduce more when the Committee has finished its deliberations. The matter is of enormous concern. We are not raising these points for the sake of it. There is genuine concern among the Opposition and in the outside world.
<P>
An associated concern is the lack of experience on the Government Benches, with one notable exception. [Hon. Members: ``Who is that?] The Paymaster General, who is not here today.
<P>
There is concern that, because of the Government's lack of business experience, the Inland Revenue is dominating the Government, and measures are being proposed that are not ready for debate because the provisions have not been drafted. I raised that as a point of order on the Floor of the House because, while I was speaking to clause 30, the hon. Member for Dudley, North told me that the draft statutory instruments relating to the clause had been published and asked me whether I had seen them. Of course I had not seen them because they had not been sent to me by the Treasury, and when I went to the Library to get a copy, they were not there. Nor were they there the next morning, nor the next afternoon, until 3.45 pm when the Treasury messenger brought over another batch.
<P>
It is grossly discourteous to the House of Commons and to the Committee that draft and actual statutory instruments have not been made available. I call on the Treasury Front-Bench, through the Chairman, to confirm that any draft or final statutory instruments that become available during the Committee's deliberations will be sent to every member on both sides.
<P>
There is an arrogance about the Government, but it is misplaced because people who have to practise the law have an increasingly contemptuous view of the Government. I quote from Robert Venables QC, a leading tax barrister, who in his book, ``The Personal Tax Planning Review 1997-98'', volume six--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am delighted to hear about members of the legal profession, as long as I am not paying them, but as the gentleman is not a member of the Committee and he is not talking about the arrangement of clauses, which we are debating, perhaps we could allow ourselves the luxury of listening to him on some other occasion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I will abide by your ruling, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Yes, you will.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I shall abandon that quote. However, there is concern about the Government's competence, about whether they are being dominated by technicians in the Inland Revenue and are incapable of understanding the detailed legislation that has been proposed and of applying some form of democratic scrutiny to it. Indeed, there is also concern about the apparent gap between the Budget statement read out by the Chancellor and the contents of the Bill.
<P>
The Chartered Institute of Taxation said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Whilst we appreciate that all proposed taxation changes cannot be specifically announced in the Chancellor's Budget speech, we are concerned that the announcement of many important provisions having immediate effect is given solely by way of a Budget news release.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Retirement relief is one such example. In two paragraphs of the Budget statement, the Chancellor sets out his plans for capital gains tax. He talks about fundamental reform and about encouraging the long-term investor. He talks about a low inflation environment and says that a complex system of indexation is no longer necessary. However, there is no mention of the fact that retirement relief will be abolished, which will have a major impact on entrepreneurs. There was no mention that the Chancellor intended to abolish bed and breakfasting from midnight on the very day of the Budget.
<P>
In the past, Chancellors have mentioned in the Budget speech key changes to tax legislation that will take effect immediately, or indeed any key change to legislation that will take effect in the near future. There is an over use of spin and presentation. The Government are using high profile occasions, such as the Budget, to present Government policy in the best possible light, so they labour points that they believe are good news, such as the introduction of the working families tax credit--although that does not appear in the Finance Bill--and skim over bad news, such as the abolition of retirement relief, bed and breakfasting and other reliefs. There is too much spin and not enough detailed work and hard grind on getting to grips with precisely what the Inland Revenue proposes for them.
<P>
One of the Inland Revenue's proposals is for a huge increase in the burden on business. An enormous number of extra burdens will be placed on business due to the record-keeping requirements in the corporation tax self-assessment provisions. In a learned article in The Tax Journal, Bob Lewis talks about the Bill requiring companies to keep enormous quantities of records, including supporting documents such as accounts, books, deeds, contracts, vouchers and receipts. There is a penalty of up to &#163;3,000 per accounting period for failing to comply. How the measures are interpreted is up to the Inland Revenue, and the whole profession is confused about how it will do that. Bob Lewis says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Perhaps most worrying is the suggestion that where enquiries result in an increase in the corporation tax liability the Inland Revenue will take what it sees as inadequate record keeping as an indication that the return was made negligently. Whilst the larger corporates may view a &#163;3,000 penalty with equanimity the prospect of a tax based penalty is a different matter.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is concern that the burdens on business are becoming enormous, and I have other examples that relate to record keeping for tapering relief and foreign earnings deductions. Those elements of the increasing burden should be debated at great length. If we do not get to them in time or if the timetable does not allow for sufficient debate, the time available should be expanded so that we can discuss them in great detail.
<P>
My final point concerns some of the rewriting of the tax legislation that has taken place in the Bill. I cite in particular examples from schedule 5 in which schedule A provisions have been rewritten. The provisions relate to the taxation of income from land. They have been rewritten in the more understandable language that resulted from the section in the Finance Act 1995 that set up the tax law rewrite project.
<P>
As a member of the steering committee for that project, I am concerned that provisions are appearing in Finance Bills without that committee having considered them. One might ask why anyone should be concerned about that. The Bill will be scrutinised in this Committee and elsewhere, so what does it matter? When legislation is rewritten, ambiguities, which exist in most tax legislation, are ironed out and complicated written phrases are rewritten in simpler language. That means making a decision on an ambiguity one way or the other. The concern is that ambiguities will be written out of legislation in favour of the Inland Revenue and that, prior to the rewrite coming to this Committee, no committee will have scrutinised it to ensure that that has not happened.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am trying to be understanding, but we cannot have a Second Reading debate on particular aspects of the Bill. We are talking about the order in which the clauses and schedules will be considered. That is important. I have allowed a fairly wide debate, but we cannot get into a general debate about the Bill's content or the way in which it is written or rewritten.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I accept your guidance, Mrs. Dunwoody. That was, however, my final point. I want to make sure that plenty of time is devoted to issues that are apparently technical, but which concern the constitution of our country. I want to ensure that the Bill is properly scrutinised so that we know whether ambiguities have been ironed out in favour of the Inland Revenue.
<P>
I could also mention the example of travel expenses in clause 61, but I rest my case there. I hope that the Government will bear my points in mind when we establish the detail of the timetable as we proceed with the Committee's consideration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mrs. Dunwoody. Some members of the Committee were present last year when we debated a Bill that would transfer the power over interest rates from the House of Commons to the Bank of England. We now find ourselves debating a Bill that will transfer the right of taxation from the House of Commons to the Inland Revenue. The Bill is nothing less than a transfer of that historic right, which the House of Commons fought for, won and preserved for centuries. That is what the Bill will destroy. As we debate the order in which the clauses are to be debated, I regret that more prominence is not given to the shameful clauses that do that terrible deed. My right hon. and hon. Friends have already talked about some of those iniquitous clauses and what giving away the House of Common's powers of taxation to Inland Revenue officials will do to this country's constitution.
<P>
What is it about the House of Commons that makes members of the Government so afraid? Is it partly their anxiety that they will lose their majority at the next election? Yes, of course--that has to be their first and foremost concern. Secondly, and more importantly, we learnt this afternoon of another reason why they are afraid of the House of Commons--because so many of them are afraid to speak at all. They would rather see these matters dealt with in quiet ``Yes, Minister'' sessions, with Treasury and Inland Revenue officials huddled round trying to sort out problems as they think fit, rather than expose their ideas and suggestions to open, democratic debate. That is how things have been run in this country up until now, and that is what Labour Members want to change.
<P>
The Liberal Democrat member of this Committee is laughing. The Committee has been sitting for an hour, yet we have not heard a word from the Liberal Democrats, nor seen evidence of a desire to speak.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): You will.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I gather that we will, and we shall certainly welcome that. Not only have Labour Members been thoroughly housetrained by the Treasury officials--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If there is anyone in this Committee of whom the hon. Gentleman should legitimately be frightened, it is the Chair. I repeat, again, that we are debating the order of consideration. We cannot have Second Reading speeches. I shall do my best to ensure that any hon. Member from either side who wants to take part in the debate is called when the occasion arises. In the meantime, hon. Members will stick to what the Chair has decided.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am most grateful to you, Mrs. Dunwoody. As I am sure you will appreciate, I was pointing out those facts because the order in which we debate the clauses will be affected by whether Labour Members intend to speak at all.
<P>
What sort of answers will we be given regarding the clauses? Will Treasury Ministers try to clarify some of the fog that has surrounded the beginning of the Bill's proceedings? We heard that the Chief Secretary to the Treasury is proud of the length of the Bill. It does not take many clauses to give away rights; as my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells and my other hon. Friends have demonstrated, it can be done in one or two clauses.
<P>
I know, Mrs. Dunwoody, that you do not want to hear from those outside the House, but a senior member of the Law Society told me this afternoon that he regarded clause 87, for example, as draconian. It is regrettable that clause 87 has not been brought to the fore in our debate on the order of consideration of clauses. We need to know whether it was the Government's intention to come forward with draconian clauses, or whether they did it without realising it. That is our problem: do Ministers know what they are doing, or are they just signing the paperwork that Treasury officials put in front of them?
<P>
Incidentally, one reason why clause 87 is so draconian is that it appears to impose a tax of 15 per cent. every year on a particular class of investment, so that after six years the capital value of such a bond will be wiped out. That is confiscatory and draconian, and has no place in any Finance Bill. It should not be up for debate--it should be dismissed before we reach it.
<P>
What is the motivation of Ministers and the Inland Revenue? If we understand the motivation, it may help our debate. Paragraph 15 of the Board of Inland Revenue guidance notes to clause 87 states that the case of CIR v. Willoughby was decided in the House of Lords last year, and that the House of Lords found against the Revenue in that case.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are debating the order of consideration. Hon Members may refer briefly to the content of every clause, and may in specific terms expand on their views about why clauses or schedules should be considered in a different order to that proposed. I shall not, however, allow a detailed debate about clauses until we come to them. I seek not be draconian--to use a fashionable word--but we should for once stick to what we are supposed to be doing.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody. I am guided by your comments. I have not taken part in such an extended debate on the clauses before, so this is a new experience for me. I am grateful for your understanding.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We are all on a learning curve.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> My point was that if the Government are overriding the House of Lords, clause 87 should be considered before the others. It represents the peak of the arrogance of the Inland Revenue, which is aided and abetted by the Government in overriding the common law.
<P>
Retrospective clauses should be debated first and foremost. A Finance Bill should not contain retrospective clauses. It is a great tribute to the previous Government that they sought in every way not to impose retrospective legislation. An approach that was a black mark against previous Labour Governments is re-emerging: they indulge in retrospective legislation. That is evident, for example, in the capital gains tax rules for reinvestment relief, now the deferral relief. The benefit to the alternative investment market has been taken away. I understand that the Chief Secretary has engaged in discussions with representatives of that market--or at least that other Labour Members have. I hope that he is listening to what they say. It is not enough to say that an environment is being created for new investment in risk-taking companies if a way is not provided for the investors to pass on their investment for others. There must be a follow through.
<P>
Retrospective elements are also evident in the taxation of overseas earnings. Why should someone who went abroad a couple of months ago, expecting that his or her negotiated earnings package would not suffer tax in this country, return in a year's time to face a tax bill of 30 or 40 per cent? That policy is also unfair. The Committee should debate the clause that relates to overseas earnings very early in its deliberations, so that such people are fully acquainted with these matters.
<P>
Indeed, for construction companies that have just entered contracts based on rates of pay that they thought would be tax free--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Members of the public are not allowed to join the Committee. We are a democratic Government, but we cannot take things too far.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody. I was about to speak about the construction industry. Construction companies will have problems fulfilling contracts when people whom they thought could be persuaded to work for them on a tax-free basis overseas are not able to do so. The pay was tax-free in the country in which they were working. It is for the country in question to decide whether they should receive their pay tax free, not this country.
<P>
My last example is property of historic interest. I know that the Committee must make progress. A strata of agreements have been entered into in good faith, between the Inland Revenue and individuals, concerning access to such property. The Government now say that all such contracts are up for renegotiation. That is where the Government are going wrong.
<P>
Having dealt with the unconstitutional and retrospective aspects, the last aspect that we should debate is the haphazard nature of so much of the Bill--the way in which it hurts one and lets off another. I am told that the rules on foreign trusts hurt the Paymaster General but do not hurt many others in a similar situation. We sometimes applaud that hapazzard nature--sometimes we feel a certain schadenfreude--but at other times we wonder what it is all for. Why is it, for example, that the clauses on gaming duty have been so badly framed, as we heard from my right hon. Friend the Member for cities of London and Westminster during the debate on the Floor of the House a couple of weeks ago? Why is it that new regulations have been introduced for travel insurance--which I broadly welcome if they level the playing field in that industry--which have an incidental knock-on cost for many health insurance companies that provide travel insurance as an add-on extra and marketing benefit for their customers? One such company is based in my constituency, and is worried about the effects on its business and on the constituency work that I do for it.
<P>
We should also consider the case of professionals, who have been through the mill in the past few months as the Government have threatened them with the most difficult regime imaginable. They are facing an oppressive new system of taxation, which might well have forced many of them into bankruptcy. That shows that the Government, throughout their deliberations, have not understood or realised the ramifications of their proposals. Their proposals last year for a pensions tax have ended up as a complete change in the administration of corporation tax in this country. Labour Ministers lack understanding of these matters. Some of my hon. Friends have suggested that that is because they lack business experience but--as we shall see during this debate--it is also because they lack common sense. The aim of Opposition Members will be, above all, to inject some common sense into our deliberations.

<P>

<B>Mr. Michael Fallon: </B>(Sevenoaks): With your usual fair-minded chairmanship, Mrs. Dunwoody, you have allowed a fairly wide-ranging debate. It has been an important debate.
<P>
Too many of the Bill's clauses--as my hon. Friends have pointed out--are retrospective or arbitrary; they delegate responsibility to officials or they are simply ill-thought out. It is important to place that on record and to ensure that those who follow the Committee's proceedings are aware of how much is either being hidden from these proceedings or will be dealt with after the proceedings have finished.
<P>
I would like to thank those of my hon. Friends who have contributed to the debate. We regret--although we are not surprised--that Labour Members have not commented on the arbitrary nature of the powers. The nodding donkeys of last year have been replaced by the silence of the lambs. We look forward, however, to some contributions from Labour Members.
<P>
This is an extraordinary Bill in many respects. It hands over power after power to officials or Ministers to make provision by regulation. In at least 20 clauses, provisions will be made by regulation. It is all the more important to point that out as, under the negative resolution procedure, we have so few opportunities even to consider regulations.
<P>
Opposition Members would have preferred a rather different order of consideration. Perhaps the Chief Secretary would consider, even at this late hour, grouping together some of the clauses by which provision will be made by regulation. We count at least 20 such clauses, and it might be to the Committee's advantage for those clauses to be taken separately. If he is not prepared to consider such action, I hope that, in response to a point made by one of my hon. Friends, he will at least give an undertaking that where draft regulations are ready, they will be placed in the Library of the House and made available to members of the Committee and--more importantly--to those who are following our proceedings from outside the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> This has been a lengthy debate. I should point out--not for the Committee's benefit but for that of those who follow our proceedings--that my hon. Friends have not said anything because they are extremely happy with the Government's proposed order of consideration. Frankly, they can hardly wait to debate the clauses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> I shall give way in a moment.
<P>
The Opposition's speeches took me back several years. They complained about all sorts of deficiencies in the Bill--and there are many ways in which it could be improved--but we have now spent over an hour debating the order in which to debate the clauses. By now--who knows?--we could have reached clause 6, 7, 8, 9 or even 15 and debated the alleged shortcomings about which they complain. But they did not let us do that; instead, they went running round the course making the wild, general accusations that Oppositions are wont to make. I know what they were doing, because I have seen it before. We did that some 18 years before we were returned to power, and Opposition Members might reflect on how they might usefully spend that length of time. I know that three out of four members of the Conservative party do not believe that they will win the next election, but perhaps we have more than our fair share of such doubters in this Committee. They may have decided that they have nothing better to do than filibuster or spend an inordinate length of time at cheese and wine parties in the City.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I can only indulge so many Committee members. I should point out that the same rules apply to the Minister as to other Committee members. It would be helpful if he would return to the order of consideration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> Indeed I shall, Mrs. Dunwoody. I was half expecting a crunching tackle from behind.
<P>
I shall give way to the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and then reply to the points--such as they were--that the Opposition raised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> This has been an important debate because we pointed out some of the Bill's wider implications, which concern people in the City and elsewhere in the professions. We are surprised that Labour Members have not contributed to our debate. If they support the Bill, they should make contributions to that effect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> Again, I do not wish to stray too far. This is the eighth time that I have sat on the Finance Bill Committee. In the previous Parliament it was noticeable that members of the then Government were equally keen to support the relevant Finance Bill and sometimes did not make the contributions that we might have expected them to make. My hon. Friends will make the contributions that they want to make in the way that they think appropriate. This debate is on the ordering of the clauses, and my hon. Friends are extremely happy with the proposed order and want to get on with debating them.
<P>
The hon. Members for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) and for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon) asked whether we could take the clauses in a different order. I am bound to say--this is not a private matter and it does not breach any confidences--that we debate clauses that are of particular interest to the Opposition on the Floor of the House. Those clauses are picked not by the Government but by agreement through the usual channels. All the clauses that were debated on the Floor of the House were nominated by most of the Conservative party, and one clause was nominated by the Liberal Democrats.
<P>
Moreover, the ordering of clauses that would apply in this Committee was discussed at the time. I remember asking the shadow Ministers, ``Have you any views on the order in which we should consider clauses? The order in which they are taken really does not matter to the Government.'' In the first Finance Bill Committee on which I sat, the clauses were taken way out of order to accommodate Ministers who had commitments outside the House, and the Opposition were entirely understanding of that.
<P>
Had the Opposition wanted a different order of consideration they could have had it, becuase the order does not matter to us one jot. We are willing to consider any suggestions--from inside or outside the House--about how to improve the Bill, but the order in which we do so does not matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Surely the First Secretary appreciates that the extent to which the Government, with this Bill, intend to take away the House of Commons' historic powers is taking some time to sink in. It is a dramatic change and quite different from anything contemplated by the previous Government. No reasonable Member of Parliament, picking up a Finance Bill to look at the minutiae of it, would realise how far the Labour party is taking the principle of the Inland Revenue running the country's taxation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> I appreciate that the honourable Gentleman, being relatively new to the House, may not have grasped that, but those on the Opposition Front Bench, who were Ministers in the previous Government and are well used to Finance Bills--indeed the shadow Chief Secretary was a finance Minister for many years--might have looked through the Bill. If the honourable Gentleman thought that there was something that should be debated at the front, the middle or the back of the Bill, on the Floor of the House or wherever, he might have drawn it to our attention and it could easily have been accommodated.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman should also be aware that I am not the First Secretary to the Treasury: technically he is the occupant of No. 10. I rank some way down the list.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Will the Chief Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> I shall, but the hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) neatly takes me on to the next point that I wanted to make. He referred earlier to the length of the Bill. I repeat: this is not the longest Finance Bill--far from it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> In the new spirit of openness that the Chief Secretary has just enunciated to the Committee, will he consider taking away the sittings motion and bringing it back, so that we can discuss the 20 clauses in which there is secondary legislation first? We could debate the clauses in the order in which they are today and then have a new sittings motion next time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are not on the sittings motion. If we can be clear about what we are debating, we might get along a little faster.
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> If we did what the hon. Gentleman suggests, that would waste another two weeks of the Committee's valuable time and I do not think that anybody wants that, least of all those to whom the hon. Gentleman refers.
<P>
The shadow Chief Secretary took exception at the start of his remarks to clause 158(4), which he said he had just noticed in front of him, although I saw that he had it marked before he sat down, so perhaps it was not quite as spontaneous as that. Because my memory failed me for a moment, I looked at clause 158. When I saw that it referred to the European single currency I realised that it was no accident. We all know that the very thought of that makes Conservative Members foam at the mouth. The right hon. Gentleman took exception to subsection (4). He complained that it gives power to make regulations that include
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``(a) power to impose charges to taxation;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>  (b) to amend or repeal any enactment; and<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>  (c) power to make such incidental, supplemental, consequential and transitional provision as appears to the Treasury to be appropriate.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I see nothing wrong with that in the context of the clause, as I shall demonstrate. It was synthetic anger on the part of Conservative Members.
<P>
I could take an example from another measure:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Treasury may by regulations make provision for securing that enactments and subordinate legislation which--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (a) apply in relation to government securities or to any description of such securities''.<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Could hon. Members and Ministers show some kindness to those making the official record? First, if hon. Members wish to quote, will they please identify what they are quoting and quote briefly? Secondly, will all hon. Members address the Chair? Thirdly, could hon. Members remember that the sterling words in the Committee, as we have been told several times, are being hung upon outside? If they are recorded accurately, it might help everybody.
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> I shall do just that, Mrs. Dunwoody. Let me first slow down. I was referring to the regulations, which go on to say that the Treasury can make regulations.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``with such modifications as the Treasury may think appropriate in consequence of the making of any provision or arrangements for, or in connection with, the issue or transfer of strips of government securities''.<P>

<P>
It goes on to say that the regulations under this subsection may
<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``(b) include provision applying generally to, or to any description of, entactments''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It even makes reference to incidental, supplemental, consequential and transitional arrangements.
<P>
You asked me where all this came from, Mrs. Dunwoody. I will tell you where it came from. It is a quote from the Finance Act 1996, for which Conservative Members voted. The shadow Chief Secretary was a Minister in the Government who presented that Bill to Parliament, yet he tells us that the four lines in clause 158 are objectionable.
<P>
Under clause 202 of the Finance Act 1996, two pages worth of powers are given to the Treasury to make regulations for gilt-stripping, which some of us then in opposition remember spending many happy hours discussing. It is an extremely complex subject; we recognised that we might, in government, have to make subsequent regulations.
<P>
However, to return to clause 158, if the shadow Chief Secretary reads the entire section--I recall that when we discussed last year's Finance Bill and Bank of England Act, Conservative Members had a habit of reading not the entire clause, but only one part of it--he will realise that clause 158(4) derives its powers from the preceding three subsections. In other words, it is not a blanket power; it is a perfectly normal way to allow Government to make regulations to take account of the single European currency that will be introduced from January next year--and that causes Conservative Members such distress.
<P>
The shadow Chief Secretary also complained about other measures. He referred to offshore trusts. Having had urges for months to close tax loopholes, Conservative Members are now against doing so. He complained bitterly about measures relating to corporation tax. The measures in the Bill follow extensive consultation with the Confederation of British Industry and others, because we are anxious to get it right.
<P>
The shadow Chief Secretary complains that the measures in relation to national insurance are not in the Finance Bill. As a previous Treasury Minister he knows that they are not in the Bill because they are not competent to be included in a Finance Bill. He should remember that, because when the previous Conservative Government increased national insurance contributions in 1992--breaking yet another election promise--they had to introduce separate legislation.
<P>
Conservative Members have advanced no reason why we should not consider the clauses in the order suggested in my motion. There is every reason to proceed, and to start to examine the clauses. That would not only cheer up Labour Members but would greatly encourage those outside the House who follow proceedings in great detail and would like to see the Opposition coming to close quarter and analysing the provisions, rather than making general points that go nowhere.
<P>
I urge the Committee to support the order of consideration. Not only did it have the general assent of Conservative Members until 4.30 this afternoon, but it would greatly assist the good governance of the country and speedy and thorough consideration of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I remind the Chief Secretary that I said that we would not vote against the motion. We recognise that the clauses are in a certain sequence, and there are disadvantages to any order. However, the Bill has certain themes and repeated characteristics that could, with advantage, be considered together. We therefore wanted at the start of the proceedings to highlight our anxieties about certain issues. We shall return to those issues on each clause in which they recur, but I alert the Committee to the fact that we regard the excessive use of regulations as a matter of concern.
<P>
I understand that my example of clause 158 was slightly embarrassing to the Government on a day when the Prime Minister has discovered that they play hard ball in the European Union. He was entirely unprepared for the sort of political argument with which he failed to grapple.
<P>
The Chief Secretary asserted at this stage that the powers were ``normal'', an assertion to which we shall return, because several observers do not take that view.
<P>
Therefore, we shall be submitting this to the arbitrament of several outside bodies. Indeed, research is being done into this issue. We shall test that assertion in due course.
<P>
Half an hour ago or more, I said that all Governments and all Finance Bills use secondary legislation. There are administrative details which it is sensible to put into regulations. What is different about this Bill is that there are major tax provisions, such as corporation tax payments, about which the Bill is entirely silent. We look in vain for any guidance for taxpayers as to when they will have to make those payments and what the penalties and provisions will be if they fail to make them on time. To delegate that entire chunk of legislation to regulation is unprecedented. We shall return to that point later.
<P>
The other point that the Chief Secretary made was about the loopholes--as he now describes them--for offshore trusts. It is progress that he now concedes that the Paymaster General has been making use of a loophole. Our case is not that it is wrong to take measures to stop tax avoidance where it is unjustifiable--we were querying their enforceability. If the right hon. Gentleman and his colleagues do not listen to our points and respond to the questions we asked, rather than the questions that he would have liked us to ask, all our proceedings will be prolonged.
<P>
Another example was the right hon. Gentleman's observation about national insurance contributions. In my opening speech, I said that I understood that such contributions were not included in Finance Bills, but should be in other legislation produced either simultaneously or soon afterwards, as had been signalled in the Budget speech. However they are not; they are not even in the Red Book--the Budget statement. That was an example of something enticing being offered in the Budget speech that is not being enacted. I contrasted that with measures of a less desirable nature, such as the abolition of bed-and-breakfasting operations for capital gains tax payers, which were omitted from the Budget speech, but are included in the Finance Bill. I was right to draw attention to that imbalance and disjunction between the Chancellor's words and what the Committee seeks to debate. It would have been useful if, even if those clauses could not have been grouped together, an asterisk could have been put alongside those that the Chancellor announced in his Budget speech and those that he did not.
<P>
As I said, we do not intend formally to oppose the motion. It has brought out several useful themes. Judging by the non-reply of the Chief Secretary, we shall have hand-to-hand combat later, which we shall relish.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That the Order in which proceedings in Standing Committee on the Finance (No. 2) Bill are to be taken shall be Clauses 2 to 6, Clauses 8 and 9, Clauses 12 to 16, Schedule 1, Clauses 17 to 20, Schedule 2, Clauses 21 to 24, Clause 26, Clauses 28 and 29, Clause 31, Schedule 3, Clauses 32 to 35, Schedule 4, Clauses 36 to 38, Schedule 5, Clauses 39 to 44, Schedule 6, Clauses 45 and 46, Schedule 7, Clauses 47 to 57, Schedule 8, Clause 58, Schedule 9, Clauses 59 to 61, Schedule 10, Clause 62, Schedule 11, Clauses 63 to 70, Schedule 12, Clauses 71 to 74, Schedule 13, Clause 139, Clauses 76 to 84, Schedule 14, Clauses 85 to 90, Schedule 15, Clauses 91 to 106, Schedule 16, Clauses 107 to 111, Schedule 17, Clauses 112 to 115, Schedules 18 and 19, Clauses 116 to 118, Schedules 20 and 21, Clauses 120 to 124, Clause 138, Clauses 125 to 129, Schedule 22, Clause 130, Schedule 23, Clauses 131 to 135, Schedule 24, Clauses 136 to 137, Clause 140, Schedule 25, Clauses 141 to 146, Clauses 148 to 155, Schedule 26, Clauses 156 to 161, New Clauses, New Schedules, Schedule 27.<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 24, leave out subsection (3).
<P>
I welcome you to the Chair, Mrs. Dunwoody. You said earlier that we are all on a learning curve. As a new Member of Parliament, I am still on a steep learning curve. During Committee proceedings, I am sure that you will have reason to give me a lesson or two, and the benefit of your wisdom will straighten me out on that curve. I look forward to those lessons with great expectation.
<P>
Amendment No. 1 connects with our previous debate because the reason why the Committee should accept the amendment relates to the way in which a regulation on sparkling premium ciders is enforced by Customs and Excise. I listened with interest to the previous debate and wondered whether I should participate. There were some notable contributions explaining why regulations must be debated in the House. I enjoyed the insightful contribution of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The first lesson that the hon. Gentleman might like to learn is that we do not go backwards. Once we have managed to stagger through one amendment, we go on to the next--which he is moving.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I have great sympathy with your remarks, Mrs. Dunwoody, so I shall proceed.
<P>
The amendment is very important, although it relates to just a few small businesses, because it is the duty of the House to scrutinise legislation on behalf of all sections of society. The amendment does not, like the previous one, relate to the removal of an historic power of the House of Commons, but it concerns a measure that is very important for a few businesses in Somerset.
<P>
I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Minister for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath), who raised this important issue on Second Reading. I am grateful to him, and to the hon. Minister for Hereford (Mr. Keetch), who is chairman of the all-party cider group. Both those hon. Gentlemen have given me some lessons, and, with the benefit of their knowledge and understanding--not to say direct experience--of cider and the cider industry, I feel able to give the Committee some clear background in support of the amendment.
<P>
In general, cider makers, and the National Association of Cider Makers, are content with the Government's approach to cider duty. They feel that this Government, and their predecessor, handled matters to do with excise duties on all alcohol very sensitively. However, some cider makers believe that there is a case for a rethink on the point covered by the amendment; indeed, they would like further refinement of the regulation applying to the special duty in question.
<P>
The issue is quite difficult and complex. It arises from a complaint from the Italian Government to the European Commission. There is currently a low tax in this country on sparkling and premium ciders, relative to excise duty on weaker sparkling wines. The Italians were concerned that that was not a level playing field--to use a hackneyed phrase that I am sure we shall hear often in Committee--and was discriminating primarily against the products of Italian wine makers. They felt that Britain needed to level up its excise duties.
<P>
Her Majesty's Customs and Excise investigated the matter, working with the National Association of Cider Makers, and realised that if a discrimination case went before the European Court of Justice the Italians were likely to win. Therefore, the Government, working with the Commission, decided that there was a case for alignment of the relevant duty rates. That policy was initiated by the previous Government and has been continued by the present Government.
<P>
A problem still exists with respect to the detailed implementation of the decision to level up the rate.
<P>
I refer the Committee to a regulation, which I am sure hon. Members know well, which affects the impact that the duty has on particular types of cider. It results from the 1996 Budget and defines sparkling premium ciders. It states that there should be a separate rate of duty for
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``sparkling cider and perry defined as exceeding 5.5 per cent. alcohol by volume (abv) but less than 8.5 per cent. alcohol abv which is contained in bottles with `mushroom stoppers' held in place by ties or fastening, or which has an excess pressure due to carbon dioxide solution of three bar or more.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The problem with that regulation is that it does not achieve what the Government, the Commission or the Italian Government wanted. It is carefully crafted; there has been consultation on it and co-operation with the cider makers. The National Association of Cider Makers believes that it will help some cider makers to get round the problem. Its advice is that cider makers who are worried about the increase in duty for premium ciders should reduce their strength. Of course, reducing the strength of ciders is not necessarily a popular device for cider aficionados--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Or for the Chair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I share that concern, as do other members of the Committee. Sometimes, the stronger the cider, the better it is.
<P>
The other advice that the association gives cider makers is that they can keep the pressure of their cider below the 3 bars or use bottles without mushroom stoppers and ties. But the Committee and the House want to preserve the traditions of cider makers and other great craftsmen. Cider makers oppose the changes because they believe that they will get in the way of the long tradition of cider making and drinking in some parts of the country.
<P>
The ingenious device to try to get round this discriminatory problem does not work in practice because it hits some cider makers but not producers of sparkling wines. That is why the Italian Government first complained. The problem is that there were counterfeit producers of Lambrusco in this country--[Laughter]. This is directly relevant; I hope that hon. Members are paying attention, because I am advancing a detailed argument. Something sold as Lambrini Bianco was produced in Liverpool and sold in a bottle with a picture of Venice on the label. That caused great dismay among Italian Lambrusco producers, who were worried about the effects on their sales. That is what made them bring the case to the European Commission--[Laughter.] Not even intended, but I am glad that you enjoyed it.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. As the hon. Gentleman knows, ``you'' in this Committee means me, and I enjoyed it very much.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> Yes. Customs and Excise have not done the right job in tackling the counterfeiters based in Liverpool. The 3 bars pressure was crucial; it had a bearing on the regulations. Lambrini Bianco has a pressure of 1 bar or less, so its producers will escape having to pay the higher duty. The problem remains; the counterfeiters will not have to pay the higher excise duty, whereas the small, legal, honest and decent producers of traditional ciders will.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am fascinated by the hon. Gentleman's great knowledge, although I am sure that there are no producers in his constituency. Does he agree with the principle that purveyors and manufacturers of this filthy Italian substance should be able to impose a change on the age-old English industry of cider production through the methods that he cites? If so, would he take issue with the way in which they went to the European Commission in 1995 and brought about all the changes in the first place?
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I would not take issue with that, because they were objecting to the way in which some people were counterfeiting their product. All hon. Members should show their displeasure when businesses try to counterfeit other businesses' products. One cannot complain about the Italian Government's original complaint; the problem is that the Commission and Her Majesty's Customs and Excise, have not produced the correct solution. That is my bone of contention. I do not believe that it is past the wit of man to come up with a solution that will hit the counterfeiters but allow the honest cider makers of Somerset to produce their traditional ciders in a way they have done for many a long year.
<P>
I hope that when she answers the debate the Minister will at least feel able to tell us that she will instruct her officials to review the regulation to see whether they can find some way to meet the aspirations and hopes of all cider makers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> As a Somerset Member I must contribute to the debate. Although it was the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome who originated the debate on Second Reading, and whose opinions were very much behind the remarks we have just heard, it is nevertheless a Somersetwide issue. I represent 14 cider makers including the large public company Matthew Clark which is based in Shepton Mallet and is now, after Bulmers, the biggest cider maker in the country. I also represent Mr. Morris who ferments the well-known Kneecracker and Stotts Superb, the delicious brew made at Wookey just outside Wells.
<P>
There are a number of other similar brews of varying quality. I remember visiting one farmer who gave me a pint of rather cloudy liquid saying, ``Drink this it will put some lead in your pencil.'' I was not quite sure what he meant, but it was a very bracing libation although it was not commercially available for a reason that I found out. A connoisseur would call it acidic.
<P>
I have a strong and direct constituency interest in the debate but in my time in the Treasury I was convinced that the law had to be obeyed. I am the last person to fall automatically into line with the edicts from Brussels, but nevertheless, I think the Financial Secretary will tell us shortly that we were subject to infraction proceedings and therefore what has flowed from that is outside our control. If she can confirm my recollection that we had to raise the duties in the way that is being continued in this Bill, I do not see that it is very clever to try to defy that law by leaving out the relevant clause or part of it.
<P>
We heard from the Liberal Democrats in the statement this afternoon that they are fully behind the Government in breaking the Maastricht treaty over the convergence criteria and the appointment of the president of the European Central Bank. Perhaps one should not be altogether surprised that they are adding to their list of crimes by suggesting here that we break European law and the harmonisation provisions of the relevant directive.
<P>
Wiser counsel should perhaps prevail, particularly as that agreement has got the support, as I understand it, of the National Association of Cider Makers. Again, if my recollection is right, it conceded that we had to fall into line however regrettably, and it is not holding out in favour of the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey).
<P>
One reason may be that it is perhaps a not very well kept secret, but an important fact nonetheless, that cider makers who make up to 1,540 gallons a year are entirely exempt from excise duties. That does not apply to anyone else in the drinks trade. The great majority of the cider makers whom I represent are not caught by these tax revisions. I am sure that the Minister will tell me if I am wrong about that matter. In another debate, the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome gave examples regarding the cases of one or two individuals. However, they do not pay any duty because they fall below that threshold.
<P>
If I were a cider maker, I would not want to make too much of the concession. It is an historic concession that dates back to the time when cider making was a cottage or farm industry. Some of the medium-sized cider making enterprises probably cluster just below the threshold. However, 1,540 gallons is a lot of cider, and they are exempt from the tax.
<P>
I do not plan to support the amendment, but I await the Minister's response before making a final judgment.

<P>

<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury </B>(Dawn Primarolo): After the comments of the right Hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory), if I went to Somerset, I should be extremely careful if I were offered a glass with cloudy liquid in it. It is not surprising that that item is not commercially available.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells is correct in his recollection that infraction proceedings were initiated by the Italians against the previous Government.
<P>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton made several errors in his contribution, which were also made in debates on the Floor of the House by his hon. Friend the Member for Taunton (Jackie Ballard). The product complained about by the Italians was called Fastini Spumante. That is apparently a sparkling perry. Some hon. Members may be familiar with it, but no doubt those with discerning palates, like you, Mrs. Dunwoody, and me, would not know of it. It is a sparkling perry, 7.5 per cent., packaged in a mushroom-stoppered bottle. It is like Asti Spumante, but not like Lambrusco, as has been stated previously.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells also pointed out--I hope that he will be as helpful to the Government on other clauses--that the majority of cider makers--the National Association of Cider Makers--agree with the actions of the previous Government, and the continuing actions of this Government, in honouring an agreement that resulted from the infraction proceedings against the UK Government.
<P>
It was made clear that the agreement had been carefully crafted by Customs and Excise in consultation with the industry. It was also approved by the Commission. I cannot remember whether the right hon. Member for Wells was still a Minister at that time and was involved in that matter.
<P>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton referred particularly to the smaller, niche market products. He said that a legal definition was necessary. In this case, we have a definition that is as tightly drawn as it can be.
<P>
The amendment would be extremely unhelpful. I urge hon. Members to vote against it, because it would leave us in severe difficulties in terms of the likely action of the Commission and future action against the Government proceeding from the infraction initiative.
<P>
The proposals, as agreed, give the industry the best opportunities for adjusting to the requirements imposed on the Government. I ask the Committee to reject the amendment and support the clause, which is honouring the agreements of the previous Government as a result of the infraction proceedings. It is the best way forward both for the Government and the industry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> The Minister's remarks were helpful and I hope that she will allow my hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome to write to her if he wants to raise outstanding matters on behalf of his constituents. Her argument was compelling. However, some of the remarks of the right hon. Member for Wells were not especially compelling. He tends to revert to such European arguments and I am sure that he will continue to do so and attack my party. He did not strengthen his argument, however. The Minister's argument was convincing, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>Rates of duty on wine and made-wine</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Clause 3 is about the revalorisation of wine. It increases the rate of duty on most wines and made-wines, except low-strength sparkling and made-wine of a strength exceeding 22 per cent., in line with inflation from 1 January 1999. The changes do not represent a real increase. They are necessary to maintain the revenue in real terms and I urge the Committee to support the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): In proposing to index the duty on wine, the Government have failed to deal with a problem that they recognised when they were in opposition. Prior to the general election, the Financial Secretary said that a Labour Government would recognise the scale and seriousness of the problem of cross-border shopping. The clause does nothing to honour that commitment to the industry.
<P>
The notes on clauses say that, compared with rates of duty in January 1994, excise duty on wine has fallen by 5 per cent. in real terms. However, since then, the extent of cross-border shopping between the United Kingdom and our neighbours in France and Belgium has increased dramatically. The opportunities for cross-channel travel have increased dramatically, too, and the cost of that travel has fallen significantly. We are beginning to reach the stage at which further increases in duty on wines and spirits, even to maintain the real value of those duties, take us to the point of diminishing returns to the Treasury as the habit of cross-border shopping and, indeed, criminal smuggling of dutiable liquors and tobacco from Europe develops further.
<P>
The Government seem to have their head in the sand. They recognise that there is a problem, but the proposal under clause 3 does nothing to address it. We are told that the market for wine in the United Kingdom has fallen by 2 per cent. We recognise that the consumption of wine has not fallen by 2 per cent. I am doing my level best to shore up the market and I am sure that other Members of the House of Commons have not been lacking in that regard either. The clear implication is that both legal importation by means of cross-border shipping and illegal importation in the form of cross-border smuggling is increasing at a rate that should concern the Government.
<P>
I want to address two separate issues. The first is organised crime. There is clear evidence that organised crime is becoming increasingly involved in the smuggling of not only tobacco and beer but wines and spirits, with which the clause deals. That perhaps began as a relatively harmless activity, involving importations of small quantities of dutiable liquors purchased on the continent. We now read in the press that Dover has become something of a wild west town with no-go areas that are unsafe to enter at night.
<P>
The consequences of that for the United Kingdom should be considered not only in terms of the overall effect on the culture of law and order that we have traditionally enjoyed but of the social consequences that stem from the uncontrolled distribution of alcohol imported illegally, and thus not subject to the relatively well-organised controls on distriubtion and end sale of the legitimate trade, which the legitimate wine and spirit industry is anxious to foster. I am thinking especially of the problems of under-age drinking. More than one study has shown that illegally imported alcohol is a significant source of supply for illegal under-age drinkers.
<P>
The second related point concerns the legal cross-border shopping activities of an increasing proportion of the population. My point relates not only to wine but to tobacco, beer and spirits--items that are purchased with increasing frequency in the European Union and legally imported for own consumption in the United Kingdom.
<P>
The trip to Calais has become an increasingly regular feature of the lives of middle-class families in the south-east of England. We have seen a gap open up between people who live in practical striking distance of a regular day trip to Calais and those who do not, and between people who are able to take advantage of opportunities to buy in bulk ahead of their consumption needs and those who are not. Many middle-class families can make a trip across to Calais on the ferry with the family car two or three times a year and purchase their alcohol and tobacco for several months to come. That option is not open to low-income households, to households without a car, or to the pensioner family which enjoys the odd bottle of wine with a meal.
<P>
By allowing that practice to continue, the Government are widening the gap between the opportunities available to those who have and to those who have not. I should have thought that that issue was likely to be of special concern to the Government. The pensioner sees the price of his tobacco and alcohol treats rising in the shop, while he sees that his more affluent neighbours are able quite legally to avoid those increases altogether.
<P>
People who for economic or transportation reasons do not have the opportunity to avoid such taxes may well be tempted to purchase from criminal importers, who bring products into the United Kingdom for resale and take them to all parts of the country--including those beyond easy reach of the cross-channel ferries--and to consumers in the south-east of England who for various socio-economic reasons are unlikely themselves to go to buy wines legally in Calais.
<P>
<B>Mr. Derek Twigg </B>(Halton): Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that middle-class families in the south buy alcohol and tobacco legally, but those in the north rely on smugglers and contraband?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am simply making a fairly obvious point that a system of importation that depends on the consumer going to Dover, getting on a ferry to Calais, buying the stuff and coming back, is much easier for someone who lives within two or three hours' drive from Dover than someone who lives further away. People who live further away must be tempted to bring the middleman into the equation.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Twigg:</B> In the north.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The hon. Gentleman says, ``In the north.'' Perhaps for the benefit of the now absent Liberal Democrat Member, we could say, ``In the south-west.''
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I want to assure my hon. Friend that there is a long tradition of smuggling in Cornwall.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I know that my hon. Friend comes from a long line of distinguished Cornishmen, and he should know better than anyone. Let me assure the Committee that I am not attempting to cast any aspersion on people who live outside the golden crescent of easy access to Dover. I am simply referring to the gaps in society that are opening up. Those who have the economic ability or who are conveniently located or who have the means of transport can avoid such duties perfectly legally.

<P>

<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> My hon. Friend might be aware of the brewers trade reports on smuggling that have contained analyses of heavily laden vehicles noted during 24-hour vigils. In fact, outside London, the worst offenders come from the northern parts of the country: Sheffield was the worst with 57 vehicles, Birmingham had 46, and Newcastle upon Tyne had 36, compared with just 33 for his own area--Guildford--and only 22 right on the south coast in Brighton.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention, which is probably intended to show that his constituents are marginally more law abiding than mine and considerably more law abiding than some others. I am sure that it is a very politically incorrect to suggest that, but the point is well made.
<P>
In opposition, the Financial Secretary recognised the problem and gave the industry every indication that a Labour Government would deal with it head on. The United Kingdom alcoholic drinks industry employs 500,000 people. It expected the Labour party in government to honour the pledges that it made in opposition--it expected the Government seriously to address the issue of alcohol taxation.
<P>
Instead of bringing forward proposals indexing duties, which does nothing to address the underlying problem, the industry expected the Government to introduce proposals for a managed reduction in the importance of alcohol taxation and to change how it is collected to recognise the unavoidable, irreversible trend towards cross-border shopping. From the consumer's point of view, that trend has been one of the great benefits of the integration of the European market, but from the Treasury's point of view, it poses a real challenge, which the Bill does nothing to address.
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaun Woodward </B>(Witney): This important amendment is designed to benefit every consumer, employer and, of course, employee in the United Kingdom. Sadly, at the beginning of this important Bill, we find a clause that is designed to clobber every man and woman by trying to grab the money from their wallets with a tax that the Government promised they would not introduce--yet it is bang, smash at the beginning of the Bill. It is part of a lengthy and savage tax-raising Bill, which, along with the other 17 tax rises under the Finance (No. 2) Act 1997, makes people worse off to the tune of about &#163;1,000. It is a mean tax because, along with taxes on beer and other drinks, it is designed to make people's lives less pleasurable. Under the present Government, they will need every pleasure they can get.
<P>
On 17 March, the Chancellor of the Exchequer told the House that, from 1 January, duty on alcohol would be uprated in the normal way. It was interesting to note that, during his Budget statement, the Chancellor did not extend such a privilege to the spirits industry. We can only wonder why such a privilege was not to be shared with those north of the border, although he was prepared to hit everyone else in the United Kingdom. He spoke about uprating alcohol duty in the normal way, but that tax is anything but normal. It is a bad tax; it is an exploitative tax and it is a highly selective and corrosive tax.
<P>
There is undoubtedly a huge difference between the actions of the previous and the present Governments with respect to the taxation of wines. The essential difference is that the Conservative Government froze the duties on wine and beer in our last Budget. Why did we do that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Derek Twigg:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman saying that it took the Conservatives 17 years to realise the error of their ways?
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman repeat the question?
<P>
<B>Mr. Twigg:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman saying that it took the Conservative Government 17 years to realise the error of their ways?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Mr. Woodward, on the error of the previous Government's ways.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am grateful, Mrs. Dunwoody, to have the opportunity to answer the hon. Gentleman. Indeed, I am grateful that you should invite me to talk about the error of our ways. There were, of course, very few errors, which is why the Conservative Government were returned in 1983, 1987 and again in 1992. Unfortunately, by mischance, we were not returned in 1997; but there is every prospect of the Conservative party--
<P>
<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. As the hon. Gentleman was provoked, I allowed him to reply; but we are not going to play this game any longer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am grateful, Mrs. Dunwoody. I could go on at length, but I am sure that you would remind me that we are supposed to be debating clause 3 stand part.
<P>
There is a marked difference between the actions of the previous and the present Governments. We came to understand the quintessential question about sustainable levels of taxation, and why the question can no longer be approached in what can be regarded as a normal way.
<P>
It is important for the Committee to recognise the difficulties faced by the drinks industry. Clause 1 sought yet again to tax the harmless beer drinker. It remains true, as the Brewer's and Licensed Retailers Association said when it heavily criticised the Government, that the Bill will increase the differential in tax rates between the UK and France still further and produce yet more of an economic incentive to smugglers. The Chancellor thinks that he can proceed in the normal way and encourage the smuggler, but this is not a normal situation.
<P>
The Financial Secretary to the Treasury acknowledged on 28 April that the amount of revenue evaded illegitimately was &#163;900 million in 1996--nearly &#163;1 billion.
<P>
That was up an extra &#163;50 million this year, to some &#163;950 million. I am sorry that the Financial Secretary did not regard that as a significant increase. But if we put it in the context of, for example, the measure introduced by the Chancellor for the rural transport fund, of which he made so much, the reality is that &#163;50 million is a great deal of money and the &#163;950 million related to smuggling is a huge amount of money, and not something that should be regarded lightly or trivially.
<P>
The Financial Secretary may wish to play down the figure, but it is a scandal and it is increasing. We realised that we could not go on in the usual way and decided that it was essential to start the freeze. When the Chancellor speaks about behaving normally, he means Labour behaving normally. What does the Labour party do when it has the opportunity? It taxes and it will do so at every opportunity, as every clause in the Bill reveals. The whole issue has been made so much worse by the cack-handed way in which the Government are handling macroeconomic policy, to the point that sterling levels are crippling our manufacturing industry.
<P>
The Government made much of the importance of public consultation. They often speak of it.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not want to interrupt the honourable Gentleman, but I am sure that he will address his remarks to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``wine and made-wine of a strength not exceeding 22 per cent.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am grateful to you, Mrs. Dunwoody because that is just what I was about to say. In their process of public consultation, the Government seem not to have consulted the Wine and Spirit Association, which is unanimous in its objectives and its extremely strong criticism of the greedy tax-raising actions of the Government, actions which the Government regard as normal.
<P>
The association believes that excise duties are too high. All five of its trade associations agree and refute the argument that higher excise duty on alcohol is an effective way of controlling alcohol abuse. It rightly points out that the United Kingdom is losing &#163;1 billion a year in lost net revenues, compounded by an additional &#163;500 million lost to the Exchequer by cross-border shopping.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) said, the measure is also a vicious attack on the employment prospects of the many people engaged in related trades, and there are half a million people whose jobs are at stake because of the Government's vicious taxation.
<P>
The reality is that alcohol taxes are at an unsustainable level. The current situation is far from normal and something must be done. We must find a sustainable long-term level of duty. The truth is that if the Financial Secretary had chosen to hold real, meaningful public consultation and had listened, not lectured, she would have heard the cries of the industry saying that the Government are wrong.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells referred earlier to Labour's broken promises to the beer industry and the Government's failure to produce a study on the extent and effects of both smuggling and legal cross-channel shopping. We were told by the Prime Minister, no less, that it was urgent and that it would be independent. But, I am sorry to say that like so many of the Prime Minister's promises, this is one more broken promise. It was an important promise and relevant to the clause.
<P>
As you will have come to expect, Mrs. Dunwoody, I shall now refer to the Wine and Spirit Association, which said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``we believe that the review of fraud and smuggling really ought to have looked at the excise rates and structures as well. Ironing out anomalies in the present duty structure will facilitate the reduction of the excise differentials between the UK and our European neighbours--the root cause of fraud, smuggling and cross border shopping.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Hardly a normal situation, as the Chancellor and his Treasury team seem to think. It returns us to the question whether wine duties are sustainable given the reality of the single market. It is again interesting that the Brewers and Licensed Retailers Association have said--
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The rules are straightforward; they are the same as those on the Floor of the House. Hon. Members may quote briefly and paraphrase, but it is not a good idea to read briefs that are prepared elsewhere. The points need to be made and they are important, but members of the Committee must remember that they should not quote in detail.

<P>

<B>Mr Woodward:</B> I am grateful to be reminded of that, Mrs. Dunwoody. I shall therefore quote briefly from the Brewers and Licensed Retailers Association. It points out that there is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``no fiscal law which says that the revenue must be maintained in real terms'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
as the Financial Secretary claimed this afternoon. All taxation decisions are choices. The plain fact of the matter is that the British excise duty structure is a mess. The anomalies are an embarrassment in the context of a Government who claim to be competitive and liberal. The structure is anything but competitive and liberal. It encourages and nurtures an illegal trade which a responsible Government would stop.
<P>
This is an important industry. It is worth more than &#163;9 billion a year to the Exchequer through excise duty and VAT. The Chief Secretary told us that he is prepared to listen, but I wonder how much the Government are truly prepared to listen to the cries of the associations that are affected. We are told by organisations such as the Wine and Spirit Association that duty levels are too high. But have the Government listened? No. Instead, they have put duty up. We are told that the excise tariff structure is illogical, but what has been done in the Bill to reform that? Nothing. We are also told that the present structure skews the market by favouring one alcoholic beverage over another. Again, what does the clause do about that? Nothing. Had public consultation meant anything, we would have seen the results of it. Clear and cogent arguments were put forward and, when we were in government, we were forced to listen to them. But this Government have brutally turned their face to the arguments and ignored them.
<P>
This is an important issue for the Government not least, as my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said, because it encourages cross-border shopping, which has serious implications. The number of people making the return journey from Dover to Calais is normally 1.43 million a month. At Christmas, that rose to about 2 million, which means that 600,000 people were stocking up for Christmas. What was the result of that? Did it help the British wine and spirit trade? No, sadly, it did not. As my hon. Friend pointed out, there was a 2 per cent. fall in the UK market share for wine and nearly twice that in the UK market share for spirits. Yet the Government have the gall to introduce a tax increase. We can be certain that the consequence of that will be further harm to the UK wine trade, its employees and the consumer.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge noted the particular anger of the Wine and Spirit Association at the way it felt that it had been betrayed by the Government. It had a meeting with the Financial Secretary in March last year, a couple of months before the general election. What did she do? She gave them hope. She led them to believe that if there were a Labour Government, they would listen, consult and sort out the situation.
<P>
In reality, as soon as Labour get into power they grab the money, take the taxes and invent the clauses, and we end up with a huge, tax-grabbing Finance Bill. They pay no attention to any of the promises that were made to the association in the months before the election. Labour Members wanted the votes and, later, the tax revenue, but that is a foolish route to follow, because it will lead to less and less revenue being taken.
<P>
We need to take a responsible look at the wine industry and to understand its importance in our country. We must recognise the growth of cross-border shopping and the impact of smuggling. We must not trivialise--as the Financial Secretary has done many times--the huge extent of that smuggling. Nine hundred million pounds would, for example, save the Burford community hospital in my constituency, which may close because of cuts in spending.
<P>
In reality, the Government have an opportunity to behave responsibly and say, ``Yes, we have listened, we believe in public consultation and we think that the problem needs to be sorted out.'' They must recognise the House's right to know, and its right to see the report on smuggling and excise duties, on which my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells commented. The right to know should be extended to the House and to this Committee. This is an opportunity for the Government to say that they understand the trade's problems and that duties should be frozen, for the short term at least.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I want to make a couple of points briefly. The clause has been widely covered by my hon. Friends.
<P>
There is a lack of logic on the Government's part regarding clauses 2 and 3. Whereas clause 2 reduces duty on sparkling white wine and increases duty on cider in order to harmonise similar types of beverages and to prevent distortion of the market, clause 3 increases duty on the entire wine market, which will only increase the haemorrhaging from Customs and Excise of both direct duty and that on cross-border shopping. As long ago as the time of William Pitt the Younger, it was recognised that reducing duties on alcoholic beverages not only reduced the amount of smuggling but increased the amount collected by the Government in duties. To think that if we increase the duty, we will somehow reduce the amount of smuggling is rather like King Canute trying to turn back the tide. It simply does not work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clive Efford </B>(Eltham): We have heard a lot about the effects of smuggling on the wine industry. I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman would care to comment on why, if the previous Government were so determined to reduce the amount of smuggling, they cut the number of Customs and Excise officers at the ports.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I call Mr. Clifton-Brown. It is an interesting thought, but not one that he will pursue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody. I will not be led down that particular path of temptation.
<P>
At a time when the internal market is increasingly taking effect, whether one likes it or not, there is clearly a case for harmonising duties on beverages. After all, the EU sixth directive 1976 on excise duties sought increasingly to harmonise VAT duty. There seems to be a clear case for equalising alcoholic beverage duties. I do not wish to stray from the scope of the clause, but enforcement against smuggling is an important matter, and I ask the Financial Secretary to tell the Committee how much she estimates is lost to Her Majesty's Customs and Excise each year by smuggling and cross-border shopping, and how much enforcement is costing the Government. Whereas the amount of smuggling and cross-border evasion is increasing each year, I expect that the amount spent on compliance is decreasing, so the gap between the two is increasing each year. If the matter were regularised as I suggested, the scarce resources devoted to Her Majesty's Customs and Excise could be better utilised, for example, on the enforcement of measures against drugs importations.
<P>
When she replies to the debate, will the Financial Secretary say what the Government's policy will be in future years? As my hon. Friends have already mentioned, we have passed the point at which increasing duties will cause the actual tax take to decline. That is perverse and unwelcome, and we owe it to all those involved in the beverage industry, whose numbers are not inconsiderable, to know what the Government's long-term plans are.
