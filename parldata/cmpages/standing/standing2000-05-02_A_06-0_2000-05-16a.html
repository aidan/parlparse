<H3><center><A href="/pa/cm199900/cmbills/087/2000087.htm">Local Government Bill [Lords]</a></center></H3>
<H4><center>Clause 9</center></H4>
<H4><center>Local authority to decide whether to introduce executive arrangements</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed [this day], That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Question again proposed.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking Government amendments Nos. 116 to 118.

<P>
Before I call Mr. Waterson to continue the debate, I want to make a small announcement. I advised the Committee this morning that this was a wide-ranging stand part debate on clause 9. It also covers clause 10 so I shall not allow a stand part debate on clause 10. The debate borders on clause 11, but as a group of amendments has been tabled to clause 11, I shall decide after the debate whether to allow a stand part debate on that clause. I am giving notice that there will be no stand part debate on clause 10.

<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Waterson </B>(Eastbourne): I am grateful to you, Mr. O'Brien, as I am sure the whole Committee is, for that indication. If it is any comfort, I do not think that we were minded to have a stand part debate on clause 10, even if you had allowed one, and the same may apply to clause 11, but it is a little early to say. Perhaps we can see how the debates on the amendments go.

<P>
I am always envious of those who manage to stop in mid-sentence and then, several hours later, start where they left off. The downside of that is that people have forgotten where we were. So that everyone remembers, having listed a selection of all the bodies, organisations, groups, councils, individuals and worthies of the Labour party as well as of other parties who do not like these provisions, I was quoting the comments of some Labour Members-not, sadly, Members of the Committee-who spoke against the proposals on Second Reading. I was about to quote the hon. Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard). He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Why must we insist on a separate executive and why is it not possible to consider alternative models?-[Official Report, 11 April 2000; Vol. 348, c. 241.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a very good question which the Minister has not yet got to grips with. The hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Smith) said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>One of the ways of maintaining the powers of local authorities would be to support the amendments in another place, which would  give them the opportunity to continue with the committee system if they believed that that system was more relevant to their community and more able to respond to its problems.-[Official Report, 11 April 2000; Vol. 348, c. 262.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We endorse those words. I hope that, if nothing else, this exercise will help to demonstrate that this is not a Conservative preoccupation; these are not the worries of a bunch of extremists or the dark forces of Conservatism. They are worries that go deep in the Labour movement and elsewhere.

<P>
The hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Dr. Jones) said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I do not accept the idea that the committee structure does not provide opportunities for scrutiny.  I urge the Government to consider mechanisms that will reduce patronage and provide genuine opportunities for back-bench members to participate in decision-making processes.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I think that she means back-bench members of local councils.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If necessary, they should consider retaining the committee structure.-[Official Report, 11 April 2000; Vol. 348, c. 272.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Finally, the indefatigable hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. McDonnell) said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To restrict options to near-parliamentary models undermines the general thrust of the Bill, which is about liberating local communities-[Official Report, 11 April 2000; Vol. 348, c. 274.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is it, I wonder?

<P>
<B>The Minister of State for Local Government and the Regions (Ms Hilary Armstrong):</B> Hear, hear.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The Minister says ``Hear, hear''. She must have a modicum of interest in Durham county council, Labour controlled of course, which has introduced the one-party cabinet system, with meetings not open to the public-held in secret. Does she approve of that? Does she think that it is against the spirit of the Bill? If so, perhaps that spirit should be spelt out in it more clearly.

<P>
I return to the main issues. Here we have a set of proposals on which, despite all the blandishments of Opposition parties, Labour councillors, the Joint Select Committee-what a waste of time that was in relation to this part of the Bill-and everyone who knows anything about local government, the Minister remains impervious to argument. Why will she not listen to all that advice and trust local government? Why will she not let local councils choose, especially if, as she seems to think, the benefits of the cabinet system are so self-evident and attractive? Is this not another example of the Prime Minister's command leadership style, to which the former Labour secretary general, Tom Sawyer, referred yesterday?

<P>
For members of the Labour party, Labour local government is an embarrassment and a difficulty. If they can find a way around the problem through ``Front Line First'' funding, they will. If they can find a way to sideline the issue through regional development agencies and other unelected, unaccountable quangos, they will. If they can find a way to ``modernise'' local government by dictating how to run matters and leaving no choice, they will.

<P>
As with so many other issues, the Lords got this one right. They are much more in sympathy with the British people and members of all parties in local government. Opposition members of the Committee will therefore support the Lords' amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): Follow that, as they sometimes say.

<P>
During the first sitting that I attended, I promised members of the Committee that I would try to be brief. Although this is a very important issue, I shall try to honour that commitment, not least because, like many members of the Committee, I am desperately keen to hear the much-heralded speech by the hon. Member for Mole Valley (Sir P. Beresford), which has been referred to on no less than seven separate occasions by the hon. Member for Eastbourne.

<P>
Given that, in the main, my comments will be fairly critical of the government and the position adopted by the Minister, I shall begin by saying something that I hope will be interpreted positively. At the beginning of our deliberations, we were discussing the availability of guidance and information. It is helpful that the Ministers provided a second draft guidance and announced a further round of consultation. Many organisations have already examined and commented on the second draft. For example, representatives of the Local Government Association have told me that it is a significant improvement on the first, although they feel that further improvements could be made. I want to place on the record our genuine thanks to the Minister for making that information available, and for making the consultation process an open one. Sadly, such openness and willingness to listen does not extend to certain issues that we are discussing in relation to the clause.

<P>
Like the Minister for Local Government and the Regions, all members of the Committee probably want councils to strive year on year to improve the quality of services and the way in which they operate. Although some of us, not least the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry), may quibble about the definition of certain phrases, we all want to ensure that councils are efficient, transparent and accountable. In the light of the Minister's description of the models that she is promoting, it is perhaps worth reflecting that the most transparent model of all-in which one knows exactly who is taking decisions-is a dictatorship. Although the provision will make it slightly easier for the public to know who is taking decisions, many Opposition members of the Committee will be concerned that we are putting a great deal of power in the hands of very few people. We are unhappy with that proposal.

<P>
The Minister made the point, which was picked up by the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson), that people do not vote in local government elections, and reference was made from a sedentary position to a figure of 30 per cent. I reiterate my opinion that the structure of local government ultimately determines whether people vote for it. What matters is what local government is capable of doing and whether it addresses the real issues and concerns of local people.

<P>
The Minister has sometimes been frustrated that we have focused so much on this part of the Bill, but that is because the Government have emphasised it and been unwilling to be flexible. The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions has a considerable interest in structures, but in the Department for Education and Employment the cry went out on day one of the new Labour Government that what mattered were ``standards not structures''. The key issue was how to raise standards without getting bogged down in the detail of structures. I applauded the attitude of the Department of Education and Employment that prompted it to introduce arrangements to allow people to determine locally how they wanted to move forward. A raft of proposals was made to allow greater flexibility in school and local education authority organisations and so on. But the Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions has a different approach, with structures starting to dominate the debate. Moreover, the structures are tightly defined and everyone must adhere to them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am carefully following what the hon. Gentleman is saying. Presumably he accepts that when structures impinge on the potential for increasing turnout, they do so particularly in areas involving the public's access to information before and after decisions are taken.

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I entirely agree, but that is consistent with my earlier argument that local people will become involved with their local councils if they believe that councils are capable of taking decisions that affect them. The only real test is whether they are able to influence their local council's decisions. The critical starting point is whether they have information on the decisions that the council are considering. I am not making a partisan point; it applies to councils of all political complexions.

<P>
I am not yet convinced that there is enough evidence to suggest that we must focus so heavily on structures that we must insist that every local council changes the way in which it operates. There should be greater opportunity for local flexibility. At some time or other, whatever our political party, we have all used the slogan, ``Local leadership, local choice.'' Local government should provide local leadership and local choice, and it should be given an opportunity to decide matters for itself after widely consulting those that it represents on how best to organise itself. If councils like the models proposed by the Government, they can consult, and if they are convinced that that is the right way to go, they can move in that direction, but the structures should not be imposed on them.

<P>
I began to wonder, listening to the Minister's comments, whether a single local council in the land met the existing criteria of efficiency, transparency and accountability. According to the Audit Commission, which regularly provides detailed information on how councils are doing, many are highly rated. Some are not, but many are highly regarded by their local communities because they deliver high-quality services and meet the criteria of efficiency, transparency and accountability.

<P>
I cannot see any argument for change for change's sake, or-to use a term with which, like the hon. Member for Eastbourne, I have difficulty-modernisation for modernisation's sake. I see no justification for that.

<P>

<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am interested in what the hon. Gentleman has to say. Can he show me where the Audit Commission has commented on the openness, accountability or transparency of a council? I understand that the commission comments on efficiency, quality of service and so on. Its latest report also involved criticism of the structure, in terms of its openness, accountability and transparency.

<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The Minister is right. I hope that I did not mislead the Committee by suggesting that the Audit Commission covered all those aspects. Many other organisations monitor those aspects and, most importantly, local people will also make judgments about their local councils. Some are, indeed, critical about the degree of openness.

<P>
The Minister appeared to suggest that there was no willingness on the part of councils to change. In reality, many councils have made significant changes to speed up and improve the way in which they operate. Even before its demise, the-perhaps-unloved Avon county council, on which I had the privilege to serve, introduced the separation of decision making from scrutiny. The council introduced, within existing legislation, the sorts of measures that have been proposed, while retaining the ability to have streamlined committees. That is one of the many examples that I can give.

<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford </B>(Mole Valley): I have a supplementary question to that asked by the Minister. If we believe-I do not-that the present committee structure cannot be open, we should apply the same considerations to the Government's suggestions. I find them wanting.

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. I look forward to the debate on clause 21, when we shall consider the openness of the current structures. We have noted what the Minister said about the improvements that the Government are offering in the latest version of the guidance notes. All of us would agree that improvements have been suggested-I certainly accept that. However, the question is whether they go far enough and whether the issues covered in the guidance should be included in the Bill. I believe that they should. The hon. Member for Mole Valley is right to say that the tests that we would apply to the current system or any improvements thereto should be applied to the Minister's proposals.

<P>
The hon. Member for Eastbourne covered much of the ground that I would have covered. The Committee would not wish me to go over the ground covered by the hon. Gentleman. Suffice it to say that the Minister herself said that, even in cases in which councils have tried the new procedures, they have found them both ``difficult'' and ``traumatic''. She said that at 
<P>
<H5>10.55 am-I noted the time as well as the words. Those cases are not theoretical; the organisations are not saying that they do not think that the procedures will work. Those cases involve people of all political persuasions who have tried the system and have found it difficult and traumatic.</H5>
</P>

<P>
I mentioned Rushcliffe borough council, A Tory-controlled council. The system is being tried there, and the leader of the Labour group, Councillor Alistair MacInnes, has said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Much dissatisfaction is being expressed about the lack of information about the activities of the cabinet. Many councillors, particularly the Tories, feel their role has been diminished rather than strengthened under this regime.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The council is Tory-controlled, and has set up a cabinet structure. Sadly, the cabinet meetings are held in private. According to the council leader, Councillor Buckley, that is because they involve only
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>preparing papers for the decision-making body-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is, the full council. Although the council has set up the new procedure, it obviously does not understand what the Minister has in mind. It is another example of a council that has rushed rapidly ahead with the procedures, only to find that it may have to rethink them. The key point is that councils do not want to be forced to change, and there is no evidence that the electorate want that either.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Has the hon. Gentleman had a chance to glance through reports about Rushcliffe in Nottinghamshire's local press? I was interested to see that the Under-Secretary, who represents Stretford and Urmston, described the arrangements in Rushcliffe as being outside the spirit of the law of the proposed Local Government Bill. Does the hon. Gentleman know what she meant by that, and why, if the Under-Secretary is right, she would not wish to deal with the matter in the Bill?

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am sure that the Under-Secretary would love to have the opportunity to respond to the hon. Gentleman's point, and I shall not spoil that by second-guessing her.

<P>
I have read the reports to which the hon. Gentleman referred. I was trying to be charitable in my selection of quotes. I could have referred to the comments of some Labour Members for Nottingham. If the hon. Gentleman looks back two pages, he will find an interesting quote about the adoption of Stalinist procedures.

<P>
The central issue is one of local choice and self-determination; it is about how people at the local level want their councils to operate. Despite the Government's flexibility in tabling amendments on the so-called fourth option, the reality is that councils are being forced to change. The Minister has made it clear that no change is not an option. Even civil servants use that language when they write on behalf of Ministers. For example, a letter from Paul Hoey of the local government sponsorship division to Mark Stevenson of the Local Government Association states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As to councils' constitutions, no change cannot be an option for any council. Whilst the Government will carefully consider 
<P>
issues raised by the House of Lords, it remains determined to maintain the integrity of the legislation which it promotes.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>

<P>
The Government are determined to push the proposal ahead, regardless of people's views.

<P>
Yet there is no public demand for the change to be forced on all councils. Without picking up on points that were made by the hon. Member for Eastbourne, opinion polls have an interesting story to tell. An ICM poll on 19 April showed that 61 per cent. of people believe that local government should be left in its current form. Only 22 per cent. were interested in directly elected mayors, which is a massive fall from the 59 per cent. that was recorded in a similar poll in February.

<P>
Several commentators have criticised the proposals. Many of us are aware of the pioneering work of John Stewart, who is professor of local government at Birmingham university. He has informed debates on local government for many years. He said that the proposals were ill conceived, unjustified and over-prescriptive. [
Interruption.] I missed that sedentary intervention, so I shall give way.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Curry </B>(Skipton and Ripon): I shall return to it later.

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I look forward to that.

<P>
Newspapers adopted an interesting response to the Government's proposals. On 19 April-which, interestingly, is also the day on which the opinion poll was released-an editorial in The Guardian said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Many councils, demoralised by the steady erosion of local government power and responsibility and the relentless advances of central intervention, fear the new system will leave them sidelined while oligarchies run their towns.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Criticisms have come from many directions.

<P>
The Government argue that their proposals involve considerable choice and flexibility, but that simply is not the case. The Minister denied the allegation that the Government were offering a one-size-fits-all model. Every council must have one and only one executive, which must have a prescribed number of people. When local authorities advance their own proposals, they must accord with the provision in clause 11, which will state that local authorities must have an appropriate form of executive.

<P>
There is a desperate need to persuade the Government to retain the clause or to agree to a raft of amendments that develop the issue. Local consultation might be needed to demonstrate that there is support for the continuation of the current model. Perhaps we should check that the model meets the criteria of efficiency, transparency and accountability, however those terms are defined.

<P>
As it is currently drafted, the clause would secure genuine local choice by ensuring that decisions were taken at the local level. It would be wrong to delete the clause and to foist on local councils throughout the land a straitjacket proposal that tells them how they should operate. I hope that the Minister will listen to these concerns, although the evidence in this regard suggests that Ministers do not listen. We shall vote to retain the clause.

<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> As we have all said, the Government are anxious to modernise, but the trouble is that they have a mechanical concept of modernisation. They speak of institutions as though they were bits of machinery.

<P>
I would like to have a more modern lawn-mower, I could doubtless modernise my central heating system at home and, if my car were newer, it could have a more modern emission-control system. Such things can be modernised. However, the Government talk about modernising institutions as though they were lawn-mowers or central heating systems. Institutions are not as susceptible to modernisation as the Government believe.

<P>
The Minister complained that current legislation was prescriptive. Although local government's basic framework remains, there have been astonishing changes in recent years, and there is no need to move from one form of prescription to another. None of us would object if the Government wanted to open out local government's options or to let 1,000 flowers bloom, but those are not their aims. As the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) explained, they want to set clear prescriptive lines to the choices that are available. In essence, they will make the relevant choices.

<P>
I understand what the Government are trying to do. All Governments share a desire for the most efficient local government possible, so that value for money can be clearly achieved in the use of public funds. We accept that, in a global economy, Governments have much less choice about the way in which they run their affairs because they have to deliver a competitive economy. Institutions such as local government, which spend about 25 per cent. of the national wealth, cannot escape the supervision of central Government, who have an overall responsibility for the delivery of an efficient economy.

<P>
I do not dissent from the Government in that regard, and I have sympathy for their best value legislation for the same reasons. However, I am worried that the Bill will not meet the Government's requirements. Of course they will point out the abuses of the present system. Labour-run Liverpool is a monolithic example of such abuses, with committees watching sub-committees watching sub-sub-committees, all in the name of the most monstrous political correctness, which has spawned more committees than any other philosophy one could imagine.

<P>
However, the essential difference between the Government and the Opposition is that we do not believe that changing the structure will change the culture. The Minister is ignoring the extent to which local government has changed over the past 15 years. It is a much leaner institution than it used to be; its management structures are unrecognisable when compared with those of 15 years ago; it is a more efficient and responsive institution.

<P>
The Audit Commission, although opposed at the time by the Labour party, has played a major part in exposing to the public gaze the efficiencies of local government. As my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley said, it shows, time after time, a quartile of pretty good local authorities at the top and a quartile of pretty desperate ones at the bottom. The problem is to get the middle ones a little further up the league table.

<P>
If the present system is incapable of delivering that change, why do we have beacon councils? Why have the Government gone to so much trouble to praise their wonderful achievements? If a council has beacon status for a series of services, can it be so demonstrably a failure as a council that it is incapable of evolving its structures in order to continue the improvement? What was all that best value legislation about? If the present structures were so incapable of improvement, why did the Government think that best value could provide such a quantum leap in the efficiency of local authorities? I agree with them that best value has a great deal to commend it, despite the impositions that it makes on local authorities.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am sure that it has not been lost on my right hon. Friend that one of the least enthusiastic supporters of the proposals is Camden council, which has achieved beacon status.

<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> My hon. Friend is right. I happen to have the resolution from Camden council in front of me, but I shall spare the Committee a reading from it. It could be set to plain song-or perhaps, in the case of Camden council, I should say plaintiff song.

<P>
I agree with the hon. Member for Bath that the Government seem to believe that structures determine attitudes and performance. They believe that a philosophy that states, ``Let the public see, let the public know, let the public understand,'' can change attitudes. That perception is flawed. If people decide to conduct their affairs in private, to sort out their business quietly in the pub either before or after a meeting, or in the corridor or the Members' Room, no legislation on earth will make them do that under public scrutiny rather than in private. It is a question of attitude and of culture.

<P>
The United States has a much more open culture sustained by legislation, which I would find rather uncomfortable. I dislike the public displays of emotion and the lachrymosity of the American political system. None the less, that culture has been promoted there over the years. I do not believe that, in Britain, the culture will change with the structures.

<P>
We had an example about 10 days ago in the turnout for the London mayoral elections. We all remember the hoo-ha that went on about that. You could not say, Mr. O'Brien, that the newspapers did not adequately cover the London mayoral elections for months and months. The Liberal Democrats are excused from my comments in a way, because after they chose their candidate there was very little fuss; no one could remember who she was and she did not do very well. However, the two main parties had a spectacular barney about producing their candidates. Despite all that wonderful barney, what happened on the day? Thirty-three per cent. of people turned out to vote. Even in areas that held experimental elections, the only method that made any difference was the postal ballot, which laid things out on a platter for people.

<P>
I pay tribute to the British electorate. When they are determined that they will not be interested, they are damn well sure that they will not be interested and no one will deter them from being uninterested. There is a resilience in the electorate's determination not to be interested; the structures will not change that. I invite the Minister, four years from now, to put her guess about the turnout for the London mayoral elections in a sealed envelope with mine, and we shall see who wins the £5 note.

<P>
Moreover, I do not believe that the provision will put the public more in charge. I fear that, especially in some county councils, the cabinet system will mean that all the old brigade, who should have retired and handed over to younger people years ago, will give themselves a new lease of life. The Bill is gerontocracy: it opens the door for all the old brigade to sit up there in their cabinets and say, ``This is wonderful, isn't it, Fred? We've got another shot at it, and all these youngsters can go on the scrutiny committee. We can soon keep them under control there. We won't bother about that.'' Hardly anyone will say, ``What a wonderful opportunity to bring new blood into the council''. They will say, ``This is wonderful, chaps-another turn for us.'' I can just see that happening in local authorities. The idea that there will suddenly be this blinding light of illumination-that the night sky will be illuminated by the gaze of public scrutiny-reveals extreme naivety.

<P>
As the hon. Member for Bath said, it is curious that this obsession with structures persists in the DETR when the Government have renounced it in other Departments. He cited the Department for Education and Employment. The curious thing is that, on the one occasion when the Secretary of State for Education and Employment ventured towards prescribing structures, he subsequently said that the whole thing had been a big joke in any case. I do not think that anyone noticed it at the time, but, on reflection, it was very funny. However, the Secretary of State has moved away from that completely. We are talking about education and he is saying, ``Let's worry about delivery''.

<P>
Why do the Government not persist down the course-which, to be fair to them, they had in mind when they introduced best value-of judging local government by the output, by the outturns, by the outcomes? Can we not get away from the prescription of the structures and say to local government, ``We will set the outcomes for you''? It is fair for a Government to do that. It is reasonable for them to say, ``These are the outcomes that we expect,'' just as they do in schools, the police service and many public services and are increasingly trying to do in their own Departments of State, saying, ``You decide how to deliver the outcomes and we intervene if you fail in that delivery''. To prescribe both the method and the outcome removes from local government a capacity to innovate and to invent solutions appropriate to its circumstances, which is wrong.

<P>
I hope that, when we debate the combination of clause 11(6) and new clause 12, the Minister can tell us what it adds up to in practice in terms of a possible new fourth way or new way. I hope that, when the Government reflect on this issue and listen to their supporters as well as those who represent the other parties, they will reflect on whether we have taken prescription one step too far and should revert to the sensible programme of reform that has taken place up to now, which has not been given even half a chance to show what it is capable of delivering.

<P>
Therefore, I look forward to the remainder of the debate and hope that the Government will not persist with their obsession of ramming their solutions down everybody's throats on a wholly false intellectual premise: prescribe the structure and the outcome is automatically guaranteed. I simply do not believe that that is true.

<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I am conscious of the fact that sundown is on the way and that we have been on the clause since what felt like sunrise. Much of what my hon. Friend the Minister for Eastbourne-and, to my amazement, the hon. Member for Bath-said has pre-empted what I wanted to say.

<P>
I want to stay succinct and to refer to something that the Minister talked about. She said in various ways that the matter concerned the public and, to use her other phrase, ``the punters out there''. The majority of the punters out there, the general public, are not interested and do not understand. They do not understand local government finance. All that they are interested in is whether their basic services are done, done efficiently and do not cost them too much.

<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> And that the dustbins are emptied.

<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> Yes, what interests them is that the dustbins are emptied, the streets swept and that sort of thing. However, the punters that came in knew something about it and had an idea about how things work, many of them being involved in it, and an enormous amount of evidence was presented.

<P>
Almost 90 per cent. of the evidence focused on two issues. One was the importance of the mayor, but we shall come to that later. The other issue, and the major part, was whether the new system would work and whether it would be sensible, as the clause suggests, to leave things as they are, but with an opportunity for improvement and for pressure to be brought to bear to ensure that that improvement took place. There is no doubt that an enormous number of local authorities are efficient, win contracts against the private sector fairly and openly, produce the goods and put their documents, papers and decisions clearly before the public. Having served on the Audit Commission, I can confirm that.

<P>
The Minister complains that local authorities take decisions in secret. That is absolutely right. When I was working in local authorities there would be a group, which one could call the cabinet, which would discuss the papers, bring forward the ideas, reject some and develop others. There would be discussion in both political groups when the papers emerged. Then they came to the committees and they were open, plain and clear: they were there with the figures. There was an opportunity for questioning by everyone on the committee. Then the matter would go on to full council, where it underwent the same procedure before the decision was finally taken.

<P>
In the evidence that was given to the Joint Committee, one sample is worth looking at. We had before us the leader of Hammersmith and Fulham council. He was an embarrassment to the idea, because he was in the process of instituting that procedure. He did it as best he could and spoke about the changes and progressions that he would make. When we cornered him, he said succinctly that decisions were taken in the group and in his executive meeting in secret, and that those decisions were then ratified in the Labour group. It does not have to be a Labour group; it could be a Conservative group, a Liberal group or a mixture, but in this case it was a Labour group. The decision was taken and then, having been taken, it was ratified, taken back to the executive, ratified there and sent down to the scrutiny committees.

<P>
The leader agreed that in the scrutiny committees there would have to be a waivering of whipping. He was reluctant to put it into practice and to accept it, particularly as some of his scrutiny committee back benchers were sitting behind him, eyeing him, and their faces were classic, showing that they did not believe it. We asked the leader a few further questions, particularly about the funding of councillors.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The hon. Gentleman alludes to whipping. As he knows, after the Select Committee's deliberations the Labour party conference agreed that there would be no whipping on scrutiny. An advice note has been issued to every council, not only making that clear but making clear the principles of openness and accountability. The hon. Gentleman's party says that it is not prepared to do that and cannot back up the openness and scrutiny that my party says must be there. Does he support what his party is saying, or does he think that it, too, should get rid of whipping on scrutiny?

<P>

<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I thank the Minister, because she has preceded me in support of my argument.

<P>
Many members of most councils receive payment. Hammersmith and Fulham councillors will receive about £10,000 a year, which is a large sum.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> It is a large sum. Before my hon. Friend leaves the example of Hammersmith and Fulham, is he aware that the cabinet in that borough took, I believe, 607 separate decisions, of which only one has been overturned by the scrutiny process?

<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> Yes, I discussed that matter earlier-my hon. Friend might want to read my comments in Hansard.

<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
People in the majority party who have key positions in the local authority are paid, in addition, about £30,000, and if they were appointed to a quango, such as a national health service trust, they would be on about £19,000-considerable sums are involved. Although we pointed out that the matter involves not whipping but patronage, we did not receive a proper answer. What opportunities will there be for a back bencher on a scrutiny committee, or any other committee, to buck the trend?

<P>
All Labour councillors have been selected by the party system, and they face the prospect of being deselected. There have been ructions about that up and down the country, especially in Labour councils. The Minister, however, simply says that the process is open and clear, and that the scrutiny committees will operate. However, the public are beginning to appreciate that Tammany Hall, which has occurred under alternative systems, may be encouraged. Many Labour back benchers are worried about that. Leaders of councils that neighbour the Minister's constituency have made it clear that scrutiny committees will scrutinise as they are directed to do.

<P>
I hope that the Minister has enough sense to recognise that we want to stop the extension of corruption, small though it is, and that the great mass of people who are concerned about this matter want to keep the open committee structure because of its associated values. The Minister claimed that she wanted to change the law to embrace such values.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> We have had a wide-ranging debate. So that I do not forget it, I shall begin with the concluding point that was made by the hon. Member for Mole Valley. The legal framework that the Bill will establish should make it clear to councils how they should operate and what is and is not legal.

<P>
A problem with the current system is that it has been changed so often. A plethora of legislation deals with ethics, and it can be hard for council officers to get hold of the relevant Act or to establish what is or is not legal. That is why the Bill will establish an integrated ethical framework. If a committee could say that anything goes, the legal framework would not make it clear to councils how they should operate or how they could be held to account.

<P>
The comments that were made this morning by my hon. Friend the Member for Tamworth (Mr. Jenkins), a former leader of Tamworth borough council, were absolutely right. External examination should be balanced-if councils can say that anything goes, it will be impossible for external people to look at a body and ask, ``Is its way of working being examined in the relevant manner and in relation to the Bill's provisions?'' I did not raise that matter this morning, but Opposition Members should consider it. A clear framework that allows local choice but allows comparisons to be made will secure clearer accountability. How should we deal with the minor instances of corruption that occur in a few councils? The Bill will introduce clearer definitions in that regard.

<P>
I was over-generous in not reminding some members of the Committee of what was said before. In 1967, the Maud committee recommended that all but the smallest authorities should appoint a management board of between five and nine council members, and delegate wide powers to it. Since then, local government reorganisation has got rid of the smallest councils, and rural districts and urban districts have been merged into larger councils.

<P>
The hon. Member for Torbay (Mr. Sanders) is right-this matter has been on the agenda for a long time. Anyone who takes a serious look at local government will conclude that there is a need for change, as did the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon when he was a Minister. He accused me of believing that structural change can bring about cultural change, but structural change alone cannot achieve that. However, I am convinced-my conviction has grown in the past months-that other changes that we are introducing demand, for example, greater scrutiny. Best value works best not when officers regard it as a merely technical exercise in the delivery of services, but when the entire council works to achieve best value. When the public's experience of a service and their ideas on how to change it are not scrutinised by councillors, best value is far too often a paper exercise that fails to change the culture and bring about better performance year on year.

<P>
Members of the Committee asked why, in the light of beacon council awards, we should want change. That suggests a complete misunderstanding of the beacon council scheme. The scheme is seen as an incentive that spreads good practice, and good practice in local government is not only possible-it is happening. However, it is too often isolated and overlooked by other councils. We are keen that councils should take note of good practice, and the scrutiny process is a good way in which to achieve that. It is already bringing benefits that hon. Members are acknowledging.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough (Mr. Ennis) recently secured an Adjournment debate that arose from a scrutiny panel report on carers in the Barnsley authority. People from the health authority and different health trusts had to be brought in, and important recommendations were made not only to them and the social services department, but to central Government. My hon. Friend was able to use that process to challenge us.

<P>
A gradual change is taking place in councils. Those who are exploring new ideas are beginning to see the good that can arise from doing so. I do not say that that is happening everywhere, but we are anxious that some councils would not contemplate change if they were not faced with the prospect of it. I accept that good councils will introduce forms of scrutiny and accountability to enhance their performance and public understanding of what they are doing. In many councils, that will not happen unless there is a momentum and push for change.

<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The Government could require a council that wished to maintain the status quo to submit its arguments for doing so to the Secretary of State or an examining body of some kind. If its performance was judged to be dismal, it could be required to change. The thrust of our suggestions is that the introduction of a form of genuine choice would assist in dealing with councils that seem incapable of improving their performance.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> That suggestion is based on a view of councils as being responsible only for the delivery of services. In fact, they have a greater role to play in terms of community leadership. We have scarcely explored that aspect today.

<P>
The current position is that the group with responsibility for the strategic direction of the authority puts its decisions to the rest of the council and the committees. In effect, it works as an executive. I have spoken to representatives of all the councils and asked them to explain their current procedures. All of them-even Wiltshire-say that they have a committee of chairpersons that meet together to organise and agree on the way to proceed. Of all this morning's speakers, only the hon. Member for Mole Valley mentioned that. It is one of the key issues that has not been addressed by those who argue in favour of the committee system.

<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I do not think that anyone is arguing that the committee system must remain in precisely its current form. I made a similar point to the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon earlier.

<P>
I should like to return to the description of the proposed system that the Minister just gave, which seemed to imply some misunderstanding on her part. She spoke in glowing terms of the executive as a group of people who are responsible for the strategic direction of the authority. Is it not the case-in a county council, for example-that the same body will be responsible for interviewing and selecting tenants for county farms, deciding on grants for village halls, attending to the preservation of historic buildings, and determining pedestrian crossings and school crossing patrols? The Minister and I seem to have a different understanding of the Bill's proposals.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The hon. Gentleman is seeking to tempt me to list in the Bill every single type of decision that a council might take. That would trivialise such decisions and the way in which they are taken. Is he saying that they must be taken in committee on an executive basis rather than as part of another devolved form of decision making?

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> No. My examples, which I chose carefully, were worked out by local councils. Under the current structure, decisions can be delegated to a small sub-committee of members who are not part of the executive. The executive could take the decisions or delegate them to one executive member or officer. However, it could not delegate them to a small group of members who were passionate about grants to village halls and were trusted by local councils to get on and deliver them.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Again the hon. Gentleman has not understood the Bill. Many of those decisions could be delegated to area committees. The people who are interested in what is going on in their area could take those decisions within the new bodies. County councils will be able to develop area forums and area committees; some, including the one in my constituency, have already done so. Provision has been made in the Bill for that kind of working. The Joint Select Committee urged that upon us, and we responded to that. We want more efficient decision taking that will improve the way in which councils work. I am determined that we shall listen to what people are saying.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Brian Jenkins </B>(Tamworth): I feel some trepidation with regard to efficient decision taking. As someone who has led a council, I know that the most efficient decision taking took place when I was taking the decisions.

<P>
Under the new arrangements, that decision-taking process will go before an executive body, to which the grounds for the decision will have to be given. Furthermore, any papers forwarded by officers will have to be made available to the public. The process will be accountable. That is the crux of the matter; the decision taking will be transparent and accountable. If the scrutiny committee is properly set up, the authority will become much more accountable and the public will understand the decision-taking process and will, therefore, have a greater involvement in the democratic process.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I can only agree with my hon. Friend. Efficient decision taking has to be balanced by accountability, and we are seeking to develop that balance. Opposition Members have too often argued that, in order to achieve local choice, we should walk away from that balance. I do not believe that they would say that if the situation were reversed. They would argue for decision taking to be balanced by accountability. That is at the heart of part II of the Bill. I am disappointed that right hon. and hon. Members did not address that this morning.

<P>
I shall respond briefly to some of the issues raised about officers. In response to the consultation, the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives and Senior Managers-quoted liberally by the hon. Member for Eastbourne earlier-said that it was committed to the fundamental changes in decision making that the Bill would introduce. It also said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The proposed executive/scrutiny splits should lead to stronger strategic direction, community leadership and faster decision making. This is desirable and supported by SOLACE.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
SOLACE is rightly ensuring that the detail supporting that overall principle is in order. Of course it should be making those arguments. Many of the people quoted by the hon. Gentleman were involved in that exercise. Others were not, and we must work out those differences.

<P>
We have received hundreds of telephone calls from chief executives, council leaders and other officers working within the system, saying, ``Please do not accept the amendments tabled by the Opposition in the Lords.'' They say that because the logic of the Government's argument is clear in relation to the strength of an executive and scrutiny split. They are not arguing against that. They have argued for choice, but that choice would present a legal quagmire. Given the advice from the hon. Member for Eastbourne last week that we should not make life even more complicated, I ask them to consider that quagmire. Councils with majority support for progress would suddenly have the rug pulled from under them and would lose confidence.

<P>
There is huge flexibility within the frameworks that we have established and it is greater than in the existing system. The Opposition's proposals would not do what they want but would lead to councils deciding that they do not need to set up scrutiny or accountability systems, and the objectives that many members of the Committee share would not be met. I ask the Committee to reject clause 9.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> You will be relieved to hear, Mr. O'Brien, that I shall speak briefly to the amendment. It concerns the option of a mayor and council manager which Lord Whitty described as
<P>

That is a charitable way of putting it, because it is the least popular option.

<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> There is a much worse one.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> My right hon. Friend tells me that there is competition at the bottom of the popularity league.

<P>
Similar Conservative amendments were moved in another place, in part to tease out from the Government whether the option contains any steam-we doubt it-and whether both an elected mayor and a council manager will be necessary. Reference was made in the other place to the American experience, where the mayor is also the chief executive. Lord Whitty was correct when he said that the option is the least well understood, but, in fairness, one of the points that he made in reply was that, if it had any attraction, it was more appropriate for rural areas and areas with a tradition of hung councils. That point was taken up by the Joint Select Committee, and it may be the key point. As Lord Whitty put it:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That may be the reason that it has not been taken up as a front runner among the structures of local government.-[Official Report, House of Lords, 28 February 2000; Vol. 610, c. 411.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
This is a probing amendment, and we do not intend to press it to a vote. However, we would like to hear the Minister's views.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I anticipated that it would be a probing amendment. As I explained, we are seeking, within the framework of an executive-scrutiny split, to offer a variety of options. Despite what the hon. Gentleman said, this option is available in other countries. The council manager arrangement, in a variety of forms, is a common and effective arrangement in many other countries. I am convinced that it is a valuable framework, which may be appropriate to a number of councils in this country. As we shall see when we discuss the Government amendments to clause 15, the purpose of having such an executive is to achieve a clear separation between policy development, which will be a matter for the mayor and the council, and day-to-day implementation of that policy, which will be a matter for the council manager and the officer corps.

<P>
The mayor provides the political leadership. Together with the council manager, he or she will propose policy to the council. The council manager implements the agreed council policy, under the guidance of the political leadership. The mayor and the council manager are accountable for the discharge of executive functions. The mayor is made accountable by the ballot box and by overview and scrutiny, while the council manager is made responsible by the overview and scrutiny of the full council.

<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The right hon. Lady said that she thought that the system would be appropriate to quite a large number of councils. Could she name, say, five councils that would, in her opinion, benefit from it?

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I do not like to contradict the right hon. Gentleman, but I said ``a number of councils''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Five is not a lot.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> If I name five, they will think that I have earmarked them for a particular form-I have not. There are one or two councils that are actively examining the proposal, although they may decide to have a council manager and cabinet; that is also possible under the terms of the Bill. We wish, simply, to ensure that that wide choice exists, so that a council that wants to choose that option is able to do so. It is not for me to say whether it would be suitable for a particular authority.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I made it clear that it was a probing amendment. I am sorry that the Minister could not rise to the challenge put forward by my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon. Can she name two councils, or just one-strictly without prejudice, as we lawyers say? Naming just one would make the amendment all the more worth while.

<P>
The Minister is intent on keeping her seat, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Ms Beverley Hughes):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 119, in page 6, line 22, leave out subsection (5).

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following: Government new clause 12-Additional forms of executive.

<P>
Amendment No. 319, in page 6, line 28, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Executive arrangements agreed by any local authority under subsection (5) must be submitted to, and approved by, the Audit Commission, to ensure that they meet the criteria in subsection (5)(a) to (c).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Amendment No. 320, in page 6, line 28, at end insert-

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5A) An executive arrangement under subsection (5), may

<P>
(a) consist of more than 10 elected members, including any directly elected members, and

<P>
(b) comprise one or more executive committees, but must not

<P>
(c) exceed one third of the total number of elected members.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Ms. Hughes:</B> We had a wide-ranging debate on clause 9, which would have made the change to executive arrangements voluntary. We turn now to clause 11, particularly to subsection (5), which was also inserted in the Bill in the other place. It allows local authorities to adopt a form of executive other than the three in the Bill, provided that the authority considers that that form, first, enhances decision making, secondly, meets the principles of transparency, accountability and efficiency, and, thirdly, is appropriate to local circumstances.
 
<P>
Subsection (6) provides for the fact, which we have always recognised, that there may be other forms of executive that improve decision making and are transparent, efficient and accountable. We have always said that we would be prepared to make other forms available. That is why subsection (6) is already in the Bill. We do not know of any yet, but that does not mean that there are not any. We are willing to accept that, as councils develop and gain experience, other forms may become apparent for which they would want legal provision.

<P>
The problem with subsection (5) is that it would enable new forms of executive to be developed and put in place without any input from the Secretary of State-[
Interruption.] There is a point to that, and I am sure that Opposition Members realise what it is. Subsection (5) would enable new forms of executive to be developed and put in place without any input from the Secretary of State and without any mechanism for ensuring that the new forms proposed are consistent with the basic principles of the Bill.

<P>
The Bill introduces basic principles about the roles of full council and the separation between executive and scrutiny. It is important that there is a proper mechanism to ensure that any other form, however constitutional, that is not encompassed by the three in the clause also conforms to those principles and therefore to the law as stated in the Bill. That is perfectly reasonable.

<P>

<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): Can the Under-Secretary explain why she thinks the Secretary of State is in a better position and more entitled to decide what is an appropriate structure for a council than the electors of that council who, if they take against the new structures that it puts in place, can vote it out at the earliest opportunity?

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman should ask that question, because the Secretary of State, through an affirmative resolution process involving Parliament, must decide whether what a council proposes is consistent with the law as stated in the Bill. Local authorities do not have that power. Unless the hon. Gentleman is proposing fundamental changes to our constitution, he should know, as a Member, that that is not possible. That is the main weakness of the subsection.

<P>
The second weakness, which is not as important as the first but is nevertheless valid, is that any new form of constitution will require consequential changes to existing legislation and appropriate statutory instruments to be made. That is another reason why, if the process is to be done properly, it must involve not just the Secretary of State. New clause 12 makes it clear that councils can consider new forms of constitution that they think will fit the principles of the Bill, but that a mechanism involving the Secretary of State ensures that such forms are consistent with the Act, as it will be then, and with other legislation which will need to be changed.

<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I have the impression from what the Minister said that the ability to invite the Secretary of State to endorse a different form of executive could come only after the local authority had already practised one of the forms set out in the Bill. Is that correct or could a local authority propose a form of executive other than that prescribed in the Bill and submit that for the Secretary of State's approval through regulation as an alternative to what is set out in the Bill? In other words, what is the time scale?

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> The answer is yes. The local authority may propose new forms of arrangement after the Bill is enacted before it has necessarily tried one of the arrangements in the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Therefore, effectively-this is an important point-the Government are saying that there are three prescribed forms and a fourth form, as yet undefined, but, if he likes it, the Secretary of State may permit the local authority to go ahead with that form. I want to be clear that that is what is intended.

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> There might be several different forms, but it would not be a question of the Secretary of State liking them. If the forms that are put forward are consistent with the principles in new clause 12, which the Secretary of State will apply when making that judgment, those forms may be adopted.

<P>
Amendment No. 319 provides that executive arrangements agreed by the local authority could, instead of being approved by the Secretary of State, be approved by the Audit Commission. Although the Audit Commission fulfils a valuable role, such a task would not be within its remit of audit and inspection. A conflict of interest could arise if the commission had approved a form of executive, as the amendment proposes, but then discovered problems during the audit and inspection of that council. I ask the hon. Gentleman not to press the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> We understand the Minister's arguments. Indeed, a further argument that she might have made relates to the importance of the Secretary of State's involvement in the matter. My hon. Friend the Member for Torbay may expand on that point, if he catches your eye, Mr. O'Brien. However, we are happy to save the Committee's time by accepting the Minister's argument.

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> Amendment No. 320 would allow an authority to have an executive containing more than 10 members and possibly comprising more than one executive committee but with a limit on its size of one third of the total elected members.

<P>
Decision making in a large executive committee, or in several executive committees, would reduce accountability and challenge the fundamental principle of the Bill relating to the split between executive and scrutiny functions. In councils such as Wiltshire-where a system with a number of executives has been proposed, which may be in the hon. Gentleman's mind-we must examine the reasons why such a model has been proposed. In that instance, the council has stated publicly that every councillor ought to have a role somewhere in the decision-making process. Large executive committees, or a number of executive committees, can result in circumstances such as those.

<P>
In the interests of brevity, I shall not rehearse the arguments already presented by my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Durham, unless the hon. Member for Torbay wishes to intervene. We have already explained that the model that involves almost all councillors in some form of decision-making role strikes at the heart of the Bill's aim of maintaining a clear separation between executive and scrutiny functions.

<P>
<B>Mr. Adrian Sanders </B>(Torbay): Surely the point is that there are many different types and sizes of council. In a council of 36 members, an executive of 10 people would constitute almost a third of the membership. However, an executive of 10 people in a council of 78 members would constitute only a small percentage of the total. Why should there be one rule for all councils?

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> The Joint Committee considered that question. The hon. Gentleman may recall that our original proposal contained a combination of limits dictated by maximum and by percentage. The Joint Committee, whose recommendations we accepted, found that adopting a percentage limit could result in some larger councils having an extremely large executive, which would strike at the heart of one of the Bill's principles. A further problem is that a percentage limit might result in small councils such as Rutland having an executive of only four councillors, which might not be enough to fulfil important functions such as education and social services. We accepted the Joint Committee's recommendation and proposed not a specific size of executive, but a maximum.

<P>
The wide range of possibilities in the three models in clause 11 and the maximum number proposed will allow executives of different sizes and combinations and with different functions to meet the requirements and aspirations of the large range of councils. I ask the hon. Member for Torbay not to press his amendments, but to support Government amendment No. 119.

<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> We agree with much of what the Minister said about new clause 12. She provided clarification, but further questions remain.

<P>
The Minister said that there is a fourth option, which could take a number of variable structures. That is good news and will be welcomed throughout local government. But there is still over-prescription in the way in which those models will be judged, and the purpose of amendments Nos. 319 and 320 is to allow greater flexibility at local level and to allow local circumstances and local history to be considered, so that suitable arrangements can be found within a reduced set of principles that have been laid down at the centre.

<P>
New clause 12 contains three requirements, one of which is efficiency. In what the Minister said this morning and this afternoon, ``efficiency'' seemed to be taken to mean that decisions should be taken quickly by a small group of people with a common purpose who can lead their community to unite behind that decision. That is not necessarily efficiency, and the interpretation should be broader. Such efficiency could result in a small cabal of councillors, with minimal or no opposition, ploughing through decision making, as may happen in a committee system when there is only one party. The Minister said that she wanted to avoid that, and such efficiency is not transparent. The Government's interpretation seems to be that electors should be able to see who decided what and who is responsible for the accompanying mess or success; but it does not seem to be that the executive should meet in open session or ask members of the public to contribute. We need clarification on whether ``transparent'' includes open decision making, public involvement, opposition presence and press not excluded.

<P>
I turn to the meaning of ``accountable''. If electors can see clearly who got them into a mess, they can blame and oust those responsible. We know from our first-past-the-post electoral system and from the demography of different areas that there are one-party councils and that it is likely that, where a council has become unpopular without a strong opposition presence in the area, the election turnout is reduced but the same party retains control. Is that what the Minister means by ``accountable''?

<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Amendment No. 320 would enable membership of the executive to be widened beyond the restriction of 10, and allow more councillors to get involved in drawing up proposals from the outset. It would enable the existence of more than one executive committee, so that sectors of the authority's responsibilities could be considered. Not everyone would know each member of an executive committee of 10, but the lead person might be widely known and become more accountable. However, if different executives cover different areas, a lead person might form the executive of executives, and would therefore be accountable.

<P>
Amendment No. 320 might also enable the establishment of area committees-I doubt whether that will be possible under the Bill's new arrangements-so that an authority could be governed by neighbourhoods. A good example of that under the existing structure is area planning committees, through which all councillors elected in an area are responsible for planning decisions in that area. The criticism of the old system was that councillors representing a ward could say, ``I can't do anything because I'm not on the planning committee''.

<P>

<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Those provisions are included in clause 17.

<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that intervention. It is now on the record that area planning committees can be included in an executive structure.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Planning committees will remain in their current form, and planning will not form part of the new executive-scrutiny split. Planning and licensing fall outside that because of their particular nature.

<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> I thank the Minister for that clarification. Does her interpretation of accountability include the points that I made? Does her interpretation of transparency include those aspects that we recognise and think important?

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I had written the word ``Sanders'' at the top of a blank sheet of paper but, sadly, the paper remains otherwise blank. I doubt whether we can support the Liberal Democrat amendments because I am not sure that I fully understand them. However, at least we know that part of what the hon. Gentleman is trying to achieve is dealt with in clause 17, so that is a step forward.

<P>
The important point is that the Government intend to overturn Lords amendments that would have given local authorities broader discretion over the exact form of executive arrangements in their own areas, and replace them, as before, with a far more prescriptive arrangement.

<P>
It is instructive to look at the wording of subsection (5), which includes some reasonable ideas on how people should proceed. It states that an executive will take
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>reasonable steps to consult local government electors  enhance decision-making  meet the principles of transparency, accountability and efficiency-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
of which we always hear a great deal from Ministers-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>and  be appropriate to local circumstances.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the Government have their way, that part of the Bill will be rudely ripped up by the roots and replaced with new clause 12. We think-subject to one or two points of clarification on the Minister's speech-that the new clause falls far short of meeting the needs of local authorities. The exercise of arbitrary regulatory powers by the Secretary of State will be required in order to enable councils to adopt alternative arrangements. The Government's hard-line approach to the executive-scrutiny split empowers the Secretary of State to decide whether a proposed set of arrangements is satisfactory.

<P>
The requirement that a certain form of executive will be appropriate for all local authorities or for any particular description of local authorities completely undercuts the concept of local discretion-or, as the Bill puts it, being ``appropriate to local circumstances''. As a result of its improvement in the House of Lords, the Bill is plugged into local needs and circumstances, yet the Government are now intent on amending it to produce a more homogenised system. The point of allowing local authorities to choose their own decision-making structures is precisely so that they can tailor them to their own local needs. It will completely defeat the object of the exercise if those arrangements have to be demonstrably applicable to large numbers of other authorities.

<P>
The Joint Committee's report highlights several authorities in which the models that the Government propose would be inappropriate. Epsom and Ewell borough council, which has a tradition of independent control, stated in its submission that it is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>concerned that the Government is wrongly generalising that the  arrangements of some Councils<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
are
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the basis for making laws that must apply to all.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The council
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>urges the Government not to apply such a broad brush of central direction that it alienates or frustrates those Councils that share its objectives for services that are more citizen orientated and  more responsive to local community needs.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We are seeking from the Government an Act that recognises and celebrates the diversity of local government.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
None of that will be achieved if the Government amend the Bill as they propose.

<P>
The council does not seek to defend the committee system-indeed, it states that it shares the Government's mistrust of that system-but stresses its need to be able to design structures for itself that do not ``apply to all''. The Government amendments certainly do not meet that criterion. Far from ``celebrating'' local diversity, the Government appear to be intent on stamping it out.

<P>
Eden district council, which also has a tradition of independent control, highlights the difficulty of introducing executive arrangements where, as in Eden-in the words of its submission-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Decisions are made in open debate with an equal opportunity for all Members to contribute.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on to say that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This equality of opportunity is important because  only three options are given  each of which precludes  that equality of opportunity.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>These three options which are intended to introduce more transparency  are in fact restrictive of the transparency with which decisions are currently made at Eden.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The council asks the Government to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>give discretion to Councils to choose a decision making structure most suited to their needs.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Unfortunately, under the amendments, that discretion would be given firmly to the Secretary of State.

<P>
The Government's proposals are far more restrictive than the formula that was recommended by the Joint Committee. Paragraph 42 of its report recommends that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Secretary of State should have regard to whether  the authority has no tradition of party political control.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That formula would have allowed authorities to submit new arrangements that are
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>not in conformity with the executive arrangements on the face of the bill.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The report made no reference to the idea that an individual authority's proposals should also be applicable to other areas. The Government have ignored the Joint Committee's advice. They are falling back on the bald assertion that the executive-scrutiny split ipso facto provides greater accountability and more efficient decision making. The proposal is born of the Government's fixation with novelty, but there is no evidence to suggest that it will have that effect. The Bill should suit local circumstances, as proposed by the people whom I quoted earlier.

<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> We agree with the argument that the hon. Gentleman is pursuing-we want to maximise choice. He asked why the Government had moved away from the option that involved many different models within an executive system. The broad thrust of the Government's counter-argument to that proposal is to point out that if all local councils operated different models, each council would need its own legislation and that there might be a need for 410 Acts, each of which might be 100 pages long. The Government have an opportunity to secure greater flexibility without encountering the problems that we have discussed.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am grateful for that constructive intervention. The Under-Secretary should explain whether alternative approaches could achieve the same result without incurring bureaucracy and complexity.

<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> Our approach is flexible.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The Under-Secretary says that the Government's approach is flexible.

<P>
What did the Local Government Association say about the matter? After the Government's defeat on the issue in the House of Lords, Local Government First trumpeted the fact that the LGA would become further involved. It continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The LGA executive has decided to step into the breach and draw up a ``fourth option'' amendment that would allow councils to adopt structures that aren't outlined in the Bill.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I think that all Committee members have a copy of the LGA's briefing on the subject. There are two possible explanations in this regard, the first of which is that the LGA is right to be disappointed by this so-called compromise solution. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The LGA sought to work to produce a compromise solution to allow authorities to work up so-called locally developed models.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The other possible explanation is that the LGA misunderstood the nature of the amendments and of new clause 12.

<P>
I remind Committee members, in parenthesis, that subsection (3) of the new clause makes it clear that the proposed form of executive must be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>an appropriate form of executive for all local authorities, or for any particular description of local authority.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That involves an alternative form of executive. If that is a concession, it is a very narrow one. That is reflected in the fact that the LGA briefing contains obvious disappointment. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>However, the new clause does not say what other forms of executive the Secretary of State might approve  under the three options in the bill, in all cases an executive must take the form of a single body and may consist of more than 10 councillors 
<P>
 The new clause suggests that the Government do not intend to use this provision to allow for models for individual authorities but rather to provide broader frameworks for all or particular types of authorities.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>

<P>
It refers to 410 models, and states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>it is the sheer diversity of authority circumstances that has led to the call for greater flexibility. The Association has resisted the suggestion that any one type of model is more or less appropriate for any one type of authority.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It says that the amendment
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>confirms that commitment. It will obviously not provide for arrangements that do not include such an executive.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That, surely, is the point. There is an almost invisible movement by the Government in the direction of different forms of executive, as approved by the Secretary of State. That is why we share the LGA's disappointment in this regard-we feel strongly that the Government should have gone much further and allowed more open choices under the so-called fourth option. That is why we are not minded to accept new clause 12.

<P>

<B>Ms Hughes:</B> The hon. Member for Eastbourne is right on his last point. We have just completed the debate on clause 9, which would have allowed authorities to go beyond arrangements that include an executive, and are now discussing clause 11, which deals with executive arrangements.

<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The hon. Member for Torbay (Mr. Sanders) stressed the issue of accountability and also talked about open decision making. I was about to intervene at the time to clarify the point. Perhaps I can do so now.

<P>
The Bill opens to councils the decision whether executives meet in public or private, so it is not something about which a council needs to make a special representation to the Secretary of State under new clause 12. The hon. Gentleman raised the possibility that structures with different executives would cover different areas and referred to the leaders of each of those executives as the executive of the executive. That raises the question of who then is taking the decisions. Who do the public perceive as the executive? Surely that would dissipate so many executive roles around the council that, again, executive-scrutiny separation would be challenged.

<P>
Under the Bill, the executives are individuals-not an executive committee. It will be for the individual executive member to take responsibility for the functions that he is given by the full council.

<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> Surely that is the fallacy-people elect not an executive but individuals.

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> They vote for individuals, but I fail to see how that invalidates my point. When individuals have been elected as councillors and become executive members of the council, they will hold, in law, individual responsibility for the portfolio that they carry and for their decisions on matters relating to that portfolio. Although individual executive members will meet to discuss corporate issues, they will be personally accountable for their policy decisions. Therefore, the notion of an executive committee with the same powers as committees under current legislation is not appropriate. That is not the road that we are going down.

<P>
Accountability is fundamental to the Bill. Its provisions on executives and, especially, scrutiny will be much more apparent and visible to local people. Therefore, we must stick with the single executive of a size that enables a council to fulfil its functions and local people to know who is taking the decisions.

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Before the Minister moves on, will she reflect again on the issue of accountability and the number of executives? As the Bill makes clear, two bodies will make decisions: planning and licensing will be dealt with differently, and the executive will be responsible for all other matters, except those that are passed on to area committees. Therefore, a multiplicity of bodies already make decisions.

<P>
Can the Minister not foresee the possibility that education-the biggest spender and an issue that concerns many people-could have its own executive, with scrutiny panels and so on, so that people get to know who is on it and who they go to about the issues that they are interested in, and that another executive deals with all the rest, other than what is delegated to area committees and the planning department? Will she explain why that is more complicated than what we will already have?

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> It may not be more complicated, but I cannot see how what the hon. Gentleman has just outlined is different from the present education committee on a council or would avoid the problem, inherent in the current system, of making it clear who is taking education decisions.

<P>
The hon. Member for Eastbourne said that new clause 12 did not meet local authorities' needs. I disagree. It is deliberately worded in a similar way to clause 11(5). The only real difference is in paragraph (c), which the hon. Gentleman stressed, which says that the form must
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>be appropriate to local circumstances.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Instead, subsection (3)(c) of the new clause says that the form of executive should be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>an appropriate form of executive for all local authorities, or for any particular description of local authority.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is simply to ensure that any proposals are not so particular that they can apply only to a single council. That seems a reasonable provision.

<P>
New clause 12 will enable local authorities to put forward new proposals as soon as they are ready, and provides a clear and transparent set of principles by which not only the Secretary of State but, through the affirmative procedure, Parliament can debate whether to accept the proposals.

<P>
With that, I commend new clause 12 and amendment No. 119 to the Committee and ask Opposition Members to seek to withdraw amendments Nos. 319 and 320.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 24, in page 6, line 32, leave out paragraph (a).

<P>
Government amendments Nos. 120 and 121.

<P>
No. 25, in page 6, line 38, leave out ``(a) or''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The Bill provides for the Secretary of State to make regulations for the further type of executive, involving the direct election of some or all of the executive members other than the mayor, but the Government's thinking on this model is still unclear-hence some of the amendments. As far as I can see, the second draft of the proposed guidance is silent about the way in which functions will be carried out under this model, and the Government amendments do not do much to clarify the position.

<P>
If the Committee does not take my word for it, it should take the word of the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. McDonnell), who, on Second Reading, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Bill contains the opportunity to have directly elected individual cabinet posts. We need more clarity on that point, because it has not been debated in detail.-[Official Report, 11 April 2000; Vol. 348, c. 274.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I endorse what the hon. Gentleman says. I remember that when the Bill was first published there was quite a lot of surprise in local government circles that, on a proper reading, that was the effect of this part of the Bill-the direct election of individual executive members. However, a lack of draft regulations makes it almost impossible for Opposition Members to scrutinise this aspect of the Bill properly.

<P>
The idea of a directly elected executive member responsible for individual policy areas may merit closer consideration, but I consider that it could be a recipe for chaos in some authorities. It is difficult to give it closer consideration without more information.

<P>
If an executive member for housing were in a different party from, and were elected on an entirely different manifesto from, let us say, the executive member with responsibility for social services, questions of accountability would surely arise, because decisions would inevitably overlap. Even in areas of profound disagreement, a compromise could perhaps be brokered, but responsibility for individual decisions would be blurred and it would be even more difficult for electors to hold decision takers to account.

<P>
There is a further problem. The Minister maintained on Second Reading that the full council will continue to be the policy-making body, and the executive will exist merely to give effect to that policy. If so, there may be a difference between the policy agreed by the council and that put forward by the various directly elected executive members. It is difficult to see how the Government intend to deal with that situation, should it arise. How would accountability and effective decision taking be enhanced in such an event?

<P>
Those are the basic concerns that gave rise to the amendments. I shall not go into more detail at this stage, but I should be grateful for further explanation from the Minister on how those problems will be avoided.

<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I shall be very brief, because I know that we are anxious to make progress. The omission of subsection (7) would remove some of the flexibility that the Government propose to extend through new clause 12. I find it difficult to understand why the hon. Member for Eastbourne moved amendment No. 18. Perhaps he wanted to persuade the Minister to give a flavour of some of the other options-the hon. Gentleman did not use those words-particularly those mentioned in subsection (6) and expanded in new clause 12. We still have no idea what form those alternatives would take, and why they would meet the Secretary of State's requirements. I confess that I do not understand why the hon. Member for Eastbourne wants to delete the three options provided.

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> Hon. Members will be aware that the purpose of subsection (7) was explained at length during a debate in another place. The intention is simply to clarify the scope and extent of the power that could be used under subsection (6). That is designed to ensure that the Bill is sufficiently flexible to allow other forms of executive to be added in the light of the council's experience of operating executive arrangements. As the hon. Member for Bath said, given the arguments that we have heard in favour of extending as far as possible the Bill's flexibility and number of options, it is a little perverse for the Opposition to argue for the removal of a provision that will increase future options.

<P>
We have no ulterior motive, and there is no particular way in which we want to use the power in subsections (6) and (7). I think that representations were made at an early stage in the development of these ideas. In other countries, it is not uncommon for some members of an executive to be directly elected, for specific posts to have direct elections that involve the entire electorate, or for people in addition to the mayor to be directly elected to a cabinet and the posts allocated after the election. Given that the Bill provides for a directly elected mayor-an institution already in place in other countries-we should ensure that we can move in that direction if councils make such proposals, having had experience of working with a separation of their executive and scrutiny functions.

<P>
Amendment No. 120 clarifies that not all members of a cabinet need be directly elected, and that an executive could comprise both directly elected members and other members who had been elected to a council in the usual way. Amendment No. 121 is simply a drafting amendment consequential on that. I commend those amendments to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I asked the Minister politely whether she had any other versions of an executive in mind. I pointed out that it would be foolish to delete the measure, which provides three possibilities. Before she finishes, will she share another three with the Committee?

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> I thought that I had replied quite openly that I had no ulterior motive, and that the Government are not necessarily seeking to go down any particular route as a result of this measure. It is an enabling provision, which will enable any ideas proposed by councils to be implemented, provided they comply with new clause 12, without the need for further legislation. On this occasion, I cannot elaborate further. However, I shall be interested to see any proposals that are made. With that, I commend amendments Nos. 120 and 121 to the Committee and ask the Opposition to withdraw their amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> This measure is a recipe for incoherence. It is supposed to be a product of joined-up government. However, I cannot imagine a sillier system than one in which people can be directly elected and each claim a direct mandate to deal with policies what might be wholly inconsistent, or even contradictory. One might, for example, have a candidate who supported the transfer of housing stock, and another-perhaps a mayoral candidate-who was against such a transfer. I do not understand how such a system could work in practice. How on earth is a voter to get effective scrutiny when there is a possibility of candidates being elected whose policies do not match? We have seen the curious things that can happen with the sort of turnout that these elections attract.

<P>
This is a barmy idea, and I hope that the Government will not pursue it further. Local authorities think that it is pretty barmy. It is disingenuous of the Government to say that this is just another option. It is astonishing that a Government who spend so much time banging on about joined-up government could come up with a scheme that seems almost mechanically designed to militate against that concept. It is daft.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I will not repeat what I said earlier. Indeed, my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon has put it even better than I did.

<P>
The measure is not a recipe for joined-up government but the opposite. We are still in the dark as to how it would work in practice. I fear that the Government will live to regret the provisions because of the chaos that they could bring to some local authorities. However, I have a constant quest not to be churlish, and I have no wish to waste the Committee's time. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Amendments made: No. 120, in page 6, line 32, leave out ``each member of which is'' and insert
<P>

<P>
No. 121, in page 6, line 33, leave out ``of'' and insert ``for''.-[Mr. Robert Ainsworth.]

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 26, in page 6, line 40, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) The authority may determine the title to be used for the position of mayor elected under this Act.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendment No. 176.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The amendment relates to the titles to be taken by elected mayors under the Bill. Under existing legislation, the title of mayor denotes the ceremonial figurehead of an authority, the chairman of council meetings, someone who is said to be above the political fray-although it does not always work out like that in practice. Such factors, when they operate properly, allow the mayor to perform a valuable civic role as the public face of an authority. Many authorities value that aspect of the mayor's position.

<P>
Under the terms of the Bill, authorities that opt for a directly elected mayor could lose the use of the word as a ceremonial title. Evidence relating to that was given to the Joint Select Committee. I shall not give details-they are in the report-but the issue was raised in different ways by the city councils of Leicester, Derby and Birmingham. The Joint Select Committee concluded that it would
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>support those authorities who may wish to make arrangements to preserve the ceremonial work of the mayor, or to vary nomenclature in a manner that better reflects the traditions of the area.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Joint Committee made that recommendation to the Secretary of State.

<P>
Our amendment is a response to the concerns expressed, not only by the handful of councils that I said had done so in their evidence to the Select Committee, but throughout local government.

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I agree with everything that the hon. Gentleman said-with one proviso. There is an additional complication, to which he did not refer. In some council areas, there are smaller areas covered by charter trustees who hold the historic post of mayor. There would be great confusion in, for example, my own area, where the long-established mayor of Bath would be competing with the elected mayor of Bath and North East Somerset council. Such confusion is the one thing that would ensure that a referendum on having an elected mayor for Bath and North East Somerset would not get through. There should be an alternative title.

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> On the face of it, amendment No. 26 might have some attraction. However, the Government amendment makes it clear why we cannot accept it. Our amendment is preferable as a way of achieving the clarity about the issue of the title that we need.

<P>
It is only right that the person elected by all the electors in a local authority area to be the executive, political and community leader of the authority should be called mayor, and should be entitled to that name. People have the right to expect that. Hon. Members have raised the fact that in London boroughs, district councils with borough status in England and some county boroughs in Wales, for instance, the chair of the council is currently entitled to the style ``mayor''. If such councils opt to have an elected mayor, there may be a risk of confusion and lack of clarity, although, to take the example of London, I doubt whether anyone would confuse the elected mayor of London with the Lord Mayor of London. Perhaps, when we assume that there will be confusion, we underestimate the electors' ability to understand the issue.

<P>
For the reasons that I have set out, it is important that the elected person retain the title. In circumstances in which there will be a civic mayor and an elected mayor, the title of mayor will fall to the elected person, not the chair of the council. That is the effect of our amendment. The Opposition may not agree, but we feel strongly that the person who has been elected by everyone should have the title, not the civic leader.

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Will the Minister answer my specific point? I used my locality as an example, because I know it best. Is she saying that if the people of the Bath and North East Somerset council area choose to go for an elected mayor, the current mayoral title, which is determined by the charter trustees of Bath, will have to disappear?

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> We recognise that, in a small number of cases, the title of mayor derives not from borough status but from ancient charter. In that situation, the title, including that of elected mayor, will continue under whichever form a new constitution is chosen. A local choice will establish who, under the new constitution, holds the ancient title. If it is decided that the elected mayor should not hold that title, the small number of affected authorities will need to ensure that the two mayoral titles are distinguished from each other in some way. In the small number of exceptional cases that involve a charter, local decision making will establish how to implement the titles.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am intrigued. How should one distinguish between a mayor and a mayor? Perhaps they will be given different numbers. I do not know how the relevant precedents work. I am reminded of the section in, I believe, ``Burke's Peerage'', which states that the Aga Khan is a direct descendent of God and that an English earl takes precedence. More detailed work is needed in this regard. In a spirit of comradeship, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 80, in page 6, line 42, leave out 10 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`one-fifth of the number of members of the authority'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
As drafted, the Bill will not permit executives to have more than 10 members. Many authorities believe that that figure is unduly prescriptive. There are some large metropolitan authorities and county councils-Birmingham has 117 members and Leeds and Manchester both have 99. If they had to choose a maximum of 10 members of the executive, many back benchers would be left in non-executive roles.

<P>
The formula in the draft Bill stated that the executive should not exceed 10 members or 15 per cent. of the total number of councillors, whichever was the smaller. The Government listened on that occasion-they were obviously having a good day-were persuaded by representations from, among others, the LGA and agreed that the earlier approach was unduly prescriptive and that the executives of smaller authorities would come under an intolerable strain. The Joint Committee pointed out that Rutland had 20 members and would have been required to have only three executive members. Despite that concession, which I welcome, there is no obvious reason why there should be an upper limit of 10 members. This probing amendment is intended to establish why the Government cannot be a little more relaxed about the maximum number.

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> I rehearsed some of the relevant arguments on this issue in an earlier response to the hon. Member for Torbay. We considered limiting the size of the cabinet to whichever was the lower of 10 members or 15 per cent. of the number of councillors. The Joint Committee examined the matter thoroughly and put to us the view that using a percentage would be restrictive.

<P>
The amendment would enhance discrepancies. Rutland, for example, which has some serious responsibilities, including education and social services, would be allowed a cabinet of only four members. At the other end of the scale, a very large authority such as Birmingham could have a cabinet of 23 members, which would not lead to the accountability, efficiency and transparency that we seek.

<P>
We received advice about the matter through the draft Bill process, the Joint Committee's examination of the proposals and the comments of a wide range of people. We accepted the Joint Committee's advice that it would be better to set an overall maximum in the Bill. In principle, a smaller executive is better than a larger one.

<P>
The use of percentages would have potentially serious implications for individual councils, and I must therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.

</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The Government amendments are technical amendments which clarify our intentions on executive functions. I shall respond to amendments Nos. 295 and 324 after Opposition Members have spoken to them.

<P>
Amendment No. 122 replaces the provision in clause 12(3) to ensure that-except where express provision is made in the Bill, regulations under clause 12 or any enactment that is passed or made after the Bill is enacted-the functions of a local authority are the responsibility of the executive. Amendment No. 123 is consequential on that.

<P>
Amendment No. 202 is an example of that sort of express provision. It contains a new subsection by which any function conferred on a local authority by virtue of part II of the Bill is not to be the responsibility of the executive. The functions that are conferred under part II are all constitutional functions such as amending the executive's arrangements and constitution, running referendums and elections and drawing up proposals. In line with the approach that we have adopted in the revised draft regulations and the guidance that we circulated last week, the Government are of the view that such functions should not be the responsibility of the executive, but should, in most cases, be dealt with by the full council.

<P>
Amendment No. 124 is a technical amendment which brings clause 12(4) into line with clause 24(2). I should remind members of the Committee that clause 12(2)(b) allows the Secretary of State to specify in regulations the functions that councils may choose to be the responsibility of the executive. The draft regulations illustrate the intended use of that power. Clause 24 requires councils to decide, in drawing up their proposals for executive arrangements, which local choice functions will be the responsibility of the executive. Amendment No. 124 therefore replaces ``may'' with ``must'' in the opening words of clause 12(4) to require executive arrangements to include provision on which local choice functions will be the responsibility of the executive. It brings clause 12 into line with clause 24.

<P>
Amendment No. 125 arises from that change. Under amendment No. 124, executive arrangements must include provision on the status of local choice functions, so it is necessary to include explicitly the possibility that those functions may not be the responsibility of the executive. Amendment No. 125 achieves that.

<P>
Much of what the hon. Member for Bath said in his intervention is covered by those technical amendments.

<P>
Amendment No. 126 ensures that regulations under clause 12 will be able to make provision on the function of a description specified as well as functions specified. For example, instead of having to specify separately all the functions relating to the granting of licences that are not for the executive, it will be possible to make general provision to that effect. I hope that that will make the regulations easier to understand as well as shorter. The amendments are not controversial and I hope that Opposition Members will not oppose them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> The Minister managed to keep almost a straight face when she told us that the amendments are simple and that life is nice and easy now that she has moved them. She said that the matters that I raised earlier are already covered. In the same spirit of cheerfulness and friendliness and with a desperate desire to make rapid progress, I want to make a couple of quick points on amendment No. 324.

<P>
I am sure that the Minister is aware that some organisations are concerned about the arrangements for land use planning. The Minister said that some of their concerns have been covered in the second version of the draft guidance, but I have two in particular. The first is the way in which the proposals will separate the work on the development plan from the development control functions. The broad principle, which has been accepted by all parties for a long time, is that land use planning involves the two working hand in hand. It has long been accepted that decisions on a proposed building and how it fits in with the longer term plan should be considered together, but under the Government's proposals they are separated. Their one concession in the revised guidance is to say that one member of the executive, preferably the member responsible for land use planning, should be on the committee that deals with development control. I should be grateful if the Minister would explain how there can be better co-ordination of the two.

<P>
My second concern is not covered in the guidance. The executive will be responsible for preparation of the development plan and I am worried that lack of openness in the executive may exclude the opportunity for public and third-party debate that currently exists in the preparation of the development plan. Some organisations want reassurance from the Minister.

<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> On amendment No. 295, the universal agreement is that the functions listed in the amendment should not be part of the executive's responsibility. That is in the draft guidance and regulations, but the concern about that is such that it is more appropriate that they should be in the Bill.

<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I understand that the point of amendment No. 295 is that Opposition Members accept what the Government are saying about that in the guidance but want it in the Bill. I urge caution. Our discussions with many local government representatives have made it clear that specifying functions to slot into the various categories is, to put it mildly, extremely complex. No matter what words are used to describe the principles, there will always be the odd exception. As the hon. Member for Eastbourne said last week, the principles then become subject to challenge and so on. Functions relating to the local government pension scheme do not readily fit into the descriptions in our guidance, but the simplest solution to ensure that the current rights and representation of employees are maintained is for those functions to continue to be discharged as they are now. It is precisely because the issue is so complex that it has been left to regulations and guidance.

<P>
It is important to maintain the maximum flexibility to amend and adapt the regulations in the light of councils' experience of operating executive arrangements; not to do so would be a disservice to councils. The amendment would constrain that flexibility, and I urge Opposition Members not to press it to a vote.

<P>
On amendment No. 134, the hon. Member for Bath is right in saying that there should be consistency between the development planning process and the development control decisions to ensure public confidence in the plan-led system. Following evidence from the Planning Officers Society and the Royal Town Planning Institute, the Joint Committee recommended that the guidance that underpins the Bill should provide that local authorities ensure effective exchange of information between the executive and the development control committee on planning functions. We have taken that recommendation fully on board. It is reflected in paragraphs 8.8 to 8.10 of the draft guidance. I assure the hon. Gentleman that, in their discussions with the Department, the Planning Officers Society and the Royal Town Planning Institute said that they were content with the Government's approach. It is a matter for statutory guidance rather than undue prescription in the Bill and I hope that hon. Members will accept that.

<P>
To answer the hon. Gentleman's second point, in developing a forward plan, the executive will give early indications of when they will consider those matters, so the amount of scrutiny and the public's ability to ask questions will be greater than at present. I therefore hope that he will not press his amendment.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.
