                           </span> It is clear that
democratic accountability in policing decisions is taking a huge leap
forward in this Bill, but there are two aspects included within that
phrase, “democratic accountability”. It is the second
aspect—“accountability”—that amendment 21
relates to.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000027">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">“Accountability”
entails a requirement upon the electorate to judge whether an elected
individual, in this case the police and crime commissioner, has
performed well during their term in office. In exercising that
judgment, “information is power”. I use that phrase quite
deliberately, because it was used by the Minister this morning on Radio
4 in relation to the enhanced local crime figures that are now
available. This amendment relates to the availability of information to
people, so that they can make the judgment on the police and crime
commissioner, and in particular on whether they have delivered on the
manifesto on which they stood.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000028">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

requires the PCC to

                        <p>The
major things that people are assessing would be the performance of the
PCC and, of course, the performance of the chief constable and his
force. I want to focus on the word “necessary”, to probe
exactly what is meant by that and to what extent
“necessary” information actually applies.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000030">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It would be
useful to have a judgment of what is “necessary”
considered by someone other than the PCC. Amendment 21 would place that
responsibility on the police and crime panel, which seems a sensible
place to put it, although that is open to debate. However, the
important point is that it would be somebody who is not directly
looking at a potential imminent re-election, because somebody who is in
that position might skew what they feel is “necessary” to
publish at that point. The essence of the amendment concerns the
definition of what is felt to be “necessary” information
and who should
be—<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000031">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman tried to make that point this
morning. What counts against that point is the necessarily long term of
the police and crime plans. The police and crime plans are put in place
for a long period, whereas an election is only some way
off.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000033">&#160;</a>

amendment is to explore that idea and to see whether there is a need to
pin down what information would fall within that category of
“necessary”.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000034">&#160;</a>

Good afternoon, Mr Chope, and welcome back to the Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000035">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I thank my
hon. Friend for the way in which he moved the amendment, and I
understand the issues that he is trying to raise. I believe that it is
true that “information is power”, as I said this morning
when we launched the new street-level crime mapping. I can report to
the Committee that the website—www.police.uk—was
receiving 300,000 hits a minute earlier today, which is the equivalent
to 18 million hits an hour. That almost certainly breaks all records
for hits on a Government website. It is now back up—it is hardly
surprising that, facing an unprecedented level of demand, it ran a
little slowly at some
points.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000036">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Information
is power and the Government are fully committed to the transparency
agenda, as we demonstrated this morning. We want to ensure full
transparency of police and crime commissioners and forces. We have
introduced a Freedom of Information Act requirement on the Association
of Chief Police Officers, which will apply later this year and ought to

has been argued that there might be occasions when police and crime
commissioners would be less than willing to disclose information and
data that might question their efficiency and effectiveness, or those
of the chief constable. That challenge confronts all elected

to replace a chief constable could publish bits of information casting
doubt on the chief constable’s
performance.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000039">&#160;</a>

comply with any of those duties—sending them to the Tower or
something else—but perhaps he can tell me, and we can no doubt

is power, and it is important that, as we seek to reduce bureaucracy,
police forces do not confuse the requirement for information, which is

as saying that they should be performance managed. The Government seek
to draw a distinction between the two.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000057">&#160;</a>

allowing a local police and crime commissioner to do exactly what they
want and thinking that commissioners must do certain
things—otherwise, how will we know what they are doing? That
tension will always exist, and I do not say that as a criticism,

states:<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000069">&#160;</a>

the panel gets the annual report that is produced under clause 12 and
has a meeting in public to discuss it. Is that one public meeting about
the police and crime panel’s action plan? If it is one public
meeting, is it a public meeting of the panel, or is it a meeting of the
panel to which the public are invited at which they can contribute and
ask questions about the action plan? If it is one public meeting, is
that not insufficient for an action plan, which lays out all the
different things contained in the annual report and which must report

the PCC’s functions—in each financial year?<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000070">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
annual report is clearly very important, because the Minister has put
so many “musts” in it. There is therefore very important
information that should go to everyone in Devon and Cornwall, Surrey,
North Wales, Sussex, West Yorkshire and South Wales with details of the
progress made, yet it is not clear exactly what is required of the
annual report. The requirement should surely be more public-facing
meetings in respect of the action plan. That goes to the heart of the
problem and the way in which the Bill is set out. As I understand it,
the action plan is produced and the police and crime panel must
organise a public meeting at which the action plan is discussed and to
which the police and crime commissioner must go. That is one public
meeting.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000073">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The Bill
requires one public meeting to hold the police and crime commissioner
to account for all the progress made—or not—on the
policing and crime plan. Frankly, that is inadequate. It will not be
the Minister’s intention, but if he is looking at
“musts” within the context of clause 12 and what is
required by clause 28(3), it is not sufficient in terms of public
involvement.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000074">&#160;</a>

hon. Member for Edinburgh West and I have a concern, which we will come
to later, about the relationship between the police and crime panel and
the police and crime commissioner. That is a fair concern. There is
also a concern about what it means to actually engage with the public
and how we get the views of the public over and above the one or two
who may turn up. I will leave the Minister with that, and I look
forward to his
response.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000075">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The point is that we should be setting a minimum
requirement. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that the dilemma
throughout is how prescriptive to be. To what extent should we write it
into primary legislation that these devolved bodies should do certain
things? My view is that there is a minimum expectation that they should
be required to meet, and the provision of information is included in
that. In my view, it was right to specify that every elected local
policing body—in other words, the police and crime commissioners
or the Mayor—must produce an annual
report.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000076">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Discretion
is equally important. Clause 12(7)
states:<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000077">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>In
the same way, the Bill says that regular meetings are to be held by the
police to fulfil the Government’s promise that regular beat
meetings will be available to the public, but we are not being
prescriptive about the period or how those meetings take place. We are
pointing to best practice. Yesterday, we published examples of best
practice and how it could be delivered. However, the police do not need
or want to be told the period in which they should hold the meetings,
and we want to move away from the idea that they are held in draughty
church halls with no one coming. We want to move to innovative ways of
engaging with the public, which the police are increasingly doing.
However, it is right to set the minimum requirements, so that the
public can know that there is a core
expectation.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000078">&#160;</a>

we are discussing is analogous to a public company that holds a meeting
that shareholders can attend once a year. As we know, those meetings
can be quite significant events for public companies. They are an
opportunity for smaller shareholders, in particular, to arraign the
board of public companies. What I am saying is that the public meeting
that is organised by the panel is necessary, but it is not sufficient
in terms of engagement. There are other ways in which we specify that
there should be
engagement.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000079">&#160;</a>

clause 14 include arrangements for obtaining the community’s
views on policing. There are plenty of other measures in the Bill that
ensure that the police and crime commissioner engages, and any sensible
commissioner will want to ensure that they have arrangements in place
for communicating what is happening to the public and for hearing the
public’s views. They would be unwise if they did not do so, and

saying that the prescription in the Bill is a minimum requirement,
notwithstanding the fact that he then found out that numerous other
clauses allow him to do certain things. The phrase, “a public
meeting of the panel,” does not lay out the Minister’s

areas that make up the participating authority. That would have been a
sensible amendment, and I should have tabled it, but the Minister has
challenged me and I have put it on  the record—it was
not bad off the top of my head. The serious point is that the tension
in the Bill relates to  the remoteness of the police and crime
commissioner. The Minister will say that that is overcome by the fact
that they have a democratic mandate every four years and will be kicked
out if they are no good, but it is reasonable to require that the

Government and the Minister should be congratulated on including that
in the Bill. Victims of crime and victims of the fear of crime across
the country and our communities will be pleased. That is not to say
that police authorities, police forces or local authorities have
ignored the wishes of victims of crime, but specifying those words on
the face of the Bill in the way in which the Minister has done is an
important step forward, and it would be churlish of me not to mention
it.

                        <p class="tabbed">However,
a legitimate question that people will ask about that is: how does the
Minister anticipate that being done? Similarly, when the Minister is
obtaining and collecting the views of communities, what process does he
expect the police and crime commissioner to go through? What is the
role of the police and crime commissioner vis-à-vis the police
and crime panel? What is the role of local authorities? We get a lot of
words that say, “These arrangements must do this”, but
what does the Minister believe will happen as a
consequence?<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000102">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I note that consultation of
the community includes the business community. The Bill states
“ratepayers”. In respect of consultation and arrangements
for obtaining the views of the community on policing, does that include
the business community? Also, when the Bill states, “relevant
ratepayers’ representatives”, does it also mean residents
groups? I am struggling to understand what “ratepayers’
representatives” means. Again, I am not nit-picking on
semantics. Does the Minister mean residents associations, or does he
mean ratepayers associations? I would be interested in some
clarification on that
question.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000103">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am also interested in why subsection (6), tucked away at the end of the
clause, would omit subsections (6) to (10) of section 96 of
the Police Act 1996. I wonder whether the Minister will regret omitting
all that. One of those subsections
states:<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000104">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“If
it appears to the Secretary of State that arrangements for a police
area are not adequate for the purposes set out in subsection (1), he
may require the body or person whose duty it is to make arrangements
for that area to submit a report to him concerning the
arrangements.”<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000416">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>The
matter goes back to some of the debates that we have had about
“musts” and localism versus prescription. Section 96 of
the 1996 Act, and particularly the provision that I have just
congratulated the Government on including, is important. The Home
Secretary should have the ability to ensure that the arrangements in
place are sufficient for the aims to be met. The Minister may regret
leaving out those subsections, unless their powers are replicated
somewhere else in the Bill to allow such intervention by the Home
Secretary when he believes that arrangements are inadequate.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000105">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Under an
earlier clause, we discussed where the public fit within the new model,

answer. Yet there is a wish list. Again, I understand that that will be
for local people to decide, but alongside that, we need to understand a
little more about how those views will be collected and collated. Does
he not believe, in hindsight, that it might have been better to leave
himself at least a reserve power to be used in extremis? I am
interested to hear his
comments.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000106">&#160;</a>

points that the hon. Gentleman has made, but I will try to address
them. He tried to draw me into how a police and crime commissioner
should make arrangements for consulting the public before issuing a
policing power or levying a precept. Although it is important that PCCs
consult the public, I will not be drawn into that discussion. It is
nonsense to suggest that Parliament should prescribe how they obtain
the public’s views. On balance, it is legitimate to require in
statute and the law of the land that they do so—it would be
unwise for them not to—but I do not think that it is necessary
to be drawn into how they should go about it.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000107">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman asked why we have omitted the subsections that, in current
legislation, enable the Secretary of State to intervene if the
consultative arrangements do not come up to scratch. The fundamental
difference is that the police and crime commissioners will have a
mandate from the public and therefore a connection with them. They
will, therefore, be much more strongly motivated to consult than a
merely appointed body would be, so I think that it is enough to place a
duty on PCCs without being prescriptive. We have been clear about where
the Secretary of State should continue to have powers to intervene, but
such powers involve issues relating to serious failure or situations in
which the Secretary of State must prescribe an approach relating to
policing requirements and so on. We will come to that. I do not think
that the measure falls into that category. I am grateful for the hon.
Gentleman’s comments about the provision urged on us by the
victims’ commissioner to consult victims of crime. That is
important, as my hon. Friends have pointed out.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000110">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I suspect that at some point, the Minister will be
drawn into it. The fact of the matter is that the 1996 Act included
such a measure not because the Secretary of State desired to intervene,
but because a reserve power was needed to intervene where it might be
necessary. I am not saying that because the police and crime
commissioner is elected for four years he will be motivated all the
time by the fact that he was elected. Many who work for police
authorities are immensely motivated and public-spirited citizens, and
they spend a

three years’ time there will be an election and people can get

objectives. The deputy Mayor for policing will be permitted to prepare
them, but I ask the Committee to note that responsibility for issuing
or varying a police and crime plan remains with the Mayor. The second
will be the requirement to attend meetings of the police and crime
panel when requested to do so. It is the Government’s position
that that qualifies as day-to-day functions of the Mayor’s

                           </strong> Yes, I am happy to confirm that. The provision
will enable him to delegate the functions, so that the deputy Mayor can
go, but there are bound to be circumstances in which the police and
crime panel wants the Mayor to attend, and I think that then the Mayor
would be well advised to go. It might reflect very badly on the Mayor
if there were a major issue for which he was not willing to answer,
just as at the moment the chief officers appear before the Greater
London authority, not because they are required to but because they
judge it is wise to do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000127">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
third function is the preparation of the annual report to the police
and crime panel. The Mayor will remain responsible for issuing that
report, but will have the option of delegating its preparation. Matters
that remain the sole responsibility of the Mayor will be the issuing of
the police and crime plan and the Mayor’s functions in
connection with senior officer appointments and suspensions. Those
matters, we judge, are so fundamental to the role of policing
governance that it is right that the individual with ultimate
democratic responsibility should retain direct responsibility for
them.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000128">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is clear to
me that the amendment will provide the right balance of responsibility
between delegation and retained powers for the Mayor of London. In
conclusion, although we want to ensure that powers can be delegated as
appropriate, Londoners will clearly understand, and it will remain the
case, that it is the Mayor who is the elected figure, and the buck will
stop with the Mayor. I believe that that is the case now. Under
existing legislation proposed by the previous Government, the Mayor
can, as we discussed last week, delegate the chairmanship of the
Metropolitan Police Authority. In my view that  will continue
to be the case. Londoners will expect the buck to stop with the Mayor,
because that is who they vote
for.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000129">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful for your guidance, Mr
Chope. I accept that the clause, if left as drafted, would make us
question what the point of the deputy Mayor is, because it would appear
that there is little left for the deputy to do if all the
responsibilities in subsection (7) remain with the Mayor.
Those restrictions still leave some limited powers for the deputy
Mayor, and my concern is about whether that suggests that although the
vast bulk of the responsibilities stay with the directly elected Mayor,
there is potential for some confusion about who is absolutely
responsible for policing in London and who is ultimately accountable to
the people of London.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000132">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To take a
current example, the chair of the Metropolitan Police Authority is, as
I have said before, a high-profile figure who does most of the media
interviews on policing issues. If the Mayor has taken the trouble to
delegate the responsibility for policing to a deputy, it follows that
the deputy will have lots of day-to-day responsibilities for and
contacts with the police, and will therefore know the detail that the
Mayor of London will not, because of his wider responsibilities for
transport, housing and all the other policy areas. The deputy Mayor
will therefore do many of the interviews, and he will be the public
face for the Mayor’s office in its function as the body
responsible for scrutinising the Metropolitan
police.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000133">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
would be grateful to the Minister for his response on this. Is there
any probability that the public will become confused about whether it
is the role of the Mayor or of the deputy Mayor to be responsible for
scrutinising the Metropolitan police? Will he also expand more on how
the deputy Mayor will function, given the restrictions placed on him by
his not being delegated the responsibilities listed in subsection (7),
even after the clause has been amended? It seems to me that, if there
is any point in delegating responsibility to a deputy Mayor, the bulk
of the responsibilities must be delegated, as is now the case, with the
Mayor having delegated virtually everything to the chair of the
Metropolitan Police Authority. What will be the exact purpose of the
deputy Mayor, given the restrictions that are placed on him by the
clause, despite the amendment that will reduce the extent of those
restrictions?<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000134">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thought that the hon. Gentleman made a bit of a
meal of that. He cannot have it both ways—his judgment is either
that too much or that too little will be delegated to the deputy Mayor,
and I was not clear what he was arguing. He ended by saying that the
situation will be confused in the eyes of Londoners, but that will not
be so under the current arrangements. Londoners are well aware that the
Mayor will have ultimate responsibility, as the person whom they elect.
It so happens that the deputy Mayor is elected to the Greater London
authority, although we have established that that need not be the
case.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000135">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Londoners
perfectly understand that the concept of appointing a deputy is about
the delegation not of responsibility, but of the exercise of the
day-to-day functions. In exactly the same way, a police force has a
chief constable who ultimately has responsibility, and his deputies
take on specific functions so that the force can be run effectively and
the day-to-day functions do

                           </div>not all fall on the chief officer; and that happens in the Met. The
principle of the division is clear—the responsibility stays with
the Mayor as the elected person, and the functions can be delegated.
The amendment is just a drafting amendment that reflects that balance.

confusion.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000136">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> To come back to the Minister on amendments 54 and
55, if I sounded confused, it is because I am. I apologise if I did not
make my point very well, and I will have another go. The position of
chair of the MPA is currently a very high-profile position. There is a
lot of media interest in police issues, as demonstrated by the meeting
of the MPA last week. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the
position of deputy Mayor with responsibility for policing and crime
within the Mayor’s office will have a similarly high
profile.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000140">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Given that
that is the case, and that so many responsibilities remain with the
Mayor, my question is whether there is a possibility for confusion in
the minds of the public that the deputy Mayor, rather than the Mayor,
would be fulfilling the role similar to that of  the chair of
the MPA. It is clear that the Mayor does not currently have that
day-to-day input in policing matters, as is envisaged in the Bill. The
Mayor will appoint the deputy Mayor, who may be high profile but will
not have all the responsibilities that the current chair of the MPA
has. Is there the inherent possibility in the Bill that confusion will
be created in the minds of the
public?<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000141">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
other point is that outside of London—we have referred to this
before—the PCCs are directly elected. Although they can
delegate, under clause 18 they are limited in what they can delegate to
someone to represent them in pursuit of their various functions and
duties as police commissioner. The lines of communication and
responsibility are much clearer outside of London than the arrangement
in London with the Mayor and deputy Mayor looks likely to be. The other
point is that it is the directly elected person who is clearly
responsible outside of London. In London, we have the possibility that
the Mayor could delegate to someone who was unelected. The coalition
and the Conservative party have made a great deal out of the principle
of the accountability of those who have been elected. Members of the
London assembly have made the point that that principle does not follow
though in the appointment of the deputy Mayor, because that person
could be neither directly elected through the assembly nor
democratically accountable through a local authority or any other body.
We may return to that in the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000142">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
the principle of democratic accountability is important, it sends a
strong signal if we require the person delegated by the Mayor to be his
deputy to have a democratic mandate as well. What we have at the
moment—both I and others have suggested this—is
inconsistent with the arrangements that we have outside of London. On
the issue of the delegation of responsibilities, we have seen 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>under clause 7 as amended that it is either necessary to delegate, as is
currently the case with the chair of the MPA, much of the
day-to-day heavy lifting of being responsible for
the accountability of the Metropolitan police, or the responsibility
remains with the Mayor. The clause has neither one nor the other. The
lines of clear democratic accountability between the public and the
person who is carrying out the day-to-day function of holding the chief
officers of the Metropolitan Police Service to account is blurred as
the clause stands. I know that the Minister will not agree with
me.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000143">&#160;</a>

Minister to respond to that question when he replies to my comments.
There is potential for great confusion in the setting-up process for
the Mayor and a deputy. The deputy will have only part of the function.
They will probably be a high-profile individual, but they will not be
accountable for all the things for which the public will expect them to
be accountable. I will be interested to hear the Minister’s
thoughts on such matters, and also on the view that, given the
consistency of a democratic mandate, the person should be drawn from
those who have some sort of democratic
accountability.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000145">&#160;</a>

that he asked last week—and that I answered last week. I shall
not dwell on such matters, but I said to him last week that, under the
existing arrangements, it is possible for the nominated chair of the
MPA, should the Mayor choose, not to be an elected person. There is no
change in the proposal. It so happens that the current deputy is a
member of the GLA, but that is not necessary under the Bill and there
is no change.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000146">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The crucial
point is that the Mayor is the police and crime commissioner, and
remains the police and crime commissioner. He has the accountability
and the mandate from the public. He can delegate day-to-day functions
to the deputy Mayor, and the deputy Mayor can take those functions of
the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime. That makes sense,
given the Mayor’s wider responsibilities, and I have not heard
anyone suggesting that it does not make sense. However, certain key
things are issued in the Mayor’s name and must therefore remain
with him, as I set out in response to the previous amendment. The plan
is part of a mayoral strategy, so it must be issued in the
Mayor’s
name.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000147">&#160;</a>

such a close interest in the governance of policing in London, and the
answer to his question is yes. I have explained the difference. It is
not a recipe for confusion; it is a recipe for the sensible delegation
of day-to-day functions to an individual. That person does not have to
be elected because a mandate goes through the Mayor. As I said before,
the buck stops with the Mayor. Londoners know that. With respect, no
one is confused, other than the hon.

                           </strong> Clause 23 will amend sections 95 and 96 of the
1999 Act. Those sections currently give the Secretary of State the
power to set a minimum level for the budget requirement of the
Metropolitan Police Authority to which the Greater London authority
must adhere when calculating its precept. The clause ensures that the
same power will be available in respect of the Mayor’s Office
for Policing and Crime when it replaces the Metropolitan Police
Authority.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000155">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We believe
that the Secretary of State should have the power to ensure that the
Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime sets the budget at a level
that will not put the public at risk. However, in line with the
Government’s commitment to reduce interference by Whitehall, it
is right that that power is exercised only if it is necessary. In
addition, and as with clause 22, clause 23 will allow the Secretary of
State to intervene and give direction only if they are satisfied that
an order is necessary to prevent the safety of people within the
Metropolitan police district from being put at
risk.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000156">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> In introducing this group of amendments to clause
24, I am correcting an error in the way in which the Bill amends
section 46 of the Police Act 1996. At the moment, section 46 allows the
Home Secretary to pay police grant to all the police authorities in
England and Wales. In the case of the Metropolitan police, the grant is
paid to the Greater London authority on behalf of the Metropolitan
Police Authority. The intention of clause 24 is to ensure that grants
can be paid in exactly the same way to police and crime commissioners
and to the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime—via the
GLA in the latter case.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000162">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As far as the
Bill as a whole is concerned, the intention is to leave the policing
arrangements in respect of the City of London unchanged. The common
council of the City of London is currently charged with the governance
of the City of London police and the Bill does not change that. It
follows that section 46 of the 1996 Act must continue to apply to the
common council so that the Home Secretary can continue to pay it police
grants.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000163">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Unfortunately,
the drafting of clause 24 has the unintended effect of removing the
common council from the reach of section 46 of the 1996 Act. The
amendments simply correct that error by including in clause 24
references to “grant recipients” and by defining that
term so as to include the common council, police and crime
commissioners and the GLA acting on behalf of the Mayor’s Office
for Policing and Crime. For those reasons, I hope that the Committee
will be able to accept these drafting
arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000164">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is helpful. The Minister mentioned the common
council with respect to the City of London police and explained that
the amendments clarify what happens, as I understand it, with respect
to the grant paid to the Mayor and then through to the Metropolitan
Police Commissioner. Will he clarify how the payment of the grant will
work for police forces outside London? Is the situation exactly the
same as it is now? Obviously it will not be, with the police and crime
commissioners, but one assumes that the route will be the same. The
Minister talked about the City of London police and the Metropolitan
police, but it would be helpful if he clarified that the situation is
the same for forces outside
London.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000165">&#160;</a>

Police Minister, the grant is paid to authorities and it will now be

the unintended effect of removing the common council from the reach of

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
497 goes to the heart of some of the debate. The Minister will continue
to chide me for suggesting different models and different ways of doing
things. Earlier, we suggested that, if we were to have direct elections
in the whole country, making the directly elected person the chair of
the police and crime panel would be one way of resolving some of the
tensions. Another way, of course, would be to increase the power of the
police and crime panel vis-à-vis the directly elected
individual.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000217">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment to schedule 5 suggests another way in which the police and
crime panel, made up of all those representatives from local
authorities, can have more say over the precepts—or have the
say. That is important, because the panel can then have a say over
budget requirements. We can therefore ensure that the directly elected
police and crime commissioner and the panel work more closely and
effectively together. That would be an important step
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000218">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
tabled our own amendment about the veto power available to the panel on
the issuing of the precept. Our amendment 495 changed the majority from
three quarters to two thirds, but it was not selected, because the hon.
Members for Cambridge and for Edinburgh West had tabled amendments to
do the same thing. Essentially, we have a recurring theme—not
just from me, but from our Liberal Democrat
colleagues—throughout the Bill. The hon. Member for Edinburgh
West, with the support of his colleague from Cambridge, has tabled
amendments addressing the lack of power or involvement of the police
and crime panel. The panel can veto a precept, but it must do so with a
three-quarters majority—before the Minister points out the
drafting error in our amendment, I shall point it out to
him.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000219">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
point is that the three quarters is almost saying to the police and
crime panel, “We’ll give you a veto, but we really hope
you don’t use it.” Two thirds is used elsewhere as a
legitimate estimate of the feeling among the members. On the Greater
London authority and other bodies, the two-thirds majority is generally
used as a barometer of the opinion of a panel or
authority.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000220">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister might want to answer my next question in the stand part
debate, in which I want to make another couple of points. Does he
envisage a quorum for police and crime panels? Does the three-quarters
majority mean three quarters of the total membership of the police and
crime panel, or three quarters of the people who come to the
meeting?<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000221">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If the panel
is to mean anything, if it is to be anything other than a talking shop,
if it is to scrutinise properly and hold the commissioner to account,
it must have power. It has only two major powers: one is vetoing the
appointment of the chief constable; the other is vetoing the precept.
If we establish a barrier that is so high that under any normal
circumstances the panel will find extremely difficult to get over it,
we have to question whether the Government are serious about providing
it with such powers.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000222">&#160;</a>

powerful case. I want him to think about the numbers, because the

small, so that would be a significant proportion of that committee. I

In general, we have said that a 75% majority would be needed for the

issue a precept, which strikes me as creating potential for deadlock

tries to say that either the PCP has a realistic power that it can use,

not have it, because in practice it would not work out. The veto on the
precept is one of only two real powers held by the police and crime
panel. It can consult, review, publish its thoughts, tell everyone what
it thinks and let everyone know if it does not agree with the police
and crime commissioner, but that is all rhetorical rubbish. At the end
of the day, if the panel is to mean anything, it has to have some power
to hold the commissioner to account. That will be the thrust of the

think that that is necessarily a huge change, but it would slightly
alter the balance of power between the panel and the commissioner, and
would bring the powers more into line with what is used successfully in

amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh West. It
seeks to alter the necessary majority for a vote—something which
the hon. Member for Gedling also addressed. We all agree that there
should be checks and balances on the level of precept. It is desirable
that it should not be set too low, thereby risking public safety, nor
should it be unnecessarily high and needlessly take money from the
public. The primary check is the fact that the police and crime
commissioner will be directly elected. He or she will be directly
accountable to the public for ensuring that an adequate policing
service is provided, with the best possible value for
money.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000233">&#160;</a>

police and crime commissioners are included in the referendum framework
set out in schedule 5 to the Localism Bill, which is currently under

will apply to all precepting authorities, including police and crime

defined by the Secretary of State, subject to the approval of the House
of Commons.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000236">&#160;</a>

Bill will require the Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government, whether or not he chooses to determine excessive rises for
a given year, to lay a report before Parliament on or before the date
on which the local government finance report for the year is approved
by resolution of the House. Typically, that happens early in February.
Under the Localism Bill, it is envisaged that if an authority set its
council tax at an excessive level, it must make substitute calculations
to derive a budget that would require an increase in council tax that
was not excessive. That provision would take effect if the excessive
increase in council tax were rejected by voters in a
referendum.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000237">&#160;</a>

panel veto the commissioner’s proposed precept. I can set out
that procedure at a later stage should the Committee wish. We have two
checks. One is provided by the police and crime panel, which can veto a
precept. The other is provided through a referendum, should the rise be

it was a good thing. In this case, that might be the directly elected
police and crime commissioner, who wished to set that higher level of
precept on the basis of a consultation that they had conducted with
local people, and who would argue that they should vote for the rise.
In spite of the commissioner’s mandate, they will not be able
simply to set an excessive precept without some kind of check, and two
checks are provided, one by the police and crime panel, which can veto
a rise, and the other by the democratic lock of the referendum. We can
discuss the detail of the matter, but it is important to understand

be tantamount to wasting public

                           </strong> The knowledge that a referendum would have to be
held is something that a police and crime commissioner would have to
take carefully into account before setting a precept that he was aware
was likely to be judged excessive by the Government. But we should not
forget that if it went to a referendum, the police and crime
commissioner would already have the challenge from a police and crime
panel; that is what the panel is there to do. We should reflect on the
fact that capping  is very unpopular with police
authorities.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000253">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I receive many
representations about capping. It is worth repeating that the problem
with the current arrangements is that people claim to have the support
of the public in setting a high precept rise. At the moment, the police
authority is not directly elected and has no mandate. There is no way
of ensuring that the local public support any kind of rise, and some of
the rises in precept over the years have been considerable.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000254">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We stand by
the position that the democratic lock is the right one, but it is in
addition to the panel’s ability to veto precepts, which we are
discussing now. A key question raised by the amendment is whether the
threshold 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 354<a class="bkMark" name="Column354">&#160;</a>
                           </div>for the veto should be three quarters of the members of the panel or two
thirds. My hon. Friend the Member  for Amber Valley has already
effectively dealt with the fact that we expect a police and crime panel
to have about 12 members. A few will have more.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000255">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The difference
in percentage may sound significant, but it is not so significant when
it comes to the numbers of votes. There is a rationale for setting a
higher threshold of three quarters for police and crime panels compared
with the GLA, for instance, which has a threshold of two thirds. The
rationale is that the GLA is a directly elected body and therefore its
ability to veto, which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh West
pointed out, has not been exercised, is drawn on a democratic mandate.
There is therefore legitimacy in its challenging the precept decision
of the
Mayor.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000256">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
the police and crime panel, its members are nominated from local
authorities. They may be elected councillors but they are nominees to
that panel. They do not have a direct mandate themselves. That is not
the function of the panel. We have to take care about not handing the
members of the panel a significant power to cut across the local
mandate of the police and crime commissioner, who would have a clear
mandate in respect of what he or she intended to do about the precept,
and to strike that mandate down when they have no mandate themselves.
The ability to levy what is effectively a local tax to pay for policing
is, of course, a significant one.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000257">&#160;</a>

Conservatives just after the last election—and he had a good

when the national Government were unpopular and that panel was of a
different political persuasion, would that not be a recipe for petty
political infighting, which would not serve the people in a police

respect. The police and crime panel is not elected. There are nominees
who will be drawn from local authorities, which will have their
elections at different times. I take the hon. Gentleman’s point,
however. One of the things that I think there is a collective desire to
ensure is that party politics does not feature in a police and crime
panel, in the same way that it is largely excluded from police
authorities. It is right to give local authorities a stake in the
governance and scrutiny of police and crime commissioners. We cannot
legislate for that, but that should be our ambition.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000259">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The reason why
the three-quarters threshold has been chosen is that, in my view, there
should be a higher threshold given that the police and crime panel is
only nominated and given that its members are exercising a very
significant power. That power is to reject the local tax—the
precept—that the police and crime commissioner has established
in relation to policing. That explains the difference in the threshold
and that is why I think that it is right to have a higher
threshold.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000260">&#160;</a>

says that police authorities, in the main, do not operate on party
political grounds and that is entirely correct. However, if we are
going to a new system under which the commissioner will be elected on a
party political ticket with a party political mandate, he will go to
that policing panel on a daily basis, saying, “This is the way
we’re going to do it”. That is a recipe for the party
politicisation of policing. It is a recipe for

a problem—would there not?—if the members of a police and

party political reasons to strike down a precept that was established

should be set at a very high level. It seems to me that the position in

                        <p class="tabbed">The Government
have already moved in that respect. That is a fundamental difference
between what we propose in this Bill and what was originally proposed.
We must, however, be careful before moving further, because of the
issue about the mandate of the PCC. I hope that the Opposition will
withdraw the amendment and think about their position. I will, of
course, reflect on their comments,
too.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000273">&#160;</a>

think that amendments 497 to 502 were linked to the larger group of
amendments, which we have already discussed and which attempted to pave
the way for maintaining a police authority within each force area and
establishing a directly elected chair for each office of PCC. It is a
pleasure to hear the proposal of the hon. Member for Gedling for
directly elected chairs of police authorities, but I have already set
out why that is a seriously bad
idea.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000274">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It will not be the last time we hear it. It does
not embarrass me and I do not feel upset or at all sad about it. I
cannot remember the procedure, but I want to make sure that we can vote
on amendment 40 if the hon. Member for Edinburgh West withdraws it.
What the Minister has said about this amendment is really disappointing
and I do not think that the hon. Member for Edinburgh West is convinced
by what the Minister has said. A recurring theme all the way through
the Liberal Democrat amendments has been that the PCPs do not have
sufficient power. Amendment after amendment, including amendment 40, is
about trying to increase and strengthen the role of the PCP. What it
means, to be frank, is that the PCP will be a toothless watchdog,
because it will not have any power over the PCC. That will be a
shame.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000275">&#160;</a>

argument that having a threshold of three quarters, so that nine votes

toothless—I completely reject that accusation—while eight

conjunction with amendment 40, which is why I mentioned it. Other
amendments to strengthen the powers of the police and crime panel have

Edinburgh West and for

                           </div>Cambridge. I have tabled amendments to strengthen the PCP
vis-à-vis the police and crime commissioner, because the PCP has
only two real powers—the powers of veto over the precept, and
over
appointments.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000277">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Although
the Minister might say that there will only be one or two votes in it,
the threshold that has been set will effectively mean that it will
extremely difficult—given that the three-quarters rule applies
to the total membership irrespective of how many members attend a
meeting—for a PCP to veto the precept put forward by the PCC. I
know that the Minister does not like this—it is a point of
difference between us—but I say again that he wants PCCs to be
omnipotent on the basis of their democratic mandate but,
notwithstanding that argument, I think that PCPs should have effective
powers to hold PCCs to account. The amendment would be one way of
achieving that, but the Minister refuses to move. In my view, that will
make the PCP a toothless watchdog, and I think his hon. Friends the
Members for Edinburgh West and for Cambridge agree with me. I will
withdraw the amendment, if by doing so I do not scupper amendment 40.

therefore also the case that under the discretion laid out in

veto the decision of the police and crime panel? In other words, can
the Home Secretary turn around and say, “The police and crime
panel has vetoed the precept. It was completely wrong of it to do that,
and I am going to exercise my discretion to say that the precept the
police and crime commissioner proposed was perfectly fine, and

of State will be able to set out by regulation what will happen should
a panel veto the police and crime commissioner’s proposed
precept. The PCC will be required by regulation to propose a precept by
21 December in the year when that precept is raised. As required by the
schedule, the PCC must make that proposal to the police and crime
panel. The panel will be required by 15 January the following year to
review the proposal and make recommendations, which may include vetoing
the proposal. Should the panel decide not to veto the
commissioner’s proposal, the commissioner may set either the
proposed precept or an amended precept in line with any recommendations
made by the panel. Should the panel veto the proposal, regulations will
require the PCC to consider its recommendations by the end of January
and make an amended proposal to the panel, which must take those
recommendations into account.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000310">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The panel may
then make recommendations within 14 days that can include rejecting the
proposed precept. If it does not reject the precept, the regulations
will allow the PCC to set either the proposed precept or an amended
precept in line with the panel’s recommendation. Should the
panel again reject the proposal, the PCC may still set the precept.
However, in those circumstances, regulations will require the panel to
propose an alternative precept, setting out its reasons.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000311">&#160;</a>

will require that the precept, when set by the police and crime
commissioner after this process, must take into account the views of
the panel. If the commissioner does not set the precept proposed
by

reasons, and must set out in the same document why he or she did not
implement the panel’s proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000312">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">No matter what
happens, the police and crime commissioner must set
a precept by 1 March. If that precept is excessive, the commissioner
must calculate a substitute or default precept that is not excessive.
Regulations will require that the PCC require that in consultation with
the police and crime panel.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000313">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Where the
precept is excessive, the local councils in that force area must
arrange for a referendum to be held by 1 May that year, unless another
date has been defined under the powers in the Localism Bill, which is
also before the House. Should the referendum be successful, the precept
set by the commissioner will be raised. If the referendum rejects the
proposal¸ the substitute calculation will be raised
instead.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000314">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The measures
will fix the timings for setting a precept. An incoming police and
crime commissioner elected in May will not be able to raise a new
precept until the following April. That is right, as to send out a new
bill mid-year would waste millions of pounds of taxpayers’
money.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000315">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
processes enable police and crime commissioners to make the key
decision setting the precept on the basis of their public mandate.
However, it sets out some clear and important checks and balances in
the form of panels’ vetoes and also a public referendum. It is
important that we set out the procedures that have to be followed when
there is a fundamental disagreement between the panel and the police
and crime commissioner. We cannot just provide for the permanent
exercise of a veto because that would result in a position when a
precept might not be set. We have to set out a procedure, and I believe
that the procedure under which the police and crime commissioner has to
have regard to what the panel is saying is the right
one.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000316">&#160;</a>

that is the level set by the Secretary of State in relation to rises
for all precepting authorities. The Secretary of State will set the
level that he regards to be excessive, in the way a capping level is
set at the moment. It is not a subjective test. It is set precisely by
the Secretary of State each year and he judges what an excessive rise
that year would be. I hope that I have answered the hon.

is worth repeating that the principle behind our approach is that the
police and crime commissioner has a directly elected mandate from the
people, and we must set out how to deal with a deadlock quickly and
with the public interest at heart. We have to set out a procedure to
deal with the situation in which the police and crime panel and the
police and crime commissioner could otherwise not agree. That is a
function of seeking to give force to the checks and balances and to
ensure that the police and crime panel is not the toothless watchdog
that the hon. Member for Gedling wrongly suggests it will
be.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000319">&#160;</a>

read out that explanation. I understand the point that, in the end if
there is a veto, we must have a mechanism by which we arrive at a
position where a

			Column number: 360<a class="bkMark" name="Column360">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
right hon. Gentleman does not like my description of the police and
crime panels as a toothless watchdog, but will he ask his officials to
reflect on the process that has been put in place to ensure that a
budget can be set? It is a perfectly reasonable function. Of course, a
budget has to be set. However, will the Minister check that the process
does not ride roughshod over the PCP’s views? Will he try to
ensure good governance? The police and crime panel may have a very real
desire to stand up to the police and crime commissioner,
notwithstanding the mandate. It may believe that he is wrong. Having
heard what the Minister has just said, I am not sure that the process
will ride roughshod over the PCP, but it is important that he checks
matters to make sure that the clause does not have the consequence of
delivering  the police and crime commissioner the precept that
he wanted, even though the police and crime panel vetoed
it.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000321">&#160;</a>

something that could actually effectively wholly override the veto. I

concerns, but I hope that he will agree that such an approach is

                           </strong> We have some more amendments. Depending on what we
hear, I may want to move one or two of them as well. We will see what
happens. That is one problem with tabling amendments that appear on the
amendment paper; it is always possible to withdraw them. I thought that
some of the Liberal Democrat amendments had merit. No doubt the
Minister will agree and include them on Report, but we will
see.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000353">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I would like a
fairly lengthy clause stand part debate, hence my withdrawal of my
earlier amendments. Much of what I would have said while discussing
them can be 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 363<a class="bkMark" name="Column363">&#160;</a>
                           </div>said during the clause stand part debate. The important point to make is
that we must consider extending the importance of the police and crime
panel. The Minister does not agree with my term “toothless
watchdog”, yet he has rejected amendment after amendment tabled
by us that would extend and develop the powers of the police and crime
panel, as amendment 288 would. He does not want the police and crime
commissioner’s power to be fettered in any way, because the PCC
has a democratic mandate. I do not agree with that position, but it is
perfectly reasonable. That is the Government’s policy, and it is
what the Bill will effectively provide.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000354">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 288,
along with my other amendments, contends that if that is the model we
want, we can deal with some of its problems, consequences and issues by
extending the power of the police and crime panel. It is there for all
hon. Members to review. The amendment would allow the police and crime
panel to do some of the things that the hon. Member for Edinburgh West
has been keen for it to do.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000355">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Alongside
amendment 288, which I will discuss in more detail during the clause
stand part debate, amendment 309 would require the chief constable, not
just the commissioner, to attend the police and crime panel. The
Liberal amendments seek to extend that requirement not just to the
chief constable but to other officers of the force. I know why; the
hon. Members for Edinburgh West and for Cambridge have the same issues
as I do. They are worried that the police and crime panel will not be
able to require local police officers responsible for neighbourhood
policing, where the accountability gap occurs, to attend the panel.
Their localism, neighbourhood and pavement politics agenda requires
them to want local police officers, inspectors and so on, as well as
other ACPO officers where appropriate, to attend police and crime
panels.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000356">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am
interested to know what that would mean. I will be corrected if I am
wrong, but would it mean that an ACPO officer responsible for
trafficking or knife crime could be asked to the police and crime
panel? I am not sure. Perhaps the hon. Member for Edinburgh West can
clarify it when he moves his amendments, if he intends to move
them.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000357">&#160;</a>

outbreak of agreement between us and the Liberal Democrats on principle

                           </strong> As I was saying, the amendments are fabulous and
they are proposed in a probing manner. The hon. Member for Gedling has
pointed out that he does not have access to Government lawyers to
ensure that his amendments are drafted in a particular way. That
situation also applies to us. With these amendments—as with many
others—we are trying not to come up with a prescriptive list of
who should be able to be called to police and crime panels. They are
meant to aid debate about who the police and crime panel needs to be
able to call to ensure proper transparency and scrutiny of the relevant
police and crime commissioner, which seems a reasonable thing to do in
Committee. At present, the police and crime panel has powers to call
only the police and crime commissioner and his staff. In the main, the
amendments seek to extend the list of powers, but it would by no means
make it extensive or prescriptive. It is open to debate whether the
police  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 365<a class="bkMark" name="Column365">&#160;</a>
                           </div>and crime panel has sufficient information properly to scrutinise if it
receives information from only one side of whatever negotiations might
have taken place, for example, between the police and crime
commissioner and police officers. That is why amendments 24 and 25
would enable the police and crime panel to call the relevant chief
constable.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000370">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
intention is not that the panel would cross-examine the operational
work of the chief constable, or scrutinise their decisions; that is
obviously the role of the police and crime commissioner, and we do not
seek to double the administrative burden or somehow create a second
police and crime commissioner within the police and crime panel.
Rather, the desire is that the panel would be able to discuss with the
chief constable the actions and decisions taken by the commissioner, to
gather the chief constable’s perspective and better understand
any operational implications. Actions taken by the commissioner will
inevitably impact on the chief constable’s work, so acquiring an
understanding of the chief constable’s experiences will be
crucial to the panel’s work, as will understanding the
effectiveness of the commissioner’s decisions in achieving the
desired
results.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000371">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Although
some chief constables might be willing to attend panel sessions
voluntarily, it might be necessary for the panel to have the ability to
enforce attendance by chief constables, so that it can fulfil its role.
If that provision were not in the Bill, the panel could find itself
scrutinising the commissioner’s work without access to critical
information. Similarly, a situation could arise in which some panels
were given access to the input of their chief constable and others were
not.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000372">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
26 recognises that some of the detail that the police and crime panel
might wish to look at may fall below the level of a chief
constable’s knowledge. We must remember that chief
superintendents are often the main divisional commanders, and their
division might map more closely to a constituent’s local
authority area. Indeed, proposals are currently being debated 
in Scotland that would see a single Scottish force with  32
operational divisions mapping exactly on to local authorities. In such
a situation, it might be more important to question a chief
superintendent who dealt with a specific part of a police and crime
commissioner’s area, which, as we might find a similar situation
in some of the larger English police services, could be a reasonable
and useful extension of the police and crime panel’s scrutiny
powers.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000373">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
28 mirrors the power that I have just described for the Metropolitan
Police Service. It would enable the police and crime panel to carry out
its work more effectively by giving it greater access to officers in
that
service.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000374">&#160;</a>

49 deals with ACPO. In the Bill, the London assembly’s police
and crime panel has the power to summon only the police and crime
commissioner and not senior police officers. The amendment would enable
the panel to require the attendance of police officers of ACPO rank to
more effectively carry out its work. At the moment, ACPO is completely
unaccountable, and although we welcome the extension of the Freedom of
Information Act to the organisation, the amendment would allow officers
in ACPO to be called before the panel to answer questions relating to
their work in

might not be the best way to achieve the aim that I have outlined, but
it flags up an issue that it might be a good time to deal with. The
rationale behind introducing such amendments is to try to look at the
issues that we face at the moment and that the police and crime panels
might face in the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000375">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Without trying to score any cheap political
points, the thrust of the hon. Gentleman’s amendments appears to
be that the police and crime panels have been too tightly drawn and
that, as a consequence, they might not achieve all that is desired or
intended of them. Am I right to make that assumption? And is he asking
the Minister to provide a bit of latitude, so that the panels can serve

information available to a police and crime panel to carry out its role
of effectively scrutinising the police and crime commissioner. Debating
these amendments raises the question of what other information they
might need to fulfil that role. As I have said, I have not produced a
prescriptive list, but the amendments flag up an area that we think
merits another look to see whether more information can be made
available to the police and crime panel.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000377">&#160;</a>

Friend the Member for Edinburgh West has discussed, as a group. We must
establish the right functions between the role of the police and crime
panel and the role of the police and crime commissioner. It is for the
police and crime commissioner to hold the chief constable and the force
to account. In looking at the powers of the police and crime panel, the
Government have taken care to ensure that chief constables do not find
themselves looking two ways, both to the police and crime commissioner
and to the panel. They cannot be answerable to two bodies. That is why
it would not be right to empower the police and crime panel to hold the
chief constable or the

with the balance of the arrangements that we have made. That is not to
say, as we discussed earlier, that it would be unwise for a chief
constable to appear before a police and crime panel—it would be
wise. That is not to say that a chief constable should not pay
attention to what the panel is saying, as it represents local
authorities in the force area, but formal answerability must be to the
police and crime commissioner.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000383">&#160;</a>

developing our policy and shaping our proposal for police and crime
panels, the chief officers to whom we spoke expressed concern that,
were the powers and functions of police and crime panels to become too
wide, they would effectively end up answering in two directions, which
would be problematic. We wish to preserve the integrity of those
relationships. I understand the force of what my hon. Friends are

chief officers, because it could create

that we need to ensure greater accountability in relation to ACPO. The
current proposal is that it will develop into a new professional body.
We are considering the recommendations made on that aspect by Peter
Neyroud, former chief executive of the National Policing Improvement
Agency and former chief constable of Thames Valley police. It is
important that such a body, a professional institute for policing,
should be accountable. In my view, it should encompass national
accountability but be locally accountable to reflect the role of police
and crime commissioners, which would give some accountability for what
ACPO leads were doing or saying.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000388">&#160;</a>

my hon. Friend’s concern that policy can effectively be set by
an ACPO lead. The question of accountability then arises. If it is
about operational matters, it should be for chief constables to decide,
but other areas may need an element of political oversight, which
depends on the nature of what is being determined. The
Government’s position is clear. It is part of our reform
proposals that there should be greater accountability for

that the amendment is necessary to achieve that. Requiring a panel to
“review and scrutinise” rather than “review or
scrutinise” the commissioner’s decisions or actions adds
nothing to the practical effect—I have been advised that
“review” and “scrutiny” mean the same
thing. The form of words used in the Bill has been
taken from existing legislation that has created local authority
overview and scrutiny committees. It has never been questioned in that

                        <p class="tabbed">Irrespective
of the fact that the Minister and his colleague have said that
amendment 288 has not been drafted as well as it might have been, the
reality is that the police and crime panels are toothless. That will be
a recurring theme in the clause stand part debate, when we get to it,
and something that I will repeat. The hon. Member for Edinburgh West,
notwithstanding the reassurances that were provided following his
remarks, has concerns as well, otherwise he would not have tabled
amendment after amendment to strengthen the powers of the police and
crime panels.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000395">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is an
issue about the relationship between the police and crime commissioner
and the police and crime panel. My amendment 288 seeks to address that,
as do the other amendments that I have tabled. The Committee will
clearly not accept those amendments, but they are none the less
important.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000396">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
will withdraw amendment 288. Will you provide me with some guidance, Mr
Chope? I am willing to withdraw amendment 309 in preference to
amendment 25, which is exactly the same but which I think has got it
slightly better than my amendment. Can I press amendment 25 to a vote
after withdrawing amendments 288 and
309?<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000397">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> If the hon. Gentleman seeks leave to withdraw
amendment 288, and the Committee agrees  to that, it is open to
him or any other member of the Committee to suggest to the Chair that
another amendment be pressed to a Division. He does not need to
withdraw amendment 309, because it has not been
moved.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000398">&#160;</a>

to a vote, it is open to him to do so, but we will not have a Division
tonight, because it is an amendment to clause 29. I will record the

vote in this instance.<a class="bkMark" name="1102024000400">&#160;</a>
