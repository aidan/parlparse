                           </strong> It is a pleasure to take part in day four of this
Committee’s work, Mr Bayley. I thank you, Mrs Davies and her
team in the Public Bill Office, the <em>Hansard</em> Reporters,
the Doorkeepers and the House officials and police, who worked such a
long day with us on Tuesday. It takes a lot to keep the House running
efficiently when MPs are working, and I appreciate that.<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000025">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I turn to
this large group of amendments. As can be seen, amendment 88 adds two
considerations to which a local authority must have regard
under its duty to consider an expression of interest. Proposed new
paragraph (c) would add a provision that the organisation expressing an
interest must be realistic in its intentions. Proposed new paragraph
(d) would add the consideration that the organisation expressing an
interest must include evidence that the majority of the users of that
service support the proposal. The users of a service are an
important group, and should be considered if there is to be a bid for
an alternative provider to run the service. The amendment could prevent
the making of vexatious requests to put services out to procurement by
ensuring that such requests were truly supported by the
users.<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000026">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 114
would add a straightforward definition, so that a “relevant
body” under the community right to challenge had to be a body
whose activities were not for profit. Amendment 90 would add the
requirement that expressions of interest in running a local public
service could be submitted by two or more employees of a local
authority only if they had secured the support by ballot of a majority
of the relevant employees whose principal work was in that
service.<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000027">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Concerns have
been expressed about the proposal that a small number of employees
should be able to make such a request. There is nothing in the Bill to
say that the employees in question should have a major involvement in
the service concerned. Another worry is that an expression might result
from a disagreement between employees, which would be detrimental to
the service. The biggest concern—I shall come back to this
later—is about services being taken over by multinational
companies. It would clearly be possible for a company to persuade two
or more employees of an authority to submit an expression of interest,
which would mean that the company, not the employees, was behind the
bid.<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000028">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We believe
that there is a precedent for dealing with such situations in the
right-to-request system that operates in primary care trusts. There,
any proposal to set up a social enterprise must be supported by the
staff, who have the right to request a social enterprise and the right
to refuse. A ballot takes place, and those directly affected can decide
their fate. We believe that that example should be followed in the
Bill. Amendment 90 represents a safeguard.<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000029">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
115 is an alternative to amendment 90. It would ensure that where two
or more employees of a local authority submit an expression of
interest, they have already set up a charitable organisation for the
purpose. Amendment 91 would remove the power of the Secretary of State
to specify by regulation the bodies—presumably not voluntary or
community bodies—that could submit an expression of interest.
The Secretary of State’s power is a cause for concern. It would
open the door to using the community right to challenge to privatise
public services. Why do the Government want the Secretary of State to
have the power to allow other persons or bodies the right to require a
service to be put out to tender? What do they wish to achieve? Another
concern is developing that the Government could start cherry-picking
public services, and there is even the possibility of asset
stripping.<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000030">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 113
clarifies subsection (7), so that the definition of a not-for-profit
body also applies to community bodies. We are engaged in an awful lot
of defining in these provisions. Amendment 92 specifies that the
meaning of “body”—a community or voluntary
body—would be restricted to bodies whose principal activities
were local. There is a desire to support local community bodies and
voluntary bodies, and the provision is an important localist measure,
but without that change, non-profit-making bodies with no connection
with an area, such as large charities from other parts of the country
that knew nothing about the area, could run local services.<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000031">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Many of the
best charities that I know and work with in Salford have separate,
locally based organisations. For example, Salford Carers Centre is part
of the Princess Royal Trust for Carers network, and Age UK Salford is
part of the Age UK network. Local bodies really know the area, and it
should be those bodies that express an interest in either delivering
services or assisting in delivering
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000032">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Let
me turn to amendment 93. Here we come back to the powers of the
Secretary of State. The amendment relates to the power of the Secretary
of State to amend or repeal definitions in subsections (5) to (8), or
to make any other amendments to the chapter—a power that causes
concern. In some ways, there is no point in either scrutinising the
Bill or considering the amendments if the Secretary of State can later
come along and amend or repeal the important definitions that are under
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000035">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I was not sure, Mr Bayley, because the group is so
large. Going back to the amendments apart from amendment 89, I have to
say that even for community organisations and charities that welcome
the community right to challenge—and of course they welcome it,
as do the Opposition—there have to be safeguards. There are
major concerns. The first and most obvious is to avoid privatisation by
the back door, or privatisation by the order-making power of
the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State wants the power
to specify relevant bodies, and he wants to take the power to amend or
repeal the definition in subsection (5) of a relevant body
that can submit an expression of
interest.<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000038">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Moreover,
there is real concern—Members may have read this in the
briefings submitted to us—about the fact that services subject
to challenge include services that are already run by voluntary groups
or community bodies on behalf of the local authority. In many local
authority areas, services are already contracted out. Those bodies
worry that other organisations will come along and tender. Examples of
such services include carers organisations that assess need on behalf
of the local authority, and lots of children’s services are run
by organisations such as Barnardo’s or the Children’s
Society. Those organisations are genuinely concerned that their
services may be put out to tender and subject to bids from outside, or
from bodies specified by the Secretary of State. Bassac, a development
trust with a lot of experience of developing new organisations,
particularly ones that undertake procurement and take over assets, was
concerned. In its evidence to the Committee, it
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000039">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“It
could in fact, be used by large national agencies or private sector
organisations to take contracts away from local community
bodies…As it stands the expression of interest could be used by
local authority employees setting up a private company; this loophole
needs to be closed.”<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000133">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>As I said earlier,
there needs to be consideration of the needs and views of service
users. Consumer First reckoned that service users sometimes prefer the
organisation that currently delivers their service, be that the local
authority or another provider.<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000040">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A final but
important consideration is that a number of third sector organisations
say that putting the measures into legislation will be ineffective
unless it is combined with extra support for community groups and local
authorities that will be changing their commissioning processes. Let me
return to the impact assessment, which we have only had for a week.
There is an estimate in the impact assessment of funding for that
support, and it is put at £14.5 million between 2011-12 and
2014-15, which is less than £5 million a year across all local
authorities and third sector organisations. That amounts to
£15,000 per local authority, which does not seem to be
stretching support very far. Funding to help community organisations
acquire an asset is given as £500,000 a year over three years;
60% of that will be loans, and 40% will be grants. If you divide that
across the country, it is £1,500 per local authority area. That
will not buy many pubs, post offices or other
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000041">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
find the assumptions about the cost to local authorities of dealing
with the new community right to challenge somewhat naive. That view is
shared by Henry Peterson, who was an adviser to the Department for
Communities and Local Government and the Local Government Association.
In his evidence, he told us:<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000042">&#160;</a>
                        </p> 
                        <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 453<a class="bkMark" name="Column453">&#160;</a>
                        </div>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
assessment on the community ‘right to challenge’ is thin
on evidence and acknowledges the impossibility of monetising
many of the anticipated benefits and costs. The
case for applying this measure initially only to local government
services is stated as being to ‘ensure that local authorities
are an examplar for this
right’.<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000134">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">Many
would argue that local government already achieves better value for
money in its commissioning, and is more open to provision through the
independent sector, than much of central
government.”<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000135">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>The
impact assessment states that there will be additional burdens on local
authorities, the main cause of which will be assessing expressions of
interest and, if they are accepted, undertaking procurement
exercises.<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000043">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is guesstimated in the impact assessment that 331 services may
be subject to expressions of interest from relevant bodies or
authorities’ employees in each of the first three years, with an
estimated cost to local authorities of £120,000 to
£140,000 a year. There is a further guesstimate that 60% of
expressions of interest will lead to a procurement exercise, the cost
of which has been put at £9,100 each, or just less than 5% of
contract value. The total additional burden on all local authorities is
judged to be just less than £3 million, based on one procurement
exercise per local authority. I do not trust those figures, and I think
we should question them
here.<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000044">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
his evidence, Henry Peterson
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000045">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Practical
implementation costs of the community empowerment proposals in the
Bill, as forecast in Impact Assessments, are likely to prove
under-estimates in terms of the additional workloads and bureaucracy
generated.”<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000136">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That
is of interest, because it sounds to me as though either the
guesstimates in the impact assessment are woeful underestimates or the
policy will not have any impact. We need to know which one it
is.<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000046">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
there will be only one procurement exercise per local
authority—and many of the proposals will not be
accepted—could the Minister tell us what impact he thinks the
policy will have? Or does he, like me, think that there will be many
more procurement exercises? In that case, there will be a bigger burden
on local authorities, which, as we know, are already struggling to
manage the swingeing front-loaded cuts imposed on them by his
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000047">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
was the case for other measures in the Bill, I have moved these
amendments to make the new process more manageable for local
authorities, more supportive of voluntary and community
organisations—for whom, let us remember, it was
designed—and fairer to service users, the staff currently
delivering those public services, and the third sector. They are
sensible, practical amendments, and I hope that the Committee supports
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000048">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
must bear in mind as we work through this large group of amendments
that the provisions have had no proper scrutiny—this is the
first scrutiny that they have had. The Department issued its
consultation document on the proposals only last Friday; that is
something else that we received very late. There should have been more
scrutiny of the Bill before it was brought before the House, and we
will do the best we can. Again, on behalf of fellow Labour Members, let
me say that I object to consultation documents being issued while we
are in Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000049">&#160;</a>

biggest problem with the community right to challenge is that it will
not do what the Government want it to do. My hon. Friend the Member for
Worsley and Eccles South was completely right to express our concerns
about the possible unintended consequences of the proposals. The idea
of a community right to challenge is politically and conceptually very
attractive, but I have a great number of fears about how it will work
in practice. I fear that it is designed to generate headlines. We could
end up with a lot of frustration and disappointment among community
organisations over what has been heralded in the

do Ministers think the expressions of interest will come from in the
current climate? This is an incredibly difficult time for the community
and voluntary sector. This week, Dame Elisabeth Hoodless was quoted in

the “Today” programme, she said simply that the

applaud Ministers’ proposals in that respect, but they
misunderstand the fact that a huge amount of capacity building and

fruition and the Government are to realise their aim of new models for
service delivery. The Centre for Local Economic Strategies’

quote played through my mind during the Communities and Local
Government Committee’s visit to Devon last week. Other members
of this Committee were there, and we met some wonderful people from the
Torbay Coast and Countryside Trust, which runs more than 1,700 acres of
country park, woodland and nature reserve on that beautiful stretch of
coastline. As I sat there, I thought, “This is probably the sort
of thing that the Government would like more of,” so perhaps
that is what clause 66 is designed to encourage. However, the
chairman of trustees said, “We couldn’t do the job
without the council.” The environment commissioner from Torbay
talked about the process of setting up the trust and said that it was a
collaboration between the council and the community—it was their
idea. He explained that it would be incredibly difficult to set up the
community-led trust in the way it operates today, given the huge
financial constraints that we are
under.<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000055">&#160;</a>

and speed of the cuts that Lewisham faces, it is considering closing
five out of its 12 libraries. It was up front about that possibility,
unlike other local authorities that kept their intentions well hidden
and announced them at the last minute. Lewisham has enabled a long
period of consultation with the community on alternative models of
provision. Fantastic community organisations are coming forward, and I
am pleased to say that we might have five workable alternatives for the
community to take on the running of those
libraries.<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000056">&#160;</a>

There have been frustrations during the process and I am sure that
sometimes the community organisations would have liked a quicker and
different response from the council, but nevertheless the process has

for an excellent charity that I felt could improve youth provision in
our town. I brought forward representatives of the charity to
demonstrate what they were doing in other areas. The value-for-money
element was indisputable: for some £30,000, which was more or
less the equivalent of one youth worker’s salary plus add-on
costs, that organisation would provide 10 youth workers who were
committed to 20-plus hours a week and to going out on the streets to
deliver really good, detached youth work and to getting involved in the
most deprived area in the town. Despite all that evidence and
endeavour, however, the local authority would not commit to that amount
of money, and that is why we need this kind of
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000068">&#160;</a>

decisions made by the hon. Lady’s authority, but by raising
value for money, she brings me on to another set of questions that I
would like to put to the Minister. In the hon. Lady’s example,
the case for the community provision was predicated on it being a
better deal for the taxpayer as well as delivering a better service
overall—the two combined. Although I appreciate that this
relates to a later clause and we have not yet discussed it very much, I
think that when local authorities consider expressions of interest,
they must make several considerations about how to run their services
overall.

                        <p class="tabbed">If I may beg
the Committee’s indulgence once again, I would like to talk
about a practical example from my experience on Lewisham council. A
couple of years ago, I was approached by a community group based on a
large estate in Deptford. The Pepys estate covers about 1,000
properties. The Pepys community forum, as it was then, did a huge
amount of good work, but it led a hand-to-mouth existence and did not
have much core funding. It came to me to say, “What we would
like to do is run a composting and recycling service for the 1,000
flats on the
estate.”<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000070">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
proposal sounded great—it sat very well with what the Government
are proposing—but there were several problems. The first one was
that the council had just signed a huge contract with Veolia to take
all the waste away, so we would have had to renegotiate that contract.
I understand that it sounds ludicrous that the council was paying a
private company to take away its waste when that recyclate could have
been a resource. The food waste could have been made into compost, and
the tin cans and the paper could have been sold. Even the then Minister
of State, my right hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, Deptford (Joan
Ruddock) came down to encourage me, as the deputy mayor of Lewisham, to
support such an
initiative.<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000071">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">While
we might have been able to overcome the contractual issues, even though
the council would have incurred some cost, the local authority had to
consider other aspects, one of which was the problem that taking out
part of the service would set a precedent, so compost and recycling
services run by community organisations could operate on every single
estate. What would that do to the residual service that the council
must provide for the collection and composting of waste, and what would
be the effect on any economies of scale? The local authority also had
to take account of risk and liability. As much as the project may have
been managed incredibly well—I know the people in the Pepys
community forum and am sure that they would have done a fantastic
job—what would happen if it involved a small operation with a
couple of men or women in a white van collecting the food waste, but
then the van broke down and they did not turn up for a couple of days?
We have lots of high-rise flats and huge amounts of food waste can be
produced. If it were the responsibility of the local authority, it
would have other vans and other men or women who could collect the
waste. Obviously, there are serious risks, perhaps including
environmental health risks, but liabilities are also
involved?<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000072">&#160;</a>

Committee might think that is an example of a Labour council giving all
the reasons why it cannot do stuff, but what happens if the guy in the
van knocks down a child on the estate? There are questions for local
authorities about the risk and liability that they are prepared to
accept when services are delivered differently. I am not saying that
such problems cannot not be overcome, but we should recognise that
there is a whole raft of legislation that makes it incredibly difficult

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We have
received the Local Government Association briefing. I could read it
out, but I agree with almost every word of it about centralised
control. Our discussion has been interesting, however, because it
reflects the different standpoints when discussing what a good
authority does. Government Members have said, “Yes,
that’s fine if you have an authority that is doing that, but if
you don’t, it’s not fair on the electors of the
area.” In my view, that is what they vote for, as I have
rehearsed.<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000078">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
have two objections to that approach. First, there is a basic
underlying assumption that central Government actually know what is
best and should prescribe it across the land. The second thing is that
each time that is done, we move further away from local
government—both words are important—and towards local
administration, and then we get back to the question of, “Why
vote for anyone; you’re all the same?” We need to
differentiate between forward-looking, entrepreneurial, innovative
councils and other authorities—or, indeed, other parties in such
a council—that do not believe that they should be like
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000079">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
very much approve of the general thrust of opening up the possibility
for challenging local authority services. I accept the points about
terminology—I am not sure that “challenge” is the
right approach or philosophy—but it seems that there is general
agreement on both sides of the Committee that services should be opened
up to voluntary or community bodies. Amendment 114 would exclude the
awful word “profit” from any consideration. I am not
opposed to profit, depending on what the profit is used for. Social
enterprises make profits—that is why they are in
business—but the difference is that that profit is reinvested in
social and community benefits. Voluntary organisations and charities
also make profits and have trading arms. Anyone who visits an Oxfam
shop is in part of the trading arm of that particular
charity.<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000080">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That is the
only point that I want to make. Perhaps we can clarify that we are not
opposed to bodies making a profit from running council services,
provided that that is reinvested in social and community wealth or
benefits.<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000081">&#160;</a>

aspect of the Bill is important. Indeed, it is a competitor for being
one of the most important aspects of a really important Bill. However,
I do not think that we can claim credit for it because it is unfinished
business that has resulted from the campaigning of many organisations
over a number of years. That campaigning reached fruition most recently
through the Sustainable Communities Act 2007, which the previous
Parliament enacted with all-party
support.<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000090">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
2007 Act introduced the idea into our national conversation that two
principles should apply: first, that members of the public and
communities should always be able to know what their elected bodies and
representatives are doing on their behalf, and that there should be
transparency around how much is spent and on what— that
important principle is reflected in various parts of the this
Bill—and, secondly, that on the basis of that information, it
should be possible for members of communities to challenge the way in
which things are being done and to suggest alternative ways of doing
things that might be able to deliver better services than at present.
Crucially, under that second principle, it should not be possible to
sweep such ideas aside or for them to be dismissed without proper
consideration only because the people in power find it inconvenient to
think in a more open way.<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000091">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The 2007 Act
was a private Member’s Bill, and hon. Members on both sides of
the Committee know what happens as such Bills progress through the
House: they get watered down, and compromises are suggested that must
be taken on board if the Bill is to make progress. Such Bills all too
often become a diluted version of their original intention. In the case
of the 2007 Act, the essence of its intent was preserved, but we now
have the opportunity to revisit that matter and go
further.<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000092">&#160;</a>

Communities Act as it was going through the House? I am promoting a
private Member’s Bill, so I know that the Minister is
right about how difficult it is for them make progress. It
should be acknowledged, however, that the previous Government and the

do not want to be churlish, and there was cross-party support, as I
said. Were it not for support from Government Front Benchers, the
Sustainable Communities Bill would not have been enacted, and although
I would like to think that some of the watering down might have been
avoided and that the Bill might have reached the statute book in a more
robust form, I give the former Secretary of State two
cheers.<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000094">&#160;</a>

tabled, including the 14 that we are considering, three set up
obstacles to voluntary groups taking up these rights. Another three set
up restrictions on the organisations that can take up the contracts.
Another five are, in effect, wrecking amendments that would prevent a
recalcitrant local authority from stymieing this process—they
would remove the safeguards. Two would remove

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
88 would require authorities to decide whether a relevant body should
compete in any procurement exercise before they considered its
expression of interest. We are consulting on the potential for that.
There are two parts to the amendment. Proposed new paragraph (c)
actually reflects something that we intend to do, so I am sympathetic
to it. We suggest in the consultation document mentioned by the hon.
Lady that the relevant bodies should make a case that they would be
able to participate in any exercise for the awarding by a relevant
authority of a contract for the provision of the relevant service, so
that is very much
envisaged.<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000106">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
second aspect of the amendment, however, would require anyone who
expressed an interest to commission a poll of service users in advance,
but that would clearly be liable—whether intentionally or
not—to block the take-up of this important right. Such a
provision would fall squarely into the type of measures that Sir
Stephen Bubb warned us against.<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000107">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> This is about expressing an interest in the first
place. There are further provisions on take-up and when a procurement
process should be triggered, which we might talk about this afternoon.
Those measures take into account social value and so on. I hope that
hon. Members will concede that it would be onerous—though
perhaps unintentionally so—to require a ballot of service users
in advance of expressing a view that things could be done differently.
That would fall into the trap of making it difficult for people to take
up these rights, as the hon. Member for Lewisham East
mentioned.<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000109">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> This is a large group of amendments, so it will
probably be easier if we deal with points as we go along. Does the
Minister think that the proposal should be considered for any sorts of
services? In social care, the identity of the personnel who make
home visits or who give intimate personal care to a service
user makes a difference, so that is an important consideration. Nothing
is more frightening to an elderly, frail or vulnerable person than the
notion of a different person turning up. Does the Minister therefore
think that the proposal should be considered for any of the services
that might be
tendered?<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000110">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Lady’s concerns are misplaced. This
is about an expression of interest, and the appropriate time to
consider the effect on users and the community is when that expression
is taken up in a tender exercise. That is the point for an assessment,
which we will talk about later. There is no obligation on the authority
to trigger a procurement exercise. As I think Sir Stephen said, the
guidelines for the services that could be challenged should be widely
drawn, and that is important at this
stage.<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000111">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
92 would restrict the right to express an interest to local bodies. It
overlooks the potential of many national organisations to provide a
useful service, as my hon. Friend the Member for Congleton pointed out.
There is an increasing trend towards national organisation. For
example, many age-related charities are moving towards having a
national core with local
operations.<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000112">&#160;</a>

of the point he is making? The local branches of the Alzheimer’s
Society are now all part of a national federation. My father passed
away from Alzheimer’s disease and I know how much people who
suffer from the condition value the services provided by the society.
The amendment would prevent the Croydon branch of the
Alzheimer’s Society from expressing an interest in
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000113">&#160;</a>

to the point made by the hon. Member for Lewisham East about
differential capacity. Our concern to make sure that different people
can take up the rights, if they are established, clearly runs through
the Bill. One of the principal ways in which well-motivated national
charities can help communities where capacity is more limited is to
follow their vocation and pay particular attention to those areas where
their mission is most needed. To cut them out of that would be a great
mistake.<a class="bkMark" name="11021058000114">&#160;</a>

That has been more difficult for voluntary organisations so far. There
can be a brilliant idea, such as Bulky Bob’s in Liverpool. It
