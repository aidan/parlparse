On resuming-- 
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We are dealing with the group of amendments headed by amendment No. 1081. The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam had just intervened on the Minister, who was replying to the debate. I call the Minister to reply to that intervention and, no doubt, to wind up the debate. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I must say how delighted we are to come back to this more elegant stage of the Committee proceedings. I hope that we might all match your sartorial elegance in future sittings, Mr. Winterton. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam asked about material considerations and whether a material consideration in a planning determination by the boroughs would include, for example, the noise strategy. Ultimately, it is for the courts to decide what is a material consideration. Under the narrower definition applied by current land use planning legislation, something must relate to the development and use of land. The Bill is not intended to change that, so the position remains that anything in the spatial development strategy that did not relate to the development and use of land would not be a material consideration. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I am grateful for that answer, but perhaps I could take the minister a step further. Given that the Bill provides that UDPs must be in general conformity with the SDS, and given that the boroughs will effectively be responsible for delivering the SDS, is it enough to leave it to the courts to settle the matter through case law, rather than dealing with it through secondary legislation, guidance and regulations or, indeed, through primary legislation? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> As I said, further guidance will be developed for the benefit of the mayor in drawing up the spatial development strategy and for further planning guidance. The hon. Gentleman will know that we are in the process of issuing a number of new revised PPG documents, that process will continue. 
<P>
The framework is evolving. As the impact of the new spatial development strategy becomes clear, we will undoubtedly see further developments. I do not see this as a static process. We are developing a new type of planning which will undoubtedly influence the way in which authorities think about these matters in the future. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> This is an important subject and I welcome the evolution that the Government are instituting. If the system is going in the direction that I think it is, it will be welcomed widely outside the House, too. 
<P>
I have a final question regarding the mayor's power to direct. I imagine that the mayor will take advice from his or her planning officers and will therefore have to have regard to his own spatial development strategy in issuing directions to the boroughs, particularly in exercising his special power to issue a direction to refuse. In that situation, is there not a possibility that the mayor's spatial development plan could well contain matters that are outwith the current planning system? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> In answering that, I shall also try to answer something that the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet asked about in an earlier debate. I discovered to my embarrassment and discomfiture that I had not answered on that occasion, but it is germane to this point so I shall take the two questions together. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Chipping Barnet asked how the spatial development strategy could in any way impact on a proposal for a housing development that was on land already designated for housing in the UDP. What I should have said is that there are wider implications. We all recognise that housing developments can generate a considerable amount of traffic, which can create unreasonable pressures on surrounding areas and indeed on the wider infrastructure in London. It is therefore important for those wider dimensions to be taken into account. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman will be well aware that while there can be designation of zones for housing, densities of housing and standards for car parking are issues on which there can be quite a wide variation of view which could, in turn, influence those wider transport issues. It is precisely in that context that it is important for us to be taking the wider dimension, which we are seeking to do through the spatial development strategy. I hope that that answers the question of the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam by showing the importance of relating to the wider strategies that the mayor has, but not in a way that could undermine the specific planning responsibilities. We are not seeking to create a position in which the planning responsibilities would be undermined by others. Instead, proper account should be taken of the full range of strategies, and consistency between the strategies should be achieved, wherever possible. That must be to the benefit of London and Londoners. 
<P>
Amendment No. 1081 seeks to alter the definition of the spatial development strategy in a way that would confine it to land use matters. This is a wrecking amendment, designed essentially to restrict the spatial development strategy, rather than allowing the wider context that we are seeking to explore. 
<P>
I was asked specifically about the significance of the word "includes" in relation to amendment No. 1081. The word enables the SDS to go beyond the conventional development and use of land--the point that we have just been debating in relation to the meaning of the term "spatial development strategy". It is not loose drafting, it is part of the definition of the spatial development strategy, which Opposition Members were seeking in the previous debate, and to which I tried to respond. 
<P>
We envisage a wider definition than the traditional development and land use planning framework. It is for that reason that we have included the word "includes". 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am glad that the Minister intends it to be this way, and that this is a clear, deliberate policy. Would he acknowledge that this is wider than the current London Planning Advisory Committee brief, which is simply in respect of development and land use? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Of course, we are moving forward. LPAC's responsibilities were defined within the context of existing land use and development planning systems. As I have already said, we are, quite openly, moving forward with the spatial development strategy to provide a new instrument for a new authority which seeks to adopt a wider approach to planning, and to ensure consistency with other strategies for which the GLA is responsible. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> While it is true that LPAC had a more narrowly defined brief, it never allowed itself to be constrained by that. Only recently right hon. and hon. Members have received a detailed briefing on road traffic reduction. That suggests that LPAC was taking the more visionary approach and widening it out. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a very good point. LPAC was seeking, in some of its recent documents, to move into that wider field that we are now making possible through the spatial development strategy. This is not happening only in London. It is a trend which reflects patterns in Europe and other countries where people recognise the importance of making the connections and achieving the more integrated approach that is the purpose of these provisions. 
<P>
I do not deny that the policy areas identified in amendment No. 1085 are important. On the contrary, the Government have made it clear through the provisions of the Bill that we need to improve the environment and promote sustainable development. Every strategy that the mayor produces must have regard to those objectives. We are resisting the amendment because we believe that it is unnecessary. It does not purport to define precisely the full list of policy issues to be addressed by the SDS. Indeed, it would be wrong to attempt to do so. I suspect that it seeks to identify some minimum requirements for the SDS, but in practice it does not go much beyond restating the general purposes of the authority that are set out in clause 25. Any such list of desirable objectives is bound to be selective and incomplete. It is also likely to require periodic review and amendment. Therefore, if it is necessary to specify minimum areas of coverage in the SDS, we shall do so through guidance notes or, if required, secondary legislation. The amendment would achieve nothing but a lengthening of the Bill. I believe that I have covered all the matters that hon. Members raised, and hope that they recognise that the amendment is unnecessary and should be withdrawn. 
<P>
I now recall the point that was raised by the hon. Member for Uxbridge about Rainham marshes. There is a good reason why I did not respond to that, as I hope he will appreciate. The matter is likely to come before the Secretary of State in his quasi-judicial role of considering planning appeals and the possibility of call-ins. It would therefore be inappropriate for me to make any comment that would prejudge the Secretary of State's view. I regret that, for reasons that all members of the Committee will understand, I cannot say anything specifically on that important issue. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I shall deal first with amendments Nos. 1085 and 1089, which relate to the environment. The Minister is no doubt aware that draft PPG11 already, in paragraph 2.23, contains a definition of sustainability appraisal. I see no reason, therefore, why a similiar provision should not be included in the Bill. The Minister said that amendment No. 1085 is unnecessary, in which case he should explain why a similar provision for development plans is in the Town and Country Planning Act. He cannot have it both ways. He also described amendment No. 1081 as a wrecking amendment. After a couple of months of debate we are all prone to exaggerate, but that really is an exaggeration. The definition of a wrecking amendment is an amendment that would make a measure unworkable if it were accepted, and I think that the Minister is stretching the point in this case. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam referred to the circular from LPAC about traffic reduction. I am sure that the Minister will agree that that exceeds LPAC's brief, and I suspect that it is more in the nature of a job application than anything else. 
<P>
The Minister is being frank about this matter, and we are not accusing him of misleading the Committee. We have a clear difference of opinion. He does not seek to define the precise scope of the SDS. We are seeking to define the precise scope of the SDS, and shall on that basis divide the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1204, in page 114, line 31, leave out "general setting" and insert "strategic framework". 
<P>
Some of the issues that I want to raise have already been partly dealt with in our debate on the previous group of amendments, so I will try not to speak for too long--to avoid the other word that we use all too often. 
<P>
I want to discover how the Government think that the plan-led system will develop. The spatial development plan will change the nature of the relationship between the new body and the London boroughs, which have responsibility for drawing up the unitary development plans. Those plans provide the basis and framework for planning decisions. In London, we have 33 unitary development plans all being developed and reviewed at different rates at different times--some old, some new, some entering their first stages. 
<P>
We now know that an SDS will be produced during the next two to three years. At what point will that begin to inform changes to UDPs? The SDS will become a material consideration when it is first published, so planning authorities will then need to take it into account. We also know that the GLA, through the mayor, will be developing a whole host of strategies; presumably, some will be developed much more quickly than others. For example, I imagine that there will be quite a lot of pressure from the London development agency to produce the economic development strategy at the earliest possible opportunity, to safeguard London's interests in relation to economic development, the ability to secure inward investment, and so on. 
<P>
That begs the question of how those other strategies will fit in with the SDS. Will the SDS be more important for Londoners and the mayor than the LDA's economic development strategy? In other words, what will be the hierarchy of strategies within the system that the Bill will set up? That is vital, because around the country regional development agencies are making rapid progress--rightly, and at the Government's request--towards developing and delivering regional economic strategies. I imagine that there will be similar pressure on the GLA to do the same. 
<P>
That is likely to occur far more quickly than the production of the new SDS. How will these two strategies be brought together? In considering the various issues of which an SDS will have to take account, it may well be found that parts of the economic development strategy have been got wrong. How will that be addressed? 
<P>
I hope that the Minister will establish how those strategies will fit together. London boroughs, which are at various stages of producing unitary development plans, will need to know whether they must stop, and start all over again, or whether they are expected to continue with the process on which they have already embarked. The SDS will have an important impact on them in that regard. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I was hoping that during the speech of the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam I would receive some enlightenment about the textual significance of the words "strategic framework" to replace "general setting", but I am no wiser. I assume that the hon. Gentleman feels that there is a strategic advantage to the words "strategic framework" over "general setting", but I am not yet convinced or persuaded. However, I will try to answer the points that he has raised and set his mind at rest. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is unduly pessimistic in his assessment of the progress of UDPs. All London boroughs, with one exception, have their UDP properly in place, and most are already involved in reviewing them. That process is already well advanced, and will not be inhibited in any way by the arrival of the SDS. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about hierarchies. In answer to an earlier question, I made it clear that we do not envisage a hierarchy in the mayor's strategies. We believe that there must be consistency between them, and we have tried to set in place measures to achieve that. I remind the hon. Gentleman of clause 33, which the Committee debated in a previous sitting. We have not only prescribed the strategies, but have also clearly laid an obligation on the mayor to keep each strategy under review and make such revisions as he considers necessary. 
<P>
Subsection (3) of that clause defines that approach in a little more detail. It states that in considering revisions, 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Mayor shall have regard to ... the need to ensure that the strategy is consistent with national policy and international obligations ... and consistent with each other strategy mentioned in subsection (1) above".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When it emerges that there are inconsistencies between, for example, economic development initiatives arising from the LDA and planning objectives, the mayor has a duty to consider revisions appropriate to one of those strategies. That is how we envisage that the process will work. 
<P>
As the boroughs review their UDPs, they will want to take account of emerging advice in the form of the draft SDS. They will have to take full account of such advice once the SDS has been adopted, because they will be required to develop their UDPs so that they are in conformity with the SDS. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also asked whether UDPs would be held up by having to await the SDS. I have expressed our hope that the process will not be unduly protracted and that it will not replicate the lengthy procedures of the Greater London development plan. There should not be a long delay before the SDS is in place. In the meantime, while the SDS is being formulated, the Secretary of State's guidance in RPG3 will remain in place, so there will be no problem of a delay in the intervening period. 
<P>
I hope that I have answered the hon. Gentleman's points and that he will accept that his amendment is not necessary and ask leave to withdraw it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> We proposed the insertion of the term "strategic framework" to test a little further the Government's view about a hierarchy of strategies. It has today been established clearly and categorically that there is to be no hierarchy. In that respect, the Government will not support our amendment, because the words "strategic framework" are intended to raise that issue. We still have a number of concerns about the process, but in the optimistic spirit in which the Minister spoke, and although we may wish to return to it, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.  1351 1352 
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1055, in page 114, line 36, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"including the tourism strategy coordinated by the London Tourist Board through the Joint London Tourism Forum".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In a previous sitting, I spoke about my dialogue with the London tourist board and its wish to give a general briefing. As I said then, I told it that its proposal would be even more valuable if it specified aspects of the Bill that it believed required amendment. The Committee will recall an amendment debated earlier that I tabled on behalf of the board, and I have done the same with the amendment before us. In that previous sitting, the Minister for Transport in London was able to explain that there was no need for the amendment and that the matter was adequately taken care of elsewhere in the Bill. I am confident that the Minister will be able to give similar assurance to the LTB now. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The right hon. Gentleman has been open with the Committee about his dealings with the LTB and its wish to promote amendments that would give it a defined and specific role under the Bill. While I understand that, I believe that it would be inappropriate to name one single body in that way. We do not propose to name other organisations that will have a very real interest in other strategies. It would be inconsistent to adopt the approach to the London tourist board that the amendment proposes. 
<P>
However, I hope that I can satisfy the right hon. Gentleman by saying that tourism will be taken seriously. He will, because he is eagle-eyed, have seen from the amendment paper Government amendments relating to the cultural section of the Bill which flesh out the role of tourism and the importance that we attach to it. I hope that that will be of comfort both to him and to the London tourist board. With that, I hope that he will feel able to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooks:</B> The Minister is entirely accurate in thinking that as I rise each morning to greet another parliamentary day, the one thing, above all, to which I look forward is the opportunity of seeing what Government amendments have been tabled overnight. I am grateful to him for what he has said, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 1202, in page 115, line 3, at end insert-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(7A) A development in the City of London shall not by reason only of the floor area comprised within the development be regarded as matter of strategic importance within the meaning of subsection (5) above.".
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
No 1226, in page 115, line 5 at end add-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(9) In determining for the purposes of this Part whether a matter is of strategic importance to Greater London the views of the Mayor and Assembly shall be paramount".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The amendment is an attempt to define more clearly matters of strategic importance to Greater London. The Provision says that matters of strategic importance need not affect the whole of London. The amendment would add the proviso that to be of strategic importance to Greater London, a matter must have a significant effect beyond an individual borough. The justification for that is that without some definition of strategy there is little limit on the Power of the mayor on what to include and direct with regard to local planning matters. 
<P>
The amendment would ensure that strategic matters are of importance to more than one borough. It allows boroughs to determine matters that affect only themselves and confines the mayor's role to genuinely strategic issues--those that are pan-London or affect more than one borough. I should be grateful if the Minister could give sympathetic consideration to this point.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The amendments give an opportunity to test the Government a little further on what they mean by "strategic. That will be crucial in terms of individual London boroughs exercising their responsibilities and duties under the planning system and not feeling as though their discretion is being fettered, to some extent, by the mayor intervening and saying, "This is strategic" without having an adequate definition. 
<P>
In a written answer on 15 March, as a result of consultation, the Minister went some way to address that point. That is to be welcomed. A very detailed set of categories will be considered as being strategic. The answer estimated that between 150 and 250 planning applications out of some 70,000 submitted in Greater London each year will fall into those categories. 
<P>
I am sure that those of us who rushed off to the Library will have studied in great detail all the other aspects of this. One aspect on which I should like the Minister to expand is category (iv), which is provided as: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Any development on a key site of strategic importance as designated in a consultation direction made by the Secretary of State."--[Official Report, 15 March 1999; Vol 327, c. 473.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Could the Minister amplify what that means, and how it will work? That will give us more information on what will be regarded as strategic over and above that which is set out in the answer. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I support the lead amendment, moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South. Westminster city council would certainly wish to be associated with the issue of providing greater definition of the strategic aspect. 
<P>
I want to speak to amendments Nos. 1202 and 1226 in particular, which I tabled. Amendment No. 1202 would avoid the situation whereby floor space alone can decide whether a development in the City of London is to be regarded as of strategic importance, thus requiring reference to the mayor. 
<P>
<H5>5 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government's position on the use of floor space as a criterion for deciding whether a development should be regarded as strategic was set out by the Minister in a written answer given earlier this week, to which the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam has already referred. A threshold of 30,000 sq m is proposed, which, although a substantial and welcome increase on the threshold of 20,000 sq m which was proposed in the Government office for London's earlier consultation paper, will still result in reference to the mayor of development proposals that are, in City terms, relatively routine in character. Moreover, it should be remembered that in the vast majority of cases, these are redevelopments in which the increase in floor space may be relatively modest--perhaps 10 per cent. or so. Their effect on aspects which might otherwise be regarded as raising strategic considerations--on transport infrastructure, for example--can therefore be discounted. 
<P>
In the six months from July to December 1997, the last period for which statistics are readily available, there were 24 developments either under construction or proposed--planning permission having been granted--with floor space exceeding 30,000 sq m. Obviously, I am speaking about the City. The common council of the City of London--the City's planning authority--recognises the need for strategic oversight in planning matters. However, there remains a concern that a threshold of 30,000 sq m will mean the mayor considering developments that are not of strategic importance. 
<P>
The City is a competitive environment. Its ability to respond rapidly and flexibly to the accommodation needs of the international financial community is an important element in London's continuing attractiveness as a financial centre. It is important that that attractiveness is maintained by a streamlined planning system. Reference to the mayor will inevitably extend the decision-making processes, so it is important that such reference is confined to developments that really merit it. I therefore invite the Minister to reconsider the Government's current approach and to remove floor space alone as a criterion for regarding developments in the City as being of strategic importance. 
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> Would it be helpful to my right hon. Friend--although heaven knows he does not need much help--if I remind the Committee, in the context of London's importance as a financial centre, that there are more American banks in the Square Mile than there are in New York? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> My hon. Friend is entirely accurate in that observation. There is, of course, a difference between the American system and our own, which goes back to events under President Jackson in 1827. However, I know that you would rule me out of order, Mr. Winterton, if I sought to introduce either that or the Single European Act into this debate. 
<P>
As I said, I invite the Minister to reconsider the current approach and to remove floor space alone as a criterion for regarding developments in the City as being of strategic importance. If that invitation does not find favour, I ask that at the very least, the proposed floor space of 30,000 sq m--or the threshold related to the increase in floor space for new building developments as compared with any buildings which they may replace--be increased. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Brent, East was down on the race card as also being present at yesterday's breakfast, which was mounted by the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry. There was an extremely interesting presentation on the euro. I think that the hon. Gentleman and I were the only two Members of Parliament who volunteered to go. Mr. Young of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, who gave the presentation, said--the Minister and, indeed, you, Mr. Winterton, will be gratified to learn that my remarks are in no way associated with the abolition of the Greater London council--that whereas up until 1986 the economy of London had been growing more slowly than the rest of the country, from 1986 onwards London's economic growth overtook that of the rest of the country. Mr. Young of the NIESR attributed that to big bang--the liberalisation of the City's regulatory controls--and the fact that there was a marked expansion in the financial services sector during that period. That underlies the point that I am making. 
<P>
Amendment No. 1227, for which I have not yet found my notes, despite the helpful intervention by my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull-- 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman does not find his notes on amendment No. 1227, because it has not been selected. He means amendment No. 1226. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> Thank you for that correction, Mr. Winterton. I meant amendment No. 1226. In the absence of my notes I made a mathematical error. 
<P>
My tabling of amendment No. 1226 may conceivably have caught the Government by surprise. I am glad to see from the Minister's face that that is so. The powers that the GLC had in the planning area were not as strong as those proposed by the Government in the Bill. There was a hazard that although the GLC acted as an extra tier that was always brought into play in terms of planning developments, in reality it served merely as a vehicle for delay. The Minister may say that the requirement is otiose, but I believe that the Bill should stipulate the paramountcy of the strategic element in the new plans. 
<P>
What I am about to say may seem somewhat contrary to some of the amendments to this part of the Bill that have been tabled by the official Opposition, but perhaps it is none the worse for that. As a Londoner, it seems to me that a hazard is involved in the removal from the London boroughs of a direct interest in the economic growth within their boundaries that has resulted from the changes in the rating system and local government finance. That has produced a slant towards residents and away from economic realities in terms of the response to some planning applications, including the speed with which those planning applications are determined. A counterbalance to that is therefore likely to be all to the good. I am delighted, Mr. Winterton, to have had the opportunity to speak to the amendments. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> Once again, we are in the midst of an extremely important debate. The amendments touch on the essence of the difference of approach between the Conservative Opposition and Her Majesty's Government. Amendment No. 1082 was tabled by my hon. Friends the Members for Croydon, South and for Solihull. London borough councils and their residents will live in daily disquiet and anxiety if the Bill retains powers that allow the mayoralty to advance proposals for development under the spatial development plan that will have grave consequences for the quality of life in those boroughs, on the pretext of some strategic objective. A strategic objective is, by its very nature, something that transcends the local, parochial and borough context, as my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South appropriately defines it in amendment No. 1082. If the mayoralty will have, in essence, carte blanche to promulgate developmental proposals throughout London that are not necessarily in accordance with the wishes and UDPs of borough councils, and certainly run counter to the traditional pattern of land use in those boroughs, we are in for at best tension and at worst conflict. In the gravest extremity we will see the loss of the mayor's credibility, because it will seem to Londoners that the mayor is using his subjective judgment--in some cases, his obsessive determination to pursue a particular project--to the detriment of local interests. 
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge described so vividly the case of the proposed Warner Brothers theme park at Hillingdon home farm in his constituency, against which his predecessor, the late Sir Michael Shersby, and local people, including my hon. Friend, campaigned so hard. If that had been a pet mayoralty project, there would have been nothing to stop it. That is why amendment No1082 is so important and relevant. 
<P>
I entirely agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster with regard to the floor space criterion for what constitutes strategic development in the City of London. If the limit were to be more than 30,000 sq m, that would be all to the good, for the reasons that my right hon. Friend advanced. I am afraid that I part company with him--as he intimated--on amendment No. 1226, which would give the mayor unfettered subjective power to decide what he or she considers to be strategic. 
<P>
We need an effective definition to limit the power of the mayoralty in that regard; that is exactly what amendment No. 1082 provides. I fear that if amendment No. 1226 were permitted to be passed by the Government, it would not have the beneficent effect that my right hon. Friend supposes. The consequence could be malign, because it would give the mayoralty for perverse, personal reasons--even, dare I say, for corrupt reasons--the ability to pursue a particular project in a locality just because he or she deemed it to be strategic. 
<P>
I hope that the Government will accept amendment No. 1082, and expand the floor space criterion from 30,000 sq m to a bigger figure to be agreed with the City of London corporation. As for amendment No. 1226, I hope that my right hon. Friend will quietly drop it.

<P>

<B>Sir Sydney Chapman:</B> I rise to support my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South on amendment No. 1082, and my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster on amendment No. 1202. 
<P>
I do not want to rehearse the arguments again, but suffice it to say that a large development does not of itself necessarily have wider strategic implications. I take to heart the Minister's fairly made point that housing in a zone earmarked for housing could have strategic implications, because of the infrastructure involved. However, I repeat that, of itself, a large development need not be of strategic significance. We want to streamline the planning system as much as we can. 
<P>
In that respect, I have a proposal for the Minister on which I do not necessarily expect him to comment now, but which he may like to consider. Where the mayor will have the right to be a statutory consultee on a planning application of strategic significance, it would be helpful if it were written, if not into the Bill, into the order--which will presumably take the form of a statutory instrument in due course--that would remove the power of the Secretary of State to call in that application. After all, the mayor will be performing the duty of the Secretary of State in such cases. 
<P>
Where the mayor has what I think is called the fall-back power to direct the refusal of planning permission, the applicant would of course continue to have the right to appeal to the Secretary of State. I fully support the two amendments to which I referred. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> We have had an interesting debate about the definition of matters of strategic importance to London as a whole, and about how that may impact on various parts of London. The amendment seeks to limit the consideration of strategic issues to matters that have significant effects beyond the borough in which they occur. I cannot accept that it is helpful or necessary to limit in that way the definition of what is strategic. Although London boroughs will remain the planning authorities for their areas, the mayor will sometimes have to take a strategic view on matters within them that do not directly affect other boroughs. 
<P>
For example, the mayor may wish to indicate the broad location of an especially important piece of infrastructure such as a new conference centre, a new sports stadium, a new incinerator--I say that with particular thought to the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood--or a new railway station. It is not absolutely obvious that in each of those examples the decision would have an impact beyond the individual borough concerned. 
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Oh come on! 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Member for Croydon, South does not believe me. I must put it to him that in a litigious society it would be very easy for people to challenge the mayor's entitlement to take the view that such a development is not strategic because it does not impact outside an individual borough area. The hon. Gentleman knows that that is so. If he wishes to speed up the planning system, as I believe most hon. Members do, the one thing that he should not propose is legislation that makes it easy for lawyers to find ways of challenging planning issues. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I was expressing scepticism about the Minister's list of definitions. How can he possibly suggest that an incinerator located in one borough will have no impact outside that borough? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I can say that very easily. If the construction of an incinerator is proposed in a borough at the edge of London, where adjoining authorities are outside London and the location is some way away from the nearest London borough boundary, it could easily be argued that the development would have no impact on another borough, perhaps because the prevailing wind blows towards the area outside London. In such a case, there would be no obvious impact beyond the borough in question. That is an obvious example, and the hon. Gentleman must be aware that it could occur. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Let us take that scenario one stage further. The SDS will have to include the mayor's plans on waste management. Surely that will make such a proposal more than a local matter, because it will be of strategic importance. The incinerator would be dealing with London's waste, so its effects would go beyond individual borough boundaries. It would therefore be a strategic issue, so I am not certain whether the Minister's argument is taking us down the correct route. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I put it to the hon. Gentleman that if the incinerator were taking waste only from the individual borough and from surrounding areas outside London, it could easily be argued that it would have no impact on other London boroughs. I do not want to introduce a framework that would allow easy legal challenge by people seeking merely to frustrate the mayor's wish for a clear strategy for London. 
<P>
It is in all our interests for the strategy to determine a proper Londonwide framework for important infrastructure issues. [Interruption.] I can see that the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood wants to intervene, and I shall give way in a moment. I hope that he will let me finish my response to the previous intervention, as I try to do such things in an orderly way. 
<P>
The mayor should be able to set a strategy for the whole of London that is consistent with his other strategies, and which is not open to frivolous challenge from boroughs seeking merely to frustrate the creation of the wider strategic framework. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> The Minister has explained clearly his vision of the criterion that decides what is strategic in terms of the spatial development strategy. His examples, however, heighten our anxieties rather than alleviate them. He spoke, for example, of a conference centre. Is not that a local matter par excellence to be determined by a borough council? It is not of Londonwide significance. One can think of all sorts of pet projects or developments that could, if the Minister has his way, be imposed by the mayor on borough councils with the specious argument that there is some vague, strategic interest for London as a whole. It is a very dangerous proposal, because it will take from local residents the power to protect their own environment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman is profoundly wrong on that point. A conference centre, to take his example, is of strategic importance to London. If London is to compete successfully against other world cities as a major attraction for organisations wanting to hold conferences and a new conference centre is to be established here, that is a strategic issue. It must be located in the right place to ensure that it provides the service that is required and that it meshes with transport arrangements, ensuring that it is workable and effective-- 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Will the Minister give way? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman is desperately keen to get in, but I am answering the question asked by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood. If the hon. Member for Croydon, South wants an orderly debate, will he please wait until I have answered the previous intervention before he makes the next one? When I have finished responding to the previous intervention, I shall give way to the hon. Member for Croydon, South, who may have another intervention. 
<P>
If we want to see the orderly planning of facilities such as conference centres, which are important to London as a whole, the last thing we want is 32 London boroughs scrapping to have a particular facility in their territory. We want an approach that maximises the benefit for London. That is why we want a strategic approach, which the mayor is best placed to offer. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood earlier raised the matter of the Warner Brothers development, to which his hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge had also referred. The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood said that had that been a pet mayoral project, there would have been nothing to stop it. He is quite wrong. The mayor will not have the power to direct an authority to accept a planning application; he will have the power to require or instruct an authority to refuse a planning matter of strategic importance, but if the borough is not happy and the applicant is not happy, the matter will go to the Secretary of State for determination. 
<P>
In the same way, in relation to the spatial development strategy--although in general the SDS will be strategic rather than site-specific--if the mayor indicates a preference for some facility to be sited in a particular area but the borough is unhappy, that borough will be able to seek the Secretary of State's intervention if it does not want to draw up its UDP in compliance with the SDS. There are thus those safeguards against an imposition by the mayor on an unwilling borough; I hope that the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood accepts that. I now give way to the hon. Member for Croydon, South. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> In his response to the amendment, the Minister seemed to argue from both directions. Originally he said that an incinerator, railway station, conference centre or sports centre would not necessarily have an impact outside the borough, but in reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood, he said that such facilities could have an impact outside the borough. Is he saying that the location of an incinerator can or cannot be of strategic importance? Do both applications apply? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Clearly, the hon. Gentleman was not listening to what I was saying. I argued that all those matters would be likely to have strategic importance and therefore that they should be within the remit of the mayor's spatial development strategy. I pointed out that a litigious authority which did not like the mayor's spatial development strategy could call in aid the hon. Gentleman's amendment to suggest that because a particular facility was located in one borough alone, it did not have an impact beyond that particular borough. I believe that that would be wrong, but if the borough were to challenge the mayor on it and seek a remedy through the courts, there could be protracted litigation on whether or not it was strategic. That would be a waste of time and entirely inconsistent with the view that Conservative Members express about achieving a streamlined and more efficient planning system. 
<P>
Amendment No. 1202 seeks to introduce a restriction on the scope of the SDS that applies just to the City of London. I understand why the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster tabled the amendment--he is being a good constituency Member of Parliament, representing the interests of his patch. But it is hardly a good start for the mayor, in his or her attempts to produce a cohesive and inclusive strategic vision for London, if one part of the city says that it would like to opt out. 
<P>
The suggestion that the City should be immune is not persuasive. It would be entirely proper for my hon. Friend the Member for Poplar and Canning Town (Mr. Fitzpatrick) to retort that that would give an unfair competitive advantage to the City as against Canary wharf as a location for business. As we need to ensure that London is able to promote London internationally, it would be wrong to give a particular advantage to one area. 
<P>
We have heard the concerns of the City. We have listened to them carefully and we have revised the floor-space criteria to take account of them; but we cannot accept the proposal that the City should simply opt out of the procedures that will apply across London as a whole. The amendment, therefore, is not acceptable to the Government.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> In the closing stage of my remarks about amendment No. 1202, I indicated that the explosion in the financial services industry had been responsible for a marked acceleration in the speed of growth of London as a whole. I take the Minister's point about how the hon. Member for Poplar and Canning Town might feel about the proposal. I freely acknowledge that there are other parts of London in which the financial services industry is concentrated. How much delay does the Minister believe will be introduced into the planning procedures in relation to the buildings that he has identified? That is a critical figure in terms of the economic impact that these provisions will have. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I do not believe that the matter that we are discussing--the formulation of the spatial development strategy--should create any delay at all. Indeed, it might reduce delay by creating greater certainty about appropriate locations for key types of development. 
<P>
We are not strictly discussing the second part, but it is impossible to consider what we are discussing without referring to the mayor's intervention powers, and so I crave your indulgence in this respect, Mr. Winterton. The mayor must express a view within 14 days if he or she wishes the borough to refuse planning permission on a particular application. That is a very tight timetable, to ensure that there is no undue and unreasonable delay. We are setting a tight timetable; we do not expect these powers to be used very often--only in exceptional circumstances. We believe in the plan-led system, in which the spatial development strategy and borough UDPs will create clarity to help ensure that development proposals are brought forward in conformity with the plans. Therefore, the intervention powers should be required only in limited numbers of circumstances. We estimate that the number of occasions when the mayor may use his or her intervention powers will be a maximum of 250--probably between 150 and 250. We have set in place time scales and procedures to ensure that that does not cause an unreasonable delay in the process. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> If I heard correctly, the estimate for the number of occasions on which the mayor will intervene was between 150 and 250. Yet in the written answer of 15 March, that was broadly the ballpark figure that was given for the number of strategic applications. Are we being told that the mayor will be exercising his direction powers in almost all strategic applications? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I probably did mislead the Committee when I spoke about the number of occasions being between 150 and 250. That is the number of cases that we expect to be referred to the mayor--the number of cases in which the mayor would be able to exercise his intervention power. Obviously, the mayor will not exercise that power in all cases. Let me put it on record that I am referring to the number of cases that are likely to fall within the criteria which will require them to be referred to the mayor. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Fitzpatrick </B>(Poplar and Canning Town): I want to pick up a reference that my hon. Friend the Minister made to the competition between Canary wharf and the City. Does he agree that whereas that may have been the case at one time, docklands and Canary wharf are now regarded as working in partnership with the City? Indeed, Lord Levene, the Lord Mayor, was once the chief executive who rescued Canary wharf. Despite an article by Christopher Fildes that appeared in The Spectator the week before last, and which was syndicated in Saturday's edition of The Daily Telegraph , which suggested that Canary wharf was a complete disaster and should never have been supported by the previous Government, the present Government or the City, without the 6 million sq ft that docklands and Canary wharf provide for London, it would not be able to compete with Paris, Frankfurt and elsewhere. The current relationship between the City corporation and Canary wharf is to the benefit of London. The days of competitiveness are gone; the days of partnership are now with us. 
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I entirely agree with what my hon. Friend says about the importance of a collaborative and co-operative approach to promote the interests of London, rather than rivalry between different parts of London for sectional advantage. That new spirit of closer working together is very much in evidence at present; the contribution of the present Lord Mayor of London, Lord Levene, has been extremely positive and valuable in achieving acceptance that it is in all our interests for the City and Canary wharf to work collaboratively together, rather than to compete against each other. 
<P>
Amendment No. 1226 would make the views of the mayor and assembly paramount in determining whether a matter is of strategic importance. I fully understand why the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster did not carry the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood with him on that amendment. I must tell the right hon. Gentleman that I am not sure how that proposal can be expected to work if the mayor and assembly have different views. The amendment states that the views of the mayor and assembly will be paramount, but does not say what happens if the two do not agree. 
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman will understand that I find it difficult to accept the amendment, because it lacks clarity. It is also unnecessary. It will already be the mayor's responsibility to consider what are matters of strategic importance, and to consult the assembly before defining that in the SDS. The assembly will have a say, but the mayor's view will ultimately be paramount. What the right hon. Gentleman wants will therefore be provided by the Bill as drafted, without his amendment. I hope that he will agree not to press his amendment, and that the hon. Member for Croydon, South will withdraw his amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I suspect that Dick Whittington's cat has just jumped out of the bag--or, if I may mix the metaphor slightly, that the fog of cliches through which we have been wandering for some weeks now momentarily cleared a short time ago. If anyone doubts that we have been in a fog of cliches, I was, as ever, listening carefully to what the Minister said, and made a note of one of his more memorable phrases. He managed to string together in one short sentence the words "cohesive and inclusive strategic vision". If ever one wanted an example of the sort of rubbish in which we are immersed, that is a pretty good one. It is meaningless garbage, but the sort of thing that we are offered hourly by the Minister as justification for what he is doing. 
<P>
The fog cleared, however, because we now know that one of the prime functions of a mayor would be, where he thought it necessary, to define an incinerator as strategic to London and then tell boroughs where it should go. If the Minister had told the people of London at the time of his much-vaunted but totally overrated referendum that he proposed an authority that could tell them where an incinerator should go, regardless of the views of their community borough council, I suspect that the pathetic response that he received from Londoners would have been even worse--but of course he did not tell them that. We are offered this cohesive, inclusive strategic vision rubbish as a justification for what is going to be imposed on the people of London. It is only during this sitting of the Committee that we have begun to see the reality. The clause has worried me from the start, and the amendment has highlighted the fact that it will potentially result in institutionalised conflict between the elected boroughs and the elected mayor and assembly. The Minister has just made it even worse by revealing to my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster that it is perfectly possible, even probable, that the mayor and assembly may have different views on these matters. Is that a cohesive and inclusive strategic vision? I very much doubt it. 
<P>
That is what depresses me about the entire process. The idea was put to the people of London and a small turnout responded to it, the majority of whom admittedly said yes. However, we are now at last beginning to get the truth about what is going to happen in London. An expensive, overblown bureaucracy will create institutionalised conflict--in the planning sphere more than any other. That is the prospect that we now face. My only regret--although I may see if I can table an amendment on Report if the thought occurs to me--is that we cannot rerun the referendum, knowing what we know now, and put before the people of London the reality of what is to happen in terms of planning and transport. We could say to them, "All right, you gave an answer based on the cohesive and inclusive strategic vision first time around. We are now going to put the reality before you and see if you still want this nonsense in your lives." I think that the answer would be a very firm no. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The other glimpse, or inclusive vision, that we received during the debate was the fact that the hon. Member for Poplar and Canning Town is a reader of The Spectator. I must confess that I had not envisioned that, but we nevertheless welcome people-- 
<P>
<B>Mr. Fitzpatrick:</B> For the hon. Gentleman's information, the column from The Spectator was syndicated in Saturday's edition of The Daily Telegraph, which was distributed free of charge in the hotel in Glasgow in which I was staying for the Scottish Labour party conference. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I thought that the hon. Gentleman was going to say that his fish and chips were wrapped up in it. Let no one who wishes to switch parties to the one that occupies the middle ground be in any doubt that that one is certainly not the Labour party if its members now read the The Spectator and The Daily Telegraph. 
<P>
I should like to pick up on the point that was made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst about the incinerator. The situation is actually slightly worse than he has just portrayed it to be. In his effort to prove that my amendment is ineffective, the Minister let slip that an incinerator may be allowed at local level without the mayor's involvement. He said that the amendment could lead to a great deal of litigation. I say to him that the words that he uttered will he quoted extensively in years to come under the principle of Pepper v. Hart.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I cannot allow the hon. Gentleman to go on compounding his inaccurate interpretation of my remarks. I was making the point that the location of a sports centre, a conference centre or an incinerator would be of strategic significance. It is therefore right that such issues should fall within the ambit of the mayor's spatial development strategy. It should not be possible for a borough that wished to proceed with foisting an incinerator on its area, which is the example that I gave, to proceed legally to challenge the mayor on the basis of the amendment. The hon. Gentleman and the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst must not misinterpret my comments as implying support for incinerators. I meant nothing of the sort. I meant that a proposal to build an incinerator or a major conference centre is a strategic matter that should rightly be considered by the mayor in the context of London's wider strategic interests. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> In that case, the Minister has misunderstood my amendment. The Opposition are trying to provide a definition of strategic importance. We suggest that it should include developments that have a significant effect beyond the London borough in which they occur. If the Minister is now saying that an incinerator will have an impact beyond the area in which it is built, I cannot see his problem in accepting my amendment. He may even be advancing a slightly better argument than I am in support of the amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I have no doubt that any development of that nature would be strategic. The amendment would mean, however, that boroughs with a different view that do not want the mayor to view a specific development as strategically important would be able to challenge him on the ground that it does not have an impact beyond the borough in question. 
<P>
I gave the example of an incinerator located at the outer edge of an outer London borough that is not contiguous with any other London borough, and where, because of prevailing winds, emissions would not go into another borough. All those factors could be used to argue that a development is not strategic. 
<P>
Such arguments would be dangerous and misguided. An issue such as the location of an incinerator is a matter of huge strategic importance. I am seeking simply to ensure that safeguards are in place to make certain that strategic issues such as that cannot be kept outside the mayor's remit by a borough that is keen to pursue its own parochial interest while ignoring Londonwide interests. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> In that case my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst really has got a point--the mayor could dump an incinerator in London anywhere that he liked. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> No. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister cannot have it every way. 
<P>
Perhaps I should probe in a different direction. Let us take the example of a conference centre, which would have considerable traffic and transport impacts, as I am sure the Minister will agree. The mayor would examine the circumstances with a public examination inquiry. Is that the right forum to assess whether the conference centre is in the right location? Surely it would be better for a UDP inquiry at borough level to consider that when assessing the planning application. 
<P>
I have sought clarification on what is meant by "strategic". The Minister will be aware that the Association of London Government has also called for clarification. He has prayed in aid the ALG in the past; I throw that back at him now by saying that the ALG wants that clarification. He may tell me that the answer lies in a written answer of his that was published a couple of days ago, on 15 March. He will be aware that a new item popped up in that answer--piers, not in the House of Lords but on the river. Is he aware that a written answer tabled by the Minister for Transport in London on 10 March states that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"it is intended that ownership of the piers should pass to Transport for London"?--[Official Report, 10 March 1999; Vol. 327, c. 238.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister will be aware that a number of piers on the river are privately owned. Will only publicly-owned piers be transferred to TfL, or is the policy the Government's first nationalisation? 
<P>
Will the Minister express his regret that his answer involved no consultation with the Thames Passenger Services Federation, which represents relevant businesses. After months of consultation, right at the last minute the Minister sticks in the new item of piers, which has not been the subject of consultation, and there is also extreme doubt about which piers are covered. 
<P>
To us this is an important amendment and whether we divide on it depends on the Minister's answer. 
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> As I said, I support my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South on amendment No. 1082. The Minister rejected it on the ground that it is likely to lead to litigation, but in the absence of a clearer definition of strategic importance, perhaps I can put another scenario to the Minister. 
<P>
The only definition of strategic importance in the Bill is in clause 226(6), which refers to matters to be dealt with by the SDS and states that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"it is immaterial whether or not the matter affects the whole . . . of . . . London."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I remark in passing that as a definition of what is of strategic importance, that seems to be paralleled by a brochure issued by the New Oriental Hotel in Galle in Sri Lanka, which starts: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The New Oriental hotel is neither new nor oriental".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Whether a matter included in the SDS is of strategic importance to London will he considered at the examination in public; I do not think that there is any difference of opinion on that. Depending on the view taken by the mayor, recommendations arising from the examination and any direction issued by the Secretary of State under clause 229(2) and (6)--here I must crave your indulgence, Mr. Winterton--could ultimately be the subject of legal proceedings. All that is because we do not have a more precise definition of what constitues strategic importance. For those reasons, I support the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South. 
<P>
The Minister replied to my amendment No. 1202 in a reasonable manner, although I noticed that despite rejecting it, he did not refer to the alternative suggestion that I made in the closing stages of my speech. I remind 1365 1366 
<P>
him that I invited him to reconsider the current approach and to remove floor space alone as a criterion for regarding developments in the City as being of strategic importance. If that invitation did not find favour, I asked the Minister that at the very least the proposed floor space of 30,000 sq m, or the threshold relating to the increase in floor space for new building developments as compared with any buildings which they may replace, be increased. 
<P>
It would have been foolhardy of me to press amendment No. 1226 in the light of the observation of my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood. I was grateful to the Minister for saying that the amendment was in any case unnecessary. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> In my earlier intervention 1 asked the Minister to expand on what he meant in the answer that he gave on 15 March, which refers to the following category: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Any development on a key site of strategic importance as designated in a consultation direction made by the Secretary of State."--[Official Report, 15 March 1999; Vol. 327, c. 473.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What is that? When will it happen? How will the process operate? What does "strategic" mean in that context? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> We have gone round these issues on several occasions, so I shall try to be brief in my response. 
<P>
I deferred responding to the request of the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam because it concerned the application of powers contained in a later clause for the mayor to intervene, rather than the definition in the SDS. However, if you are content, Mr. Winterton, I shall give the hon. Gentleman a reply now. 
<P>
We need to cover particular locations of such importance that any development or redevelopment would have implications for the mayor's strategic policy. The mayor will therefore be able to propose specific sites or areas as being of strategic importance. Their formal designation will require confirmation by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions. That will introduce a check on the number and scale of sites, as well as allowing consultation by the Secretary of State with the individual boroughs. I hope that that gives the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam greater guidance on the way in which we envisage that process operating. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, South persists in his belief that his highly restrictive amendment is necessary. It would put the onus on the mayor to show that a development would have a significant effect beyond the borough itself. It is precisely that that would be the invitation to litigation and would hamper the exercise of the mayor's strategic functions. We believe that that is undesirable, and that is why we do not propose to support the amendment. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned piers. Piers are, of course, part of a strategic transport infrastructure. For too long we have not taken account of the use of our river for transport, and it is right that we should do so. The provision of a network of piers to enable the river to be used more intensively for transport certainly has a strategic implication for London. It is right that it should be part of the mayor's strategy. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked whether we would be transferring piers not in public ownership to TfL. The answer is no. Only piers in public ownership will transfer to TfL. He also asked whether this was our first nationalisation. The answer is no; he is wrong. He forgot that we nationalised the docklands light railway some time ago.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Is the Minister proud of that? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I see no reason at all why the docklands light railway should not have been brought within the ambit of the Secretary of State at the time that the London docklands development corporation ceased to exist. The alternative of leaving it in an incoherent relationship, or possibly to be an additional burden on London Transport, which had been having certain difficulties in other areas of its operation, would not necessarily have been desirable. It was an entirely logical and appropriate decision on the part of my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister to bring the docklands light railway under national control. 
<P>
The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster repeated his concern about the figure of 30,000 sq m of floor space in relation to the City. I indicated in my earlier reply that we had listened to the views expressed in the City, and had increased the level from 20,000 sq m to 30,000 sq m as a result of representations. But it was not our intention to exempt the City from a floor space figure or to revisit the issue following our decision. We issued our decision only this week. After consultation, it is our view that 30,000 sq m is the correct figure. It is higher than for any other area for London. Central London will have a figure of 20,000 sq  m, and the figure for other areas of London is 15,000 sq m. So the City has a considerable advantage over other areas as a result of the decision that I announced at the beginning of the week. It is not our intention to revisit that decision. 
<P>
The right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst accused me of using unhappy language. He was talking about the words "cohesive and inclusive strategic vision". I would always rather have cohesive and inclusive strategic vision than a narrow-minded, parochial, elitist and incoherent approach. 
<P>
I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Could the Minister deal with three points that I raised earlier, but which he may inadvertently not have considered? First, does the written answer to the parliamentary question give an inclusive, totally conclusive list of those items which he considers a matter for the mayor? Secondly, does he feel that he has answered the Association of London Government's need for clarification on the definition of a strategic authority? Thirdly, I used the example of the conference centre. Why does the Minister think that an examination in public would be a better way to consider the impact of a conference centre on the local community than a local UDP inquiry? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Randall:</B> I have listened carefully to the arguments that have been advanced. We have heard about incinerators, conference centres and sports centres. On Tuesday, we heard that the Minister supported Northampton Town, whose nickname is "Cobblers". 
<P>
That brings me to the Minister's response. It is difficult to understand which developments will be regarded as strategic. I understand the examples that the Minister gave. However, how small can a proposal be if it is still to be considered? Subsection (6) states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"it is immaterial whether or not the matter affects the whole area of Greater London."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am not clear whether a development can affect only one borough and still be regarded as strategic, but that is not for want of trying. We are not attempting to extend the Committee sitting. We are genuinely concerned about such matters throughout London, but especially in the outer boroughs. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I will pick up the points that have been made. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, South asked about the criteria for mayoral intervention. We ought to consider that when we come to discuss later clauses, because it is entirely related to the mayor's powers to intervene in planning matters, not in the formulation of the SDS. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will bear with me on that. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked why a public examination would be better than a UDP public inquiry. The answer to that is simple. A conference centre, such as the one in the hon. Gentleman's example, might have a considerable impact on London as a whole. A public examination of the SDS would allow representations to be made on the interests of other parts of London. In a UDP local inquiry, the matter would purely concern the siting of the conference centre in a particular location. That would be consistent with the hon. Gentleman's amendment, if he is suggesting that it is better to adopt a parochial approach and not have a wider review of London's interests. However, I hope that Conservative Members will try to get out of the parochial approach into which, sadly, they have fallen. That fall has been all too evident in their easy exchanges on this part of the Bill, demonstrating that their only real interest is the boroughs having planning powers within their areas. 
<P>
London is a greater and more important city than a collection of 32 boroughs and the City. London as a whole must decide on matters that are important for the whole city. Should the hon. Gentleman reflect on those issues, he will see that it is right that we should think about the appropriate London location for venues such as conference centres, not whether it is right for boroughs to promote such venues within their boundaries. 
<P>
The hon. member for Uxbridge, in one of his happier pieces of research, discovered the nickname of my favourite football team. I am proud and delighted to support the Cobblers. However, I wish that their football was of a better standard. They have not played in the first division for more than 30 years. I hope that I will not have to wait as long to see them achieve such success again. 
<P>
That reveals my Achille's heel of-- 
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Backing losers. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The right hon. Gentleman tempts me. I may inquire about the footballing prowess of Bromley or Chislehurst. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Randall:</B> I must repeat that, as the Committee sat on Tuesday evening, Uxbridge football club was sadly beaten two nil by Bromley. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Given the prowess of the right hon. Gentleman's and the hon. Gentleman's respective football teams, I have reasonable hope that if they were in conflict with Northampton Town, the Cobblers would win on both occasions. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked whether a matter can affect only one borough and still be strategic, yes, of course it can. A development located in only one borough will inevitably have a far wider impact across London. The important point is that that should not have to be established by the mayor against the possibility of legal challenge: the mayor must be able to judge whether a major infrastructure development, even if it is located in only one borough, will impact on London generally and should be seen in a London-wide context. 
<P>
<H5>6 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Randall:</B> I understand the location. My point was whether it had an effect only on the borough. Subsection (6) states that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"it is immaterial whether or not the matters affect the whole area of Greater London."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That does not specify how large an area may be. I do not expect it to state how large an area it might affect, but might a development that some believe affected only one borough be regarded by the mayor as strategic for the whole of London? 
<P>
<B> Mr. Raynsford:</B> I understand that. If there is an element of doubt about it, and a challenge, the mayor's ability to act and operate in a strategic way could be severely compromised. A borough simply might not wish the mayor to take a view about a development that he thought was of strategic importance to London. Let us take, for example, the conference centre. Let us suppose that Croydon wanted the conference centre and Enfield wanted the centre but the mayor believed that the centre could not work to London's advantage if it was divided between two relatively modest centres and that the right decision was to have a larger, more extensive centre giving more facilities in one or other location or in a third location. It must surely be right for the mayor to reach that view rather than be constrained by the arguments of a borough. 
<P>
My other point is that development might affect a strategic policy such as the green belt, setting a precedent and undermining the mayor's general policy. Such an individual development could be built only in one borough but if it involved development on the London green belt it could have a far wider impact and would set a damaging precedent. That, again, is an example of a development in one borough that would have a wider impact but where developers could, and the borough might, argue that it should be allowed because it affected only one borough immediately. That would be an unhelpful precedent. 
<P>
I hope that we have now exhausted the issues. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Not yet. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I live in hope, but clearly my expectation is running ahead. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister--, I suspect intentionally,-- put a slant on the way in which I presented my case. We are proud to stand up to the London boroughs because we are the only party in Committee that is doing so. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Dowd </B>(Lord Commissioner to the Treasury): Well, a couple of them anyway. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Nevertheless, the essential point that I am pushing home is how best we handle these matters. The difficulty lies in there being no proper definition of the term "strategic". When I asked the Minister how an examination in public for compensation should be dealt with, he said that he thought that an EIP was the right way of doing it. 
<P>
Some public inquiries are extremely complex and technical. I am told that a public inquiry into the siting of an incinerator ran on for several weeks and in one instance a witness was cross-examined for more than a week by a QC. Is the Minister suggesting that an incinerator could properly be considered in an SDS examination in public? We genuinely think that the right approach is to start at local level and go up. 
<P>
The problem is, having rejected the bottom-up approach in earlier amendments, the Minister is having some trouble answering the point.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> No, I am not having difficulty answering. It is the hon. Gentleman who is having difficulty understanding. Of course a public examination can consider arguments for and against an incinerator. It would not necessarily want to get into technical arguments about the combustion properties of the incinerator, which would be a proper matter for a local inquiry. But as part of the wider view about whether incineration should play a role in the waste disposal strategy for London--for example, an incinerator's appropriate location in respect of waste supply and wider factors such as prevailing winds--such matters can properly be considered in the examination in public, of the SDS. 
<P>
The hon. Gentleman fails to understand that a local public inquiry into a local planning proposal is necessarily about local issues. The public examination about the SDS will look at Londonwide issues--what is proper for London as a whole; and London's interest as a whole. They are different processes. The EIP examines matters of strategic significance, whereas detailed consideration of an incinerator's impact on the local community would be dealt with at a local inquiry. The first stage--the EIP--would question the need for an incinerator at all, and, if there was a need, what factors should govern the planning approach to the siting of incinerators in London as a whole. That is the appropriate framework for the EIP, and is quite different from what would happen at the local inquiry. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I place a bet with the Minister that sometime in the next 15 years the amendment will succeed. Obviously it will not do so today, but I shall have great pleasure writing to the Minister to say, "I told you so." In the circumstances, we wish to press the amendment to a vote.

<P>
</FONT><B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move, 
<P>
Amendment No. 1083, page 115, line 4, leave out "for different cases or". 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: 
<P>
No. 1203, in page 115, line 5, at end add-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(9) The provision to which subsection (8) above relates includes in particular the manner in which the spatial development strategy applies to developments which are of different maximum heights above ground level.".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 1096, in page 119, leave out lines 25 and 26. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> This continues the argument from the previous group of amendments. 
<P>
Existing provisions allow the SDS to provide for different cases or different parts of London. The amendment would delete those revisions, thereby limiting the mayor's ability to make site or location-specific proposals. 
<P>
The strategy can include different provisions for different cases. That points towards consideration of individual sites which in our opinion is best left to the boroughs. If the mayor decides that Hackney should be the site of a new international conference centre, Hackney will be obliged to include it in its unitary development plan. If Hackney or local people consider that the local road system cannnot cope with a conference centre, they cannot challenge it in the UDP process or have it properly considered by a public inquiry. 
<P>
The examination in public process on the SDS is unsuited to considering technical matters such as the suitability of individual sites. It is worth noting that draft PPG 11 on regional planning provides that the RPG should not be site-specific in paragraph 3.8; therefore, there seems to be an inconsistency between the SDS and PPG 11, and I should be grateful for the Minister's explanation. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I obviously support my hon. Friend's amendment. I wish to speak to amendment No. 1203, which touches on a separate but similar matter to that in amendment No. 1202. 
<P>
Amendment No. 1203 emphasises the need for flexibility in relating strategic importance to the height of buildings in the City of London. A written answer to which I and other members of the Committee have already referred 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"recognises the City to be a special case and proposes that the height of 75  m should trigger consultation with the mayor."---[Official Report, 15 March 1999; Vol. 327, c. 472-4.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 On the basis that mayoral involvement should be confined to developments that are truly strategic in nature, it should be borne in mind that there are already 18 buildings in the square mile over 75 m in height. In deciding on the strategic impact of any given development, it is as relevant to consider where the development takes place, and the overall effect on the skyline as it is to consider the actual height. This is particularly true in the City. A blanket 75 m trigger height does not achieve this flexibility. 
<P>
In response to the earlier consultation document from the Government office for London, the City corporation held a meeting of interested parties, including many of the leading players on the City building development scene. The view that clearly emerged was the need to ensure that further layers in the planning process should be confined to those circumstances that really demand them. In that connection, 150 m was proposed as an appropriate trigger height for reference to the mayor. I believe that my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South tabled a subsequent amendment on that subject. By way of comparison, the NatWest tower is 185 m high. 
<P>
I hope that the Minister will take this opportunity to say that the height criterion for consultation with the mayor will be applied in a way that reflects the existing height of buildings in the City and will confine the requirement to cases that break new ground. 
<P>
I conclude my remarks by relating a brief coincidence. I spoke on the Skyline Bill in 1978, a private Member's Bill introduced, I suspect, by my hon. Friend the Member for South Staffordshire. I remember frequent references to Canaletto in his speech on the Bill. I recall the measure well, partly because I lunched with the Royal Academy the day before, and I still have in my possession a menu card on which Sir Hugh Casson, then president of the Royal Academy, did a drawing for me of the London skyline. My other reason for recalling it is that when I was about to speak in the debate on the Bill, the then Government Whip, the hon. Member for Enfield, Edmonton, now Lord Graham of Edmonton, sidled up to me on the Conservative Back Benches and drew my attention to the fact that we were thereafter going to be considering a Bill to be introduced by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Corbett) on the subject of the transport of animals and their welfare. The Government Whip said, in a manner that the Government Whip in this Committee will recognise, "Peter"--that is my name, Mr. Winterton--"Peter, if you care to make a speech of indefinite length, nobody on the Government side would prevent you from doing so." The coincidence to which I refer is that the Minister who replied to the debate was the then hon. Member for Greenwich, who said that the existing legislation was perfectly adequate to deal with the skyline issue. 
<P>
Perhaps I could also say something about the developments fronting the Thames. The Government's proposal for a height of 25 m as a trigger for consultation with the mayor is welcome. There is, however, a question about the way in which this requirement will be formally expressed. It is assumed that only developments immediately adjacent to the river frontage will be affected. It is, however, less easy to define the intention in legislative terms than to state it. It would be most helpful if the Minister could confirm that the intention is to apply the restriction only to buildings which are immediately adjacent to the river frontage. 
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> There are two matters that I should like to raise in the context of these amendments. They both may lead me to support the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Croydon, South. It depends very much on what the Minister says by way of answer. The first relates to the matter raised by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster, which is buildings along the Thames. For the whole of my time in the House of Commons I have regularly been involved in planning applications which have had more than local relevance and which have either been called in or prospectively called in and certainly debated in that context. Many have indeed been the subject of lengthy public inquiries. 
<P>
As presently drafted, will subsection (8) enable the Minister to allow the mayor to decide a policy separately for one site along the river which he or she might not apply to the rest? I want to give the most topical example--the site for the GLA building. We have had no comment on the announcement made by the Minister a couple of weeks ago. Not surprisingly, I welcome his choice of the London Bridge City site as the home of the GLA. 
<P>
Coincidentally this morning I was in Bloomsbury square. My revisiting of that site confirmed my view, on an entirely objective basis, that it would in no way have been as impressive or appropriate as a new building by Tower bridge, opposite the world heritage site of the Tower of London. I entirely welcome the Minister's announcement. It is a bold building. It will make a bold headquarters for the GLA and I am sure that we will come to rejoice in it as an addition to the London skyline. 
<P>
A planning application will shortly be made for that building, as there will be for the development of London Bridge City phase 3, which is the remaining undeveloped site on the south side of the Thames between Tower and London bridges. I would be interested to know, as a trailer to the main answer I seek, whether Ministers currently expect--

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Winterton. I think that this Committee, under your leadership, should go and see this site. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am fascinated by that request and also the reference to my leadership but I am afraid that this Standing Committee has no power to travel. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Either further to that point of order or not, Mr. Winterton, I am happy to arrange, outside Committee hours, an extramural visit both for the hon. Gentleman and others who wish to see either the design which is currently in Battersea, or the site in Southwark, which is less exciting at the moment. I will happily facilitate such an arrangement. 
<P>
In the past, all major developments along the river have been the subject of consideration for call-in by Ministers. Like the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey), I have been instrumental in having some applications called in. An application for a vulgar pastiche replica of this building that was proposed for the Southwark site was called in by the then Minister for Housing and Planning, William Waldegrave. We have benefited from that building not having been built. However, we then ended up with a proposal that looked like St. Mark's square in Venice, which struck me as rather inappropriate, too. Kuwaiti politics and investment policy having moved on and the land having been sold, that development did not take place either and we are now faced with the third big scheme that is the CIT proposal. 
<P>
I refer to the general policy that was adopted on a tripartisan basis by this and the previous Administration concerning important sites along the river that are of interest Londonwide and probably nationally. I am interested whether, for example, specific sites such as those opposite the Tower of London, which is a world-heritage site, will be subject to the present policy and not ring-fenced. The danger of ring-fencing is that it would allow a favour to be granted to a particular site for a particular reason that might not be in London's wider interests. 
<P>
An obvious example of such action is if the mayor was given permission to grant a particular favour to a site in connection with the GLA or an authority of the same party as the mayor. A consistent standard must apply that ddoes not allow a localised special favour to be granted. I should be grateful for the Minister's confirmation of that. Will he say whether the usual processes will be followed for the proposed building for the GLA? 
<P>
If the public want a speedy public inquiry, I do not understand why it cannot happen. I would far rather that the GLA building was the subject of an expedited public inquiry than looking as though it had been granted a special favour because it was to house the GLA. 
<P>
I turn now to the provision of social housing in inner London at costs that people can afford. Over the years, the hon. Member for Vauxhall, the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster, other hon. Members who represent inner-London constituencies and I have all been involved in such developments. Since I became a Member of Parliament, I have been associated with the campaign for the homeless in central London. It has done good work in ensuring that we do not lose out, because of land values, on the opportunity of consolidating communities on both sides of the river where the house prices are naturally higher. 
<P>
I am talking about communities in Pimlico in the constituency of the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster, about Soho and somewhere called Fitzrovia--although I have never seen a signpost for it--or those on the south side of the river in Vauxhall, Lambeth, in Waterloo, the old borough of Southwark, Blackfriars or Bermondsey. 
<P>
I am concerned about a spatial development policy or a development policy that allows us to apply special criteria to protect the interests of those who cannot afford market price housing, but who want shared ownership, rented or other housing in the area. If we allow usual market forces to apply, housing associations, for example, will invariably find it cheaper to build in my borough or somewhere further south in Peckham, Camberbell or Nunhead than they would by the river. Historic riverside communities would be told, "If you want improved or expanded housing, you will have to move". It is important that London's villages remain villages and that those who belong to those villages that just happen to be nearer the middle of London should have as much right as possible to a planning policy that facilitates strategies that are intrinsic to their development. 
<P>
The matter is extremely topical for a rather controversial reason that relates to my borough. The just about still Labour-controlled local authority--I say "just about still" because, for the first time in 33 years, only the mayor's casting vote keeps Labour in control--is consulting on a proposal to sell council housing stock near Tower bridge, and move people, because the land value would produce high asset returns that could be invested in housing stock elsewhere. I understand the logic of the proposal, but it poses a great and hugely troubling threat to people who live in those council properties. 
<P>
A similar, but slightly less dramatic, proposal has been made in relation to people who live in the Heygate estate--by any definition not the most beautiful estate in Britain--at the Elephant and Castle, itself probably not the most beautiful part of Britain, but home for many people who have always lived in that part of London and want to stay there. 
<P>
My question follows up on both interventions made from the Opposition Benches. Will the proposed new arrangements guarantee a consistent riverside strategy and a consistent strategy for responsibilities such as social housing provision--with social housing constituting a minimum of about 25 per cent. of all housing developments--defined not necessarily by borough, but by area? The GLC defined an inner London ring that was much smaller than the inner London boroughs that formed the late Inner London education authority and the London county council. Some of us believe that special planning policies should apply to the pressurised parts of inner London, where cost pressures are such that without such policies a huge distortion would result in developments such as housing. 
<P>
I hope that that can be guaranteed and that the Minister can give reassuring answers. I should be grateful for an answer that buildings such as the proposed new GLA building and the new CIT development on the London Bridge City site will be covered by a general strategy and will not be entitled to special favours, either now or in future. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> This debate has focused on amendments to subsection (8), which states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The spatial development strategy may make different provision for different cases or for different parts of Greater London."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that hon. Members appreciate the importance of the mayor being able to make different provision for different cases of development in the SDS, which would be explicitly prevented by amendment No. 1083. Let us consider an obvious hypothetical example. The mayor may want to promote areas around London's mainline train stations as a focus for activities relating to travel. Under the amendment that the hon. Member for Croydon, South proposes, the mayor would be unable to differentiate between terminuses outside which mainly office developments might be appropriate and terminuses outside which different developments, such as for shopping or leisure, might be more appropriate. 
<P>
The amendment would hamstring the mayor and prevent sensible policies from distinguishing between appropriate uses in different locations. I hope that the hon. Member for Croydon, South will not pursue it. 
<P>
Amendment No. 1203, tabled by the right hon. member for Cities of London and Westminster, is designed to widen the scope of the spatial development strategy. The right hon. Gentleman is mirroring anxieties in the City about height restrictions. The amendment is unnecessary because the existing wording, which refers to different cases or different parts of London, enables the mayor to do what the amendment intends. On Tuesday, I set out the provision for the City, using the height limit of 75 m, to which the right hon. Gentleman referred, as against other areas, where the limit is 30  m, and areas fronting the Thames, where the limit is 25 m. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman concedes that we have taken on board the concerns about the City and that his amendment is unnecessary. 
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
Subsection (2) allows the Secretary of State to make different provision in regulation for different parts of London--a power that amendment No. 1096, with which we strongly disagree, proposes to remove. We need the provision, for such eventualities as the Secretary of State needing to specify in regulation that the mayor should address, in the SDS, strategic aspects of a particular area, such as the Thames--a germane subject--where there is already special guidance in place; most hon. Members believe that special guidance should continue to exist. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, South questioned our intention to issue guidance on the interpretation of the powers under clause 236. We will issue guidance, and further guidance in secondary legislation, on the form and content of the SDS. I assure the hon. Gentleman that that will be consistent with the draft version of PPG 11, which was recently issued and which sets out our preliminary views. 
<P>
On the locational specificity of the SDS, the draft guidance says: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Whilst RPG should establish broad locations for specific types of development ... site specific proposals ... should be avoided in RPG given its strategic nature."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that that is helpful. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Will the Minister briefly elaborate on what discretion exists for that provision to be ignored? I understand generally where guidance fits into the planning system, but if someone were determined to ignore it and took a site opposite the Palace of Westminster or the Tower of London, for example, could that person claim a good reason for a site-specific exemption? If so, the drafting may not be tight enough.

<P>

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I have noted the hon. Gentleman's point and I shall return to it in a moment, but I can assure him that we do not envisage a framework that will permit the exemption that he fears for high buildings in inappropriate locations on the Thames. We are pursuing the approach of non-site specific provision relating to uses such as developments adjacent to rail terminuses. 
<P>
The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster asked whether developments fronting, or only on the river itself, would be covered. The precise definition has not yet been laid down, but our objective is to safeguard the Thames. It is widely felt that our river is a priceless asset that could be seriously compromised by insensitive development that makes it impossible for people to enjoy and use the wonderful resource that flows through our city. In some areas there has been such insensitive development, which has undoubtedly affected people's enjoyment of the Thames. It is our objective, as it was of the previous Government, to ensure that the Thames is safeguarded by appropriate planning policies. They will not prevent certain high buildings being constructed in certain specific locations, where appropriate, but they will avoid insensitive and inappropriate development, which would seriously damage the Thames and people's enjoyment of it. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey raised several issues. He specifically asked about the new headquarters building for the GLA. I appreciate his welcome for the choice of the Southwark site and indeed the inspired and exciting proposals from Sir Norman Foster. I have to say, however, that in order to ensure that proprieties are respected, it would be wrong for me to make any comment on that matter. Planning considerations will be dealt with entirely by Ministers who have played no role in the decision of the choice of building. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Deputy Prime Minister? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> To set the hon. Gentleman's mind at rest, the Deputy Prime Minister was involved in the decision about the choice of building and therefore neither he nor I will be involved in planning matters. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that that is appropriate. 
<P>
I am sorry that the Committee has no power to travel and so cannot take up the suggestion from the hon. Member for Solihull that we should inspect the marvellous site to see what it looks like now in order more greatly to appreciate Norman Foster's building when it transforms that particular site. 
<P>
Other issues raised by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey related to the strategic importance of the Thames and strategic planning guidance for it. I have already referred to our concerns to protect the river and I have nothing further to add. 
<P>
As far as affordable housing is concerned, it is important that policies respect the needs of people who cannot afford to pay the full cost of market-priced housing in central London locations. I know that the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend the Member for Vauxhall have supported campaigns for communities in areas such as Coin street to have the opportunity to live in a central London location and not be forced out by crude market forces. 
<P>
Those campaigns were immensely important and it is right that we continue to respect the wishes and concerns of communities to be able to afford housing in central locations. I have no doubt that the mayor, in furthering the SDS, will want to have regard to policies that ensure the provision of social housing in appropriate locations. 
<P>
The issues raised by the hon. Gentleman about particular matters in Southwark are very wide indeed of the particular amendments that we are debating. I clearly cannot comment on them without incurring your wrath, Mr. Winterton, for straying beyond the specific amendments. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey asked what would happen if the mayor insisted on pursuing a site-specific proposal that went beyond the scope of the Secretary of State's guidance. I should make it clear that in the last resort the Secretary of State has a reserve power to direct the mayor to amend the SDS. That is the safeguard that applies in that particular instance. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> On the last point, it is tempting to suggest that the reserve power might be a good thing, but I had better put that aside for a second. 
<P>
Can the Minister confirm what I understood to be implicit in his previous answer but one--that the normal construction of the words in clause 226(8) apply, so that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"different parts of Greater London"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
include localised areas much smaller than boroughs so that policies such as the campaign for homes in central London, taken over from the GLC, can be continued? Smaller areas than boroughs may be appropriate to a strategy proposed by the mayor. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I can confirm to the hon. Gentleman that the phrase 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"different parts of Greater London"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
does not have a specific limitation to areas the size of boroughs. So a central London location or a Thameside location could cover several boroughs. Conversely, some locations could be relatively small in perhaps one or two boroughs. I have given the example of those that surround railway termini. 
<P>
Such flexibility will enable the mayor to devise appropriate strategies for London. That is our objective, and I hope that the Opposition will support us in achieving it. I hope that the hon. Member for Croydon, South will withdraw the amendment. If he does not do so, I shall invite my hon. Friends to vote against it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for the tone in which he has responded. I diffidently remind him that he did not respond to one issue that I raised. I had hoped that he would say that the height criterion for consultation with the mayor would reflect the existing height of buildings in the City and that the requirement would be confined to those cases which break new ground. As I said, 18 buildings in the City already exceed 75  m, which will be the height of the bar in the high jump. Therefore, new buildings of 75 m might be built in areas where higher buildings already exist. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I hope that I can reassure the right hon. Gentleman. The criteria are designed to ensure that cases involving developments that exceed the limit are referred to the mayor, who will take a view. That does not mean that the mayor will necessarily direct that permission should be refused in any case or that the Secretary of State would be bound to support the mayor against the local planning authority. 
<P>
Criteria must be set, and it is generally thought that a height of 75  m is probably appropriate. I accept that many buildings in the City are above that height, but 75 m is a high building by any criteria. Criteria are necessary if proper judgments are to be reached about buildings that will have a significant impact on their environment. We believe that the 75  m criterion is appropriate, but that does not mean that the mayor will necessarily be bound by it. He might choose to develop new criteria in due course, but the 75 m criterion is the starting point. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying how draft PPG 11 will integrate with the SDS legislation. However, he suggested that there is a difference between site-specific cases and "different parts", which is the phrase used in the Bill. If that is so, I welcome it. However, there is still some way to go in merging the scope of the two if they are to be identical, as the Minister says. 
<P>
Our main complaint refers back to the previous group of amendments. The public examination process for the SDS is unsuitable for considering technical matters. A development plan inquiry can consider whether there is a national, regional or strategic need for a development; it is not simply confined to local issues. A development's strategic importance must be considered against its local and wider impacts. The UDP process can do that, but examination in public cannot. That is why I shall win my bet. Nevertheless, we have made our point and, therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. 
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 102, page 115, line 5, at end add-- 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(9) In preparing the spatial development strategy, the Mayor shall consult and have regard to the views of the London and the South East Reagional Planning Coference (SERPLAN).".
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>

<P>
The amendment would reintroduce something that will be lost when the LPAC is abolished under later clauses in the Bill. Under the Bill, the responsibility to have regard to the wider impact of its actions will be removed from the GLA. It will not need to be involved in planning matters that stretch beyond the boundaries of Greater London. That is why I have moved the amendment, which would ensure that the mayor in developing his SDS had regard to the views of SERPLAN. London's footprint undoubtedly extends well beyond its boundary. Therefore, the mayor must have regard to the views of those involved in planning who must live with the consequences of London's decisions, but have no direct influence on them. I hope that the Minister will be able to offer some means by which to take that into account. The mayor will have to exercise the same duties as LPAC in respect of spatial development matters that go wider than the region. 
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am afraid that I have to disappoint the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam. I appreciate the thinking behind amendment No. 102, but it would not be appropriate to create a formal requirement in primary legislation to consult SERPLAN, not least because SERPLAN is not a statutory body and there is no guarantee that it will continue to be the mechanism for consultation when the new arrangements under the Bill and for regional development agencies are in place. SERPLAN has performed a useful function but does not have a guaranteed continued existence. Alternative arrangements may emerge to ensure proper co-ordination between the mayor in London and the areas outside. We shall examine that in the context of the secondary legislation, to be drawn up under clause 236, setting out detailed provisions. 
<P>
In the meantime, the hon. Gentleman may be relieved and reassured to know that we have not lost sight of the need to take account of the broader regional dimension from the provision in clause 235 that requires the mayor to have regard to any broader regional planning guidance currently in force. That is the safeguard that the hon. Gentleman seeks. 
<P>
On the mayor's role in place of LPAC in carrying forward broader regional planning issues, I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to new clause 86, which we shall come to later. I hope, therefore, that he will agree to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am obliged to you, Mr. Winterton. 
<P>
Clause 227 deals with public participation and the point in the planning process at which the boroughs will be consulted--a subject to which reference was made this afternoon. The mayor will be required to consult the assembly and functional bodies on the first draft of the SDS, but consultation with the boroughs and representative bodies will take place only on the second draft. That will put the London boroughs on the same level as members of the public. The Minister shakes his head, but the boroughs will get their bite of the cherry at the same time as members of the public. 
<P>
The amendment would extend initial consultation to the London boroughs and representative bodies, and would require boroughs and interest groups to be consulted at an earlier stage. As it stands, the mayor will produce a draft, on which the assembly and the functional bodies may comment. The mayor will then produce a further draft, on which the London boroughs, interest groups and members of the public can comment. 
<P>
I know that the Minister is keen to help the ALG. The ALG wants boroughs to be consulted at an early stage and the amendment would meet that concern. Given that the first draft will be sent to the assembly, it is hardly likely to remain confidential; inevitably, it will become part of the public domain and will be commented on. In our view, consultation should be more open and it is therefore important that the boroughs and representative groups are involved in the process at an early stage. That would give the mayor a fuller understanding of views on strategic issues. The amendment reflects the Conservative party's concern for the little platoons and would also help the Minister to deliver on the Deputy Prime Minister's pledge that the SDS will be based on the borough's views. 
<P>
Amendment No. 1090 would allow the public, London boroughs and other bodies six weeks in which to comment on the draft SDS, which is the mimimum consultation period currently prescribed by regulation for development plans. The amendment would also prevent the Secretary of State or the mayor from forcing through a strategy. 
<P>
I should be grateful if the mayor would consider those points. [Hon. Members: "The mayor?"] I meant to say the Minister. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Perhaps that was an outing of someone's long-term aspirations--we shall have to wait and see. 
<P>
A number of amendments in the group deal with consultation issues and have been tabled by the Liberal Democrats. In drafting them, we have sought to avoid one of the usual objections to our amendments, which is that they consist of long lists. Instead, we have tabled amendments that would, in as non-prescriptive a manner as possible, establish the need for full public consultation, and for general obligations in respect of those bodies with whom the mayor will deem it appropriate to consult. For that reason, we hope that the amendments prove appropriate to the Bill. Given the uniqueness of the SDS, there should be the fullest possible public consultation on its development. 
<P>
The hon. Mem for Croydon, South referred to the little platoons. Over the past 18 years they have become considerably smaller as a consequence of a number of initiatives undertaken by the Conservative party when it was in Government, not least the ever-tighter planning framework that it imposed on local government, further constraining local authorities' ability to do the very things that Conservative Members have advocated in the Committee. Many members of planning committees will choke on the words of hon. Members today, if they ever get to read them, because they will find them so extraordinary and at such variance with the attitudes of Conservative Secretaries of State and Conservative Governments of the past 18 years. 
<P>
Nevertheless, as the Minister has also said, we are clearly in a period of repentance and revisionism, and what has in the past been the Conservative party's position appears no longer to be its position. It will be interesting to see whether that remains the case when we reach some of the later clauses, which I shall not stray on to now. 
<P>
The Conservative amendments in the group rightly address issues of consultation--a position that the Liberal Democrats have held consistently. Even if Conservative Members have come to it lately, we still believe that their amendments deserve support. We hope that the Government will accept that London boroughs and business representatives should be involved in spatial development plans at the earliest stage. 
<P>
If the Government publish the draft SDS and then consult the boroughs, the boroughs will have a new material consideration to take into account in determining planning applications, on which they will have no opportunity to comment prior to publication. While it might be appropriate for a Secretary of State to impose such a situation by issuing draft guidance, it is far less satisfactory for a new strategic tier of government in London to do so. Therefore, Ministers must give the matter further thought, to see whether we can avoid the draft SDS becoming an emerging policy, and thus a material consideration, before the boroughs have even had a chance to have a say about it. That is essential if this is to be the consensual process that everyone says it should be. For that reason I hope that the Minister will make some positive comments. 
<P>
The last amendment in the group, amendment No. 1114, deals with the withdrawal of an SDS. I dare say that the Minister will draw my attention to clause 228, which deals with withdrawal. A number of bodies need to be notified in the event of an SDS being withdrawn,  1383 1384 not only those that have to take planning decisions but others, whom we list in the amendment. Again, we hope that the Minister will have some regard for that and perhaps table an appropriate amendment to clause 228 in due course. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dowd:</B> Any observer of our proceedings this afternoon would take one of two views: either that Members have been painstaking and careful or tedious and lamentable. I hope that the act of generosity that I am  about to bestow on the Committee does not lead to constraint in our debates at a later date. Given hon. Members' various commitments this evening, I beg to move that the debate be now adjourned. 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I wish everyone a very peaceful, restful and pleasant weekend and I wish the Cobblers success on the playing field, as I do Macclesfield Town. 
<P>
Further consideration adjourned--[Mr. Dowd.]
