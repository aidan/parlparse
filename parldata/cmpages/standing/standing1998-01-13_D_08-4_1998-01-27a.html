<P>
On resuming 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I have listened carefully to the Minister and to the hon. Member for Basildon and was a little disappointed. I had thought that we were arriving at something of a consensus and that the Minister might be able to be more generous in his comments, but he has conceded nothing with respect to our contention that a range of motives brings people to employment in charitable organisations. He has told us that there is no reason for charities' employees not to benefit from what he sees as the protection of the Bill. The amendment was not intended to deprive genuine, full-time or full service charity employees of the Bill's protection. It was merely intended to give the Secretary of State the power to take account of the fact that some people are employed not only or primarily for money but for the sake of their good work in the organisation.
<P>
The Minister spoke of waiting to see what evidence is given to the Low Pay Commission. I detect a glimmer of hope there, but I fear that, as the Bill is now drafted, whatever the evidence to or recommendations by the Low Pay Commission, the Secretary of State will not have the discretion that she needs to implement the recommendations.
<P>
On the first sitting of the Committee, the Minister said:
"There is no purpose in having a Committee process if there is only a dialogue of the deaf." [Official Report Standing Committee D, 13 January 1998; c.22.]<P>

<P>
I had hoped that the amendment was modest enough to enable the Minister, if not to accept it, at least to acknowledge that it was well intentioned. As he has gone a little way towards acknowledging that the motives behind it bear consideration and has said that he will take account later of the points that have been raised, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> We revisit familiar territory in a new context with this clause. I accepted your advice, Mrs. Dunwoody, that a point that I made in debating clause 3 would be more properly made with respect to the short, terse, business-like clause that we are now considering. My point is about the linking and logical sequence of events in relation to clauses dealing with various exemptions.
<P>
It is clear, particularly from the notes on clauses to which the Minister of State has referred several times, that the Government want a universal national minimum wage. They are prepared, on advice from the Low Pay Commission, to countenance exceptions in respect of persons under the age of 26. They also prudently have at the back of their minds as we did in tabling amendments aimed at greater flexibility the possibility of extensions to whatever exemptions for under-26-year-olds will be made pursuant to the recommendations. One exemption singled out in the main explanatory note No. 2 to clause 4, relates to the possibility of a training rate for older workers. It is not promised, of course; there is no commitment to it. I do not intend to reopen the argument about whether there should be one, or to wheedle out of the Minister a commitment at this stage. I am putting forward a formal consideration. To put it crudely, has the Minister got the Bill right? It is not for me to cross swords with learned draftsmen. However, it seems odd: could it be done better or more efficiently?
<P>
My complaint, to which I have already referred, is that clause 4 appears to hang on clause 3, and to provide for a number of exceptions. It extends the scope of clause 3 by widening the number of relevant exceptions.
<P>
Clause 3(1) states that section 3 as clause 3 will become when the Bill is enacted applies to
"persons who have not attained the age of 26."<P>

<P>
We shall not reopen that debate now. However, clause 4(1) states that the Secretary of State intends to give herself the power by regulations to
"amend section 3 above by adding further descriptions of person to whom that section applies."<P>

<P>
What troubles me is that clause 3 deals solely with young persons. It is clear from the notes on clauses that it is already intended at least to consider the possibility of extensions that apply not solely to young persons, but to other classes of persons. Is it sensible to hang that potential power in respect of over 26 on a clause clause 3 that deals specifically with persons under 26?
<P>
Hypothetically, it could work as follows I hope that the Minister will reflect on my example, take his officials' advice and perhaps return to us if he is not wholly satisfied that he has got it right. There are many conceivable cases in which the Minister decides, after advice from the Low Pay Commission, that there should be a general training rate for persons undergoing a recognised course of study, whether they are adults or young persons.
<P>
In such a case, presumably to interpret the notes on clauses the Minister would lay down regulations which would have to be debated in both Houses, for amending section 3. Presumably, those regulations would have to say retrospectively that section 3 was originally intended to apply to young people, but that the Government no longer wanted it to apply exclusively to young people, or indeed to young people at all.
<P>
They would, therefore, introduce an amending set of regulations that re-write the primary legislation. They would not only re-write it in the sense of changing something, but would subvert the purpose of that section.

<P>
I do not know what view would be taken in this House about that. I think that we would raise an[Mr. Boswell]
eyebrow. I am, however, pretty certain that another place would metaphorically go bananas about it.
<P>
It is not merely a Henry VIII clause; it is a Henry VIII and off-with-his-head clause as well. The Government legislated on the basis that the clause dealt with under-26s a fair consideration. We accept their good faith in the proposals in clause 3, which has been extensively debated.
<P>
In clause 4, however the Government are effectively saying that it does not matter what was said in clause 3 and that they reserve the right to reopen it. Moreover, if they do not like its purposes because they are unduly narrow, they can change them. It is not a minor technical adjustment; it goes to the heart of the Government's aims in clause 3.
<P>
<H5>4 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Perhaps I can put it another way. I advise the Minister to prepare for the return perhaps not tonight, but in due course of a Conservative Government. That may not take place in the next couple of days, but it will inevitably happen. I cannot speak the leader of the Conservative party would not want me to in definite terms about any policy commitments that the Conservative party may have. It is wise for parties in opposition to adopt the general practice of not taking early positions from which they may later have to retreat. They must take account of the passage of events. The Government have already been embarrassed once or twice in Committee because of over-specific or inappropriate commitments on the national minimum wage that they have had to rescind. However, I shall not reopen those arguments.
<P>
The Minister may find this point uncomfortable, but let us suppose that I were the Minister in charge of the national minimum wage. If we take at face everything that the Government have said, it appears that they believe that our amendments, which were tabled with the benign intention of improving or clarifying the Bill, drive forward a hidden agenda. The Government think that we do not believe in the Bill, but want to wreck it.
<P>
If I were able to lay my own regulations in a future Conservative Government and were of the frame of mind that the current Government attribute to me, I could use the powers in section 4 of the Act, as it would be then. I may not go so far as to kibosh the Act entirely I suspect that that would be regarded as an abuse of power but I could introduce regulations that would largely take away the meat of it. I could lay regulations for persons under 50, or that put other constraints on age or on persons with particular characteristics. I am sure that I could devise a means of satisfying the lawyers and of substantially filleting this Government's concept of the Bill.
<P>
I have put forward a hypothesis that demonstrates the point I wish to make to the Minister. Ideally, one should not legislate in regulations that subvert primary legislation. To some extent, that is a lawyer's point and the type that is considered by, and excites and concerns, those in another place. Above all, one should not legislate by regulations under one section of an Act if that requires tearing up the specific purpose of the immediatley precedent and linked sections.
<P>
I do not object in principle to the Government taking additional powers to disapply the national minimum wage, a matter which we have already debated at length. However, will the Government reconsider at their leisure and without any commitment whether there could be two parallel provisions? One would cover the under-26s and the other would cover any other special case for which they would want to make a derogation. That is not unprecedented. Later, we shall consider voluntary workers, share fishermen and the armed forces. It is not inconceivable that such a exemption could be created. I shall not say that it would be utterly repugnant to suggest that it might not be provided by a regulation-making power if that were submitted to the House.
<P>
Ministers are leery of that approach because they are wedded to the concept of a universal minimum wage that has one major exception and one or two minor exceptions, to which I referred. They do not support a freestanding power to make derogations from the way in which the wage operates for people over the age of 26.
<P>
I do not want to debate substance again, but clause 4 is procedurally uncomfortable. It provides for widening the discretion of clause 3 without removing its essential purpose, which is to cover young people. However, if clause 4 changed that purpose, untidiness, an awkward constitutional position and potential for confusion would ensue. There is something slightly wrong or anomalous about the clause from a procedural point of view. At least, it looks wrong. I hope, with due humility, that the Minister will reconsider whether the provision achieves the Government's objective in the best, most elegant and least confusing way.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity to talk about clause 4 and to join my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry in considering its implications.
<P>
Clause 1 provides for a national minimum wage for workers at a single hourly rate. Clause 48(1) is a general, standard provision for varying the regulations that implement the measure according to different circumstances. However, clause 48(2) disapplies subsection (1)(a) to clause 1(3) because Ministers support a single hourly rate. Therefore, clause 48 cannot vary that concept.
<P>
Clauses 3 and 4 must be considered together, because clause 4 can amend clause 3. Clause 3's impact is twofold. First, the concept of the single hourly rate can be varied for those covered by clause 3, as amended by clause 4. Therefore, the clause offers a different route from that which is closed off by clause 48.
<P>
Secondly, clause 3 provides for excluding classes of persons. As I understand the measure and I am now reaching the end of my understanding clauses 3 and 4 qualify the circumstances in which people may be excluded from the national minimum wage.
<P>
If I am right about clauses 3 and 4, clause 48 could not be used to make regulations to exclude the classes of persons that clauses 3 and 4 preclude from exclusion. The clauses refer to regional variations, occupations and sectors of employment.
<P>
What would happen if we removed clause 4? There would be two consequences. First, it would not be possible to vary the rate of the national minimum wage for anyone other than those under the age of 26. That may be undesirable. Circumstances may arise in which we would wish to vary the rate for persons over the age of 26, for example, in the case of a training rate, which should apply to all those in training regardless of age.
<P>
Secondly, there are specific differences age is the principal one among the classes of person who can be excluded under clause 3 and who may not be excluded under clause 4. If we deleted clause 4, we would no longer be able to treat different-aged people differently, as in clause 3. Forgive me for repeating this, Mrs. Dunwoody, but I want to get it absolutely right so that we all understand what taking out clause 4 would do: we would be able under clause 3 no, we would not be able; I shall give way to my hon. Friend who can perhaps help me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for giving way. While he collects his thoughts, let me offer my interpretation. If we removed clause 4, there would be no power to extend the scope of clause 3 to classes of person other than those aged under 26.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Gladly. I am simply trying to be clear about the implications of what we are doing.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I can assist the hon. Gentleman by guaranteeing that we will not remove clause 4. On that basis, his problem does not exist. Clause 48 is a regulation-making power relating to any decision that the Secretary of State may make in relation to clause 3 or, in conjunction with clause 3, in relation to a decision made about clause 4. Thereafter, regulations will carry out the decisions made by the Secretary of State on those two clauses. The clauses do not exist in isolation. Clause 48 is the regulation-making power that will substantiate decisions taken by the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful to the Minister, and I think that I am with him on that. We must see clauses 3 and 4 in their relationship to clause 48. If we deleted clause 4, we would close one option to specify different rates and close off the other option to vary the power in relation to classes of person other than those aged under 26. That leaves the question of what, precisely, we are aiming to achieve in clause 4. If Ministers desire a training rate, it seems perfectly possible to delete clause 4 and do that by amendment under clause 48.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I want to make just one brief observation. Clause 4 provides the power for the Secretary of State to broaden the scope of clause 3, but that power is fettered by subsection (2) of clause 4. The provisions of that paragraph 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. With respect to the hon. Gentleman, we have sidled back towards clause 3, but even I am going to balk at going back to clause 2. We are debating clause 4 stand part. I know that it is difficult, but we must stick to what we are doing. Clause 4 is the one that, not surprisingly and not for the first time, is causing difficulties.
<P>
<H5>4.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg your pardon, Mrs. Dunwoody, if I have made myself unclear. I was referring to subsection (2) of clause 4.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I beg your pardon, Mr. Hammond. I thought you said clause 2.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg your pardon, Mrs. Dunwoody. It is 4.15 am. I was drawing attention to the restrictions that clause 4(2) imposes on the Secretary of State's discretion. Its effect will be to ensure that there is no discrimination in terms of "different areas", "different sectors of employment", "undertakings of different sizes", "different ages" or "different occupations". However, as it stands, it draws attention to classes of people who could be proscribed perhaps the disabled, trainees, or family members. I understand how the problem has arisen: the Secretary of State has discretion but it is unbalanced by the proscription of certain classes of discrimination as prescribed in subsection (2).
<P>
I particularly wish to draw attention to one class of person who could be proscribed family members. My hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham referred to them earlier to some derision from Labour Members. Yet there are pressing moral and practical reasons why family members might be a class of people whom the Secretary of State should consider proscribing under the powers given to her in the clause.
<P>
Many small businesses particularly in the retail sector and ethnic minority businesses depend heavily on the involvement of family members. To the extent that there is an employer-employee relationship, it is difficult to imagine the practicality of applying minimum wage legislation to close members of the same family. Indeed, the desirability of bringing the force of law into such family relationships is debatable.
<P>
I rose mainly to draw the Committee's attention to the distinction between classes of people who could and those who could not be dealt with under the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I hope that I shall be even briefer than my hon. Friend.
<P>
My concern about the clause is its fundamental illogicality, bias and prejudice. Subsection (1) attempts to give enabling powers to the Secretary of State to expand on and change the regulations in clause 3. Subsection (2) then provides a list, which attempts to draw back from generalised use of those regulations by the Secretary of State. However, the notes on clauses state that the most likely use of the Secretary of State's powers will relate to trainees of any age. It also states that the Low Pay Commission is already receiving representations along those lines, although it
"has not as yet formally been asked to do so"<P>

[Mr. Green]
<P>
as part of its terms of reference. Explicit in that statement is the fact that the Low Pay Commission will receive evidence that might alter the focus of the regulations and exemptions that the Secretary of State may make. Given the admission about trainees of any age and the Government's desire to introduce a reserved power to allow trainees to be exempted, it seems perverse to say that evidence given by any organisation on the raft of areas covered by subsection (2) is inadmissible. Either the Government are prepared to set out the option for the Secretary of State to use powers of exemption in accordance with evidence, or they are not.
<P>
The clause falls classically between two stools. In one grain of its drafting, the Government admit that evidence will be given which will make them want exemption powers, but the Bill's other, more dogmatic, grain means that the Government do not want to admit such evidence to the Bill. That gives us a dog's breakfast of a clause. It runs in one direction but ends up going in another. It symbolises many of the Bill's problems in that sense. It is one of the Bill's less convincing clauses and I urge the Government to reconsider it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> The hon. Member for Daventry asked if I were certain that the Bill was right. A great deal of care has gone into the Bill, both technically and philosophically. The Committee stage is intended to test whether we got it right. Without being arrogant, up to now, no amendment except my own which raised a general discussion of principle has undermined the Bill or shown it to be deficient in any way. The purpose of the clause is to give us flexibility on the recommendations that come from the Low Pay Commission.
<P>
There is nothing intrinsically wrong with that. Regulatory powers giving a Secretary of State power to deal with matters in the context of primary legislation is a well-worn path that Governments of all political persuasions have used. I remember dealing in the previous Parliament with the complex Bill that became the Jobseekers Act 1997. That was even more of a shell of a Bill than colleagues of the hon. Member for Daventry purport this one to be. Our enabling Bill gives the Secretary of State the capacity to take account of a range of issues and the legislative opportunities to do so.
<P>
The proposal is not unique. It has not just happened. It is not unknown in parliamentary procedures. I am satisfied that what we propose does not undermine parliamentary scrutiny here or in another place. Nor does it undermine the capacity of the House of Commons to reach logical conclusions about recommendations from the Low Pay Commission at a later date and to put forward regulatory proposals to implement our objectives.
<P>
The power is being introduced on a just-in-case basis in addition to the different treatment of young people. We are aware that the TUC and the CBI have raised training with the commission. If the commission recommends that trainees of all ages should be treated in a special way, the clause allows us to act on that if we choose to do so. Without clause 4, we will have prejudged the commission's report as the Bill would permit no further exemption. That would not seem reasonable or wise.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I suspect that the Minister of State and I should not be conducting an argument between lawyers. While I accept his good intentions and his wish to impart flexibility to the Bill, it seems to my lay eye that clause 3, at present, is keyed to persons under 26. If, for example, he wanted a universal power for trainees, I do not see how he could do that without retrospectively amending clause 3 to exclude any reference to persons under 26. Will he confirm that he would have to do that in regulations?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> No. This is not a difficult issue. Neither of us is a lawyer and neither of us needs to be. Clauses 3 and 4 are clear. There is synergy between them. Clause 3 sets out specifically the Secretary of State's capacity to take into account recommendations in regard to young trainees, as and where asked to do so. In addition, the title of the clause is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Exclusion of, and modifications for, certain classes of person".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 4 enables the Secretary of State to add to those persons, and clause 3 applies, so the measure brings about continuity and consistency. It also gives the Secretary of State power if she so chooses, to take account of the Low Pay Commission's recommendations, but it maintains the principal behind the Bill, which underlines simplicity and universality. Therefore, clause 4 should be included in the Bill, as it enables us to consider fairly any proposals that the Low Pay Commission puts forward at a later date.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am trying my humble best to understand what the Minister of State is saying. Am I right in believing that the inclusion of clause 4 enables the Secretary of State, by regulation, to bring persons into the provisions of clause 3 and thereby to vary the rate, as he describes? In the absence of clause 4, however, the Secretary of State could use clause 48 to make exclusions from the national minimum wage, for persons other than those below the age of 26,but not to influence the rate.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The clause enables the Secretary of State, if she wishes, to vary the classes of person who may be entitled to the minimum wage, but the primary legislation does not include a clause saying what the rate will be. That will be a proposal for secondary legislation. That is important. It is what happened under previous Governments in wages councils orders. It prevents us having to change the primary legislation every time a variance in the rate takes place for any reason. The clause relates to the classes of person who may not qualify for the minimum wage, not to a variation in the rate itself.
<P>
I ask my hon. Friends to support clause 4. If we can agree on that, we can go on to clause 5.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> This is our second visiting of the clause and it is an interesting point in the Bill, where we move into new territory. The Committee is now making good progress. [Laughter.] Members of the Committee will have noticed that no amendments have been tabled to the clause, and they may be interested to know why. It is because the clause does not need much amendment. I made one or two modest jottings for a contingency, in case we did not reach this stage. They would have slightly expanded the Low Pay Commission's scope by enabling it, for example, to make recommendations on matters ancillary to the five main matters set out in subsection (2). I was also interested in the idea of a double-headed report to the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State the President which is analogous to the school teachers' pay review body, for example. I shall not comment further on that wide-ranging issue.
<P>
It is interesting that the Chancellor of the Exchequer does not get his oar in at this point, because the commission's remit is to have regard to matters connected with the economy. It would be beyond belief to presume that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was not taking a lively interest in the proceedings and implausible to think that he was not putting his considerable weight behind those who would opt for a lower rather than higher minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> A hawk, not a dove.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Yes, as my hon. Friend says, a hawk not a dove. The Chancellor will not soar high with his version of the national minimum wage.
<P>
We are looking for a Government view; indeed we have been looking for a Government view throughout all seven sittings of the Committee. Presumably the Low Pay Commission has also been looking for a Government view, because, while I appreciate that correspondence has passed at official level, the commission's terms of reference are terse even terser than the clauses that we have just been discussing. They are jejune and therefore do not give much guidance. The Low Pay Commission has had to operate in the absence of a clear steer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend makes an interesting point in relation to the references to the Prime Minister as well as the Secretary of State, which are curious, to say the least, in omitting the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
<P>
However, is it not at least as curious, and perhaps more relevant, that in clause 5(4), the Secretary of State is to take decisions about making regulations without on the face of the Bill exercising that power in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer? If the Chancellor of the Exchequer were to be included, that might be the most apposite point at which to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point. Regulations are not usually tabled in the name of one Secretary of State only. The Chancellor of the Exchequer could therefore be a co-signatory to them. Indeed, it would be rather disturbing if he were not to be a co-signatory. Will the Minister give us the assurance that the Chancellor of the Exchequer will put his name on the final document?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Is my hon. Friend suggesting that if the Chancellor of the Exchequer were not a co-signatory that that might be because he was busily briefing against the regulations?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Perish the thought; I am sure that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would never stoop so low as to brief against views expressed by any of his colleagues. He would be much more likely to send one of his sidekicks to do it for him. However, I do not intend to import a note of controversy at this hour, even if I am tempted to do so.
<P>
However, I must slightly rib the Government about their establishment of the activity. The point is encapsulated in a later clause, to which we should properly reserve it. I am reminded of "Alice in Wonderland". The Government are establishing a non-statutory Low Pay Commission to do the job of a statutory Low Pay Commission, without allowing time for a statutory commission or to ensure that it reports before it becomes one unless it forgets to report, in which case it will be overlooked. It will then move to a new statutory basis. That is a rather crabwise procedure.
<P>
Moreover, that process is taking place even though the Low Pay Commission has no general evidence from Her Majesty's Government about what it is trying to do. It seems strange to proceed while the Bill is under consideration by a Committee that is half blind because it lacks that information. The commission's recommendations are to be witheld until assuming that we continue to make the excellent progress that we are now making the Bill is safely put to bed.
<P>
I am sure that the Minister could cite a battery of precedents. There have been occasional precedents when his predecessors established bodies ahead of legislation, usually because it has been necessary to carry out an elaborate planning exercise and to enlist staff to perform an executive function. Although I[Mr. Boswell]
would need to check the record, I believe that an example of such a body is the Meat Hygiene Service.
<P>
The Low Pay Commission is an advisory body, designed to give advice to the Secretary of State. That advice includes recommendations, which will be published. Any differences of view between the Secretary of State and the commission will be rehearsed in a memorandum explaining the nature of those differences and the reasons for her action.
<P>
That seems an odd way to proceed. It would have been far better to have set up a non-statutory commission and for the Secretary of State and the House to have heard its extensive evidence. That would have informed our consideration of the Bill. It would perhaps have taken slightly longer, but we would have had a much more straightforward consideration. Some of the difficulties that we now have to envisage on paper would have emerged from real evidence and from the deliberations of the commission sifting that evidence. The result would have been a more informed and authoritative conclusion and a better piece of legislation.
<P>
I want to raise one other point on the composition of the commission. In exchanges with the hon. Member for Wentworth, I said that I respected the fact that the commission has taken on its remit with a will. It has heard much evidence and made many visits. It is doing its level best. I am not here to ribbish its conclusions in advance. We need to read its report and see how it has reached its conclusions.
<P>
I have some concern, however, about the commission's composition. That will be raised when we discuss the schedule dealing with composition of the statutory commission that will take over from the current one. In particular, I am concerned that better representation should be built in for those with knowledge and experience preferably hands-on of small businesses. I ran one for several years, and there is no substitute for knowing how it all works.
<P>
When the Conservative's were last in Opposition, I indelibly remember acting as the secretary to a working group examining reform of VAT. To my surprise, while many members of that group were incredibly able tax practitioners who understood the concepts far better than I ever will, I was the chap who has actually had the experience of filling in my VAT 100 every month or quarter to reclaim tax, because of my trading pattern. Because I was reclaiming, I did not feel so bad, but I needed to know how the system worked. That knowledge informed my consideration of legislation.
<P>
The Minister for Small Firms seems to be perking up. I know that she has a strong interest in small business. She has also said that she is interested in compliance costs for business, and in particular for small business. I share that interest. I am concerned that no matter how well intentioned the commission is and she will point out that one member will represent small business it is not strong on small business, and not as strong as I feel it should be.
<P>
Our concern is not with the structure of the clause. One reason for that is that, unsurprisingly, the initial report comes first and we shall not reach the composition of the statutory commission and the meatier clauses until later. However, I am concerned about the workings of the reporting operation and how decisions will be taken. I also have some concern about how the commission will be composed.
<P>
There is no doubt that when the commission reports and I have the Minister of State's confirmation that, unlike one or two other things, that will happen on time at the end of May some of us will be very excited to find out what rate it will recommend. In order not to delay that process or to allow ourselves to be caricatured as rubbishing it I will conclude there.

<P>

<B>Mr. Green:</B> Three specific difficulties arise from the clause. The first is well illustrated in the notes on clauses, which state:
"The purpose of the clause is to ensure that the Low Pay Commission as an independent body is consulted".<P>

<P>
The Committee should raise its collective eyebrows at the suggestion that the commission is an independent body. I am sure that each of its members approaches his tasks conscientiously and with independence of mind, but the commission does not have any statutory basis and it is appointed by the Secretary of State, so it is stretching language to call it an independent body.
<P>
It is widely agreed that the first setting of the minimum wage will be the most important, not least because it is inconceivable that anyone would reduce it once it had been set. If it is set too high as a result of a recommendation from the Low Pay Commission, the mistake will be embedded for all time or at least until a future Government repeal the legislation. The first non-statutory Low Pay Commission should not simply be a quango that is appointed on the say-so of the Secretary of State; it should have a statutory basis and it is wrong to call it an independent body.
<P>
I share some of the concerns of my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry, but my worries about the commission's make-up range more widely. I agree with him that the absence of a small business practitioner is a severe weakness. The list of its members shows that it contains only one practising business person the director of human resources for the Granada Group, Gerry Robinson, who was a strong supporter of the Labour party at the previous election. I am sure that Labour Members will have noted a comment in footnote 12 on page 9 of the Library's research paper, about the commission's make-up. It states that the "Pay panel" that is, the Low Pay Commission 
"is dominated by labour economists".<P>

<P>
For the benefit of those Committee members who cannot see that footnote, I should point out that it refers to economists who study the labour market and not necessarily to economists who support the Labour party. I cannot comment on the political views of those economists, but there may be an accidental dual meaning.
<P>
The commission is a skewed and rather unrepresentative non-statutory body, but it has the most important task of any future statutory Low Pay Commission because it will set the first minimum wage. That rather contradicts commitments that the Minister gave when he was in opposition. He pledged that he would establish a Low Pay Commission on which employers, trade unions and independent members will sit. However, only one employer sits on the Low Pay Commission. The Minister has failed to live up to the commitment that he gave in September 1996.
<P>
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry, I am rather puzzled by the dual reporting system the commission's report will go to the Prime Minister and to the Secretary of State. I am not sure how many pay review reports are sent to more than one Minister. The notes on clauses refer to one the school teachers' pay review body but no attempt is made to explain why any body should report to the Prime Minister and to the Secretary of State. It is clearly unthinkable that any Prime Minister would not take a full and active role in discussing whether the Secretary of State should implement any of the recommendations that she received from the Low Pay Commission. The addition of the Prime Minister to those to whom the commission formally reports is rather unnecessary.
<P>
On the principal that good, well-drafted legislation does not contain unnecessary words, I should have thought that the Government might well consider simply having the body report to the Secretary of State. That would at least avoid the teasing that they have already had from my hon. Friend about why the Chancellor of the Exchequer appears to have been ostentatiously left out of the loop, when no doubt he will have strong views on the report and its economic consequences.
<P>
The third and most long lasting objection to the clause is that it sets up a system that is insufficiently transparent. We hear much about open Government, but in two respects the clause falls short of what is desirable. First, it says that if the Secretary of State departs from the Low Pay Commission's recommendation, she simply has to lay the report and her reasons before Parliament. In most, if not all such circumstances, it would surely be infinitely preferable for the relevant Select Committee to be invited to hold hearings with the commission and Ministers before any decision was reached. The expertise gathered in the House could thus have some serious input into the decision-making rather than a Government decision simply being laid before the House.
<P>
Although the obligation to put any reasons for not following the Low Pay Commission's recommendations before the House is laid on the Secretary of State, there is no time limit. In theory, the Low Pay Commission's recommendations could fester for months while the Whitehall battle continued and the Chancellor tried to get into the loop and the House would have no chance to discuss any of it. That is a serious weakness. If the Low Pay Commission is to be taken seriously, it must know that if it produces a report for the Secretary of State, some action will be taken within a specified time span. For those various reasons, the Committee should have serious reservations about the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I should like to refer to three points about the clause. The first, which was pointed out by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry and about which I intervened on him, concerns the references to the Prime Minister and the absence of references to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It would be sensible to make a few remarks about why that is significant. The fact of dual reporting without an explanation is something that the Minister might care to address. More significant, however, is the absence of references to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
<P>
The purpose of legislation is not normally to interfere in the process by which the Government reach a collective decision. It is normally a matter for the Government to determine who participates in a collective decision. In this case, an independent body will make recommendations upon which the Government are to act, and which transparently affect two principal Government Departments the Department of Trade and Industry regarding competitiveness and the Treasury regarding the impact on the economy of the United Kingdom. We have amply seen in previous debates how those two issues are at the heart of the debate about the work of the Low Pay Commission and its recommendations. It makes ample good sense to put into the Bill the matter of the Secretary of State making regulations on consultation with the Chancellor about precisely those two issues.
<P>
I would add one more thing 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that there is a standing order that refers to tedious repetition of other Members' speeches. I do not want to intervene unnecessarily, but the hon. Gentleman must not repeat the same points.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I shall go out of my way to avoid doing so, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am happy to hear that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I was coming to the point about regional variation. Even in the absence of regional variation, the proposition that the level of a single hourly rate should be the subject of additional consultation with the territorial Secretaries of State is a further rationale for the measure. Unusually, it moves into the territory of determining how the Secretary of State is to take a decision, and with whom he should consult.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree with me that consultation with the Secretaries of State for Scotland, for Northern Ireland and for Wales is even more important in the absence of a regional minimum wage rate? That is because it will be important for Ministers to satisfy themselves that the proposed level at which the rate is to be introduced will be acceptable in their part of the United Kingdom.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who completes my point.
<P>
The second issue that arises from clause 5 is the reference to first regulations. Ministers had an opportunity to simplify the drafting to make it clear that in all circumstances, when they are to make regulations under what will be section 1(3) or 1(4) or section 2 of the Act, they will do so by referring matters to the Low Pay Commission and acting on the basis of a report. Instead of taking that route and omitting the word "first" for regulations in clause 5(1), Ministers have chosen to[Mr. Lansley]
include an additional clause which offers them two options, which we shall discuss later.
<P>
The Committee should be most sceptical about clause 5, a principal deficiency of which is that it is confined to the making of regulations only in the first instance, rather than in each instance on which Ministers wish to make regulations in respect of matters covered in subsection (2).
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I wonder whether my hon. Friend is quite right on that point. It may be acceptable to have the one-off clause 5. There may be more anxiety about whether all matters are subsequently to be referred to the commission under clause 6.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend and I agree about the objective; it is the mechanism that is in question. It would be cleaner and simpler to put everything into clause 5 and make it clear that when matters are to be the subject of regulation, they will previously have been referred to the Low Pay Commission by the Secretary of State. I am not trying to draft a proposal while I am on my feet; clause 6 seems to be drafted expressly to give the Secretary of State an alternative option. The reference to "first" regulations is unduly restrictive and would be better included in clause 5.
<P>
My third point is about the making of reports. Subsection (4) sets out clearly the rage of circumstances in which the Secretary of State in not pursuing recommendations, in pursuing the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission only in part or in acting outside any recommendations made by the commission, should lay a report before the House.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am sorry to have to trespass again on my hon. Friend's generosity; I hope it is for the last time.
<P>
My hon Friend referred to first regulations a number of times, and I needed a moment or two to reflect on what he said. Is it not important for all of those regulations to be contemporary, otherwise, the drafting would not make it clear whether a regulation that bears on one section would automatically disapply that section thereafter, as the first-regulation test would have been fulfilled even if most of the regulations were to follow thereafter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> The Minister will want to answer that question, but my understanding of the clause is that once a regulation has been made on each of the five matters set aside in subsection (2), that position is, in effect, disapplied, and clause 6 takes over. That is why, in the notes on clauses, specific reference is made to the different treatment in language for regulations made in relation to clause 3, as amended by clause 4. The Low Pay Commission will recommend whether such regulations are to be made, which is why the language is different. The notes on clauses make it perfectly clear that the first use of regulations will disapply clause 5 and move on to clause 6. If the first use of regulations were to be omitted, it would be perfectly possible for clause 5 to apply in each case in which the Secretary of State wished to make regulations.
<P>
To avoid prolonging this debate I shall move on to my third and final point, which concerns the reports made on those occasions when the Secretary of State does not follow the advice of the Low Pay Commission. The Minister will know more than I do about the mechanisms by which the House can exercise its scrutiny. To simply lay the report before the House seems to me to be informing the House without being informed by it. To lay a report and to make provision for a debate I am ignorant of the mechanism by which the drafting of the legislation might make it a requirement that there should subsequently be a debate would seem entirely desirable. I do not know whether the Minister can comment on that.
<P>
The regulations would be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, and my understanding is that they would be published at the same time. It seems to me that there should be a passage of time between the laying of the report, when a statement is made of the Secretary of State's reasons for proceeding in a particular way, and the point at which, following debate, Ministers introduce regulations that are subject to affirmative resolution. As such procedures currently occur at the same time, and the House only has the opportunity to accept or reject the regulations, it seems to me that the House's opportunities to express a view on important matters that go to the heart of the Bill, such as the rate, are limited. Clause 5 does not therefore provide us with the assurances that we might seek.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I had five points to raise in relation to the clause but, in the light of your strictures about repetition, Mrs. Dunwoody, I have determined that two of those points have already been dealt with by my hon. Friends. If I am mistaken, and I stray into an area that has already been covered, I have no doubt that you will quickly bring me back to the straight and narrow. I shall attempt to make my points briefly.
<P>
As I understand it, the clause as drafted provides no mechanism for the Government to give any guidance to the Low Pay Commission as to their preferred outcome from the commission's deliberations. I do not suggest that the Government should be prescriptive, but the deliberations that the commission will have to make, especially in relation to clause 2, mean that it would have been helpful if clause 5 had proposed a mechanism for the government to outline the kinds of outcomes that they would like. Those outcomes could include equality between workers, fairness between workers and employers I could go on ad nauseam, Mrs. Dunwoody, but I will not. Clearly, there is potential within the clause to help the Low Pay Commission, and it would also help us if such a provision were included specifically in the Bill.
<P>
Secondly, it is not clear that the matters to be considered by the Low Pay Commission will be considered within the constraints placed on the Secretary of State's regulation-making powers. Clause 5 refers to the single hourly rate and the period or periods that should be prescribed, but does not make it clear that the Secretary of State is limited against discriminating in respect of different regions, areas or types of employment. To have made it clear that the commission was so constrained would have been helpful, particularly to smaller organisations that do not have the benefit of full-time parliamentary advice and that are making representations to the commission.
<P>
I understand that the commission has received at least some representations on matters with which the Secretary of State has no power to deal by way of legislation. One assumes that the commission will inform itself of the constraints on the Secretary of State, and, in the interests of transparency, it would be better if those constraints were evident in the Bill.
<P>
Finally, the clause should require the commission to report not only on the economic impact of its recommendations as a later clause provides for but to give specific assessments of the consequences for jobs and the impact on public finances.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I thought, naively, following the remarks of the hon. Member for Daventry, that we would not need much debate on this clause. To paraphrase him, he saw not much wrong with the clause as drafted.
<P>
Clause 5 requires the Secretary of State to consult the Low Pay Commission before the minimum wage is first set. As has been said before, that twin-track approach is fundamental to our policy of implementing a national minimum wage as quickly as possible following thorough consultation. Before making the first regulation, the Government are required to consult the commission on the rate, and the commission's report is intended to inform our decision.
<P>
In my trusting way, I did not expect the debate that we have had. I reckoned without the contribution of the hon. Member for Ashford who made some harsh remarks about the commission's independence. The fact that a body is appointed by Government does not mean that it cannot act independently. The membership of the commission is distinguished and to doubt its bona fides is regrettable. All the members were appointed in accordance with the Nolan provisions. Compared with the record of the previous Administration in public appointments, our record is absolutely scrupulous.
<P>
I also leap to the defence of bodies such as the CBI, which are represented on the Low Pay Commission. According to the hon. Member for Ashford, the CBI has no experience of business at all; it does not know anything about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I shall not give way to the hon. Gentleman. May account of his comments will make interesting listening for the CBI when I next have one of my regular meetings with it.
<P>
Of course the Low Pay Commission represents business and many of its members are well aware of the needs of business. That is why we have expressly asked it to look at the matter.
<P>
I thought that I detected a split in the Opposition ranks when the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said that the Government should give guidance: on the one hand they must be independent, but the Government must give guidance. As one of our magazines says, "Shurely shome mistake there". However, there has been guidance, and the hon. Member for Daventry has often quoted the lettter of Professor Bain, the chairman of the Low Pay Commission, from my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, in which she expressly spoke about that guidance.
<P>
The hon. Members for Ashford and for South Cambridgeshire referred to the part of the clause which discusses the possibility, however remote, that the Low Pay Commission will fail to make its report in the time allowed and then the Secretary of State will be free to proceed to make regulations. That is an unlikely event, but it is set out in the clause. The hon. Member said that one possible solution would be to refer the matter to the Select Committee, or to include a specific period of time in the Bill. Clearly they attach great importance to that idea 
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> No, I am not giving way. I note that not one amendment has been tabled to include such provisions. Those hon. Gentlemen obviously thought they were of sufficient importance 
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I do not believe that either my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford or I referred to subsection (5). I made no reference to the Low Pay Commission failing to make a report. I referred to subsection (4) rather than (5).
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I accept what the hon. Gentleman says. That was not the impression that was conveyed. I had the distinct impression, and I shall be interested to look at Hansard when it appears, that the hon. Member for Ashford was asking for a Select Committee hearing. But, I repeat, I notice that no amendments were tabled on that point.
<P>
Reference was also made to the fact that the report is made jointly to the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State. That reflects its importance and is in line with the existing arrangements for the teachers' pay review body, a body set up by the previous Administration in exactly the same way, because the Prime Minister appoints the members of that body just as he appoints the members of the Low Pay Commission.
<P>
I believe that I have dealt with the points that were raised.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> We have started on the business of considering the Low Pay Commission and it occurs to me, even at this late hour, that matters have been magically transformed between clauses 5 and 6. I was a little disappointed with the Minister's reply to clause 5, which I thought was unnecessarily rebarbative, particularly considering my seductive opening words. I shall have to be a bit rougher this time and see if that helps.
<P>
<H5>5.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Low Pay Commission, this chameleonic organisation, has suddenly, between clauses 5 and 6, transformed itself. At one point it is a non-statutory Low Pay Commission, as referred to in clause 5. When we come to clause 6, although it is called the same thing, it is a statutory Low Pay Commission, one which has not even been set up until later in the Bill, as indeed we will subsequently consider in schedule 1. But as the ever-helpful notes on clauses make clear, it refers to a time after the initial report and the laying of the initial regulations, matters that we have previously discussed.
<P>
At this point we come to a strange series of considerations, and I shall use this short debate to smoke out some of the Government's intentions. First, there is now, to use a phrase that we have used in the past, a twin-track approach to the making of subsequent regulations, because the Secretary of State explicitly has two options. She can take the consultation option, via the Low Pay Commission, prior to exercising any of the powers in question for example, to set a new rate or she can take what is disturbingly described as a non-consultation option. Knowing the way in which the Government conduct their consultation, the idea of a non-consultation option fills me with gloom. That provision, whatever it means, would proceed directly to the regulations.
<P>
I ask the Ministers to explain the different circumstances in which either of those routes would be chosen. I cannot imagine that the President of the Board of Trade will get up in the morning and, without recourse to professional advice, will simply spin a coin and say, "We'll go for the consultation option, because I'm feeling happy today" or "No, no, it's Mr. or Mrs. Hard Guy today. We'll go for the non-consultation option." Some principle must broadly, and I hope flexibly, inform the decision about which option to take. The Minister may respond, "It depends on how important the decision is." That may well be the case, but the criteria for choosing between the two options must be clarified.
<P>
The second question is about what the Low Pay Commission will do after its great initial effort. Will it be asked to do anything at all? The Government's intentions are unclear. How will they decide whether the regulations should be revised? What I might call in shorthand the politically sexy issue is the setting of a new national minimum wage, but will the Government reconsider the rate? How frequently will they do so? In what circumstances might they make an exceptional revisitation? If there were a sudden change in the exchange rate would they revisit the rate between, for example, annual rests? I am not aware of any commitment to a formal, annual revisitation of the rate.
<P>
We had exhaustive and exhausting discussions about the regulations' degree of flexibility, or otherwise. We have not seen them yet, and we have not received the Low Pay Commission's recommendations, which will inform the Secretary of State's decision when she draws up the regulations. Sooner or later we shall receive them and debate them, and there will be a need thereafter to amend them. What route are the Government likely to pursue, and under what time scale will amendments be considered? The decision about how rates will be changed is central. The CBI presented some interesting evidence on that matter and it is anxious for the work of the Low Pay Commission to continue after its initial effort. I do not entirely share its enthusiasm. It was also anxious for any recommendations not to be keyed into the annual payround. It felt that recommendations should come on a non-predictable I should not say random basis, which will prevent the bunching of pay settlements. Pay review bodies tend to report at this time of year, and one suspects that the Government will modify their findings to meet their other obligations. We discussed the teachers' pay review body in that context, but I must not go on about that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I understand the CBI's preference for erratic reconsiderations, but, if the Government of whatever complexion have full discretion there is a danger that the minimum wage will be subject to political pressure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I understand that it is an example of the practical problems that may arise. As sometimes happens in American politics, there may be a strong temptation for centre-left politicians if there are any now or even for centre-right politicians to say, three months before an election, "This is just the moment for a revision of the national minimum wage. There is not time to consult the Low Pay Commission and the Secretary of State will have to do it himself or herself and, bingo, here is the answer, and aren't we popular." But then the consequences will come home to roost. There is a real tension there. It would be useful to probe the Government's thinking on that point.
<P>
I want to close with one further point. In the absence of clear parameters within which the Government will continue to seek the Low Pay Commission's advice, it is not at all clear what the commission will do. From the financial memorandum, we know that it will cost between 500,000 and 1 million a year if it is a statutory commission that continues to operate until executed at dawn by some future Government. There is no requirement on any Government to take any notice of it at all. It may sit twiddling its thumbs, perhaps even reporting on something if it feels so inclined. It will be obliged to produce an annual report and accounts, but it need not actually be doing anything. That is the worst of all worlds.
<P>
The Under-Secretary and the Minister of State will not be surprised to hear me say that we do not need that. We should not have got into this game. However, assuming that the Government are seriously prepared to go through the rigmarole of setting up a non-statutory commission that will turn, like Cinder's coach, into a statutory version, it would be odd if the Government did not consult it on some basis I did not say "regular" basis. It would be useful if the Ministers could explain that basis to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for anticipating one of my points. It seems eminently sensible either to arrange regular reporting to the commission by the Government and vice versa, or to set out the principles that will determine when a reference is to be made to the commission, preferably in the Bill but certainly in the Minister's response; otherwise, the danger exists that the commission will be in limbo. It will be remunerated and will have staff and offices, but there will be uncertainty about what it is doing when the Government are not making a submission to it or requesting it to consider particular matters.
<P>
Clarification would be welcome and would rid us of the suspicion that the Government would, after a long time in which they made no particular request, make one when politically expedient. That would be undesirable and would appear unfairly to compromise the commission. That aspect of clause 6 is less than satisfactory and I hope that the Minister can offer some hope of improvement.
<P>
<H5>5.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The second unsatisfactory feature of the clause, as with clause 5, is the arrangement whereby only two Ministers will consider the commission's report. The clause refers to the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State. That is unsatisfactory for two reasons.
<P>
First, to require the material to be considered only by the Prime Minister and Secretary of State opens the possibility I put it no more strongly of a logjam. If three Ministers were involved, that possibility would not exist as there would be a determining voice. If there are only two Ministers, the possibility of no action and no conclusion exists. I am not suggesting that the Prime Minister and the President of the Board of Trade are at loggerheads on such matters, but that they might be must be conceded 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Not at the moment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> As my hon. Friend correctly points out from a sedentary position, they are not at the moment. That was a well-timed and pertinent observation if ever there was one. Even if they do not now disagree, they may at some stage in the future, or, as this body is presumably intended to remain extant for some time to come, a future Prime Minister and a future Secretary of State for Trade and Industry might be unable to overcome their innate differences on some matters. It would therefore be preferable for a third Minister to be involved.
<P>
I am anxious to avoid excessive repetition, as you, Mrs. Dunwoody have kindly advised, but it has been suggested that that third person be the Chancellor of the Exchequer. That makes obvious sense; he is one of the big hitters in the Government.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman mildly tries my patience; I know that that is unusual. When I said that I do not want tedious repetition, I meant that I do not want the same speech made by three people. If we could perhaps devote a little time to thinking of original ideas, it might speed things up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I assure you, Mrs. Dunwoody, that no one has ever made my speech for me, and that no one ever will.
<P>
I put an alternative proposition. I am if nothing else, forever a seeker of consensus as well as of truth. I want nothing better than to restore the good humour of the Chairman, and, where possible at this ghastly hour, that of members of the Committee.
<P>
If it is not thought appropriate to involve the Chancellor of the Exchequer, or if he is too busily occupied with other activities, there is an alternative. That is to have as the third person the Chief Secretary of the Treasury. I am surprised that that idea has not occurred to anyone else, and that it has apparently not been considered. Admittedly, the Chief Secretary is only the number two in the Treasury, but he is an extremely important figure in the Government. I am sure that the present Chief Secretary would welcome my reaffirmation of what he in any case knows to be true.
<P>
The involvement of the Chief Secretary would be appropriate because there are manifestly public expenditure implications in the decisions that the Government reach on such matters. That is to some extent true across the board vis-\ga-vis the national minimum wage, because the rate at which it is set will have implications for the whole economy, including benefit levels, changing entitlement to benefits and so on. However, certainly within the public sector, it is of paramount importance. No member of the Committee suggests that the effect of the introduction of a national minimum wage in the public sector will be to cut the public sector pay bill. Everyone acknowledges that its effect will be to increase it. Who better therefore to be a trustee guardian of the public finances in that context than the Chief Secretary to the Treasury?
<P>
I am therefore saddened that there is no reference to the Chief Secretary. I hope that the Minister will consider the appropriateness of his or for that matter, in the future it might be, her inclusion in that part of the clause that refers to the Prime Minister and to the President of the Board of Trade line 20 in clause 6. We should add the name either of the Chancellor of the Exchequer or of the Chief Secretary to the Treasury.
<P>
Finally, when the commission reports, following a request to consider matters by the Secretary of State, it would be helpful if the Bill stated that the commission would be required to provide an assessment of the impact of policies on different parts of the country, on different sectors of employment and on undertakings of different sizes.
<P>
Part of the Government's defence so far has been to say, "All of these matters are being taken account of quite adequately. We do not need to have differential rates because the rate will be sensitive to all of these[Mr. Bercow]
considerations." When the commission reports, surely a few paragraphs or pages should assess those considerations. They are of the greatest concern to Conservative Members and to both sides I regret even having to use that term of industry and commerce as well as many citizens across the country.
<P>
The simple truth is that the clause is grossly defective. My hon. Friends will make noble efforts to improve it and I am happy to assist in that process.

<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I think that this is our first opportunity to challenge the Minister's view of the function of the Low Pay Commission.
<P>
The Minister has spoken with passion about his belief in a national minimum wage. It is slightly odd that the Government appear to be slightly lukewarm about the Low Pay Commission, which is the very vehicle that, we are told, will deliver the policy to Parliament and the country. I press him to clarify the commission's role in the interregnum as the Bill goes through Parliament. Do the Government intend the commission to be statutory or is it to remain a non-statutory type of quango?
<P>
The Minister said early in our proceedings I paraphrase that all would become clear. Has the time arrived for all to be made clear about the commission's future? I press him to accept that the commission should be an independent body with powers under regulations to make decisions on the national minimum wage and its future.
<P>
The Minister any politician must be aware that changes of Government, power and political fortunes or misfortunes would make the national minimum wage a hostage to fortune unless the commission was independent and permanent. The different ends of the employment spectrum the TUC and the CBI want a permanent body to be established.
<P>
The Minister should clarify the Government's view of the commission's role in monitoring and regularly uprating a national minimum wage, if only to benefit from the unfortunate experience of the United States of America. There is no automatic uprating there, so the Government spend a great deal of time arguing, sometimes over several years, about bringing the national minimum wage up to current levels. We should not go down that route in our Parliament. If we are to have a national minimum wage, we should relate it to rising costs so that issue is removed from the day-to-day political to and fro.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I had five points to make, but you, Mrs. Dunwoody, will be pleased that one-and-a-half have been covered by my hon. Friends.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastleigh did not mention my first point, which deals with the inability of the Low Pay Commission to act on its own initiative. The clause makes it clear that the Secretary of State will refer matters to the commission from time to time and more or less at whim. I take the point made by the Minister in the partial reply to the previous debate: the members of the commission are good men and women and true and should be taken seriously. If she is serious in that, she should allow the commission to think for itself. If it is to be independent and representative of all sides of industry, it is not appropriate to box it in. Nor is it a way to attract high-calibre people to serve on the commission when it is set up as a statutory body. The clause prevents the commission from developing its own initiative and investigating matters. All bureaucracies expand, and the Low Pay Commission may investigate matters that are inconvenient. For example, it would damage a Labour Government if commission research showed that the minimum wage was adversely affecting employment and employability, but a Conservative Government would not be immune either.
<P>
For the commission to become a permanently valuable part of the landscape, Ministers must consider allowing it to act on its own initiative. Similarly, I am worried that the requirements partial and badly drafted though they be for the Secretary of State to report to Parliament when the commission's recommendations are neglected do not apply outside the five core matters specified in clause 5(2).
<P>
The clause allows the Low Pay Commission, when it is so instructed, to go beyond its five core activities. However, there is no process of parliamentary scrutiny if the Secretary of State chooses to ignore its recommendations. That is unsatisfactory and damaging both to the commission and Parliament.
<P>
There is some irony in the statement in the notes on clauses that other general matters that might be referred to the commission
"could include research and advice on the impact of the national minimum wage."<P>

<P>
That expert research and advice would be most valuable now, while the Committee is debating the Bill. It is bizarre to allow it only in the future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Would not my hon. Friend agree that making that research and advice available now as well as in the future would provide invaluable before and after comparisons?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Indeed so: advice would be valuable on all sorts of matters. The commission has received many contradictory submissions from the bodies involved 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> But not from the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> As my hon. Friend notes from a sedentary position, no submissions have yet been received from the Government. No doubt in the fullness of time the Ark Royal will be sighted and we will find out what the Government think about these matters.
<P>
If the Government put it in the Bill that advice and research by the Low Pay Commission will be valuable over the long term, there seems no reason for that advice and research not to be available now.
<P>
<H5>5.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
For those of us who have, as I have, worked in Whitehall and know that "Yes, Minister" was a documentary, not satire, it is wonderful to read the solemn statement that a non-consultation option is available to the Minister. Sir Humphrey could not have improved on that piece of drafting as a way of highlighting absurdities. The Government realised that there was a danger that a bit of decision making might fall outside the hands of Ministers or that they might be unduly influenced by objective evidence collected by the Low Pay Commission. Therefore, in extremis, the non-consultation option was written into the Bill. It is to the credit of whoever prepared and published the notes on clauses that something so starkly Sir Humphreyesque should be included.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Does my hon. Friend share my view that it seems odd, given that the Government say how important it is to rest upon the advice of the Low Pay Commission and how vital that advice is, that the clause provides a power to refer or decide potentially important matters specifically without taking such evidence or advice?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Indeed. There is an ambiguity at the heart of the Government's attitude to the Low Pay Commission. The hon. Member for Eastleigh has already commented on it. The Minister speaks passionately in favour of the minimum wage, and has done for years. But when the Government are confronted with the reality of having to set up a Low Pay Commission which might have some independence around the edges and might collect, publish andcomment on objective evidence, their ardour cools considerably. They start reaching for non-consultation options, shutting down the commission's ability to act on its own initiative and Parliament's ability to debate the recommendations outside the core recommendations of the Low Pay Commission.
<P>
The clause is unsatisfactory because the Government are, to an extent, willing the ends but not the means. They say that they would like to set up a minimum wage based on objective evidence prepared by a top-rate commission, but they are deeply unwilling to let that commission have the powers and responsibilities that would enable it to do the job which the Government say that they want it to do. As a result I recommend that the Committee votes against the clause. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> rose 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is now my intention to suspend the Committee until 6.30 am.
<P>
<H5>5.49 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended.
