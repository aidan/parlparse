<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000355"></a>The
Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform (Mr. Jim
Murphy):</b> We were in the middle of my response to the
comments made by Opposition Members. I started by referring to Sarah in
the case study in our paperwork and I shall continue from there.
</div><a name="061024100000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">For clarification,
the significant point in case study 1 is that Sarah&#146;s condition
gradually improved.</div>
<a name="061024100000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">I apologise for not greeting
you at the start, Mr. Amess. It is great to see you in your
place on this sunny afternoon, rather than bleak morning.</div>
<a name="061024100000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the avoidance of doubt, I
remind the Committee that someone is given access to the support group
because they have attained the 15 points required and met one of the 46
descriptors. Nevertheless, if that person sought to volunteer for
work-focused interviews or work-related activity or, indeed, to enter
the world of paid employment, if permitted of course, they would still
be treated as a member of the support group in terms of their
assessment. Only a medical assessment or a new personal capability
assessment can end a person&#146;s membership of the support group.
In such circumstances, no member of a support group would be punished
for undertaking work-focused interviews or work-related activity. It
would not be the volunteering itself that would take someone out
ofthe support group, but the new personal capability 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column191" />Column number: 192</div>assessment or, as in Sarah&#146;s case&#151;the case study is very
clear&#151;the changing nature of the condition. Some conditions
improve gradually over
time.</div><a name="061024100000016"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="061024100000356"></a><b class="B">Danny
Alexander</b> (Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey)
(LD): I am grateful to the Minister for that clarification. He
makes a very important point. Will he clarify what circumstances, in a
case such as Sarah&#146;s, or one in which someone has perhaps
engaged successfully in work-related activity, would trigger a new
personal capability
assessment?</div><a name="061024100000017"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000357"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> That is difficult because unlike Sheffield Dave,
case study Sarah is not a real person. However, a new personal
capability assessment could be requested primarily by a personal
adviser who might notice a change in the circumstances, for better or
worse. That would be the main means for requesting and carrying out a
new
PCA.</div><a name="061024100000018"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="061024100000358"></a><b class="B">Alison
Seabeck</b> (Plymouth, Devonport) (Lab): Following on from the
point made by the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and
Strathspey (Danny Alexander) about reassessment, would the new PCA need
to be triggered by the personal adviser or client, or could a carer
take an interest and perhaps prompt the adviser? Would that be an
acceptable
trigger?</div><a name="061024100000019"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000359"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Our preferred option would be through the personal
adviser. We have been clear about the opportunity for interaction
between a carer and an adviser. For example, from 2008, customers
seeking the employment and support allowance should be encouraged to
take an advocate with them where sanctions might be involved or they
have to prove good cause. There should be a close working relationship
between an advocate or a family member, and the customer and the
personal adviser. That sort of interaction could lead to the personal
adviser requesting a new
PCA.</div><a name="061024100000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I turn to
the points raised before
lunch?</div><a name="061024100000021"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="061024100000360"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jeremy Hunt</b> (South-West Surrey) (Con): I want to go back
to the point made by the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and
Strathspey about what triggers a PCA. Is the Minister aware that a
number of people think that a change in employment status can trigger
an assessment of a person&#146;s entitlement to the disability living
allowance? That is a serious matter because it is a disincentive to
people wanting to engage in employment. The Child Poverty Action Group
argues that anecdotal evidence indicates that moving into employment
can trigger a reassessment and removal of DLA, which can leave people
worse off if they access work. Is the Minister aware of those
concerns?</div><a name="061024100000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000361"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I have not had the opportunity to quote from the
pamphlet that the hon. Gentleman has in his possession, but he
acknowledges that it is anecdotal
evidence.</div><a name="061024100000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will
structure the new employment and support allowance entitlement
according to our policy intention and legal position. It is the
personal capability assessment, not an anecdote or pamphlet, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column192" />Column number: 193</div>that will determine whether someone is in the support group and attracts
the higher level of benefit, and we have discussed that in great
detail. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman and, through him,
the authors of the pamphlet.</div>
<a name="061024100000024"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000362"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> This is very important because it gets to the nub of
the question whether the structure of the benefits system is a big
disincentive to people engaging with the world of work and because
promoting such engagement is the point of the entire Bill. If the
Minister does not want anecdotal evidence, will he accept actual
evidence from Citizens Advice about voluntary work? Citizens Advice
says that</div> <a name="061024100000025"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;our evidence
shows that sometimes when people undertake voluntary work, it is
sometimes interpreted as indicating that they are capable of work and
therefore not entitled to
benefit.&#148;</div><a name="061024100000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am happy to
supply the Minister with the evidence from Citizens Advice, but is he
aware of those concerns and will he do anything to address
them?</div>
<a name="061024100000027"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000363"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> There is only one person in the Committee who
seems to be confused, and that is the hon. Gentleman, although I hope
that that is accidental. The fact is&#151;I cannot be any clearer
than this&#151;that the decision on whether a person will be in the
support group will be based on the evidence from a medical assessment
carried out by a medical expert. If they meet the 15 points, they are
entitled to ESA; if they meet one of the 46 descriptors, they are in
the support group&#151;it is as clear as that. We could not be any
clearer about the employment and support arrangements. Which part of
that does the hon. Gentleman not
understand?</div>
<a name="061024100000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000364"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I am grateful to the Minister, and I understand all
of what he said. However, that was not the point that I was discussing;
my point related to what triggers a PCA reassessment and to
people&#146;s concerns that it can be triggered by a change in
employment status. I have given the Minister anecdotal evidence from
the Child Poverty Action Group and Citizens Advice that the PCA can be
triggered by a change in employment status. If so, it is a major
disincentive to people engaging with the world of work.
</div><a name="061024100000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000365"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I can do no better than repeat the response that I
gave, although perhaps I can rearrange some of the words. It is the
personal capability assessment that will determine whether someone is
entitled to ESA and/or the support group, not a change in whether they
are volunteering or undertaking work-focused interviews or work-related
activity.</div> <a name="061024100000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman might want to make a wider point about DLA, which, like other
benefits, can be an in-work benefit, but we are talking about an
entirely different benefit entitlement with an entirely different
structure for an entirely different purpose. We have been very clear
about that, but if he feels that there is genuine concern and
confusion&#151;other than in his own mind, from time to
time&#151;about a lack of clarity as regards ESA, about entitlement
to the support group and about the fact that we will not punish anyone
who, for whatever reason, is determined to undertake work-focused
interviews or work-related activity when 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column193" />Column number: 194</div>we have not requested it as a condition of entitlement to benefit, I
will be happy to join him in finding ways to tackle the issue. As I
said, however, we have been very clear with all the disability
organisations and in the Bill, as well as in our briefings, draft
regulations, meetings, speeches and our comments on Second Reading and
in Committee. We have absolutely no intention of doing what the hon.
Gentleman&#151;quite fairly, I am sure&#151;is concerned
about.</div>
<a name="061024100000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000366"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying my
earlier point about what might trigger a new PCA. He made it clear that
engaging in work-related activity, or even potentially getting back
into work, does not, of itself, trigger a new PCA. He also made it
clear that incapacity benefit personal advisers will potentially be in
a position to trigger a new PCA. Will he therefore reassure the
Committee that the points that he has just made about the circumstances
that will or will not trigger a new PCA will be in the guidance to
those
advisers?</div><a name="061024100000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000367"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I am happy to respond to the hon. Gentleman, who
makes a reasonable request. As I said, the personal advisers will
trigger the PCA. I should add that Jobcentre Plus decision makers will
also have the power to request a new PCA. Through a carer or GP, the
customer could additionally request a review of the outcome in terms of
their entitlement to ESA or the support group.</div>
<a name="061024100000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, if the hon. Member
for South-West Surrey (Mr. Hunt) genuinely feels that there
is lack of clarity despite the clear way in which we are setting out
our position today, I shall be happy to hear from him, either in
writing or in some other way, how we can ensure that people outside the
Committee understand our position. The medical assessment will entitle
someone to ESA, not the fact that, for whatever reason, someone has
taken up or volunteered for work-focused interviews or work-related
activity. We are not taking in the Bill the power to do what the hon.
Gentleman, perhaps reasonably, is concerned about in terms of
conditionality and sanctioning. I hope that that is clear but if,
despite our efforts, there is still concern about ESA rather than
DLA&#151;they are different benefits for different purposes&#151;I
shall be happy to correspond or converse with
him.</div><a name="061024100000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where I think
there is lack of clarity&#151;we know this from constituency
cases&#151;is in the linking rules. There is a genuine lack of
understanding. We can see whyand there is a shared
responsibility for that. The Government could do more, as I am sure
could Members of Parliament in various ways. The voluntary sector could
also do more although it already does fantastic work&#151;Citizens
Advice does great things. Perhaps we could all do more together on the
linking rules. I am sure that private voluntary sector providers,
pathways and Jobcentre Plus could do more, but, importantly, Jobcentre
Plus will continue to carry out the first of the work-focused
interviews so that all the entitlements are spelled out at that stage.
That is part of the core script for what Jobcentre Plus will say to its
customers at the first work-focused
interview.</div><a name="061024100000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">Specifically
on money, the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey
consistently raises the issue for the right reasons
and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column194" />Column number: 195</div>to keep us on our toes to ensure that we maintain our commitment to our
funding model. I shall repeat what I have said on more than one
occasion. The question does not change, nor does the answer. I am not
suggesting that the question should change and he should accept that
the answer will not change. The roll-out of pathways has the same
funding model as the current pathways.</div>
<a name="061024100000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="061024100000368"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): I did not intervene earlier
because I missed some of the earlier exchanges and did not want to
rehearse them because of my absence. The Minister referred to
work-related interviews and indicated that there will be a formal
script to rehearse the benefits and conditions under which the benefits
are payable. My constituency experience and, I am sure, that of other
hon. Members is that there are many cases of the Department&#146;s
argument being not on the facts of the case but on what was or was not
alleged to have been said either on the telephone or at interview. In
the interests of clarity and an audit trail, can he give attention to
the need for personal advisers at work-focused interviews, particularly
the crucial first one, to establish clearly and in writing if necessary
some evidence of what is being said to customers so that there is not
an argument afterwards about whether they were told the particular
circumstances in which the benefit is
available?</div><a name="061024100000037"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000369"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> The hon. Gentleman characteristically makes a
reasonable point. It is captured by the power in clause 13, which
requires action plans to be a written record of the conversation at
work-focused interviews. That record will be agreed between the
customer and the adviser. However, in addition we intend to include
inaccurate information being provided by the adviser or Jobcentre Plus
under the good cause for not fulfilling conditionality. The hon.
Gentleman may want to reflect on the specifics of clause 13 and the
draft regulations, which we have provided. If he is not satisfied with
that, we could further debate the matter later. The point is a fair one
and the action plans are intended to be a written record of the
work-focused
interviews.</div><a name="061024100000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
specifics of funding, the hon. Members for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch
and Strathspey and for South-West Surrey asked whether it is enough.
The funding model will be the same, and the funding will be structured
to enable investment in people who wish to volunteer to go on to the
support available through pathways to work, even if no conditionality
is applied to them.</div>
<a name="061024100000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">All that I say to the hon.
Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey is that we have
set aside the &#163;360 million for the proposals on welfare reform.
He repeatedly asked whether it is enough, but what is his assessment of
any potential funding gap, and how much does he think it amounts to? I
shall happily give way to him if he has a specific figure. I say the
same to the hon. Member for South-West Surrey. Does he have a specific
figure for any funding gap in the pathways to work roll-out? I shall
happily give way to him if he thinks that additional investment is
needed.</div>

<a name="061024100000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000371"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Of course. First, for the record, the hon. Members
for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey and for South-West Surrey
earlier raised that issue for good reason, and I am trying to ascertain
whether they have made a scientific observation about a funding gap in
the roll-out of pathways to work. I gave both hon. Gentlemen the
opportunity to answer, but at the time, they were not ready. I shall
happily give way to the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds
(Mr. Ruffley) and then give the hon. Members for Inverness,
Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey and for South-West Surrey the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000372"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I am most grateful to the Minister. The
straightforward answer is that we have heard from the Government
neither about the number of existing claimants&#151;rather than new
claimants who will claim after 2008 under the new allowance&#151;who
will be able to take advantage of the new regime and all its resources,
nor about the number of people in the support component who might want
the high-end support and resource-intensive advice and backing if they
are to take advantage of the work-related activity component. How many
of them will volunteer? What are the estimates?</div>
<a name="061024100000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">If there is a headlong rush of
people migrating from the support component to the work-related
activity component, as we hope there will be, with all the
condition-management resourcing that will apply, will that investment
be enough? We have not heard enough from the Minister, because he
assumes that the employment and support allowance will be available for
new claimants only, and not for the other people whom I have just
listed.</div>
<a name="061024100000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000373"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Mr. Amess, that deserves the
awardfor the longest intervention thus far&#151;with your
indulgence, understandably. I shall give way to thehon. Member
for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey and then to the hon.
Member for South-West Surrey.</div>
<a name="061024100000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000374"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> We may wish to reflect on the issue during our
debates about later clauses, because it is important and it pertains to
the clauses on conditionality. I draw the Minister&#146;s attention
to estimates already published by various outside organisations, which
are based on written answers that he and the Under-Secretary have given
about the costs of pathways to work set against the amount of money
available and the likely numbers of people who will benefit. Some
assessments suggest that there will be a shortfall of some &#163;200
million to &#163;250 million when dealing with new claimants alone.
If the Minister is looking for estimates, there are plenty in
circulation. He says, &#147;It is the same funding model,&#148;
which is fair enough. However, it requires more explanation. How is it
calculated in terms of the numbers of on-flow? I could happily have
this debate for a good deal longer.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column196" />Column number: 197</div><a name="061024100000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000375"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I give way to the hon. Member for South-West
Surrey again.</div>
<a name="061024100000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000376"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> Like the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch
and Strathspey, I have received numerous representations from outside
organisations on the funding model. The Government must ensure that
their sums are right. Will the Minister assure us that the funding
model will be the same, and that the funding per person for the people
whom he expects to use the pathways to work programme will be the same,
too?</div>
<a name="061024100000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000377"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I have enjoyed listening to the three hon.
Gentlemen trying to avoid answering a question and avoid committing
themselves to an additional penny of funding. We have said
repeatedly&#151;on Second Reading and in various parliamentary
forums&#151;that based on all the evidence of pathways to work thus
far, we are absolutely satisfied that the necessary investment will be
in place through the &#163;360 million that we have set aside. If,
over time, there is a change in the profile of those people who come on
to ESA, we will have to consider what more we can do. All that I am
saying to Opposition Members, three of whom have made this point from
the Front Bench on behalf of their parties, is if they share the belief
that not enough funding is in place, what additional funding would they
commit to? They must answer that question not as Back Benchers raising
the concerns of other organisations, but on behalf of their parties.
They have positions of responsibility. I am trying to get a sense of
the additional funding that they would like to be put in
place.</div><a name="061024100000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000378"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> One of the Opposition&#146;s duties is to hold the
Government to account, so will the Minister answer my previous
question? I asked him not whether the funding model was the same, but
whether the funding per head of person who goes on to the pathways
programme is the same in the roll-out as it was under the
pilots.</div>
<a name="061024100000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000379"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> In the contracts with the private and voluntary
sector the same funding model will be used in terms of the individual.
We will ensure that the necessary investment is put in place. One of
the things that we look at is the creativity of the private and
voluntary sector. Can they do things differently and more effectively,
using their experience and their flexibilities? Are we prescriptive
about how much each and every instance and each and every outcome
should attract? No, we are not. That is one of the reasons why we are
involved in the private and voluntary sector in the way that we
are.</div><a name="061024100000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000380"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Perhaps I can bring a fresh angle to this little
discussion without reopening it and joining the Minister&#146;s list.
Our interest in this matter is, if the private sector is able to
deliver a more cost-effective model&#151;the Minister, fair-minded
man as he is, is prepared to consider that it might be so&#151;should
the profit thereby generated be fed into additional or improved
services or will it be pocketed by the contractor or the Minister and
the Department in terms of a reduced funding requirement? I think the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column197" />Column number: 198</div>Minister will understand from the exchanges in the Committee that
whatever the exact figure, there is a good deal of concern about the
ability to operate this scheme. From what I saw of pathways, they are a
resource-intensive activity&#151;I am sure that he would concede
that&#151;but we need to ensure that we get the best possible value
for money and that people, be they on one side or other of the
equation, are properly covered for their
requirements.</div><a name="061024100000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000381"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> That is another fair point, which I will come to
in a couple of
seconds.</div><a name="061024100000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">My general
concern on this matter&#151;I say this without seeking to incur your
wrath for being unnecessarily gentle with others, Mr.
Amess&#151;is that I do not enjoy listening to those who voted
against every penny of the new investment now saying that they do not
think it is enough. That is how I would put it gently. Others will
reflect on that and come to their own
judgment.</div><a name="061024100000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000382"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="061024100000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000383"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> No; I am going to make some
progress.</div><a name="061024100000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) is on to a fair point
about contracts. When, as many of us do, we sit down with the private
and voluntary sector providers they talk about their frustration about
the way in which in the past some contracts&#151;there is no need to
be specific today&#151;created perverse incentives. They achieved
their outcomes eight months in and there was no financial reward to
encourage them to continue with all their great work for the next four
months. Because of the type of people that they are, some continue to
provide services. In terms of contracts, it is important that we learn
that lesson.</div> <a name="061024100000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
also important that as we increasingly devolve some of our welfare
provision, we consider recycling the savings for further good work. Our
city strategy, which we announced in July, involves 15 pathfinders
across the United Kingdom. Two thirds of the people on benefit live in
our big cities. I do not say that it is not an issue outside cities,
but two thirds live in the cities so it is an additional challenge for
those cities to come up with solutions that suit their purposes. The
challenges in Glasgow are different from those in east London, which in
turn are different from those in Birmingham or Newcastle. We are saying
to the cities, &#147;You work with us. You design a solution to the
specific problems in your city. And let us see if we can&#146;t
further incentivise it.&#148; If a city makes savings and succeeds in
supporting people and giving them the chance to work, it should have
the chance to retain some of the savings rather than the Treasury and
ourselves seeking to claw it back. That is devolution and will ensure a
sense of continued momentum. It is important to put that principle into
the delivery on the
ground.</div><a name="061024100000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000384"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I think that every member of the Committee would
support the idea of recycling any savings into better support services.
For the purposes of clarity, will the Minister tell the Committee what
saving he expects to make in the roll-out of the pathways to work
programme by using private and voluntary sector providers, compared
with the cost of the pilot programme?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column198" />Column number: 199</div><a name="061024100000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000385"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> We will be happy to do that when we negotiate the
contracts. I do not think that it would be very helpful to do it in
advance. I do not believe that everybody in the country listens to all
the specific details of our conversations in Committee, but it would
not be a good negotiating strategy to announce today our attempted
savings through using the capacity of the private and voluntary
sectors.</div><a name="061024100000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000386"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="061024100000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000387"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I shall give way one more time, and then I shall
deal with the
amendment.</div><a name="061024100000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000388"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I am grateful to the Minister. I am sure that he
appreciates that part of the reason for these interventions is that
outside bodies are concerned about the financing of the roll-out of the
pathways to work programme. Can he confirm that he is not budgeting to
make a saving by using private and voluntary sector providers, although
if he can make one he will, and that as things stand the cost allocated
per head for those using the pathways programme will be the same in the
roll-out as on the pilot
programme?</div><a name="061024100000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000389"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I seek to be entirely direct with the hon.
Gentleman. The targets that we have set are not on funding, savings or
efficiency. They are on achieving a net reduction of 1 million in the
number of people on IB/ESA over a decade. We have not even set a target
for the number of people in the support group, and we are not going to
do so as it would create all sorts of unintended incentives in the
system. The point is not to assess how much we will save.</div>
<a name="061024100000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">We intend to use the private
and voluntary sectors because we admire their flexibility, expertise
and connections and the relationship of trust that they have in many
instances. With the best will in the world, the Government do not have
that, regardless of which party is in power. It is important for us to
plan for personal advisers to have a relationship of trust with people
and support them to get closer to the labour market. Having said that,
in carrying out a series of other important priority matters for us the
staff of Jobcentre Plus and the personal advisers working under the new
deal and other avenues have done a fantastic job, and are recognised
throughout the world as having done
so.</div><a name="061024100000065"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="061024100000390"></a><b class="B">Adam
Afriyie</b> (Windsor) (Con): I think that most Members of the
House welcome the Bill and the concept therein of the employment and
support allowance. Why does the Minister refuse to confirm that the
amount per person will be the same as in pathways to work, which
clearly had some
benefit?</div><a name="061024100000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000391"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> The hon. Member for South-West Surrey has already
asked that question. We are not going to set a target per head. It will
take as much as it takes to support someone to get closer to the labour
market, based on the complicated experiences of the individual. We do
not wish to have a public debate by saying that we intend to spend
whatever amount of money on each customer. Contracts will be
constructed around outcomes, but as a matter of public policy we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column199" />Column number: 200</div>will not say that somebody with one condition should attract a certain
amount of funding, someone with another a different amount and someone
with a combination of those conditions a third
amount.</div><a name="061024100000067"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="061024100000392"></a><b class="B">Natascha
Engel</b> (North-East Derbyshire) (Lab): The hon. Member for
Daventry will have seen the wide variety of support given in the
pathways to work area in Derbyshire. Even today there is not a fixed
amount per head for those who are being helped. That intervention is
intended to help Opposition
Members.</div><a name="061024100000327"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000393"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> My hon. Friend is right that there isan
average, but that is different, from a point of conception, from saying
how much. [<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span> &#147;What about the
average?&#148;] On the average, additional costs will be involved in
helping many people to get closer to the labour market, but I am not
going to hazard a guess today as to what they might be and I am not
going to set a target. As I have said repeatedly, it will take as much
as it takes to get someone closer to the labour market, based on their
various experiences and conditions.</div>
<a name="061024100000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000394"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b> I think this is fundamental to whether the
amendment would make a lot of sense, because if the funding is not
there, any amendments will be pretty much irrelevant anyway. To return
to the essential point, however, if an average amount per head is to be
paid under the pathways to work scheme across the country&#151;we
recognise that the scheme has brought a lot of benefits&#151;why is
the Minister unable to commit to achieving that average across the
country, or at least to ensuring that the funds per head will remain in
the ESA scheme? Does he not have a commitment from the Chancellor
perhaps?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000404"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way.
Before we conclude our discussion, I have a slightly different
question. I appreciate that the Minister does not want to give
averages, figures per head or all the things on which he has just been
scrutinised. However, he says that it will take as much funding as it
takes, so will he explain where the figure of &#163;360 million came
from in the first place? That figure has been attached to the funding
for this welfare reform project for a long time. Was it plucked out of
the air or based on some rational assessment of what might be
needed?</div>
<a name="061024100000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000405"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> The &#163;360 million set out in the welfare
reform Green Paper is an assessment of how much would be needed to
carry out the IT investment and to put in place the support, the
personal advisers, the work-focused interviews and the ESA. As I said,
we will not publicly set an average or a goal as regards how much
getting someone closer to the labour market is worth. If we did,
Opposition Members would, quite fairly, say, &#147;Why have you only
set this amount? Isn&#146;t it a disgrace that you have set a public
financial figure based on each and every individual?&#148;</div>
<a name="061024100000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want to stray into
your area of responsibilities, Mr. Amess, but I wonder
whether I could be encouraged to come close to a conversation about the
amendment before us, although perhaps I should first say a little more
about the outcomes in terms of cost per individual or averages. Despite
some disquiet in the room, we think that contracts that are not 100 per
cent. outcomes based, but a 70:30 mix, are the right approach and will
ensure that we do not have the quick-wins situation that was mentioned
before our lunch break. A mix of 70 per cent. outcomes and 30 per cent.
overheads and investment will enable people to access the welfare
provision market in a way that a 100 per cent. outcomes structure would
not.</div> <a name="061024100000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me turn to
the specifics of the amendment. As I said, we do not want to write
anyone off and we will pick up on the best experience of pathways as a
matter of public policy and delivery to ensure that that does not
happen. However, we recognise that it would be unreasonable to require
people with the most severe functional limitations to engage in
mandatory work-related activity. As we know, such people will be placed
in a support group and will not be required to take part in
work-focused interviews as a condition of receiving the full amount of
their employment and support allowance.</div>
<a name="061024100000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 11(1) provides that the
obligation to participate in work-focused interviews cannot apply to
customers who are in the support group. We are not labelling those
people as incapable, but as having limited capability for work-related
activity at this time. We expect that many of their conditions might
improve sufficiently to enable them to leave the support group at some
point. As I made clear in the Committee&#146;s second sitting, and as
the Secretary of State made clear on Second Reading, customers in the
support group will be able to volunteer at any time for any appropriate

<div class="Column"><a name="Column201" />Column number: 202</div>support on offer, including work-focused interviews with a specialist
personal adviser. Therefore, paragraph (a) of the amendment is
unnecessary.</div> <a name="061024100000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Support
group members are not caught by the provisions in clause 11, so their
benefit cannot be affected if they do not participate in any
work-related activity, provided that they continue to comply with
standard benefit rules such as those on permitted work. As there is no
risk of support group customers being sanctioned if they do not
participate in work-related activity, paragraphs (b) and (c) of the
amendment are unnecessary.</div>
<a name="061024100000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I do agree with the
entirely fair comments of the hon. Member for South-West Surrey about
the journey back to work being taken in small steps by many people. For
some, that will be about regaining confidence if it has been knocked,
undermined or lost. For others it will be about refreshing
skills&#151;people who were employed in traditional industries who
have been out of work for some time, for example, or people who worked
in the world of IT, in which, increasingly, a person&#146;s skills
can become stale if they have been out of work for just six months.
Volunteering and part-time work are also important steps along the
journey back to economic
activity.</div><a name="061024100000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000406"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for finally getting
around to addressing the substance of the amendment. I shall briefly
address the two points that he has raised, and ask him to respond.
First, he said that there is no need for paragraph (a) of the
amendment, which would stipulate in primary legislation that people in
the support group will be able to volunteer to take part in the
packages. He says that the Secretary of State has given assurances on
the Floor of the House, and that this issue is addressed in the notes
to the Bill, but nowhere in the Bill does it say that people in the
support group have the right to volunteer to take part in work-related
activity. Does not he think it important that that right should appear
somewhere in the
Bill?</div><a name="061024100000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister&#146;s second point was that sanctions would not apply to
people in the support group. We accept that that is as it should be,
but that is not really the purpose of paragraph (c) of the amendment.
It is to ensure that when the Department is arranging contracts with
providers to help people to get closer to the labour market, it is
accepted that for some people the objective should not be simply to
place them in a full-time job. Some people in the support group may
volunteer to participate in work-related activities, and for them, the
best outcome of the programme might well be part-time, voluntary or
community work, or education.</div>
<a name="061024100000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000407"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Importantly, we also have to ensure that the
contracts are right, and we have had discussions on this with private
and voluntary sector providers. First, we should try to ensure that as
far as possible work is sustained rather than short term. Secondly,
contracts should be structured to ensure that contractors do not
simply, as a matter of operation, support those who are already nearest
to the labour market, although I am sure that most of them do not wish
to do that. We will make those two important distinctions in our
contracts.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column202" />Column number: 203</div><a name="061024100000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000408"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for those
assurances. Will he at least acknowledge that if, without prejudice to
the level of resources that turnout to be necessary, there is
a tightening of the situation&#151;in the real world, this has
happened with all Governments at different times&#151;people in the
support group will wish to fall back on his pledge that they will not
be excluded and their support will not be
rationed?</div><a name="061024100000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
point is, in drawing up the structure of contracts for the private
contractors who will take on the additional part of this work, while
the Minister rightly expresses the need to have certain firm
conditions, will he also make it clear that the contractors have an
obligation to admit members of the support group to the services that
they offer without prejudice to whether or not they are on the support
group? They must offer the services to anyone within the allowance, not
simply to those who are in its employment or work-related

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000409"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Those are entirely fair points. The first of the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s two points is captured by clause 11(1)(b) on
the basis of any sanctions. If someone is in the support group, we
cannot impose anything on them on the basis of subsection (1)(b). That
is included in the
Bill.</div><a name="061024100000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000410"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I shall be brief, because I realise that the
Minister wants to make progress. With respect, that is not a sufficient
answer, because it simply says that such people will not lose the
benefit. We are talking about a situation where they might lose the
right to participate in the programme, which the Secretary of State has
promised
them.</div><a name="061024100000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000411"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> As the hon. Gentleman says, that is about the
sanctions on benefit. I shall make some progress and comment on how we
intend to ensure that the pathways-style support happens. He is also
right about the contracts for the private and voluntary sector: they
must be flexible enough to ensure that someone who is in the support
group and who volunteers can have access to the pathways-style support.
That would be done through the work-focused interviews, which will
largely be provided by the private and voluntary sectors. He is right
to raise that issue. We intend that it will be fed through into the
contracts.</div> <a name="061024100000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">As hon.
Members are aware&#151;this relates to the point raised by the hon.
Member for South-West Surrey, who may wish to reflect on this over
time, perhaps in advance of Report in the Commons&#151;the
entitlement to access pathways-style support is enabled through section
2 of the Employment and Training Act 1973. It gives the power to
provide such support, and talks
about</div><a name="061024100000095"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;assisting persons
to select, train for, obtain and retain employment suitable for their
ages and
capacities&#148;.</div><a name="061024100000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is the primary legislative source of the type of support that we are
talking about. I understand that it was the source of the
conditionality support through the new deal for disabled people, and is
relied on in the extension of support in other benefit regimes and in
some of the jobseeker&#146;s allowance new
deals.</div><a name="061024100000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Gentleman knows, the Bill is about setting out new powers to impose
conditionality upon 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column203" />Column number: 204</div>those for whom we think it is appropriate. The volunteering would be
covered by the powers in section 2 of the 1973 Act. As he also knows,
we are currently providing support through pathways to work for those
who volunteer, even for those who are in the exempt category. That
process will be carried over to ESA for the support group. He might
want to reflect on specifics and the powers in the 1973 Act, but we
derive the power to provide the support that we refer to as pathways
roll-out from it.</div>
<a name="061024100000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000412"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I would indeed like to reflect on the last point
that the Minister made. I am still concerned that there is no primary
legislative right for people in the support group to apply for the
package of support offered under the work-related activity programme. I
am grateful to him for responding at some length both to the points
that I made in my speech and to the interventions that were made. I am
still very concerned that the Minister and the Government have not
appreciated the full purpose of my amendment, which is to ensure that
the end point of any programme offered is the possibility of steps
towards full-time employment, and not just full-time employment
itself.</div> <a name="061024100000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
concerned that the programmes, as currently designed in the pathways
pilots, will tend to favour those on the work-related activity
programme, for which people in the support element can volunteer,
should they so choose, but that the programmes might not necessarily be
designed for them. That is the substance of my concern. Will the
Minister respond to that? If he does not, I am afraid that I shall
press the amendment to a
vote.</div><a name="061024100000328"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000413"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I shall respond briefly to that point and to some
others.</div> <a name="061024100000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Based on the
tone in which the hon. Gentleman moved his amendment, I am not
surprised that it might end with a Division. I am not sure that there
is much that I can do or say to reassure him, given the way in which he
introduced the amendment.</div>
<a name="061024100000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have an additional concern
about the way in which the amendment is

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000414"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000415"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000417"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> As someone says from a sedentary position, that
has nothing to do with the fire
alarm.</div><a name="061024100000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">New subsection
(5)(a) of the amendment suggests that the Government
should</div><a name="061024100000312"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;ensure a full
programme of work focused interviews is offered to those in the support
group who indicate a desire to take part in these aspects of the
programme.&#148;</div><a name="061024100000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Based on
what he said at the outset, I suspect that the hon. Member for
South-West Surrey will push the amendment to a vote, and I understand
why he wishes 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column204" />Column number: 205</div>to do so. However, I do not think that the Government should be
compelled to provide full work-focused interview support to everyone in
the support group who wants it regardless of circumstance. As the
Government and also progressives, that is not where we want to
be.</div> <a name="061024100000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are talking
about folk with often serious and fluctuating mental health conditions
and the Government being responsible, under primary legislation, for
the provision of work-focused interviews and work-related activity for
everyone, regardless of their condition and of whether that interview
might be bad for their health, counterproductive to their condition or
add to the pressure that they are under.</div>
<a name="061024100000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000418"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="061024100000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000419"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> One moment; this is a serious
point.</div><a name="061024100000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the hon.
Member for South-West Surrey seriously wants that to be a matter of
public policy enshrined in primary legislation, I disagree with him
very strongly.</div> <a name="061024100000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
know from the draft regulations that automatic access to the support
group is for those with a terminal illness. We have talked about that
already. But it is there also for those who it is assessed on medical
grounds might harm others, including Jobcentre Plus staff and personal
advisers. If the hon. Gentleman seriously wishes that to be public
policy, to enshrine it in primary legislation and to ensure that the
Government have that absolute legal responsibility to everyone,
regardless of their circumstances, condition and health, as well as the
possible impact on those working with them and providing that support,
frankly, I think that he is doing a disservice to many of his other
comments in Committee thus far.</div>
<a name="061024100000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not think that that is
what the hon. Gentleman intends, but it is what his amendment would
achieve. It undermines many of his well considered comments. On that
basis, I encourage him to reflect on whether he wants to put such a
provision in primary legislation as part of a supportive mechanism to
get people back into the labour market. I do not think that that is
what he intended. It is up to him to articulate that if that is indeed
what he wants as a matter of public
policy.</div><a name="061024100000115"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000420"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> Before we conclude and before external events
intervene, let me deal with the Minister&#146;s two final
points.</div><a name="061024100000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, let me
be absolutely clear that my amendment simply seeks to ensure that
legislation reflects what the Secretary of State promised on the Floor
of the House. That is all we are trying to do. We want to ensure that
the Government are true to their word. I know that they want that and I
have absolutely no doubt about their good intentions in that respect,
but we want to ensure that the Bill commits them to doing what they say
they want to do and nothing
more.</div><a name="061024100000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point that
the Minister made about the amendment having the effect of requiring
the Government to offer work-related activity to people who could be a
danger to others is a good one, but that does not affect my support for
it because I can simply table further amendments to ensure that it does
not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column205" />Column number: 206</div>apply to those individuals. We are trying to ensure that the Bill
reflects the commitments and promises that the Government made on a
number of
occasions.</div><a name="061024100000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister&#146;s second point is important and questioned whether we
want a Bill that assumes that everyone, no matter what their
disability, would want to move in the direction of work-related
activity. I stress that the amendment would cover only those who
volunteer to go in that direction. That is all we are seeking to do. We
want to ensure that the important structure that the Government are
putting in place in the Bill, which we welcome, gives as much hope to
people who are further away from the labour market as to those who are
nearer to it because we have real concerns that the existing structure
might unintentionally disadvantage that
group.</div><a name="061024100000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that basis,
I shall press the amendment to a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000434"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before we come to an expected debate on clause 9
stand part, I remind the Committee that we seem to have had an
extremely wide-ranging debate on amendment No. 227 and I hope that hon.
Members will bear that in
mind.</div><a name="061024100000138"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
proposed,</i><i class="I"> That the clause stand part of the
Bill.</i></div><a name="061024100000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000435"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I am most grateful to you, Mr.
Amess.</div><a name="061024100000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
may not have agreed with the conclusion of the previous debate, but I
congratulate Labour Members, as well as Opposition Members, on a lively
and constructive debate. We shall return to it
later.</div><a name="061024100000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have only
two questions; it will be a short stand part debate. I seek clarity
about an issue that is not dealt with under the clause but which has
been spoken of and which was prefigured in the Green Paper. It is the
ad hoc review of existing claimants under the new regime. My remarks
could have been made equally well under clause 8. The principle is the
same.</div> <a name="061024100000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new PCA
applies only to claimants of the new ESA. The Green Paper said that,
for existing claimants of incapacity benefit, the Department was
planning to complement its existing case review of existing stock with
ad hoc case checks by a dedicated new team. The Green Paper
stated:</div><a name="061024100000313"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where
these checks produce doubt about the nature or extent of an
individual's incapacity, a fresh PCA will be
required.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column206" />Column number: 207</div><a name="061024100000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">That would be a new assessment, should
this part of the Bill become law. However, Mind said in evidence to the
Select Committee report on pathways published this spring that such ad
hoc reviews might induce fear and uncertainty among existing claimants;
and that they might be unnecessary, as eligibility for benefit was
already reviewed regularly.</div>
<a name="061024100000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">My questions are these. First,
what are the intentions of the Department as regards doing ad hoc
reviews of existing claimants? Secondly, will the Minister
tellus about the processes that govern case reviews,
particularly the criteria to be used for selecting those existing
claimants who will be the subject of ad hoc checks? It is a small,
granular detail, but the theme for many of my hon. Friends and for
Labour Members is that existing claimants should not have their
interests overlooked. I know that the Minister would not want to
overlook existing claimants&#146; rights, but although the issue was
flagged up in the Green Paper, it did not make its way into the Bill.
It would be useful to hear his
thoughts.</div><a name="061024100000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000436"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I, too, will be brief because, although it was
a little ill-tempered at times, in our previous debate we managed to
bring out several important points. It was a useful
discussion.</div> <a name="061024100000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish
to raise a couple of points in addition to those raised by the hon.
Member for Bury St. Edmunds. First, I would welcome a little more
clarification on the process by which people can move from the
work-related activity component into the support component. I seek
clarification on how and when it might take place, particularly for
those who have a condition that might fluctuate, or whose ability to
undertake work-related activities might be affected by other factors
such as caring responsibilities&#151;a problem that has been
mentioned by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee.</div>
<a name="061024100000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, I would be
interested to know a little more about the way in which the 46
descriptors were arrived at. I have received representations from
organisations speaking for those with severe mental illness who say
that they were not consulted as much on their limited capability for
work-related activity assessment as they were
consulted&#151;thoroughly&#151;on their limited capability for
work. Will the Minister clarify the Government&#146;s intentions on
one or two specific categories, and whether he envisages them
automatically being involved in the support component? For instance,
questions have been raised about people who are sectioned under the
Mental Health Act 1983, whether in hospital or in the community, under
guardianship orders or under the proposed new supervised community
treatment. Does he envisage that those people would automatically be in
the support group? Would they have to go through the assessment? How
would they be
treated?</div><a name="061024100000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has been
put to me that people who are so ill that they have to be treated
without their consent for their own safety are not in a position to
undertake work-related activity. For example, people subject to
residential orders will not be able to leave hospital. There are a
number of points on which the Minister could usefully flesh out the
Government&#146;s
position.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000437"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> The House of Commons never fails to surprise me.
In 10 years here, that is the first time I have known an amendment to
be moved in Committee after those who tabled it had said that they did
not support it in full, and all in the middle of a fire alarm. That was
a novel experience.</div><a name="061024100000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall pick up the points that have been raised.
<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i></div><a name="061024100000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000438"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> The fire alarm sounds only when the Minister
speaks.</div><a name="061024100000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000439"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> That is because I speak so
much.</div><a name="061024100000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">With your
indulgence, Mr. Amess, we had a wide-ranging debate on a
narrow amendment, so I shall be brief. On the point made by the hon.
Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, someone in the
work-related activity group could move into the support group if they
or their personal adviser or carer requested a revised PCA. Within that
issue is the matter of how we should support people with degenerative
disease, and in my experience there will come a point where such people
will be assessed as suitable for the support group. Whether somebody
would remain in the support group if they were assessed before being
sectioned under the Mental Health Act will depend to begin with on what
the medical expert said in the initial PCA. When they are sectioned, a
carer, personal adviser or anyone else involved in the process will be
able to request a new PCA. Conditionality, such as work-focused
interviews and work-related activity, would be suspended. That would
clearly be well within the boundary of good cause. We have set out in
the draft regulations and the notes for the Committee where we intend
to set the bar for good cause, and being sectioned under the Mental
Health Act is way beyond what we anticipate to be good
cause.</div><a name="061024100000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">I add
parenthetically&#151;I move from gently to
parenthetically&#151;that if Opposition Members had been successful
and amendment No. 227 had been accepted we would have had a legal
responsibility to undertake work-focused interviews and provide
work-related activity if a person sectioned under the Mental Health Act
had wanted them and volunteered for them. I add my sense of relief that
the Committee, in its wisdom, did not support that
amendment.</div><a name="061024100000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000440"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b> Would the Minister have supported the amendment
had that exclusion been
made?</div><a name="061024100000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000441"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I have already explained that there is no need for
the amendment because of the Employment and Training Act
1973&#151;that is reason No. 1. Reason No. 2 is that it would have
moved us in the wrong direction in finding the appropriate way to
support people with mental illnesses and fluctuating conditions. There
were many reasons not to support the
amendment.</div><a name="061024100000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
been encouraged to digress, Mr. Amess, but I deal now with
how benefit checks will be carried out. We know from our constituency
casework that when people are called for an interview on benefit 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column208" />Column number: 209</div>entitlement, they often think, &#147;What&#146;s this about? Why is
this happening to me? Has someone told them something? What does this
mean for me?&#148; There is a sense of worry in many instances, as we
all know from the people who come to talk to us at our surgeries and to
whom we talk in our constituencies. In terms of the current PCAs and
benefit entitlement observations, I should like to see a system that is
more regularised in that we would tell customers what would be expected
within a set period of time. Perhaps at the point when they had applied
for incapacity benefit, the norm would be that they would be called and
they would have a conversation every year, every two years or whatever,
so that there was a sense that this was part of the system.
Particularly for those with mental health illnesses, we should not add
that sense of worry that they must have done something wrong or that
they were no longer entitled to the benefit and that is why the letter
came through the
post.</div><a name="061024100000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Incidentally,
there is an important piece of work for us to do to ensure that our
forms and letters are much more customer-friendly, particularly as we
roll out ESA. One of the things I have been doing in recent weeks, and
will continue to do, is sitting with those who have a recent and
current experience of a mental health illness and discussing how they
think we should restructure some of our communications. It is not
something we issue press releases about or issue the names of
participants, but it is important to get this redesign for ESA right.
Listening to people who have experienced frustration with the current
process is
important.</div><a name="061024100000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for
continued entitlement to the ESA system, if there is a change in
condition that is the point at which a new assessment would take place
about whether someone was still entitled to ESA at work-related
activity level or at support group level. We will learn from best
practice how often that should be. One of the lessons that we should
take from incapacity benefit is the one I mentioned earlier, which is
that we should seek to ensure that those with an experience of mental
health know that this is an accepted part of the process. It is not
because they have done something wrong and it is not because someone
somewhere inside this great government machine thinks that they are no
longer entitled to it. It is just a continuing part of keeping in close
contact with the customer. It is part of work-focused interviews. It is
part of the personal adviser arrangements; and it is part of continuing
to ensure that we take account of changing medical circumstances that a
customer may experience. We are in the realm of comment rather than
specific response here. We are trying to build best experience into the
new system.</div>

two wider points to make about the nature of work-focused
health-related assessments. Can the Minister confirm that those
assessments are intended to be similar in some ways to the capability
assessment and report that is currently undertaken in the pathways
areas, in focusing very much on what people can do&#151;identifying
activities in which they can take part and specific health
interventions that may help them to get themselves closer to the labour
market and ready for
work?</div><a name="061024100000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">There has been
some concern that the capability report currently used in the pathways
areas is doing some work that is similar to what the personal
capability assessment is designed to do, particularly under the revised
programme that has been
introduced.</div><a name="061024100000173"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000447"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> On the capability report in pathways, which has
been used as a model&#151;certainly that was the intention for the
new assessment&#151;was the hon. Gentleman as surprised as I was to
discover that evaluation work done by the Department found, first, that
the reports were sent rather late to personal advisers and, secondly,
that the IB PAs thought that in many cases the reports were repetitive
and included less than useful generic information? Does he join me in
hoping that those problems have been designed out of pathways to work
and that they will play no part in the new regime, which we hope will
operate much better than the capability
report?</div><a name="061024100000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000448"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am grateful for that intervention, as the
hon. Gentleman makes an important point. I was somewhat surprised to
read those frank comments in the evaluation but welcomed the fact that
it included them. Personal advisers said that the quality and level of
detail in the capability report was generic, standardised and
repetitive, as he said, and some personal advisers said that they were
of minimal use&#151;that they did not serve any useful purpose above 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column210" />Column number: 211</div>and beyond what the personal adviser was able to do through the
work-focused interview
process.</div><a name="061024100000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not
yet have any draft regulations on work-focused health-related
assessments, and the details of what is intended in the draft
regulations and supporting material are pretty sketchy. Even
inthe personal capability assessment report, the developments
in respect of work-focused health-related assessments are the subject
of six paragraphs. Given all that, it would be useful if the Minister
set out in much greater detail than in those documents the
natureand purpose of the work-focused health-related
assessments, and how the Department has learned the lessons of the
pathways evaluation and will ensure that the exercises are
useful.</div><a name="061024100000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
assessments are intended, at least in part, to lay the foundations for
the conditionality regime that will apply once the Bill is implemented,
perhaps the Minister could also clarify when and under what conditions
she expects that regulations will be introduced to make the
work-focused health-related assessment compulsory. The Committee needs
to understand that important point when dealing with the
clause.</div><a name="061024100000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">I draw the
Committee&#146;s attention to an exchange that I had with the
Secretary of State on Second Readingin which he gave the
impression&#151;inadvertently, I believe&#151;in response to an
intervention I made on him that it was not the intention to have
sanctions or conditionality for the work-focused health-related
assessments. He wrote to me about it subsequently, and the letter
states:</div><a name="061024100000314"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
has always been our intention that participation in the work-focused
health-related assessments would be mandatory and hence a sanction
would be imposed for failure to
participate.&#148;</div><a name="061024100000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can the
Minister confirm that that is the Government&#146;s
thinking?</div><a name="061024100000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000449"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> This may assist the hon. Gentleman. The
explanatory notes suggest that regulations will make provision for
reducing the amount of ESA payable if a claimant fails without good
cause to take part in an assessment. I believe that we will get to that
later, perhaps on clause stand part, but it was obviously prefigured in
the Government&#146;s
thinking.</div><a name="061024100000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000450"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am grateful for that intervention. My purpose
in raising the matter now is simply to ensure that the exchange that
took place on Second Reading is clarified for the
record.</div><a name="061024100000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had a
full debate on the issue that is the focus of this group of amendments:
that is, the nature of the support group and the extent to which people
who are members of it will or will not be able to choose to participate
in and benefit from the range of interventions that is proposed in the
rolling out of pathways and in the clause.</div>
<a name="061024100000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate that we have had
quite a full debate on this subject, but the purpose of the amendments
is to invite the Minister to flesh out the way in which members of the
support group will be able to access the support that might be
available as a result of taking 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column211" />Column number: 212</div>part in a work-focused health-related assessment. In our previous
debate, we talked about work-focused interviews and work-related
activity, but work-focused health-related assessments were not the
focus of that discussion, and I would be interested to hear more from
the Minister about how members of the support group will be able to
access the support provided for in the clause. Although it is clear
that conditionality will not apply to members of the support group in
relation to work-focused health-related assessments, it is none the
less important, in the light of the previous debate, that members of
that group should also be able to access that
support.</div>
<a name="061024100000330"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div><a name="061024100000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000451"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Given that this is a health-related assessment,
is it at least in the back of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s mind that one
aspect that might be considered is the appropriateness of provision for
access-to-work facilities? As the explanatory notes make clear, the
purpose of the assessments is to</div>
<a name="061024100000315"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;provide additional information
about the claimant's functional capacity&#148;.</div>
<a name="061024100000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the individual has a particular
medical condition, which is relevant to their chances of returning to
work whether or not they are in the support group, there might be an
opportunity to see how that capacity can be
supplemented.</div><a name="061024100000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000452"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point, but I
suspect that we will deal with it in more detail on the next group of
amendments, so I do not want to steal his colleagues&#146; thunder.
However, access-to-work funding is an important part of ensuring that
any employment and support allowance claimant has the best chance of
getting back into work. That is why we talked earlier about whether it
was possible to have a core assessment that informed decisions about
access-to-work entitlements. People could then have those entitlements
almost as soon as they had taken part in the assessment, rather than
having to wait to get a job offer before seeing what access-to-work
funding was available. With that, I look forward to the
Under-Secretary&#146;s response to this group of
amendments.</div>
<a name="061024100000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000453"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I do not propose to tax you, Mr. Amess,
or the Committee for long, because we discussed many of the arguments
in the very generous time that you allowed us on the previous
amendment. The basis of my party&#146;s support for the amendment is
the same as that for our support of the earlier amendment: we want to
ensure that the new packages are as available to the members of the
support group as they are to members of the work-related activity
group. Access to the work-focused health-related assessment is
obviously crucial to that.</div>
<a name="061024100000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Under-Secretary
clarify a point regarding the work-focused, health-related assessment?
As I understand it, the assessment will be a positive interview and
will focus on a customer&#146;s capability&#151;on what they might
be able to do in the employment market. In so far as it is undertaken
for people who are part of the support package, however, will it also
look at any part-time, voluntary and community work and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column212" />Column number: 213</div>any full-time and part-time courses that they might be able to
undertake? People might be able to undertake those activities as a
stepping stone towards full-time employment or as a goal in themselves,
if that is their or their advisers&#146; realistic assessment of what
is appropriate.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000454"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions
(Mrs. Anne McGuire):</b> I am delighted to be under
your chairmanship, Mr. Amess.</div>
<a name="061024100000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">By way of introduction, let me
say that I was fascinated by the previous debate on clause 9 and by
some of the comments that were made, not least because, under the
previous Conservative Government, I used to manage employment schemes
for the most disadvantaged of people. The debate was an interesting
exchange of views, because money was an object then and unit costs were
a difficulty, so I want to congratulate Her Majesty&#146;s official
Opposition on travelling such a long way from the days of the 1980s and
1990s.</div>

McGuire:</b> I shall give way in a moment.</div>
<a name="061024100000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Back then, people such as
myself in the voluntary sector had no room for negotiation over unit
costs, even over those people who were furthest from the labour market
and most disadvantaged. I do not want to reopen the debate, but I
thought it an interesting observation by way of
introduction.</div>

was very lax in my chairmanship of the previous amendment, so I should
ask the hon. Gentleman to be careful not to reopen the
debate.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000459"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> With that stricture, I shall just say that the
Under-Secretary was generous in congratulating Her Majesty&#146;s
loyal Opposition on their position on this debate. I repay those
congratulations by congratulating her Government on understanding the
importance of a strong, stable and growing economy as the foundation
for all the support that we are able to give to these important
programmes.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000460"></a>Mrs.

the Labour party always understood the importance of a strong and
stable economy. We understood also that all people should share in the
benefits of a strong and stable economy, which was not always the
philosophy of the Conservative party.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000461"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000465"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I promise that I shall not abuse this
opportunity. I simply want to ask the Under-Secretary one question,
because I was puzzled and slightly alarmed by what she said. I inferred
from her remarks that the Government&#146;s position is that money is
no object, because she seemed to congratulate the Opposition on having
got us to that position&#151;an argument that I do not necessarily
concede. If only for the reassurance of her colleagues, will she
confirm that she does not regard the Government&#146;s position as
one in which money is no object?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000468"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> Thank you, Mr. Amess, for that little
indulgence late on a Tuesday afternoon.</div>
<a name="061024100000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to the amendment moved
by the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey. I
admit to being a little confused about his contribution tothe
debate. I do not know what he thought his amendments would do, but I
fear that their consequences would be greater than he
describes.</div>
<a name="061024100000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000469"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> It is clear what the amendments would do. They
would delete references to the support group in several clauses. The
purpose of the amendments is to draw out from the Under-Secretary how
members of the support group will in practice access support under the
terms not only of the clause before us, but others. I made it clear
that the amendments are probing. To some extent, my questions were
answered in the previous debate, but that debate did not touch on support
group members&#146; access to the work-focused health-related
assessments in any great detail. Can the Under-Secretary provide
further information on
that?</div><a name="061024100000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000470"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> First, in case I do the hon. Gentleman a
disservice in what I am about to say, may I confirm that he and his
party support the inclusion of a support group within the new benefits
system?</div><a name="061024100000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000471"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> Having known the Under-Secretary for a little
while now, I am sure that she would not seek to do me a disservice in
any of her remarks. Given the structure of the benefit, the inclusion
of the support group makes sense. As I said in a previous Committee
sitting&#151;I do not want to try your patience by going on for too
long, Mr. Amess&#151;I strongly believe that a more
constructive reform of the benefits system would be a move towards a
single working age benefit, with which support for the extra costs of
disability were met through benefits such as the disability living
allowance, which are payable irrespective of whether someone is in
work. However, the purpose of these amendments is to probe the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column214" />Column number: 215</div>Government&#146;s intentions on the making available to members of the
support group the support in this clause and
others.</div><a name="061024100000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000472"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I am not much clearer at the end of that
contribution than I was at the beginning, but I shall take the hon.
Gentleman through some of the issues that he has raised. First, I
confirm that the letter that he received from the Secretary of State
states the position. I understand that it clarified a comment that the
Secretary of State made on Second Reading, and that he was anxious to
ensure that the correct position was relayed to the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="061024100000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
I shall deal with work-focused health-related assessments. I appreciate
that we are attempting to bring about a significant change in the way
in which the reformed PCA process will deliver for people on the new
benefit. I hope that I can give some comfort to colleagues here, and
organisations outside Parliament, when I say that we want the new PCA
process to underpin the approach of the new welfare reform programme. I
think that we can all agree that, to a lesser or greater extent, people
were often left to their own devices with very little or no
intervention. The new process will move that work-focused
health-related assessment on to being a far more supportive and focused
tool with which to assist people to get back to
work.</div><a name="061024100000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Daventry said that the WFHRA&#151;one of these days we will come
up with shorter titles for some of these things&#151;was very much
about looking at some of the health-related interventions that might be
of assistance to individual claimants when they are on the benefit. It
will also allow us the opportunity to identify at a fairly early stage
some of the adaptations that might be necessary to support a person
going back to work, or often into work for the first time.</div>
<a name="061024100000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have talked about medical
and social models, but the reformed PCA underpins the fact that for
many disabled people and people with limiting conditions, solutions
regarding physical barriers or adaptations that have not been made,
which they perhaps did not think could be made, would allow them to go
back to work. It is about building some of those decisions and
attitudes into the process pretty early on, because it is important
that when people are work-ready, they know what adaptations are
necessary, and, more important, that the employer or prospective
employer, organisation or company knows exactly what is
necessary.</div><a name="061024100000331"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30

I do not seek to pick a quarrel with her on that matter. I am pleased
by what she just said in response to my comments. Does she agree that
that might well include some appreciation of whether the individual
involved has access to public or private transport? Otherwise, people

of support group access to the work-focused health-related assessment.
A person who has been assessed to go into the support group can ask for
the work-focused health-related assessment at the end of that first
assessment. That will be undertaken by a different person, but those
concerned can ask to move to that additional part of the process if
that is what they so
wish.</div><a name="061024100000217"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000475"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am grateful for that clarification, which is
helpful in two ways: first, in clarifying that members of the support
group will have access, which is very positive. Secondly, the
Under-Secretary said that the assessment would be carried out by a
different person. Can she clarify whether that will be the case for all
ESA recipients who are invited to take part in their work-focused
health-related assessment, at the end of their limited capability for
work assessment and limited capability for work-related activity
assessment? Will the same person or different persons be
involved?</div><a name="061024100000218"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000476"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> Obviously, we are learning from experience about
how best to connect all those elements of the process. There are three
elements to a single process. Some of that assessment may be carried
out by other professionals or those with some experience&#151;not
only on the medical side, but on the occupational health side. I hope
that that gives the hon. Gentleman some
comfort.</div><a name="061024100000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman and other Opposition Members have probed certain issues of
detail, but I would obviously ask him to withdraw the amendment, which
would, as I hope he appreciates&#151;and as he in fact
realised&#151;put those people who had gone into the support group
into a mandatory position for all the other elements of the employment
and support allowance.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000480"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> Given the Committee&#146;s desire to make
progress, we do not need to have a huge debate on this set of
amendments.</div> <a name="061024100000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
a question over the wording in the Bill; I think that the Government
have inadvertently made a mistake. The amendments deal with clause 10
in which references are made to &#147;health-related&#148;
assessments. We would like that wording to be changed to &#147;health
and disability-related&#148; assessments. The Committee will
understand the important difference between a health condition and a
disability, and it is clear that the work-focused health-related
assessment, as described in clause 10, is meant to focus on the work
people can do despite an adverse health condition or a
disability.</div> <a name="061024100000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the amendments therefore is to ensure that we understand
that many conditions that can limit a person&#146;s capability for
work are not health conditions, but disabilities such as learning
disabilities, autistic spectrum disorders, blindness, deafness and so
on. We want to make it clear in the amendments that the work-focused
health-related assessment will cover disabilities and not just health
conditions and ensure that the wording of the Bill makes it clear that,
just as we said in discussions on earlier clauses, it is vital for
personal advisers and people conducting the PCAs to understand the
difference between a health condition and a disability. It is important
therefore that the wording of the Bill makes it clear that we as
legislators understand that important
difference.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column217" />Column number: 218</div><a name="061024100000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000481"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> These amendments are helpful in making clear
the extent and scope of what is described as the work-focused
health-related assessment. I think that the hon. Gentleman makes an
important point about the range of disabilities that might not be
captured at the moment. I took it from the Under-Secretary&#146;s
earlier comments on access to work&#151;perhaps she will confirm
this&#151;that the Government intend the assessment to consider some
of the disability-related issues that have been described, not least
because, as I understood from her previous response, that process could
lead to a recommendation for reasonable adjustments that might cause
the person to be subject to access-to-work funding and therefore assist
them with returning to
work.</div><a name="061024100000234"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000482"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Has the hon. Gentleman considered the possibility
that whereas my hon. Friend made it clear that not all disabilities are
health related, it might be that the Government are arguing that
limited capability for work&#151;the clause 8
test&#151;automatically constitutes a disability? That might be how
they are approaching the matter.</div>
<a name="061024100000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000483"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am grateful for that intervention, and I
shall pass that on to the Under-Secretary. I am not sure that it is for
me to interpret the Government&#146;s intentions, but that was an
important point that she might like to
clarify.</div><a name="061024100000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
work-focused health-related assessment is intended to have the wider
scope described in this debate, the Government, without wishing to make
the assessment&#146;s title even longer, should think about whether
their language is appropriate. As the Under-Secretary knows, language
is important in many aspects of this debate. She might wish to think
about whether the name of that assessment is correct and bring forward
Government amendments to change
it.</div><a name="061024100000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000484"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b> I echo what the hon. Gentleman said; language,
especially when it comes to learning difficulties and mental health, is
incredibly important. The stigma generated by the incorrect use of
language is unwelcome. On that point, there seems to be an opportunity
to modify the language marginally so that certain types of stigma do
not continue inadvertently and
unnecessarily.</div><a name="061024100000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000485"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I agree with all Committee members&#146; that
language is important. That is why &#147;health&#148;&#151;not
&#147;health and disability&#148;&#151;is mentioned in the
clause. Although, superficially, the amendments appear to be minimal in
their effect, they could widen the scope of the assessments in a way
that the Government do not think would be helpful. To some extent, the
hon. Member for Daventry mentioned that in passing in his last
contribution and he highlighted it in discussion on the earlier group
of amendments.</div><a name="061024100000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
assessment is deliberately designed to focus on the support that people
will need to overcome the impact on their mind and body caused by
health conditions. It is not necessarily about the disability, but
about the health-related barriers that prevent an individual from
moving into work. The hon. Gentleman mentioned those with learning
disabilities. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column218" />Column number: 219</div>That is a good example. Earlier today, he highlighted the fact that
often people assume that individuals with learning disabilities cannot
suffer from other health-related conditions. We are trying to be
specific about such matters in this part of the Bill. It is not
aboutnot recognising the difference between health and
disability; it is about saying that, in some circumstances,
health-related issues and not matters relating to a person&#146;s
disability can be
involved.</div><a name="061024100000240"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000486"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I am not sure that I understand what the
Under-Secretary is saying. We are not saying that this measure should
not relate to a health assessment, but that it should just relate to a
health or a disability-related assessment.</div>
<a name="061024100000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me give the
Under-Secretary a practical example. If someone in a wheelchair, who
therefore has significant mobility problems, wants to engage with the
labour market, that is not a health issue; they are in a wheelchair
with a long-term if not a permanent condition. Clearly, some types of
job will be suitable for them&#151;for example, answering the phone
on reception or working in an office&#151;and other jobs, such as
cleaning, will not be suitable. I understood that the purpose of the
work-focused health-related assessment was to help a person understand
what jobs and what part of the labour market they might be able to
engage with. Surely, taking into account the disability of someone in a
wheelchair is an extremely important part of the
assessment.</div><a name="061024100000242"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000487"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> It is an important part of the process for that
individual, but although the hon. Gentleman has given the Committee a
good example to illustrate our point, I am not sure whether there is
necessarily in all circumstances a health-related issue for a disabled
person. The disadvantages and barriers that he has rightly highlighted
can be dealt with in differentparts of the process. However,
it is not necessarily appropriate for that to be considered within the
health-related assessment part of the
process.</div><a name="061024100000332"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div><a name="061024100000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000488"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I am grateful to the Minister, but that is exactly
my point. As I understand it, there is no other part of the process
where a person&#146;s disability&#151;the fact that they have
mobility problems&#151;will be taken into account with respect to how
best to help them engage in the labour market. It is precisely their
disability that needs to be taken into account if the work-focused
health-related assessment process is to do its
job.</div><a name="061024100000244"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000489"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I give way to the hon. Member for
Daventry.</div><a name="061024100000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000490"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I find myself, not for the first time, thinking
very much along the same lines as my hon. Friend the Member for
South-West Surrey. It is important that the Minister should be able to
explain to us where the disability issues are picked up, if it is not
in this clause. It could be that they fall under the appraisal for
access to work, but that is work or employment-contingent.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column219" />Column number: 220</div><a name="061024100000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I say something that is
designed to be less critical of the Minister? The other day, when
discussing condition-management programmes, I learned that they are
exactly what they say they are: designed to encourage individuals to
manage their condition. They do not necessarily imply a pledge to
remove the condition, sadly, because it may not be removable. Does the
Minister have in her mind, in respect of this clause and in the
argument that she is developing, some obverse of this, where one is
trying to find out what is within the health framework and can be
altered, rather than what cannot be altered and will have to be managed
in terms of getting close to the labour
market?</div><a name="061024100000247"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000491"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> As both my hon. Friend the Minister of State and
I have indicated, this is part of a process. I can appreciate the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point of view that perhaps there is an implication
that we do not recognise the difference between health and disability.
He, and others, might need confidence that we will take into account
the support needs of disabled people, which are not necessarily in all
circumstances health-related. I reassure him and the Committee that the
physical barriers that need to be dealt with for a disabled person to
move into the world of work will be dealt with during the work-focused
interviews. That is the correct and proper place for them.</div>
<a name="061024100000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have also clearly indicated
that in the health-related assessment we will have an early opportunity
to examine some of the issues relating to adaptation, which could then
be carried on as part of the process. Obviously the regulations are due
to be published, so I will not ask hon. Members just to accept my
assurances; it will be part of the regulations, so that we can continue
to give people confidence that we are genuinely about moving people who
have no access to work, through support, whether it be given through
some of our other programmes or health interventions, to a situation
where they can genuinely choose work as an option.</div>
<a name="061024100000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the assurances
that I have given the hon. Member for South-West Surrey, together with
what will be in the draft regulations&#151;I fully understand that I
am expecting him to take this on trust&#151;will meet some of the
concerns that he has raised. We have used the word
&#147;health&#148; very specifically and deliberately in this
clause.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000492"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I just need to understand one point. I am grateful
to the Minister for her explanation. On this sort of issue, I would not
be at all unwilling to take things on trust, because despite our
sparring today, we are all trying to achieve the same thing in this
Committee. I want to clarify one point. She seems to be saying that I
was wrong to say that this was a question of language. She seems to be
saying that the work-focused health-related assessment will in fact not
look at people&#146;s disabilities; it will look at people&#146;s
health, and therefore at issues such as what happens where someone has
a disability and a mental health condition that needs attention. The
point of this part of the process is not at all to look at
people&#146;s disabilities. If I understand the Minister correctly,
she 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column220" />Column number: 221</div>is saying that dealing with the issues relating to their disabilities
will be taken care of later in the process. Can she confirm
that?</div>
<a name="061024100000251"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000493"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I think that the hon. Gentleman and I agree more
than is currently obvious. Not all health problems are disabling and
not all disabilities are caused by health conditions. We are talking
about where we support people during the process. The issues to do with
barriers, to highlight the social model aspect of disability, will be
dealt with as part of the work-focused interviews. The health-related
assessment is very much part of the process of whether we should be
looking to see, for example, whether people would benefit from
additional physiotherapy. I am talking about issues that are related
directly to their mind and body in terms of health. As I said, I think
we agree far more than is obvious. The assessment is part of a process.
We recognise that, as part of the health-related assessment, we will
take the opportunity to look at some of the adaptations that might be
necessary, but the focus is specifically on health, not on
disability.</div><a name="061024100000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000494"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I think we are getting there, but it has just
occurred to me that we do not appear to have mentioned that there is a
specific requirement in subsection (7) for the assessment to be carried
out by</div><a name="061024100000317"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a health care
professional approved by the Secretary of
State&#148;.</div><a name="061024100000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">That could be a
number of people. For example, it could be a physiotherapist or an
occupational therapist&#151;occupational therapy is and has been for
a number of years my particular interest. From what the Minister said,
it is not inconceivable that the assessment would be carried out by an
occupational therapist, who would be concerned not only with the
functionality of the individual but, often and typically, with the
conditions under which that individual would be required either to live
their life or to have a working life later on. We move from the narrow,
symptom-driven approach to one that is going towards a fuller
appraisal, but is at the same time health-driven and professional,
rather than being purely advice about how to go to
work.</div><a name="061024100000254"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000495"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> That is a helpful contribution. I did not allude
to that part of the clause because we are due to discuss amendments
relating to it later. The Welfare Reform Bill is linked to many other
aspects of our programme promoting equality for disabled people. The
hon. Gentleman is well aware of that; indeed, I know that he is very
supportive of it. Examples are the extension and strengthening of the
Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and the duty on employers to make
reasonable adjustments. All those are issues that we have to consider
horizontally as opposed to considering just the specific issues in this
Bill. There is a dovetailing of responsibilities and of
rights.</div><a name="061024100000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the hon. Member for South-West Surrey will not take what I have said
just on trust, given that I have given him assurances, but will
recognise that, further on in our process, we will have a set of draft
regulations that I think will meet the requirements and address the
issues that he has raised here this afternoon. In the light of that, I
hope that he will withdraw the amendment.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column221" />Column number: 222</div><a name="061024100000256"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000496"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for her responses. I
completely agree with her that these issues need to be considered
holistically because, for a disabled person, the employment and support
allowance will be only a part of their benefits package, albeit a very
important part. In that spirit, I am grateful to the Chairman for
allowing us latitude to talk about the general issue of work,
disincentives and the benefits system, which I know is of great concern
to hon. Members on both sides of the
Committee.</div><a name="061024100000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think I
will accept the Minister&#146;s assurances; I shall explain why. It
is not an argument that the Minister made herself, but if she is saying
that this is really a health-related assessment, not a
disability-focused assessment, I can see some benefits in a purely
health-related assessment, because we do not pay enough attention to
the health issues that affect disabled people. A purely health-related
assessment could remove a major stumbling block. I am thinking of the
mental health issues, for
example.</div><a name="061024100000258"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="061024100000497"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Russell Brown</b> (Dumfries and Galloway) (Lab): I would just
like to point out to the hon. Gentleman that he said in a previous
intervention, rightly, that language is important. We have been talking
about his amendment, which says &#147;health and
disability-related&#148;, but the record will show that he used the
terminology &#147;health or disability-related&#148;, which makes a
significant
difference.</div><a name="061024100000259"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000498"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I do not want to get into a discussion about
semantics with the hon. Gentleman and whether there is a substantive
difference in meaning between work-focused health or disability-related
assessment and work-focused health and disability-related assessment.
An assessment for disability and health could mean an assessment for
disability or health. The purpose of my amendment
stands.</div><a name="061024100000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree with
the hon. Gentleman that language is important, but I think the Minister
is saying that the language is correct in this case and that the
assessment should be health-focused. That is important if we want to
help disabled people to get back on the road to engagement in the
labour market because of the issues we raised earlier about the
complicated and poorly understood interaction between mental health
issues and disabilities, and the fact that we know that mental health
issues affect a large proportion of the people who go on to incapacity
benefit. I see some benefit in a health-focused interview and on that
basis I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="061024100000261"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000499"></a>Danny

clause 10, page 8, line 21, leave out
&#147;, within a prescribed
period,&#148;.</div><a name="061024100000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the amendment is simply to probe the meaning of the term
&#147;prescribed period&#148; in the regulations to subsection
(2)(f)(ii). This part of the Bill imposes on an individual a condition
to providewithin a time limit a good cause for not
attendinga work-focused, health-related assessment. It is
important to discuss this because someone may have a good cause that
leads them to be unable to make contact or they may be incapacitated as
a result of their 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column222" />Column number: 223</div>condition and unable to show within a prescribed
limit good cause for not attending. We do not have the draft
regulations for clause 10, but we have them for work-focused interviews
and the prescribed time limit is five days. Is it the Minister&#146;s
intention that the five-day time limit should also apply to the time
within which someone must demonstrate good cause for not attending a
work-focused health-related
assessment?</div><a name="061024100000264"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="061024100000500"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Wayne David</b> (Caerphilly) (Lab): Is the hon. Gentleman
suggesting that a time limit should be specified in the Bill, or does
he simply want a prescribed time to be
deleted?</div><a name="061024100000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000501"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. I am
probing the Government&#146;s intentions, particularly on how they
intend to deal with cases when someone has a good cause that has made
it impossible for them to notify the Department within the five-day
period specified in the regulations. The way in which the work-focused
interview regulations are drawn up suggests that no matter how good the
cause, if someone fails to notify what that good cause is within five
days they will be subject to a sanction. That seems to be problematic,
to say the
least.</div><a name="061024100000266"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000502"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman have in mind the
eventuality of someone who suffers bipolar disorder and finds that they
are low for a much longer period than five days and are functionally
incapable of communicating that fact to the Department? That would not
necessarily absolve people with other conditions, but suggests that the
test needs to be
sensitive.</div><a name="061024100000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000503"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> The hon. Gentleman sets out an example of
exactly the sort of circumstances that I have in mind. I hope that the
Minister can reassure the Committee that, in such cases, although the
five-day time limit&#151;if that is intended for the health-related
assessments&#151;is what the Government have in mind for the
regulations, sufficient latitude will be given so that in the example
to which I have referred or that cited by the hon. Member for Daventry
some leeway can be taken into account in such cases. Safeguards should
certainly be in place so that they are applied in such examples before
sanctions are
imposed.</div><a name="061024100000333"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div><a name="061024100000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, the circumstances described by the hon. Member for Daventry
might lead people notto attend a work-focused health-related
assessment. Understandably, for whatever reason in light of their
condition or impairment, they might not be able to get back to the
Department to explain their non-attendance and may then have their
benefits sanctioned in the way that has been described. I am relying
again on the work-focused interview regulations that describe in detail
the sanctioning process and the amountof sanction, not the
work-focused health-related assessment regulations because we do not
have them. I am sure that members of the Committee would not want to
get into such circumstances. While they may be few in number, they
could have a significant impact on the lives of those whom I am
describing. With that, I should be grateful to hear the
Minister&#146;s
response.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column223" />Column number: 224</div><a name="061024100000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000504"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I hope that I can reassure the hon. Gentleman and
other members of the Committee about those matters. He has rightly
pointed out that we do not yet have the regulations in respect of
clause 10. I wish to say at the outset that it is not our intention to
make life difficult for people for whom life may already be difficult.
We recognise that, in some situations, there is very good cause why
people cannot respond within a reasonable time. For the sake of the
record, a reasonable time will be five days, but it will be five
working days: it will not include Saturdays, Sundays, Christmas day,
Boxing day and the September weekend in
Glasgow.</div><a name="061024100000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the same
time as recognising those issues, we must accept that a time frame
often allows people to concentrate on what they have to do, which may
be important in their lives. May I describe some of the experience of
the pathways to work pilots? We rarely used the sanctions method in
work-focused interviews in the pilots. It is not our intention to slap
sanctions on people from the point that they take themselves out of the
process. If people have a mental health condition or a disability that
will impact on their ability to undertake some elements of the process,
of course, we will go out of our way to ensure that their particular
circumstances are
recognised.</div><a name="061024100000271"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000505"></a>Mr.
David:</b> I am enormously encouraged by what the
Under-Secretary of State said, but can she confirm that, in fact, the
sanctions under pathways are as low as 0.8 per cent? I am sure that she
will agree that that is very low
indeed.</div><a name="061024100000272"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000506"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I know that my hon. Friend has some experience,
if not from his constituency, then near it, of some of the successes of
pathways. The sanctions mechanism is there. I suppose that he and I
understand why people become upset about it, rightly, given that they
are vulnerable people who often have many other things to deal with in
their lives at certain times. I want to reassure the Committee that it
is our intention to recognise the impact on the lives of individuals,
which may make it difficult for them, yet at the same time we believe
that it is important to set a time frame, so that the information can
come to us. It is not for the benefit of Jobcentre Plus, but for the
benefit of individuals, so that they can get themselves on to the right
benefit with the right support at the right
time.</div>
<a name="061024100000273"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000507"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I fully understand the balanced nature of the
case made by the Under-Secretary of State and I agree, but will there
still be the power for an officer of her Department to waive the
provision on the five-day rule if there are felt to be extenuating
circumstances? Many years ago, in circumstances I need not go into and
that had nothing to do with my own health, I effectively had to take
sufficient time out of my life to be able to square my parliamentary
expenses within the six-week time limit. I just managed it in time, but
these things occasionally happen and while I am sure that the Minister
does not want to say to the Committee, &#147;Make a habit of failing
to meet your obligations&#148;, there may be cases where it is
entirely
appropriate.</div><a name="061024100000274"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000508"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I can give the hon. Gentleman an example that
will illustrate his point. If someone is in hospital and they cannot
reasonably be expected to attend a health-related assessment, obviously
we will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column224" />Column number: 225</div>need to recognise that in those circumstances, it would be utterly
unreasonable for us to expect that person to deliver themselves to an
assessment in the five days. In those circumstances, for example, we
would give a further month during which they could bring forward
evidence leading to a reconsideration of any sanction that may have
been imposed. We wish to ensure that the system is as flexible as
possible while still recognising that this is a rights and
responsibilities agenda and that, within the process, we need to put
some milestones along the road.</div>
<a name="061024100000275"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000509"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b> I have one concern. We are talking about rights
and responsibilities, but clearly to conduct a health assessment or any
of these assessments, the assessors have to be available. In the
circumstance where somebody presents themselves, but there is a strike
or the person they are supposed to see is not there, what is the
redress for that claimant and where does the responsibility lie? There
have been many examples of that happening in other public services.
What happens in this
case?</div><a name="061024100000276"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000510"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> My hon. Friend the Minister for Employment and
Welfare Reform said that strikes are at an all-time low, so that is not
the example that would immediately come to mind. The hon. Gentleman has
raised the individual&#146;s competency to get the information or, if
there is a bus strike and the person relies on public transport, to get
to the assessment. Obviously, that would be the sort of issue taken
into account.</div> <a name="061024100000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
aim in the Bill is to assist people into work and to build in as much
support as we can, not to put additional barriers in the way. There
should still be a prescribed time and that should be five days, but
there will be circumstances, to which we will ensure our advisers are
attuned, that will allow people a bit more
flexibility.</div><a name="061024100000278"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000511"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b> I thank the Under-Secretary for her generosity. I
am raising a serious point about the availability of the actual
assessor and what happens if the person arrives to be assessed and the
assessor is not available for whatever reason. We have a huge variable
here as the Government are talking about letting contracts to the
private sector and one never knows what will arise in that kind of
scenario. There may be a situation where there are thousands of people
around the country who are unable to present for their assessment. What
is the safety net and where is there a line in the regulations that
would pick up that
eventuality?</div><a name="061024100000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000512"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I sometimes fear that we think that unless
something is written in law or in regulation, it will not happen. I can
give the hon. Gentleman a categorical assurance that, if all the
doctors in Atos Origin&#151;there are 243 of them&#151;go on strike
one day and people turn up for their health-related assessment, they
will have a rescheduled appointment and any expenses incurred will be
reimbursed. Does that satisfy the hon. Gentleman?</div>
<a name="061024100000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">In that light, I ask the hon.
Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey to withdraw his
amendment.</div>

Alexander:</b> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for her
clarification. She has offered me the reassurance that I was looking
for, not least in the suggestion that a further month would be allowed
for extreme cases, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
<a name="061024100000282"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment, by leave,

<a name="061024100000283"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000514"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 49, in
clause 10, page 9, line 4, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(d) for pilot
schemes to vary the time during a claimfor an employment and
support allowance at which the work-focused health-related assessment
is
conducted.&#146;.</div><a name="061024100000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is an important amendment. It is analogous in a way to the debate that
we had about melding together the tests in clauses 8 and 9, and the
Minister gave a very satisfactory reply to our amendment to the effect
that there were legal reasons why there had to be discrete silos of
assessments in clauses 8, 9 and 10. However, I need to return to the
question of timing and lumping together the three conceptually
different tests all at the same time and in the same room.</div>
<a name="061024100000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 49 would allow
the piloting of the timing of the work-focused health-related
assessment that follows the PCA. The sequence would be the clause 8
test to decide whether someone got the allowance, the clause 9 test to
decide whether they came under the support component or the
work-related activity component, and, if they came under the latter,
they would move on to the work-focused health-related assessment. That
is where a potential problem arises. Undertaking the work-focused
health-related assessment immediately after the work-related activity
assessment could be confusing. For a start, the health-related
assessment will take place when the outcome of the PCA might not
necessarily be known to the claimant&#151;in fact, it probably will
not be.</div> <a name="061024100000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">The PCA
assessment and the work-focused health-related assessment perform two
separate functions, to establish first whether someone gets an
allowance and secondly what support and adaptations someone who is
capable of work might need to get them moving towards work. To ask the
individual to respond sequentially&#151;a matter of minutes might
elapse between the two tests&#151;could be confusing for the
claimant. Those concerns&#151;someone will be trying to show that
they are ill enough to get the allowance and also having to show some
residual functional capability&#151;might be pushing in separate
directions. If I were in that room, I would want to show that I was
deserving of an allowance and needed support but at the same time I
would be told, &#147;What can you do? You&#146;re not that badly
off, because we&#146;re trying to show what capability you can
display to us in this health-related assessment&#148;.</div>
<a name="061024100000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">That tension is acknowledged
in the review of the personal capability assessment that was published
with the draft regulations. On page 19, it
states:</div><a name="061024100000318"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
timing of the work-focused health-related assessment (whether it should
immediately follow the benefit entitlement assessment, or whether it
should be carried out at a subsequent appointment) has been the subject
of some concern and difference of opinion.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column226" />Column number: 227</div><a name="061024100000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">So the Government acknowledged that
difference of opinion in a document published just before these
Committee proceedings. It
continues:</div><a name="061024100000319"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
are advantages to carrying
it&#148;&#151;</div><a name="061024100000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">the
health-related
assessment&#151;</div><a name="061024100000320"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;out
at the same appointment: not least the convenience for the claimant of
only having to attend one appointment instead of
two.&#148;</div><a name="061024100000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
Government&#146;s logic. It
continues:</div><a name="061024100000321"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Any
perceived conflict of
interest&#148;&#151;</div><a name="061024100000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">as I
have
described&#151;</div><a name="061024100000322"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;could
be managed by appropriate explanation of the different nature and
purpose of the two
assessments.&#148;</div><a name="061024100000334"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div><a name="061024100000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is logic
in the Government&#146;s position: they are saying that things will
be more convenient. There will not be the travel time and transport
costs associated with having a work-focused health-related assessment
at a different time of day, or even on a different day, and we can
understand why that may be in claimants&#146; interests. However, I
am still struggling, as are some outside groups, to resolve the tension
between the two matters that are being demonstrated: capability on the
one hand and eligibility for allowance on the other. Someone trying to
show capability might see that as compromising the results that they
had achieved on the personal capability assessment. They will be doing
it within a matter of minutes after a conceptually very different test.
I assume that the same person will conduct both tests and that that the
claimant will be in the same room with that person, but showing
radically different
things.</div><a name="061024100000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Royal
National Institute of the Blind refers to the two interviews being
focused on very different subjects,
thereby</div><a name="061024100000323"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;potentially
confusing the claimant and leading to anxiety that information
disclosed in the WFHRA could be used against them in relation to the
PCA decision.&#148;</div><a name="061024100000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
words&#151;</div><a name="061024100000324"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;could be
used against them&#148;</div><a name="061024100000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">are
quite powerful. That might rightly or wrongly be the perception of a
claimant in a situation in which they have to undertake two tests one
after the other in the same
room.</div><a name="061024100000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
seeks not to strike down such arrangements but merely to introduce
pilot schemes to vary the time at which a health-related assessment
might be undertaken. The pilots could experiment with doing it the day
after, or the week after, or at some other time. That would sit happily
with the ethos of experimentation, testing, stress testing and the
other propositions in the Bill to which Ministers have already
subscribed by way of the dummy runs that will occur for parts of the
regime to which we shall come in the next few clauses. Ministers have
had open minds, and they have said that they will take best practice,
and adapt and modify it between now and the time when the allowance is
up and running in 2008. In that spirit of consensual piloting, I hope
that Ministers will give some consideration to the
amendment.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column227" />Column number: 228</div><a name="061024100000297"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000515"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I wanted to add a brief point of clarification
to the case for the amendment that has just been made by the hon.
Member for Bury St. Edmunds. It relates to a point that we debated
earlier: the question of when decisions about benefit entitlement
should be made, and of whether sanctions apply to a work-focused
health-related assessment. In the earlier debate, the Under-Secretary
made it clear, I think, that if the first assessment occurred
immediately following the assessment under clause 8 or clause 9,
because the decision would not have been made by the decision maker,
the sanction would not apply. If so, because sanctions can apply in
more general terms to work-focused health-related assessments, a degree
of confusion could attach to whether sanctions applied in the case of
certain timings. The piloting for which the amendment provides would
allow experimentation to take
place.</div><a name="061024100000298"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000516"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman foresee, as I do, a
theoretical situation hoving into view, in which an individual has done
the clause 9 test and is convincedin his or her mind that he
or she has qualified forthe support component? They do not
receive a determination on it straight away, because the decision is
not made that minute. They are then asked by one of the assessors to do
a work-focused health-related assessment, and the individual is quite
convinced that it will not apply to them because they are in the
support component. Why should they have to start demonstrating
capability for the work-related activity component, for which they
think they will not be eligible? We can see a situation in which
someone says in good faith, &#147;This work-focused health-related
assessment does not apply to me. I&#146;m not doing it.&#148; Is a
sanction applicable in those circumstances? It would be very
unreasonable if it
were.</div><a name="061024100000299"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000517"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> That is exactly the sort of circumstance that
we need a wee bit more clarity about. From my understanding of what
Ministers have said in this Committee, at the end of the assessment
under clauses 8 and 9, the Atos Origin employee will make it clear to
the claimant whether the result of their assessment will recommend to
the decision maker that they be part of the support group. However, I
understand that the actual decision about entitlement is taken by the
decision maker and not by the Atos Origin doctor. If that is the case
and someone who says in good faith, &#147;I think I am entitled to be
a member of the support group,&#148; and who is told that they are
not, may wish to appeal. If he then turns down the opportunity to take
part in the work-focused health-related assessment at that time, it
seems only fair that the sanction should not apply in that
circumstance.</div><a name="061024100000300"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000518"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I thought that this was a straightforward
amendment, but I see that it is slightly more complicated than I
thought. I do not know whether it has been made complicated, but it is
slightly more complicated than was initially
obvious.</div><a name="061024100000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">I advise the
Committee that we should not assume that there are not occasions when
health professionals assess people for both capability and incapacity.
It is one of the skills in occupational health that a professional can
look at two aspects of a person&#146;s 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column228" />Column number: 229</div>incapability at one time. In some respects, we are in danger of assuming
that neither the health professional nor the individual can make the
transition from one set of circumstances to another. I mention that as
a caveat at the
beginning.</div><a name="061024100000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">I reassure
the Committee that all the processes that we are discussing will occur
during the 13-week assessment period. During that period, there will be
no sanctions. We are setting ourselves a firm deadline for that initial
assessment. I hope that that gives the hon. Gentlemen some comfort
about where and when the decision making and the sanctions will occur,
and I hope that we will not develop the argument totally around the
issue of sanctions. As we heard earlier, sanctions form a tiny
proportion of the activity in pathways to work. We intend that to
happen through the new system.</div>
<a name="061024100000303"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000519"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I do not mean to disrupt the
Under-Secretary&#146;s flow, but I thought that I heard her say that
sanctions will not apply during the 13-week assessment phase. However,
my understanding of the clause is that regulations may make provision
for reducing the amount of ESA payable when a claimant fails without
good cause to take part in a health-related assessment. Is that
right?</div><a name="061024100000304"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000520"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> I hope that I can clarify the position. The
direct question is, &#147;When will the WFHRA be
sanctionable?&#148; It will be sanctionable only after the assessment
phase period, when the full benefit is in payment and the customer
refuses to attend. There could be, for example, a second work-related
health assessment. That is what clause 10 alludes to. I hope that that
clarifies the matter for the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="061024100000305"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000521"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> This is extremely important and I am grateful to
the Under-Secretary. Will she say, in answer to the questions posed by
the Liberal Democrat spokesman and me, that if a claimant rejects a
health-related assessment under clause 10 that takes place within the
first 13 weeks, that cannot, under any 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column229" />Column number: 230</div>circumstances, result in a sanction being placed on them&#151;provided
that it is refused within the first13
weeks?</div><a name="061024100000306"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000522"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> If the person continues to refuse after the
13-week assessment, of course, we have the option to decide what action
to take. I hope that that clarifies the position for hon.
Members.</div><a name="061024100000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall deal
quickly with another matter, because I appreciate that I may be under
time pressure because of a vote downstairs. Our preference is that the
work-focused, health-related assessment should take place at the same
time as the other assessment, but we are prepared to test the issue to
see whether that would be appropriate. I use the word
&#147;test&#148;, not &#147;pilot&#148;. I say to the hon.
Member for Bury St. Edmunds that clause 18 will allow us to do that.
Therefore, we already have the power to undertake some of the testing
that he and the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and
Strathspey mentioned. In that light, I ask that the amendment be
withdrawn.</div><a name="061024100000308"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="061024100000523"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I am most grateful to the Minister, because she
has clarified areas that seemed a bit murky in relation to sanctions
and in relation to the proposition that there might be testing. If she
does not want to use the word &#147;pilot&#148;&#151;well, she
says &#147;potato&#148; and I say
&#147;po-tah-toe&#148;,&#151;I shall not fuss about its use. If
she is giving an undertaking to the effect that there will be some
testing of the proposition that the health-related assessment should
take place immediately after the clause 9 assessment, and if that is
being considered, that will give heart to many people reading the
<i class="I">Hansard</i> report of these proceedings; it certainly gives me
heart. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="061024100000309"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
