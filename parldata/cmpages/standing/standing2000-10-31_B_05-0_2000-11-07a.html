</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Chope </B>(Christchurch): When the Committee rose, I had almost concluded my remarks on the amendments. However, I want to apologise to the Committee. During the discussion on the amendments to clause 5, I referred to a firm in my constituency whose name, I thought, was ``New Life Windows''. I have been told that its name is, in fact, Be-Secure Windows. I do not know whether an organisation called ``New Life Windows'' exists but, if so, I would not wish it to remain on the record that that was the firm involved. When I returned to my office at lunchtime, I had a letter from the police saying that they would interview the boss of Be-Secure Windows as soon as he could be found. So that is good news.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is absolutely fascinating, but it has nothing to do with the amendments. We might regard it as a point of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Gale.
<P>
I hope that the Minister has had an opportunity for some extensive briefing, especially on the People's Trust, during the course of the afternoon. I look forward to his response. The loophole is sufficiently large to warrant the Committee's attention and, perhaps, a Division, if the Government do not give any undertakings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Austin Mitchell </B>(Great Grimsby): I am sorry, Mr. Gale, that you brought the remarks of the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) to a premature halt, because I was enjoying their brevity, wit and sparkle I sympathised with his Whip, who sat on the Front Bench nodding sagely and gently at everything he said. I am glad, too, that we have identified the firm at last as Be-Secure, because he made a b. long speech on the subject.
<P>
I agreed with parts of the hon. Gentleman's speech, however, especially those referring to the nature of the deals that we are discussing and whether such cases should be taken before the courts for disqualification. Amendment No. 52, which I tabled, refers to a similar point. Will my hon. Friend the Minister tell us a little more about the envisaged results of the provision? Is it a means of saving money by not bringing cases to court? Is it a way of shaking down people presumed guilty of fraudulent practice and arriving at a plea bargain? Is it some kind of negotiation in which people will accept disqualification for a lesser issue while the larger issue is put in abeyance? I do not understand what the provisions will involve. What cases will they be used for and how frequently? Will such cases be more numerous than court cases, or less? Is the matter simply one of convenience?
<P>
Whatever the answers to those questions, the settlements that are negotiated should be a matter of record. Amendment No. 52 would require publication of any arrangements made with a person from whom the Secretary of State accepts such a disqualification undertaking. The public need to be able to judge the people involved. If plea bargaining is involved, the public need to know about the charges that started the process and the settlement that was negotiated. Questions will be asked, not only by those involved in any abuse or dereliction of duty, who will want to know that justice has been done, but by those who deal with someone once his disqualification is over; they will ask what the offence was. The provision could be a way to hush it up, put it out of the public arena and reduce to a minor charge a public court case. On all those issues, the public's right to know and the provision of information are paramount and should be required either in the Bill or by regulation. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Minister will tell us which, but in either case there should be publication.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Page </B>(South-West Hertfordshire): My hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch made some powerful arguments in support of his amendments and the Government changes that have been made to the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986. I look forward to what the Minister has to say.
<P>
I should like to speak briefly to amendments Nos. 71 and 72, which are both remarkably short. Amendment No. 71 specifies the basis on which a court can grant a variation or discharge of the disqualification undertaking. The material word in my amendment is ``material''. I am sure that the Committee will agree that a disqualification undertaking should be brought to an end or varied only in the light of major changes in circumstance, not in relation to trivial matters. That is the reason for the introduction of ``material''. I believe that it is important that the basis of the decision to try to vary or revoke be stated in legislation. The amendment would achieve that dual purpose.
<P>
Amendment No. 72 makes it clear that a director can object to proceedings being retained in the ``wrong'' court and seek to have them transferred to the proper or more appropriate court. I shall not deal with specific cases, but we have all had constituents coming to our surgeries to argue that their case would have been better heard in a place different from the one in which it was heard. The amendment would give the director the opportunity to deal with that issue. If appropriate, he or she would then be afforded the chance to make representations in what was considered the proper forum.
<P>
The Minister will be able to deal with those two amendments in about 30 seconds flat. Now, I shall return to a fascinating part of the contribution made by my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch, concentrating specifically on new clause 2. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising the serious issue of directors who fail to deliver their company accounts to the Registrar of Companies. The issue arising from that is that some would-be customers would not be able to undertake the proper investigation of the accounts to determine whether they were dealing with a company of repute and credit-worthiness. For those reasons, accounts and their filing are important requirements: we would all agree that they are essential armaments in the arsenal of statutory regulation of companies.
<P>
Until our proceedings in Committee, I was unaware of the fascinating tale of the People's Trust and its shortcomings. When the history of Al Fayed—or Fayed—is written, it will be yet another little jewel to be added to that long and exciting saga.
<P>
Very few people have managed to create so much excitement in so many arenas over such a long time. However, it is an excitement that should be brought to an end. It is wrong that someone should be able not to comply with provisions that are observed by all other companies. Of course, the CDDA already provides that the failure to file accounts is a serious matter, and persistent failure can justify disqualification. However, in some cases the Secretary of State cannot justify an application, and it should still be open to him to press the significance of such a failure in an application. The new clause would achieve that and I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch for spotting the loophole. It shows that experienced Members of Parliament can exploit such situations and give guidance to would-be—but I shall go no further with that argument, Mr. Gale. Suffice it to say that, if my hon. Friend decides to press new clause 2 to a Division, I shall be happy to support him.

<P>

<B>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Dr. Kim Howells):</B> I shall try to deal with the many amendments that have been spoken to and the questions that they have generated. However, I shall disappoint the hon. Member for Christchurch. I have no more information about the case of The People's Trust and Mr. A1 Fayed, fascinating though it was. Nevertheless, I shall try to deal with some of the principles that he sought to illustrate using that case.
<P>
We see no good reason why the Secretary of State should not be able to accept a disqualification undertaking from a director, as suggested in amendment No. 2, if he considers it expedient and in the public interest that the director should be disqualified in the circumstances set out in clause 8. No good purpose would be served. The contrary would apply if the Secretary of State were forced to apply to the court for a disqualification order in such circumstances.
<P>
The point of clause 6, which gained wide support when we consulted on it, is to take cases out of the court if the director and the Secretary of State agree that a period of disqualification is appropriate. That would help the courts and defendants, and it should result in earlier disqualifications. Where an undertaking has been given, it will be recorded on the register of disqualified directors, which is open to public scrutiny.
<P>
If amendment No. 4 was made, it would mean that if the Secretary of State considered that a director's conduct warranted a period of disqualification in excess of four years, he would have to apply to the court for a disqualification order even if the director was prepared to offer an undertaking for that greater period. That would defeat our intention to achieve earlier disqualifications in order to protect the public from unfit directors and to save the courts' time and the time and costs of defendants. I am sure that the Committee will agree that unfit directors should be disqualified as soon as possible. Being able to accept undertakings for an appropriate period, even for 15 years, is an important part of providing protection for the public.
<P>
The hon. Member for Christchurch asked whether I thought the provision would increase the number of disqualifications. We do not anticipate that being the case. At present, disqualification proceedings are instituted against all directors identified by the Secretary of State as being unfit and if he considers it appropriate in the public interest to institute proceedings. We do not expect the number of disqualifications to increase once the Bill is in force.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked a concomitant question about the explanatory notes, which do not refer to the saving mentioned in the regulatory impact assessment. The explanatory notes are not used to identify savings, which should be identified in the regulatory impact assessment; that is what I have done. The section in the explanatory notes that deals with the financial effects of the Bill is intended to point out expenditure that will fall on the Exchequer and it does precisely that.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> I am puzzled. As I understand it, proceedings start automatically against a director in this case. A reduction will not be brought, because proceedings are starting against everyone anyway. What proportion of the proceedings started is successful? I cannot understand why a director should plead guilty in such a way. It would be one hell of a guilty plea for a director to say that he will disqualify himself and accept that from the Department without defying it and asking to be taken to court.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> In the past two years, 2,800 disqualification orders have been made. About 10 per cent. are contested in court, 30 per cent. are settled between the parties under the Carecraft procedure and an order made 60 per cent. go to court with no defence submitted. Those figures are interesting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> Is not another contributory factor the possible reduction of costs to the director if he goes down that route, rather than the more expensive one of requiring legal advice? You know, Mr. Gale, how legal fees can escalate at the drop of a hat.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Yes. God knows I do not want to deprive any solicitor of a living, but the hon. Gentleman makes an important point that goes to the heart of the issue.
<P>
The hon. Member for Christchurch asked whether more serious cases that warranted a disqualification period of more than four years should be dealt with in court. He made an interesting reference to fixed penalty tickets. The Secretary of State will accept a disqualification undertaking from a person only if he thinks that it is appropriate to do so in the public interest and if the undertaking is for a period approximating to that which the Secretary of State considers the court would be likely to disqualify the individual for if he applied to the court for a disqualification order. Consequently, the period of disqualification resulting from a disqualification undertaking is expected to reflect the degree of unfit conduct involved. I hope that that eases the hon. Gentleman's worries.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> The Secretary of State might know the length of time that a court might impose as a disqualification if the matter went to court, but what access does a director contemplating the option of a disqualification period have to any case law involving disqualifications for varying periods?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The options are open to him. If he does not want to enter into an undertaking with the Secretary of State, he is at liberty not to do so. He is perfectly at liberty to do everything that he can do at the moment. All we are doing is adding another option, which will save the court time. It will also save money and the disqualification will be implemented much more quickly than under the existing system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> Will the Minister address the analogy of someone thinking about settling a case for damages? There are precedent books and reports of cases in which damages have been agreed for particular injuries, and it is possible to have access to those precedents through one's advisers. Will there be a system that enables directors to have access to the precedents to which the Secretary of State obviously has access?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> He will be able to do so by seeking legal advice. He will be able to hire the expertise and skills of lawyers, as at present. There is nothing to prevent that. He would be able to check whether the period proposed was appropriate. No one wants to deny any director opportunities that are now available. The provision simply creates another means for a disqualification undertaking to be agreed between a director and the Secretary of State.
<P>
As to amendments Nos. 5, 7 and 52, we do not believe that a statement of facts should be a precondition to acceptance by the Secretary of State of a disqualification undertaking. It is, after all, intended that the new provisions should allow for the disqualification of directors who agree that they should be disqualified—amazed though my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) is that anyone should agree to be disqualified. The Secretary of State will certainly seek to agree on the matter of unfit conduct before accepting an undertaking, in accordance with practice since the Woolf civil justice procedure reforms.
<P>
However, for a variety of reasons that may not always be possible. For the Secretary of State to be able to accept an undertaking only when a schedule had been agreed would be unduly restrictive and, in some instances, might run the risk of delaying the establishment of the protection that the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 is intended to provide. It would be likely also to increase costs if there were difficulty in agreeing the schedule.
<P>
Under the new provisions, the Secretary of State could accept an undertaking only if satisfied that the conditions under section 6(1) of the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 were met. In particular, he would need to be satisfied that the conduct of the director would make him unfit to be concerned in the management of a company. I should have thought that the disqualification of unfit directors as early as possible would be the issue of most importance to the public.
<P>
I turn now to amendment No. 6. The court will have discretion as to whether to make any order under new section 8A. We consider it appropriate to leave it to the court to consider what order, if any, to make, even if the application is made in the first two years of any disqualification period. The hon. Member for Christchurch may have overlooked the fact that under section 8 of the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986, there is no minimum period for a disqualification order or undertaking. Not allowing someone subject to an undertaking under section 8—as it is proposed to amend it—to apply to court within two years of giving an undertaking could result in the disqualification period expiring before an application could be made. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would agree that that cannot be right.
<P>
We do not consider it appropriate that the Secretary of State should, as new clause 1 would provide,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>publish guidelines as to the circumstances in which he may deem it expedient in the public interest that a disqualification order under section 6 shall be made<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or a disqualification undertaking accepted. Each case must be considered on its merits and in context, and the extent of the overall unfit conduct should be weighed before a decision is made. That is not a process that could be distilled into guidelines. However, we offer guidance on what would constitute unfit conduct.
<P>
The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) asked this morning what the Department of Trade and Industry does to inform people about its monitoring of the issues that we are considering. I meant to answer this morning, but could not get a word in edgeways. The Insolvency Service publishes and regularly updates a variety of leaflets aimed at providing information and assistance to the general public and others. Two of those leaflets, ``A Guide for Directors'' and ``Information on Disqualification Procedures'' give examples of conduct that might lead to disqualification proceedings. If the hon. Gentleman is suffering from insomnia one night, I urge him to look at those estimable leaflets.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that response, but many members on both sides of the Committee consider that there is inadequate regulation of insolvency practitioners.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby has been conducting such a crusade for many years. We have tried to strengthen regulation. Indeed, there is a huge new construct whereby we shall soon see some results. It will be beneficial in respect of monitoring the regulation of insolvency practitioners in general whom we have tried to bring along with us when constructing that new framework.
<P>
If the hon. Member for Christchurch is concerned that directors should be disqualified for failure to file their accounts—a matter that relates to People's Trust—he can rest assured that an application can already be made to the court under section 3 of the Act for persistent defaults in relation to various provisions of the companies legislation. It would include failure to file accounts at Companies House. Indeed, I am always writing to colleagues who contact me on behalf of companies that have filed late, or have forgotten to file their accounts at all and say that it was the fault of the late post. I operate a rigid system, otherwise a great sense of injustice is felt by those companies that genuinely file late and have to pay fines as a result.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> The Minister has referred to a provision that includes the word ``persistent''. I was worried about instances of one-off late filing, after which time the company was dissolved.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Perhaps I should not have used the word ``persistent''. I assure the hon. Gentleman that, if there were a serious case of accounts not being filed, we would follow it up as assiduously as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I direct the Minister to section 3(1) of the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986. I do not think that he will have the power to take action unless there have been persistent infringements.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I shall try by the time that we discuss the Bill on Report to obtain the exact definition of ``persistent'' or ``serious''. I know from experience that we have pursued several cases of one-off late filings.
<P>
In an application under section 6 of the 1986 Act, failure to file accounts may be used to demonstrate that the person's conduct makes him unfit to be concerned in the management of the company. The amendment, therefore, would be unnecessary and impractical. If the Secretary of State were to apply for an order under section 6 of the 1986 Act because the person had been a director of a company that had, within the previous year, been struck from the register of companies because it had failed to deliver company accounts, he would have to show unfit conduct. However, because generally in such circumstances no report would have been made from, say, an insolvency practitioner on the company's affairs, he would have a better means of establishing any unfit conduct by the directors to determine whether to make the application. In that sense, the amendment would be unworkable.
<P>
I refer now to amendment No. 71. We do not consider that the court should be restrained by the way that is proposed under the amendment. It is far more appropriate for the court to have discretion on whether to reduce the period for which an undertaking is to be in force or to provide for it to cease to be in force. However, a factor other than a material change in circumstances since the person gave the undertaking may be of sufficient importance to persuade the court to make an order under proposed new section 8A.
<P>
Under the proposed new section, the court will be able to take into account any factors that it considers relevant in making such an order. It will be helped in reaching a view by matters that the Secretary of State calls to its attention under subsection (2) of the proposed new section. I hope that that eases the anxieties of the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Page).
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 72 is designed to make it clear that a director against whom disqualification proceedings have commenced in the wrong court can apply for the proceedings to be transferred to the proper or more appropriate court. However, such a provision is unnecessary, as the court already has the power to transfer proceedings to another court when it is considered appropriate to do so. It is open to any party to the proceedings to apply to transfer those proceedings in any event.
<P>
I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby that the details of all disqualification undertakings will be maintained on the register of orders, which is held by Companies House and is open for inspection by the public even over the internet. We do not consider it appropriate to publish any more detail than that. What is important is that those who should be disqualified are disqualified and for an appropriate period. I hope that the hon. Member for Christchurch will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I rise to speak to new clause 2, which has some force, but is probably too draconian as drafted. Nevertheless, one of the main prices that people pay for incorporation for limited liability is full disclosure. The Minister and I discussed that matter at length during the various stages of the Limited Liability Partnerships Bill. I strongly believe in full disclosure if people hide behind limited liability, and I believe that the Minister fully subscribes to the view that those who want limited liability must allow full disclosure.
<P>
Failure to deliver company accounts is a grave breach of the directors' duty to make full disclosure. The accounts go to the heart of a company's state of solvency and provide a useful history of the company's activities over the previous year. I hope that the Minister agrees that the least that directors should do is submit their company's accounts to Companies House for public examination.
<P>
As I said, I like the thrust of the new clause, but it is too draconian. I refer the Committee to clause 6, whose provisions are mandatory. Perhaps the solution to an acknowledged problem is for the Minister to consider whether changes might be made on Report, or other changes might be introduced to allow the Registrar of Companies to serve a notice on an individual to provide the necessary accounts such that only one failure, not persistent failure, to lodge one set of accounts would trigger the disqualification procedures. I hope that the Minister will consider that, because in some cases failure to deliver just one set of accounts is of the greatest importance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon. His support for the thrust new clause 2 is welcome and was well expressed.
<P>
The Minister referred to section 3 of the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986. His quotation related to persistence and implied that that section would deal with the mischief that I had described in relation to the People's Trust, but, on reflection, he will see that it does not cover such activities. Section 3(1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The court may make a disqualification order against a person where it appears to it that he has been persistently in default in relation to provisions of the companies legislation requiring any return account or other document to be filed with, delivered or sent, or notice of any matter to be given to the registrar of companies.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on to state that a person's persistence can be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>conclusively proved by showing that in the 5 years ending with the date of the application he has been adjudged guilty. . . of three or more defaults in relation to those provisions.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
On the basis of statutory interpretation, I believe that it would be difficult for anybody to establish persistence.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I am trying to be helpful. As the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon told us, failure to file accounts is a serious offence. Section 5 of the CDDA provides that a director who is prosecuted for not filing accounts can be disqualified on the basis of that single offence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> If so—[Interruption]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. About half a dozen private conversations are occurring around the Room. The House, in its infinite wisdom, has provided Green Benches in the Corridor where such conversations can be conducted in comfort.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I am grateful, Mr. Gale.
<P>
Is the Minister saying that, under section 5 of the CDDA, it would have been possible to bring a prosecution leading to a conviction against any of the directors of the People's Trust? My reading of that section implies that it would not be possible to do so. It covers circumstances in which it appears that a person has been guilty of the offence in the course of winding up a company.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I apologise to the hon. Gentleman—the section applies to three default offences in five years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I am grateful to the Minister, who has already accepted that we are discussing a mischief that should be dealt with. He is now conceding in his own inimitable way that existing legislation does not deal with the matter. Even if new clause 2 is far from perfect, I hope that, having recognised the problem, he will undertake to consider it and to deal with the loophole on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): Like the hon. Gentleman, I quickly read section 5 of the CDDA to find out how it could cover the position. I am grateful to the Minister for his clarification. I have a lot of sympathy with the thrust of new clause 2, but does the hon. Member for Christchurch that it is draconian as it would penalise many innocent directors for acts or omissions of which they might not have been entirely aware?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> Perhaps the new clause is too draconian. I am keen only to explore the possibility of coming up with a form of words on which hon. Members can agree and which can be incorporated into the Bill on Report. I want a provision which is not too draconian and which would give notice and discretion. It is not as if no notice was given in the case to which I referred: two letters were sent to the registered office and a notice was published in the London Gazette. Although Mr. Fayed said that the notice came as a great shock to him and that he would remedy matters immediately, he never did. One assumes that notices posted to responsible solicitors and company secretaries will be received in due course.
<P>
Having heard the comments the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon and the Minister, I might table a new clause or a fresh amendment on Report. It might be better to draft an amendment to section 3 of the CDDA rather than propose a new clause. I see the Minister nodding. It would help if he stated that he and his officials will see whether the lacuna can be filled.

<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I shall certainly look at the matter seriously.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. Repetition of the other points that he made in response to my amendments will not strengthen the argument in any way, but perhaps I can tease out his thoughts on the point made by the hon. Member for Great Grimsby. If someone were offered an undertaking for seven years and did not accept it, saying that he would go to court, would it be open to the Secretary of State to argue before the court that a period of disqualification in excess of seven years should be imposed? If the Secretary of State was likely to argue for a period in excess of seven years, it would be entering into plea bargaining: to put the pressure on the director he could say, ``Accept this now, or you may find that, when we go to court, the whole issue of sentence will be at large.''
<P>
In disqualification of directors, unlike the matters covered by other criminal legislation, the Department has an important influence on the length of disqualification imposed. Can the Minister assure us that, if, in accordance with the criteria enunciated by the Minister determining an appropriate period, the matter goes before the court, the Secretary of State makes an offer to a director to accept a disqualification period and the director says, ``No, I prefer to fight it in court,'' the Secretary of State will not reply, ``In that case, I shall ask for a longer period.'' That would introduce a completely different concept.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The answer is no. The process will not amount to plea bargaining. Generally, proceedings will be started if a person considered to be unfit is not prepared to consent to a period of disqualification that the Secretary of State considers similar to that which is likely to be imposed by the courts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> Is the Minister saying that, if the matter goes before the court, the offer that was made can be referred to as a maximum, and that his representative in the court will not argue for a longer period?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> If the director elects to go to court, the court will have to decide on that period. The Secretary of State cannot tell the court what to decide.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I agree that the Secretary of State cannot tell the court what to do, but he can advise it. We are left with a situation in which, although the details of those people who have accepted undertakings to be disqualified will be included on the register, the circumstances leading to those undertakings being given will not be available on the public record. A major gap remains in the legislation that will militate against transparency and accountability. I am sorry that the Minister has not been prepared to accept my suggestions, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 58, in page 6, line 2, at beginning insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(A1) Section 17 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (general duties of an administrator) is amended by inserting a new subsection (4) as follows—
<P>
``(4) The administrator shall be under the same duties to report suspected offences as are imposed on a liquidator under sections 218 and 219.''
<P>
(A2) Section 48 of the Insolvency Act (Report by administrative receiver) is amended by inserting a new subsection (6A) as follows—
<P>
``(6A)The Administrative receiver shall be under the same duties to report suspected offences as are imposed on a liquidator under section 218 and 219.''.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is important to point out what clause 9 would achieve if it remained unamended. The clause amends section 218 of the Insolvency Act 1986, and provides that, in a winding-up, a court may direct the liquidator to report apparent criminal misconduct by past or present company officers or members of the company to the Secretary of State rather than to the Director of Public Prosecutions. It also requires a liquidator in a voluntary winding-up to report suspicions of criminal misconduct by company officers past or present or by members of the company to the Secretary of State rather than the DPP. Lastly, it provides that the Secretary of State may take powers under the Companies Act 1985 when investigating the alleged misconduct. In the case of a winding-up in Scotland, such misconduct would still be reported to the Lord Advocate.
<P>
The amendment would simply extend to administrators and administrative receivers the duty to report breaches that is now incorporated in clause 9. I hope that the Minister will either accept the amendment or explain why administrators and administrative receivers are excluded from the provision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I rise to speak briefly on the matter, because the change will lead to a substantial increase in the role of the Department of Trade and Industry as prosecutor—a role that has not always been pursued to unanimous acclaim.
<P>
Earlier this year, I had the privilege of taking part in all the stages of the passage through the House of Commons of the Bill that has become the Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate Act 2000. It is a Law Commission Act, which rightly provides for an independent inspectorate to scrutinise the procedures, actions, performance and effectiveness of the Crown Prosecution Service. I hope that the Minister will acknowledge the importance of his Department's prosecution section and that it should be subject to the same independent scrutiny as the CPS. Will he also speak to his learned colleagues the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General to ensure that the independent CPS inspectorate has the additional role of scrutinising and monitoring the performance, actions, procedures and effectiveness of his Department's prosecutors?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Strictly speaking, those comments do not apply to the amendment but to clause 9. However, as we are embracing the clause stand part debate as well as the amendment, I am quite prepared to let the Minister respond.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> If I may, Mr. Gale, I shall deal first with amendment No. 58. Our intention is to achieve specific objectives. Although we have had wide-ranging discussions about it, we intend that the Bill should remain tightly focused. One of our objectives is to provide that liquidators should no longer report allegations of misconduct to the Director of Public Prosecutions as is currently required under section 218 of the Insolvency Act 1986, but to the Secretary of State. Section 218 of the 1986 Act deals only with the reporting of conduct by liquidators, as set out in part IV of that Act, on the winding up of companies registered under the Companies Acts.
<P>
The Insolvency Act 1986 does not state to whom administrative receivers and administrators should report misconduct. While it may make sense to include a duty for administrative receivers and administrators to report their suspicions of criminal misconduct, such a provision would go beyond what we have set out to achieve in this Bill.
<P>
The amendments made to section 218 by clause 9 of the Bill will mean that when, in a winding-up by the court—often referred to as a compulsory winding-up—the court directs the liquidator to report apparent criminal misconduct, it will be reported to the Secretary of State and not to the Director of Public Prosecutions, as is currently the case. Additionally, a liquidator in a voluntary winding-up will be required to report suspicions of criminal misconduct to the Secretary of State and not the DPP, which will streamline reporting of alleged offences and put matters in the hands of investigators with requisite powers more quickly.
<P>
The purpose behind clause 9 is to remove what has proved to be an inefficiency. Currently, under section 218, allegations of misconduct in England and Wales are reported to the DPP. After review, however, the majority are passed on to the Secretary of State who, in appropriate cases, will usually prosecute the offence. Under clause 9, which would amend section 218, the alleged misconduct will be reported directly to the Secretary of State, instead of to the DPP. That will remove the existing deficiency and seems to be a sensible improvement.
<P>
It is considered inappropriate for the DPP to be involved in potentially criminal matters before they have been investigated by the police or by an investigative body. The role of the DPP and CPS should be to provide an objective overview of the case and to take a decision on whether to prosecute after the case has been investigated by the DTI. We did not, and do not, intend to revisit the Insolvency Act 1986 to consider how office holders in other insolvency procedures should report misconduct. Office holders know to whom they can report, and no further provision is needed in that regard. I ask the hon. Member for Christchurch to withdraw his amendment. I shall take great delight in speaking to my colleagues at the DTI about the matters raised by the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for explaining why administrators and administrative procedures are excluded from clause 9. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The amendments will largely replace the substance of clause 11. That has been done because what would have been new subsection (5) of section 421 of the Insolvency Act 1986 could have had an unfortunate effect. It could have prejudiced the marketability of property where the deceased's interest in jointly owned property passed to the survivor on death, irrespective of whether the deceased was solvent or not. Prospective purchasers of properties that involved an inherited interest could have been deterred from proceeding with a purchase because the deceased's severable share may have been treated as having vested in any trustee subsequently appointed. We would not want a disposal of a property by a surviving partner to be made unnecessarily difficult because prospective purchasers were concerned that they might not have a good title if the deceased's estate was insolvent.
<P>
The amendments are intended to address that problem and to ensure that the value of any interest in jointly owned property lost by the operation of the survivorship rules is still to be recoverable for the benefit of the insolvent estate and, therefore, for the creditors of the deceased insolvent. We propose to achieve that by enabling the trustee of the insolvent estate to make an application to the court for a monetary order against the survivor in such cases. The only purpose for which such an order may be made is for securing that debts and other liabilities to which the insolvent estate is subject are met—even if the deceased's interest in the property was worth more.
<P>
The scope of the order will be limited to what was lost to the estate when the beneficial interest passed to the joint owner on the debtor's death, even if the sum required to pay what is due in respect of the deceased's estate is larger. In making any monetary order, the court is to have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the interests of the former joint owner as well as those of the deceased's creditors. However, unless the circumstances are exceptional, the court must assume that the interests of the deceased's creditors outweigh all other considerations. Additionally, we propose that such an order cannot be made if the petition for the insolvency administration order is presented more than five years after the death of the insolvent. Provision will apply only in cases where the petition for the insolvency administration order is presented after the new provision comes into force.
<P>
Clause 11, as amended, will continue to address the effects of the Court of Appeal decision in the case re: Palmer (Deceased). Although we have adopted a different way of achieving that objective, the creditors of an insolvent should not, as far as is reasonably possible, be in a significantly worse position where a debtor has died than they would be were he still living.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> The amendment is designed to deal with what may be called the mischief of retrospectivity. It is not reasonable that the provision, as described by the Minister, should apply in cases where people have already died. My amendment would more effectively implement the Minister's earlier undertaking that there should not be any retrospectivity by making it clear that the provision would apply only to people who die after the enactment of the legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I should like the Minister to elaborate on the monetary order that must be made against the surviving trustee. I take it that that order must be registrable and that if it is not registered, the bona fide purchaser for value without notice will be completely protected. Will the Minister confirm that important point, to protect the country's commercial activities?
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I ask the Minister why the amendment appears now and not before. It should be of public concern that the Government have tabled such a substantial, far-reaching amendment at this late stage in the legislative process. It did not emerge following a sudden blinding light on the road to Damascus—mrlor in the Corridors outside—an hour or so ago.
<P>
The Government had the advantage of reading a draft form of the detailed and critical submission on the clause from the Law Society. My hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch will know that that Law Society critique was issued in October 1999, over a year ago. Its concerns about the retrospective aspect of the clause as drafted were shared by the Trade and Industry Committee, of which my hon. Friend is such a distinguished member. The DTI offered bland assurances to that Committee that its concerns would be addressed. In the event, the clause appeared without amendment. Specific matters of concern were drawn to the Government's attention on Second Reading and in Committee in another place and they are before us today. I do not take issue with the amendment, but I should be grateful if the Minister would explain why we were not given the privilege of considering it and discussing it much earlier.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I shall answer the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire first and as candidly as possible. The amendment is so late because the issues it addresses are difficult and complex. I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that answer, because it is the only one I have.
<P>
Amendment (a) was tabled by the hon. Member for Christchurch. Hon. Members will appreciate that we must strike a balance between the interests of creditors who have not been paid by a deceased insolvent and a survivor who has become sole owner of what he or she formerly owned jointly with a deceased insolvent. We are not convinced that the creditors of an insolvent should be in a worse position if the debtor has died than if he is living. Limiting the application of the new provision as set out in amendment No. 36 strikes the appropriate balance. Prior to the Palmer case, it was understood that the survivor would automatically have been deprived of the deceased's interests, or the creditors would have got the debtor's entire share, with no thought been given to the survivor's situation or interest.
<P>
The new clause does not treat the survivor so harshly. It provides for the court to have the discretion to make a monetary order against the survivor; that order will deal with only so much of the value lost to the estate as is needed to meet the debts and other liabilities to which the estate is subject. A court will make such an order only after it has weighed the interests of both the survivor and the deceased's creditors. That balances the exercise. The court must assume that the interests of the deceased's creditors outweigh all other considerations unless the circumstances are exceptional. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Gentleman will ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
On the point made by the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon, there is no need for third parties to be protected. The clause does not provide for any alteration in the ownership of the property. It will be open only to the trustee of an insolvent estate to apply for a monetary order against the former joint owner; he will not be able to have the deceased's former share vested in him. If the survivor cannot pay over the sum that the court has ordered him to pay the trustee—because, for example, he has given the property away to a third party—it is up to the trustee to pursue the survivor in the usual ways. He would seek to enforce the order: he could, if necessary, make the survivor bankrupt when the disposal of the property might be challenged as a transaction at an under value or the trustee could seek a charging order to secure payment of the sum against the property of the former joint owner.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> How long does that liability hang over the head of the survivor of joint property?
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I mentioned a time limit earlier, but I do not want to give the Committee another wrong answer so I shall check and reply to the hon. Gentleman. [Interruption.] In the meantime, I shall try talking about Pontypridd rugby club.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Fascinating though that may be, if the hon. Gentleman is ingenious enough to work Pontypridd rugby club into the Insolvency Bill, he may do so, provided that he remains in order.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> We in Pontypridd are certainly not insolvent at present, but the shambles of—I almost said English—rugby union—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is definitely out of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howells:</B> I am reliably informed that the proposal would become statutorily barred under the Limitation Act 1980.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> The Minister dealt with my amendment summarily. Will he explain why it is not retrospective legislation to change the position for people who have died? If the law is changed, surely it should apply to people who die after the legislation is implemented.
<P>
The Government stated in paragraph 20 of their response to the Trade and Industry Committee's report:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We note the Committee's comments. It will be made clear that provisions will not have retrospective effect.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I remain to be convinced that the Government's amendments will not have retrospective effect in the case of people who have already died and who are, by definition, unable to alter their position.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I did try to respond to the hon. Gentleman and I am sorry that he felt that his amendment was summarily dismissed. We have provided expressly that an order will be available against the personal representatives of a survivor of a deceased insolvent who dies after the making of an insolvency administration order. To do more than that would be to cause undue difficulties for personal representatives because it would affect the estate. There is no issue about a former joint owner being insolvent.
<P>
If the hon. Member for Christchurch wants to pursue the matter, I could examine the European convention on human rights, which is relevant. I do not know whether that is behind his question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> The European convention on human rights is usually at the forefront of my mind, but on this occasion it was not. Assessing the compatibility of the Government amendments with the concerns expressed by the Trade and Industry Committee was at the forefront of my mind. Perhaps the Minister will explain how he is complying with the assertion in paragraph 20 of the Government's response to the Trade and Industry Committee that

Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
I do not intend to detain the Committee for long. The new clause sets out a basic and important principle, also enunciated by the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire, that should apply to all insolvency operations. That principle is one of objection to the vested interests involved in banks using an accountancy firm to do a report on a company and subsequently using the same firm to carry out the liquidation. The practice has been banned by the Royal Bank of Scotland. The Minister will be increasingly hard pressed in future to accept that principle, which the Government should implement when they come to regulate accountancy. I shall be interested to hear his reaction.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The new clause would prevent people who are appointed by banks to prepare reports on the financial status of a company in relation to a proposed or an agreed voluntary arrangement from accepting a subsequent appointment in relation to the same company as a supervisor of a voluntary arrangement or liquidator of the company. I have sympathy with the approach and I am giving it serious consideration. However, it is not appropriate to the Bill. Furthermore, the concerns of my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby about investigating accountants becoming administrative receivers should not apply in this respect. An individual can become the supervisor of a voluntary arrangement only if his appointment is agreed to by more than 75 per cent. in value of those creditors able to vote on whether a voluntary arrangement should be accepted, and creditors for secured sums are not allowed to vote. Despite having heard my hon. Friend express the principle behind the new clause, I urge him to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> I appreciate that deeply moving plea. I am grateful to hear that my hon. Friend the Minister has some sympathy with the principle and will consider it in future, despite its irrelevance to the Bill. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the Chairman do report the Bill, as amended, to the House.

You brought a light touch and contributed to the relative good nature that has prevailed in the Committee, even though you have witnessed, as I have, the Government's desperate attempts to plug the Bill's weaknesses and holes. It is a matter of regret that you will not be in the Chair on Report to see the saga through to its end.

Several matters that were mentioned in Committee will need to be teased out and refined. However, all that is yet to come. In the meantime, thank you, Mr. Gale.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I echo everything that has been said about your expert handling of the Committee, Mr. Gale, and it applies to Mrs. Michie, too. Unlike the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire, I do not desire that you preside over Third Reading and Report—after all, there is only so much punishment that any human being can tolerate.

<B>The Chairman:</B> I am pleased to tell the Committee that the three hon. Gentlemen's recent remarks are entirely out of order, as they have nothing whatever to do with the question. However, in the same vein, I should like to thank the Committee for the courtesy with which the debate has been conducted. It has been good humoured and I am deeply saddened that I shall not be able to preside over further proceedings.
<P>
On behalf of the Committee, I should like to thank the Officers of the House and Hansard staff for their work, without which we could not do ours.
