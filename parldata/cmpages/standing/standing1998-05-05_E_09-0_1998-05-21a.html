(Except clauses 1, 7, 10, 11, 25, 27, 30, 75, 119 and 147) <P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): On a point of order, Mr. Butterfill. Looking at the names associated with amendment No. 125, I find myself in unusual company. Perhaps you could make it clear to whoever publishes the amendment paper that I did not table the amendment and I am not party to it. I do not know how my name got there. I am trying to lend a bit of tone to what would otherwise be a vulgar affair.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sorry if the hon. Gentleman has been embarrassed. I shall have the matter investigated and, if necessary, have the record corrected.
<H4><center>Clause 47</center></H4>
<H4><center>Gifts in kind for relief in poor countries</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, [this day], That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Question again proposed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Fallon </B>(Sevenoaks): Amendment No. 125 concerns the film industry, where it is rare for someone to want to remove his name from the credits.
<P>
In your absence this morning, Mr. Butterfill, we dealt with two specific aspects of clause 27 the definition of educational establishment and the list of recipient countries. I apologise to the Economic Secretary for the number of general points that I want to raise with her. If she cannot respond to them today, perhaps she will write to me.
<P>
First, the clause introduces a differential tax arrangement for charities. We are distinguishing between charities at home and their operations overseas. I suspect that that will lead us into some difficulty. What does she think about that and how does the clause fit in with the conclusions of the charity law review?
<P>
Secondly, what criteria will be used to judge the success or failure of the scheme? It is important that it is benchmarked in some way. The Chancellor's hopes are set out in his press release, but the criteria are important.
<P>
Thirdly, what is the starting date? I understood that the scheme was to start on 1 April. Perhaps some of the donations can be backdated because that is the start of the tax year. I am sure that the Economic Secretary will appreciate that the scheme has a relatively short shelf-life. It is, I think, due to finish on 31 December 2000 which gives charities only two and a half years. Can the end date be stretched beyond the millennium to the end of the financial year 31 March 2001, 4 April 2001 or whatever. That might make it easier for a charity's fiscal year.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): The hon. Gentleman is concerned about the length of the extension to the gift aid scheme. I hope that his hon. Friends will support my amendment to clause 48.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> The hon. Gentleman will discover the answer to that question when we reach clause 48.
<P>
As the scheme has a relatively limited shelf-life, it is important to get it up and running as quickly as possible. Will gifts through the scheme begin on 1 April or from Royal Assent? The first designated day will probably not be until after Royal Assent. If the Chancellor wanted the scheme to begin on 1 April, there may be a case for stretching it a few months into 2001. Fourthly, has the Economic Secretary considered how the scheme might be more widely promoted? Those charities that are aware of it welcome it, but has she other steps in mind to advertise it and ensure that it is sufficiently well known?
<P>
Fifthly, the Government want funding to be transferred directly to educational establishments in reply to amendment No. 129, the Economic Secretary said "directly and quickly" so why must gifts be channelled only through charities? Could they not be given directly to educational establishments? The definition of charities is fairly loose. Would it include, for example, non-governmental organisations and United Nations agencies? Is it a particularly British definition of charities, or is it the intention, as with "educational establishment" to leave the wording sufficiently loose to avoid donors being tied down?
<P>
Sixthly I apologise for the length of the list I am puzzled by subsection (2). Why is the donor restricted to active trade or manufacture in the article to be donated before relief may be claimed? That may simply be a read-across from other legislation covering charitable giving. I remember from my experience as an education Minister that when we tried to define educational gifts in the context of attracting relief, we defined them in that way, but I wonder whether that should apply in the Bill. Why should not someone be able to make a gift, whether or not they are involved in manufacturing it?
<P>
Seventhly, under subsection (4)(b), if a donor receives any benefit he is taxed on it. That puzzles me. Would the amount of benefit have to be substantial and what is the purpose of taxing the donor?
<P>
Eighthly, I wonder whether the Economic Secretary accepts the point made to me by a number of charities about the paperchase involved. Perhaps she has some proposals for simplifying the procedure. The clause requires the charity to provide notification. The individual making the payment will have to certify what he is doing, and the charity will then have to undertake the necessary paperwork to reclaim the tax. That seems to be a complicated paperchase and perhaps there is some way in which the procedure could be simplified.
<P>
None of these points are intended to be in any way critical or churlish and I emphasise that we welcome the proposal. We understand that it has been widely and warmly welcomed across the charity world and we need to ensure that it is swift, effective and relatively simple to operate. The Economic Secretary may be able to[Mr. Fallon]
reassure me as successfully as she reassured the Committee this morning.
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): I support everything that my hon. Friend said and I rise to emphasise his point about the institution or unit defined in the clause as the recipient of the gift. Clause 47(1)(a) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"any article falling within subsection (2) below is given to a charity".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is not clear whether that refers to a charity in the United Kingdom, a registered charity, or a charity falling within the common law definition. If the provision applies only to charities in the United Kingdom, it would be helpful to know whether there will be any further definition of the type of charity that will be eligible. If charities that are not United Kingdom-based, but operate within countries defined as eligible, are included I can see very good reasons why they should be further definition will be required to avoid abuse.
<P>
Many third-world countries, as I learned from direct experience in an African country, have no charity legislation as such. The definition of a charity in such countries depends on a common law interpretation and some activities of some bodies operating as charities there would not, I suspect, be acceptable to Her Majesty's Government for the purposes stipulated in clause 47. It would therefore be helpful if the Economic Secretary could clarify that matter when dealing with the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks (Mr. Fallon) about non-governmental agencies, especially United Nations agencies, which may be direct recipients of such donations.
<H4><center>[Mr. Don Touhig in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Helen Liddell):</B> I think that I am slighly out of synch with the hon. Member for Sevenoaks in the number of questions that he asked. I think that I counted nine questions, but he said that he asked eight. If I introduce any unnecessary ambiguities, I shall seek to correct them, if not today then certainly in writing.
<P>
Before I begin, I would like to thank the hon. Member for Sevenoaks for his positive attitude to the clause. To put it in context, the clause is a specific recognition of the millennium and provides an opportunity for people and companies to contribute to the millennium in a way that benefits those who are much less fortunate than we are.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Chancellor's main concern in this respect is to increase literacy and the provision of education in the world's poorest countries. Under the Mauritius mandate, which he announced last autumn, we made it clear that we were committed to reducing poverty and debt in highly indebted poor countries and those countries experiencing specific difficulties. The clause aims to enable business to show its support for education and is linked to clause 48, which provides wider opportunities to give the kind of assistance that such countries require.
<P>
Tax relief is already available to businesses giving used plant or machinery to schools or colleges in the United Kingdom. I am sure that many of us know of instances of local companies donating equipment to schools and colleges in our constituencies. A major computer manufacturer with a base close to where I live has been generous in the assistance that it has given to schools. The clause extends the tax relief provision to similar donations to educational projects in the poorest countries, the purpose of which is to give children a better start in life. We will mark the millennium in our contributions as individuals, as companies and as a country.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman has referred to the fact that the clause creates a differential rate of tax for charities. We are currently engaged in a review of the taxation of charities, and it would be inappropriate given the significance of the millennium to delay the introduction of such a provision until that review was completed. I cannot tell the hon. Gentleman what stage we have reached in charities review it would be inappropriate to do so as it is not completed but he asked what criteria would be used to judge whether the provision was a success. The Government will have to monitor that to ensure that it proves effective and to obtain feedback from the charities involved.
<H4><center>[Mr. John Butterfill in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
In response to the point made by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, those are UK-registered charities. We must be specific; it is no help being wide ranging and missing the point of what we are trying to do. The idea came up in a discussion with major UK-registered charities at a reception in No. 11 Downing Street in December last year. Indeed, the churches were also involved in that.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the start date; it cannot start until the Bill has received Royal Assent, but that gives us an opportunity to fine-tune the mechanics. It will operate for a period of two and a half years. We have to set a date because we could talk indefinitely. We are all aware of the debate about what is the exact date of the millennium, which is beginning to assume the proportions of how many angels can dance on the head of a needle.

<P>

<B>Mr Hammond:</B> On a point of clarification, the hon. Lady used the term "registered charity". My hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks has drawn it to my attention that clause 47(9) says that the word "charity" will have the same meaning as in section 506 of the Taxes Act 1988. That section says that a charity means any body of persons or trust established for charitable purposes only. That does not necessarily mean a registered charity in the sense of being registered with the Charity Commissioners. Perhaps the hon. Lady will clarify which it is.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Let me be specific; that was a helpful intervention. It means charities based here. I am sorry if I used the wrong language inadvertently.
<P>
We must be clear about what the end date is likely to be. By that time, the review of charity taxation will have been completed and, hopefully, other arrangements for charities will be put into place.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked a valid point about promotion. It is important to promote this. There has been a lot of publicity about gift aid, but much less publicity about this valuable aspect. The Chancellor is considering that and discussing with charities how best to promote this useful and worth means of assisting poorer nations, although it is perhaps less sexy than gift aid. We are working hard to develop a promotional strategy, so it will be up to us to obtain the advice of development and aid charities about the most suitable time to launch this to ensure that it does not conflict with other initiatives.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sevenoaks asked why we did not let businesses give directly to schools and colleges and why the gift must be made through a charity. We had a brief debate this morning about human rights issues and about ensuring that gifts were specifically targeted. It is not practical to define "educational establishments" in such overseas countries because they range widely. A highly westernised, developed country's analysis of an educational establishment is different from that elsewhere so it would be difficult to police the measure if we did not use charities as intermediaries, bearing in mind the important points raised this morning about ensuring that donations were charitable donations for the people not for the regimes, because some of those regimes are not especially attractive.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sevenoaks also asked whether the donor would be taxed on any benefit that he received. I am plucking this out of the air, but it is not inconceivable that a product is donated to a school, but a charge is made to operate that product and therefore a company makes a profit as a consequence of that donation. The provision is intended to ensure fairness, and no mischief is involved. It will ensure that there is to use that unfortunate expression a level playing field.
<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) asked about paperwork. We want paperwork to be kept to the minimum that is necessary to operate the system effectively. It is well known that charities take the lead in the handling of paperwork. They are pretty effective at handling the bureaucratic side of giving, and we shall build on their skills. It is also important to recognise that the donor has to signal his or her intention to give to a charity, which has the responsibility of notifying the Revenue. We shall ensure that the system is monitored as effectively as possible.
<P>
I hope that I have covered all the points that were raised by the hon. Member for Sevenoaks. I got slightly out of synch in answering them, and if, when I read Hansard, I realise that I have missed any I shall ensure that he gets a written response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> The Economic Secretary's comments have been helpful, and I welcome her commitment to simplify the paperwork. The forms for the give-as-you-earn scheme, for example, are relatively simple, but I hope that she will do something to eliminate unnecessary paperwork. She accepted that the donor and the charity have to notify the Revenue, but the system needs to be as simple as possible.
<P>
The Economic Secretary has done her best, and she made helpful comments on all my questions, but I want to return to my question about the end date. The start date has slipped a little the Chancellor's press release states that he hopes that the millennium fund will be in place by the beginning of the financial year 1998-99, but that cannot now happen. That was no one's fault there was proper consultation, which we fully accept. The Economic Secretary confirmed that the first designated day cannot be until after Royal Assent. In that case, should not the scheme be extended by three months to the end of the financial year 1999-2000? That would have the added benefit of making the end date fit neatly with the end of the financial year. The scheme would not finish exactly at the end of the year 2000, but it would finish at the end of the financial year 1999-2000, which would be neater and simpler for all concerned. If she cannot concede that point immediately, will she at least undertake to consider it?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I cannot concede that point. I am sorry to have to disappoint the hon. Gentleman, but we had to take a decision about when the scheme will end.
<P>
The Opposition's points are well received, and we shall do our best to ensure that the House's determination to make the clause work is borne in mind. By the time that this aspect of charitable giving is completed I hope that the new charity arrangements will be in place. That system will allow for the development of a focused regime for charities.
<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge asked about taxes, and I probably glossed over the matter too rapidly in my response. "Charities", for the purposes of the Taxes Act 1988, refers to registered charities and to tax-effective giving. The Charities Commission does not require all charities to be registered. Many smaller charities, which may operate locally, do not have to register. If a charity is charitable within charities law, clauses 47 and 48 will apply irrespective of whether the charity is registered. If the body is recognised as a legal entity as a charity, the clauses will apply. I hope that that clarifies the situation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I am a little disappointed with the Economic Secretary's response to my point on shelf-life. The scheme was supposed to last two years and nine months. We have lost four months becausse it cannot come into operation until after Royal Assent. I wanted her to add just three months on the other end. I accept that the scheme has to finish at a specific time because otherwise it would run on and on. I should simply like her to put back three of the four months that we have lost. I hope that she will think about that.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for returning to that point. I cannot give him a commitment now but I will consider the matter in case there is some way in which we can make progress.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank the Economic Secretary for further clarifying the position on registered or unregistered charities. I understand her intention in stating that it applies to charities that are based in the UK only. However, I am not sure that section 506 of the Taxes Act 1988 makes that clear. It says:
[Mr. Hammond]
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"`charity' means any body of persons or trust established for charitable purposes only".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A general principle of tax law that I am unaware of may override that and limit the provision to UK-based charities. Do the Government intend to apply the measure to UK-based charities only? Will the Economic Secretary consider whether further clarification is required?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I thought that I had given the Government's clear intention. I keep my copy of the Taxes Act in my locker downstairs and I do not have time to spring down and get hold of it. I am trying to be as clear and helpful as possible. UK charities have been specifically defined by a legal decision in the courts. That will help the appropriate authorities decide how the clause should be administered.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 47 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 48</center></H4>
<H4><center>Gifts of money for relief in poor countries</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): I beg to move amendment No. 120, in page 27, line 44, leave out "2000" and insert "2001".
<P>
The amendment would make a small improvement to a welcome initiative. Last week we saw thousands of people in Birmingham link arms in the campaign to break the chain of debt. It showed how many people in this country are concerned about third world debt. They will welcome the Government's proposal. I am sure that many hon. Members have received from their constituents little postcards with  1 coins indeed, in some cases, 20p coins Sellotaped to them. I hope that they passed them on to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I am sure that you, Mr. Butterfill, will have done so. It is clear that our constituents are prepared to give in small amounts. The initiative is an attempt to make it easier for them to do so. We welcome the measures in the clause that allow tax relief on payments made by direct debit over a period of time on the minimum amount of  100.
<P>
Our amendment would go slightly further. The hon. Member for Sevenoaks wants to extend the scheme by three months. We want to extend it by a full year. That is not just to be more generous but to correct a mistake. We think that there may have been a printing error because the Government have clearly not understood when the new millennium starts. It begins on 1 January 2001. A tax incentive for the new millennium that ends before it officially starts seems odd. It would be much better for it to end on the last day of the first year of the new millennium.
<P>
The authority on that is the Royal Greenwich Observatory. I am not making a partisan point. Baroness Trumpington in 1994 told the other place:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The historically correct date on which the new millennium will begin is 1st Jauary 2001."</UL></FONT>
<P>
A Labour Member who questioned the Minister without Portfolio on 20 April 1998 made this telling point:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"When we are emphasising the need for arithmetic to be taught correctly in schools, I would have thought it incumbent on Her Majesty's Government to mark the arithmetically correct time of the millennium change." [Official Report, 20 April 1998; Vol. 310, c. 473.]
<P></UL></FONT>
The hon. Member for Thurrock (Mr. Mackinlay), who is a constituent of mine, makes the point clearly.
<P>
A start date for the millenium of 1 January 2001 is based on the theory that, when the calendar changed from BC to AD, there was no year 0. On that basis the first year of the first millennium was 1 AD, and the first day of the second millennium was 1 January 1001. It is logical to conclude, therefore, that the first day of the next millennium will be 1 January 2001.

<P>

<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> If the hon. Gentleman is so concerned with the correctness of the date given in the clause, why did he not table an equivalent amendent to the previous clause, which gives the same date?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> If accepted, the amendment would establish the principle, and we might therefore return to the previous clause and correct that as well. In any event the point is valid, and relates to gifts of money for relief.
<P>
In her reply to the hon. Member for Sevenoaks during the previous debate, the Economic Secretary justified the end date given in the clause by saying that, by the time it is reached, the Government's review of charity taxation will be complete. However, the effects of the amendment would be modest. It would change the end date by just one year, and would not interfere with the conclusions of the Government's review.
<P>
I was heartened to learn during the Economic Secretary's response to the hon. Member for Sevenoaks that she might consider the matter. Having heard my arguments, I hope that she will be encouraged to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) asked me some time ago whether I would support the amendment. Being a reasonable man, I wanted first to hear the case for it. Having done so, I shall tell him why I do not support it. First, the amendment is inconsistent with the date given in clause 47. Secondly, it does not deal with the point that I have been making, and which the Economic Secretary has emphasised. A scheme of this kind must have an end date because it relates specifically to the millennium.
<P>
I sought an extension of three months in order largely to compensate for the four months that we have lost since the scheme started. However, Conservative Members will not support the extension of the end date by a whole year because of an arcane, official Liberal Democrat definition of the millennium.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Seldom do I and Conservative Members agree wholeheartedly, but on this occasion we do. The intervention of the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton in support of the amendment was dangerously near to the inner cogitations of the flat earth society.
<P>
According to the hon. Gentleman, I claimed that the end date given in the clause is intended to tie in with the completion of the Government's review of charity taxation. I should make absolutely clear that the time limit given in the clause, and in clause 47, is crucial to the Chancellor's objective, which is to focus people's minds on giving, and to ensure that help is given now in specific recognition of the millennium. By limiting the period during which relief is available, both charities and donors should get the message that help is needed now.
<P>
I do not intend to enter into a debate on the precise date of the millennium. That is a short cut to getting measured for a straitjacket. However, it is impossible to argue that the end of the year 2001 is in any way connected with the millennium. I agree with the hon. Member for Sevenoaks when he says that the Liberal Democrat definition of the millennium date is particularly arcane. The debate is beginning to assume the proportions of the synod of Whitby.
<P>
The millennium provides a unique focus for the provision of gift aid. Limiting the period for relief gives us an excellent opportunity to convince people to give help now, when it can be suitably focused. For that reason, I cannot accept the amendment in fact, I must go further and say that it would undermine the clause. I urge the Committee to reject it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I am disappointed by the Economic Secretary's reply. By her own admission, she did not want to engage in an argument about when the millennium will begin, and she therefore failed to deal with the whole point of my amendment. If we are going to base improvements in tax incentives for donations to charity around the millennium, we should use the correct date. I am sorry that the Economic Secretary did not answer that point. However, faced by the battalions of Labour Members, who seem to be forming an unholy alliance with the battalions of Conservative Members sitting to my right, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Mr. St. Aubyn, do you want to press amendment No. 131, which we debated with amendment No. 126, to a Division?
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): No.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Similarly, do you want to press amendment No. 130, which we debated with amendment No. 127, to a Division?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> No, it is not my intention to press that amendment to a vote.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I wish to ask the Economic Secretary about her longer-term intentions about the change from  250 to  100. It might be simpler if that proposal applied to gift aid across the board. There is general acceptance that, despite the administrative costs and the sums involved, relief is still valid and worthwhile at that level. But if the point is valid in this case, why not go the whole hog and make it valid more generally?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I support my hon. Friend's argument, but I welcome the benefits that the clause will bring.
<P>
I am involved with an education charity called Project Trust, which sends school leavers abroad during their gap year, primarily on educational schemes to support third world countries. The trust has existed for 30 years, during which time it has sent more than 4,000 school leavers abroad. It was the first non-church organisation to do that. In the 1960s, Voluntary Service Overseas decided to focus its efforts on graduates and those with other qualifications. I have an interest in that organisation in that I was one of its earlier volunteers. As the number of people going to university has grown, so has the number of people travelling abroad with Project Trust. Today, two thirds of its volunteers are from the state sector.
<P>
Project Trust identified a real problem for this and future years, which I hope the clause will help to alleviate, namely, the cost of a university education. The massive increase in costs that the Government imposed on students from this autumn means that those from less-well-off backgrounds will increasingly find that they cannot afford to give of their efforts and skills in their gap year to people in other parts of the world.
<P>
Those volunteers are wanted, and they want to go, but faced with the enormous bill of a university education they simply cannot justify volunteering their time rather than spending it in an earning capacity before they go to university. That serious problem was identified in a paper that Project Trust presented to the Government. It has also been remarked on by VSO, which also finds that those who leave university 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not going to labour this point. I was tolerant of him making a minor point, but he cannot make a speech on this subject in this clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I shall just finish that sentence. Those who leave university will be so indebted that they will not be able to afford to volunteer their services.
<P>
Clause 48 will benefit those who give money to such charities, schemes and projects, and will make it easier to raise money, which is essential to the success of such schemes. Given the difficulties that such groups will face I do not want to get involved in an arcane debate about dates I urge the Government, in respect of volunteer work overseas on education projects, to consider the provision of much wider relief for a much longer period.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Leslie </B>(Shipley): I should like to make a few brief points to explain why I feel that the millennium gift aid is a good example of the Labour Government's commitment to improving the lot of the poorest countries in the world and of channelling resources to places where they are most needed.
<P>
The reactions of some of the charities involved have been interesting. Save the Children has been especially welcoming of the instalment aspect of clause 48, while Christian Aid is pleased that the likelihood of the public making donations has been so increased. Oxfam has recognised the educational objectives as pivotal to anti-poverty work in the third world. I asked the House of Commons Library to estimate the extra public and business donations that are likely to be produced by this[Mr. Leslie]
scheme. The Library estimated that between  150 million and  261 million of additional money would be expected to go to the poorest countries of the world during the lifetime of the millennium gift aid project. That is an extremely significant sum, which will provide considerable help.
<P>
I was glad to hear that so many people have welcomed the scheme. I was slightly puzzled that, although amendment No. 16 was not selected for debate about which I am glad the Conservatives tabled that amendment with the intention of deleting lines 9 to 31. Not only would that have killed the whole project, it would have removed the whole instalment scheme. It is puzzling that those Front-Bench Opposition Members who tabled that amendment are now speaking in favour of the project.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am curious about the hon. Gentleman's figures. If I am not mistaken, the Red Book shows that the cost of the scheme is  15 million a year, rising to  25 million a year. It is therefore curious that the expected increase in giving is  160 million a year, when the cost to the Exchequer in foregone tax revenue is only  15 million to  25 million.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leslie:</B> I gave a cumulative figure for the full lifetime of the millennium gift aid project. I know that the hon. Gentleman worked previously as consultant to the Government of Malawi, and it is pleasing to see that he is so much in favour of a scheme that will benefit one of his favourite countries.
<P>
The millennium gift project is an excellent initiative and I hope that, after the millennium, we will continue to consider innovative and ingenious ways of channelling gift aid from the public, which should be tied in with specific projects. The millennium is a good focus to encourage the public to donate and make a difference as best they can.

<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I shall not repeat the arguments I deployed earlier about the specific nature of the millennium gift aid project, but it is for a specific purpose and a specific time scale. The hon. Member for Sevenoaks asked why the time scale cannot be extended, so I must point out again that the charities review is currently under way. We have so far received 3,500 responses to the first stage of the review, the consultation document will soon be published and we will take into account all the views submitted as part of the charities review. That also relates to the point made by the hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn), who mentioned young people who volunteer their time to work abroad. That is why it is not apposite to go into the detail of matters that will be the subject of the charities review.

I commend the efforts of my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Mr. Leslie), who went into great detail on the clause. I do not wish to enter into a partisan dispute on the matter. All sensible and kind people throughout the United Kingdom recognise that, as a prosperous nation, we have a responsibility to help others. What more appropriate way can there be to mark the turn of the century than to ensure that those who are in conditions of real poverty and distress embark on a new millennium with a new opportunity to seek prosperity and well being for the future?

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> As I understand it, clause 50 provides an enabling power to permit the Secretary of State by regulation to impose national insurance contributions on the gain made on the exercise of options over tradable typically quoted shares. There is a problem with the new system, especially for small growing companies.
<P>
The Government tell us that they are in favour of promoting enterprise and helping smaller business, but other aspects of the Budget and the Finance Bill have shown us how they are attacking the system and framework that the previous Government created to support the growth of the companies. In particular, we have seen how companies on the alternative investment market have been hit by the Government's changes to capital gains tax, which we will debate later.
<P>
Some companies will be hard hit by clause 50. Executives who have often risked all their own capital putting not only their names but their money on the line are frequently granted options when the companies are not traded or quoted and are still very small. When a company grows to such an extent that it needs more cash to survive, the alternative investment market and others come into their own. They provide vital extra capital to give the business a lift and a spurt before a greater period of growth in which the company creates more jobs, opportunities and revenue for the Government through its tax payments.
<P>
When such a company goes public, those people who made the company a success, and were given options as key incentives to devote themselves to it and to risk their future livelihood in the business, may decide to exercise their options. The trouble with clause 50 is that it requires them to pay national insurance contributions. Not only will that grab back much needed money at a critical time in the growth of a business but it will have a damaging effect on the earnings of that company.
<P>
We all know that when a company becomes a quoted company its earnings level is very important. Anything that damages its earnings is likely to damage its price-earnings ratio. The actual price at which the business raises new money will also be directly affected by the clause.
<P>
The clause may well be appropriate as an alternative to the system introduced in 1996 for large companies. Of course, such incentive schemes apply to FTSE 100 companies, the largest companies in the country. The clause may also be appropriate in the case of companies that have share option schemes, which typically comprise a small proportion of the total capital of the company, in relation to which the cost of the clause will not have such a devastating impact on the earnings of the company in any one year it may be that those on the Government Bench can argue their case. However, in this instance, for unquoted companies, the clause will have a serious negative impact, and I urge the Economic Secretary to consider the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): Amendment No. 61 would leave out the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"contractual arrangements with the company".</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 50 provides for a new section 140C of the Taxes Act 1988, and the amendment would mitigate the effect of that anti-avoidance clause. Important though the clause is, there is a problem in that it provides that, where a share is forfeited because of an obligation exerted by the company on an employee so that he or she loses the shares on leaving the company, it should not count as one of the sorts of shares covered by the anti-avoidance provision.
<P>
One exemption cited in the clause is where the obligation is incorporated in a company's articles of association. There may be other obligations on an employee to hand over his shares when he leaves the company, and it may be a contractual arrangement. Indeed, US companies do not generally have articles of association and may impose this obligation in some other way. Many companies may feel obliged to change their articles of association because of the exemption. That is cumbersome and burdensome to do because it requires a 75 per cent. majority. To avoid such problems and allow companies to continue with the arrangement whereby employees lose shares when they leave the company, I urge the Government to accept the amendment as a way of making this anti-avoidance clause more workable in the real world of commerce.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I want to return to amendment No. 60 and speak briefly in support of the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. It seems unfair that national insurance contributions should be imposed on the exercise of options granted on companies that are not, but may subsequently be, quoted. Several provisions in the Bill will make it difficult for new companies entering the junior market, and it is my understanding that the stock exchange, which has overall responsibility for the junior, as well as the main, market, is unhappy about the effect, albeit perhaps unintended, of some of these changes. I should be grateful if, in replying to the debate, the Economic Secretary would say whether the stock exchange is satisfied that the clause will not have a harmful effect.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I think that amendment No. 65 is based on a misunderstanding. Opposition Members seem to think that the clause is, in some sense, penal. Let me go back to first principles. Clause 50 provides that when employees receive shares subject to the risk of forfeiture, they are taxed on a fair and sensible basis. The amendment would take shares in unquoted companies outside the scope of the clause.
<P>
I want to pick up on one point raised by the hon. Member for Guildford, who said that the clause would damage unquoted companies in relation to share options. Share options are unaffected by the clause. However, if the amendment were to have effect, employees of unquoted companies would be taxed on a different basis from those of quoted companies. That different treatment would be unnecessary and unfair on those employees.
<P>
Under the amendment, employees of unquoted companies who received shares that were subject to the risk of forfeiture would have to pay tax when the shares were first acquired instead of when the risk of forfeiture had been lifted. An employee might pay tax on shares that he or she would ultimately not own.
<P>
On the other hand, if the risk of forfeiture was subsequently lifted, the employee might receive a valuable asset and pay tax on only a small proportion of it, but that benefit would be unavailable to employees of unquoted companies. Those are just the sort of avoidance arrangements that we want to stop. There is no reason to offer such arrangements to employees of some companies and deny them to others.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The hon. Lady must address the problem, which for those companies is the very large amount of national insurance contributions that will be claimed from them when they become quoted companies and the options are exercised, and the effect that that will have on their share price. There may have to be consequential amendments or changes to other legislation, but the point that the hon. Lady must address is how to deal with that problem for small quoted companies.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> On the point about flotation, a wide range of factors is taken into account on the flotation of a company and must be verified to ensure that the company is floated at the proper rate. The hon. Gentleman is trying to find a narrow route by which to address a wider issue. The clause is a specific anti-avoidance measure to maintain fairness within the system.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Will the hon. Lady tell us what evidence she has that small companies have used this mechanism for avoidance purposes? We accept that larger companies have tried to use it, but what evidence is there that small, unquoted companies have tried to use the same mechanism?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The clause is not directed at companies that have tried to avoid due tax. Its purpose is to ensure that we have a fair and equitable taxation system that takes account of any inequities between companies, whether quoted or unquoted.
[Mrs. Liddell]
<P>
I want to make progress on the point raised by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) about the stock exchange. The Inland Revenue has received no representations from the stock exchange on the clause, which returns the tax treatment to the position that was believed to exist for many years. It clarifies the situation and will help companies.
<P>
On amendment No. 61, the income tax charge in the clause excludes those shares that may be forfeited because the articles of association require an employee to offer his or her shares for sale on leaving the company. That common pre-emption right in small, unquoted companies exists for straightforward reasons to prevent the shareholding from becoming polluted and to ensure that shareholder control is maintained. It tends to apply to specific employees or groups of employees. The amendment would extend the sort of arrangements covered by the exemption and widen the scope for manipulation. For example, companies would be allowed to set up contractual arrangements with individual employees or directors requiring them to sell their shares at perhaps an artificially low price if they left the company. That arrangement would lower the value of the shares and the amount of tax paid when the shares were first received. That tax avoidance route could be put in place for certain favoured employees.
<P>
Companies will still be able to make contractual arrangements with their employees requiring them to sell back their shares when they leave employment. If the price paid for the shares is not less than the market value, the shares will not come under the scope of the new charge. There have been misunderstandings about the purpose of the two clauses, but I hope that I have managed to clear up some of them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I have a short but germane point about private company shares. I have been out of practice for 18 months, and I do not know whether the shares valuation division still goes by that name or whether it has a posher corporate name. Either way, we all know of the body to which I refer.
<P>
Unkind souls often allege that time seems to stand still at the shares valuation division. Its competence and conscientiousness is not in doubt, but it has an enormous amount of work to do and too few people to do it. In relation to unquoted shares, clauses 50 and 51 will add to the work that that body has to do. Will the Government increase the number of its staff?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I understand that there are currently no plans to increase the number of staff in the shares valuation division. Government Departments are always on the quest for increased efficiency.
<P>
I was asked whether share valuations would become more complicated. With regard to the taxation of shares that are subject to forfeiture, the clause will put on the statute book the situation that has applied in practice for several years. Share valuations will therefore be unaffected.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> We are all very disappointed by the Economic Secretary's response. We accept that the Government want to counter an abuse of the national insurance system by large companies, which have exploited the unapproved share option schemes, but there is no evidence that those schemes have been used for tax avoidance purposes by small companies. Small unquoted companies have a genuine need for such schemes, and they are being unnecessarily damaged by the intransigence of the hon. Lady and her colleagues. Any claims that they make about supporting that sector will be heard dare I say it rather sceptically.
<P>
Amendment No. 61 would improve the Bill, and it is churlish of the Economic Secretary to reject it. The Bill will suffer as a result. However, in view of the Government's intransigence and given the time of day we should move on. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 139, in page 37, line 35, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"no later than thirty days after"</UL></FONT>
<P>
and insert "by 6th July following".
<P>
This is a small amendment, which I shall introduce extremely briefly. Clause 52 imposes considerable additional record-keeping, documentation and reporting burdens. The amendment would bring the date required for delivery of particulars under the clause into line with the date required for delivery of employers' year-end returns. The burden of additional paperwork would consequently be modestly reduced. I urge the Economic Secretary seriously to consider the amendment, which would not have a significant effect on the Revenue but which would slightly reduce the additional burden on business.
<P>
<B>Mrs Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman claims that the clause will place an additional burden on employers, which is highly unlikely. Employers will usually have all the necessary information directly to hand for their own purposes. They must keep records of which of their employees' shares are subject to forfeiture and when that forfeiture is likely to be lifted, if they do not have such records, they are massively incompetent. They must also keep similar records of convertible shares.
<P>
The clause requires such information to be made available to the Inland Revenue within 30 days of the end of the tax year. That is the same time limit applying to the supply of information about all other kinds of shares and share options, and it works pretty well in practice. The amendment would move the time limit to 6 July, following the end of the tax year. The reason for that is presumably that it is the same as the time limit for supplying information about benefits and expenses. Different rules relating to that time limit would mean that there would be automatic penalties for non-compliance I hope that that is clear. Any change would therefore need to take into account the impact of different rules.
<P>
Contrary to the hon. Gentleman's intentions, the amendment would create a new and unnecessary complication for employers. They would have to cope with one time limit for shares subject to forfeiture and convertible shares, and another time limit for all other shares and share options. I must therefore resist the amendment, which does not achieve the purpose that the hon. Gentleman seeks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank the Economic Secretary for that explanation, although I am not entirely sure that I followed the detail of it.
<P>
The amendment merely sought to draw attention to the way in which further burdens are being imposed on businesses. Different dates for reporting different things may not be convenient: one might reasonably expect that the plethora or options and benefits granted to an employee could be collated at one time and reported in one hit to the Inland Revenue. The Economic Secretary has provided a complex and somewhat convoluted explanation which smacks of officialdom of why that would not be convenient.
<P>
I shall not press the amendment as I hope that my point has been made, but I hope that the Treasury will seek to harmonise reporting requirements and dates wherever possible in the years ahead. The interests of the business and the employer should be paramount, not the convenience of officials in the Inland Revenue. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Clauses 52 to 56 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 57 </h4>
<h4>Sub-contractors in the construction industry </h4></center>
<p>Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I see that Labour Members are disappointed by the splendid progress that the Committee has made during the past few minutes.
<P>
Two distinct Government proposals relate to the construction industry. The first is contained in clauses 55 and 56, and is largely uncontroversial. The proposal is accepted by the industry as a broadly sensible way of dealing with a problem that has cropped up within it. Clause 57, however, raises different matters that the Committee should consider in greater detail. It gives effect to the provisions of schedule 8, which deal with the treatment of sub-contractors in the construction industry.
<P>
Not for the first time during this Committee's proceedings I should declare an interest, in that I am a director of a small building company. However, my company will not in any way be directly affected by the measures, because they apply to companies and individuals who carry out building and construction work for other builders or developers, rather than to companies that carry out work on their own behalf as speculative developers. Nevertheless, I would like to place my interest on record.
<P>
My direct, if rather limited, experience enables me to see some of the advantages of the British construction industry's flexibility. I have also had a limited but useful opportunity to contrast Britain's construction industry with Germany's. I cite Germany not because it is a particularly difficult or bad case, but because it is one of which I have some experience.
<P>
There are two principle ways in which sub-contractors in the construction industry are paid by their employers. Both methods depend on the approval of the Inland Revenue. The 714 scheme recognises sub-contractors as self-employed and enables them to be paid on a gross basis. During the recession that the building industry has suffered in recent years, that system has to some extent been assaulted. I understand the Government's wish to tackle the problem of 714 certificate holders. Some people who previously held 714 certificates and who were recognised as self-employed tried to claim unemployment benefit when they were caught in a downturn in the construction industry. A number of cases went to employment tribunals which ruled that they were in fact employees.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I accept that it is not satisfactory for people to claim to be self-employed in the good times and then claim to be entitled to unemployment benefit in the bad times. I think that the industry accepts the need to tighten up and clarify the system. However, we must ensure that we do not throw the baby out with the bath water. In this case the baby is the successful element of flexibility in the British construction industry that is provided by the sub-contracting system and the use of sub-contractors who are able to be paid gross. I am not arguing that the system should be left exactly as it is, nor am I in favour of the abuses which I accept have taken place, but the Government should look carefully at the tests that they want to impose on the issuing of 714 certificates. They should consider the impact that the tests will have on small companies and individual sub-contractors.
<P>
We need to ensure that we do not follow the route taken by the construction industry in those countries that have created an all-employment industry. We must bear in mind the fluctuating levels of construction work, the unique pivotal role that the construction industry performs during the upswings and downswings of the British economy and the geographically dispersed nature of the work undertaken by many individuals and small firms. It would be a disaster for the industry and the country if we were to move towards a system that forced construction companies and developers to employ all the people needed to construct their buildings. That system would be similar to the one in Germany where the costs of building a house my experience is of the housebuilding sector square foot for square foot or square metre for square metre is between two or three times the cost in the United Kingdom. That leads to significantly higher house prices at all levels and in all sectors of the housing market.
<P>
I remember a telling comment by the German Minister for housing at a German housebuilders conference about two years ago. She berated the industry with the fact that it cost twice as much to build a house in Germany as it cost to build a house in the Netherlands, which is not noted for its socially irresponsible employment practices. That example[Mr. Hammond]
underlines the extent of the problem in Germany and how difficult the situation is for the industry and those German people who aspire to own a house, which relatively few of them succeed in doing. One of the factors underlying the lean and efficient operation of the British construction industry is the effective operation of the sub-contracting system.
<P>
The clause will introduce a turnover test for the issue of a 714(i) certificate which is issued to individuals. That test will require a self-employed tradesman such as a plumber, an electrician or a bricklayer to show that he has a turnover in excess of an as yet undefined figure for the labour-only element of his turnover, which will exclude materials and other costs and which should be above a certain level.
<P>
I understand from the Federation of Master Builders that the turnover test will be in the range of  20,000 to  30,000. That is quite a big range. I suspect that most self-employed tradesmen at the botton of the range will qualify if they work alone and that most self-employed tradesmen at the top who work alone will not qualify.
<P>
It is important that the Financial Secretary tells us where we can expect the figure to be pitched within that range and when we can expect definitive figures from the Government. That underlines the difficulty that Conservative Members have had throughout consideration of the Bill when we are dealing with issues that hinge on a figure or a level that has yet to be announced. We are required to discuss matters in the abstract, but our response to the Government's proposals will be determined in large part by where the threshold is set. Perhaps the Financial Secretary can reassure us that the figure will be set at the bottom end of the range; perhaps she will increase our alarm by saying that it is to be set at a higher level that will exclude many legitimate self-employed tradesmen from registering under the 714 scheme.
<P>
The position of small companies that work in the subcontracting sector for which the 714(i) certificate is issued is more complex still. The Bill proposes that companies will have the option of passing one of two alternative hurdles. The first is that they have  200,000 of labour-only total income, excluding the cost of materials and other costs. They would have to have a billing of  200,000 that was attributable to the labour element only. The second alternative is that their turnover of labour-only billings is the same as that applied to the individual subcontractor we do not yet know what that is, but it will be between  20,000 and  30,000 multiplied by the number of directors in the company.
<P>
The implication of the way in which the threshold has been set is that all the directors in a small building subcontracting company will be working directors, but that may not be the case. Anyone who has dealt with small building industry subcontractors and trades people and who has tried to get a plumber, decorator or plasterer to come to his home will know that it is common for the person who answers the phone, books the work and organises the billing to be the wife of the principal or of one of the directors. It is common in such firms for the wives of the working principals to be directors of the company. That will create an onerous situation and will add to the multiplier that has to be applied to the base figure when determining the threshold.
<P>
Our concern is that many small enterprises companies or individuals will fall foul of the new threshold and that they will not be able to obtain a 714 certificate. That will mean that employers will have to operate the alternative system for paying subcontractors in the construction industry the SC60 system. That requires tax to be deducted at source from payments to the subcontractor.
<P>
There are two points to be made about that system. First, it is clear that, in terms of cash flow, a small business that has been used to operating on a system of gross payments will be disadvantaged by having to switch suddenly to having 20 or 23 per cent. of all billings deducted at source and retained by the employer. That loss of flexibility will be distinctly unhelpful.
<P>
Secondly, some employers especially local authorities and others in the public sector, such as housing authorities are set up to deal with subcontracted work on a 714 basis. Their systems are designed to make gross payments and to treat billings by subcontractors as supplies of goods like any other. They will not be anxious to reconstruct those systems to deal with tax deduction under the SC60 procedure.
<P>
Nor will those bodies be keen to account for those amounts of tax to the Inland Revenue simply so that one or two small local traders or builders can remain eligible for local authority or housing association work. Therefore, the provision may put at risk the existence of many of the smallest construction firms the small companies or firms run by individuals especially when they depend to any extent on local authorities and other public bodies for their work.
<P>
As I said earlier, we lack precise figures for the threshold, which will be of critical importance both for 714(i)s and 714(c)s. Will the Financial Secretary say when those figures will be published? What basis have the Government used for the figure that eventually will be proposed? What analysis has been made of the industry, and how many firms have been assessed as likely to be below the threshold? If the provision has any purpose, some firms must cease to be eligible for the 714 procedure.
<P>
How many people will the proposals force out of business? Has the Treasury analysed the impact on the industry as a whole and on the overall economy of the loss of flexibility and of the trend towards direct employment by construction companies?
<P>
I look forward to a helpful response from the Financial Secretary.

<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I, too, should like to speak briefly on this matter. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, I have an interest in the construction industry.
<P>
I am worried about two things. The more members of the construction industry, employers and contractors alike who are assessed, the more mistakes may be made. A recent case in my constituency involved someone who had been on a contract basis for many years but who was clearly a contractor. The Benefits Agency investigated him for six months and decided that he was an employee of the organisation where he worked. When his employment at the firm was terminated, he went to a much larger firm that clearly was a contractor. As a result, he had to sell his house and it took more than a year to recover from the crisis. To top it all, the Benefits Agency then wrote to him to say that it had reconsidered his case and decided that he had been a contractor all along. The process had a devastating effect: it will certainly be investigated further and I hope that my constituent will be awarded compensation.
<P>
If the Government intend to crack down on the construction industry, they will find the problem of definition difficult. They should bear in mind that a significant number of those who go into that industry were the more disaffected element when they were at school. My own business has experience of taking pupils on work experience courses to encourage them to go into the industry. They realise, after that experience, that they have to get the basics right in their final year at school. That group is entirely law abiding, but they are not lovers of officialdom. If the Government crack down on construction workers, they will be going after a group who have an innate reaction against officialdom. They do not like having to fill out lots of forms. The whole issue needs to be handled carefully, or we will drive out of employment some of those whom we most want to encourage to earn a crust.

<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Dawn Primarolo):</B> I should like to assure the hon. Member for Guildford that the purpose of these clauses was outlined very well by his hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge.
<P>
I have already explained this matter to the Committee, so I shall not repeat the explanation. What happened when the previous Government was in power was the result of more than confusion. The hon. Gentleman gave the example of tribunal rulings where someone was deemed to be self-employed but then, when unemployed, qualified for unemployment benefit. The industry approached the then Conservative Government seeking a solution to what it recognised and we recognise as a difficult problem: how to strike a balance between genuine subcontractors and people who abuse the national insurance and PAYE system by not paying.
<P>
That is the purpose of the clause. It is not about forcing people into bankruptcy or running a vendetta against either building workers or the building industry. It is a genuine attempt at a solution, and we have worked very closely with the industry. A great deal of work had already been done on this matter when the Labour Government were elected. My predecessor, the right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack), wrote to me after the election and tabled parliamentary questions asking whether progress was being made on these proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank the hon. Lady. Of course, I agree with what she says, but I suggest that there is another way of testing the genuineness of self-employment in the building industry. It is a route that the Inland Revenue already uses continuity of employment.
<P>
Clearly, if someone claims to be self-employed but works month after month and year after year for the same employer, that is bogus self-employment. If, however, a person whatever the level of his turnover works for 26 different employers during the course of the year, clearly that is genuine self-employment. That is a fairer and more objective test than the one that the hon. Lady is outlining.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Personally, I would be quite attracted to the definition that the hon. Gentleman suggests, but it cannot work when applied across all sectors. It is not as easy as that, which is why the Government and the previous Government settled on this route.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's questions hinged on turnover thresholds, which are contained in regulations that will be placed before Parliament later this year. However, he is quite right; I intended in my remarks on the clause to indicate the thresholds, so that the figures were in the public domain. I shall also respond to the hon. Gentleman's other points.
<P>
In order to obtain a certificate giving entitlements to gross payment of earnings, a subcontractor will have to demonstrate a business turnover that exceeds a prescribed level. The turnover thresholds, as they are called, will be set out in regulations to be laid before Parliament later this year. There is widespread interest in the level at which the thresholds will be set. No purpose would be served by deferring announcement of the levels until the autumn, which will give time for proper consultation.
<P>
Following the Inland Revenue's wide consultation, I can outline the new turnover thresholds. Full details will appear in an Inland Revenue press release to be published in the next day or so, but I shall give the figures now. As I said, the points are dealt with by the regulations referred to in the schedule that is why I shall deal with the matter now.
<P>
The turnover thresholds will require individual traders to have an income within the scheme, net of materials, of  30,000. Partnerships and companies will have to multiply the threshold by the number of people involved in their businesses, such as partners or directors, to arrive at their threshold. The threshold has an upper limit for such concerns. As the hon. Gentleman said, it is described as the alternative turnover threshold, and will be set at  200,000. If their net construction turnover from all sources achieves that level, they will pass the turnover test. The thresholds will be kept under close scrutiny and may be subject to alteration, which will occur, for example, when pay rates in the relevant industry increase significantly.
<P>
I want to emphasise the point made by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge about the importance of maintaining flexibility and balance with regard to the Government's objectives. I agree with the hon. Gentleman; I think that he said that we must not throw the baby out with the bath water and that the matter should be approached sensibly. The Government[Dawn Primarolo]
believe that the policy will achieve flexibility as well as stability and certainty about qualification.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the thresholds' likely impact. He suggested that small firms would be especially likely to lose their certificates and would therefore suffer tax deductions from their turnover and be forced out of business by the cash flow effect. The Government do not believe that that scenario will occur. We had to balance two objectives in setting the thresholds: the protection of tax revenue and the safeguarding of genuine small business interests. The hon. Gentleman encouraged the Government to ensure that powers are in place to enable that. Most established small businesses will be able to meet the turnover thresholds, which contain a reasonable degree of flexibility. For example, they provide for the turnover of a business to be tested during six months or three years, or for it to averaged when the business has had a bad year in the test period. All that would be the subject of the regulations, which I have made clear will be laid before Parliament. It is important, because of the issues around the thresholds, that I should give an indication of those figures to the Committee.
<P>
I sense that Committee members are in agreement with the continuing strategy as embodied by clauses 55, 56 and 57. I therefore ask the Committee to support clause 57.
<P>
I assure the hon. Gentleman that we shall take a careful approach to the turnover thresholds and to the draft regulations. Our consultations with the building industry over a considerable period of time indicate that those are in the range that they believe to be acceptable. The Committee should therefore also find them acceptable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am disappointed by what the Financial Secretary has said. I spoke of a range of  20,000 to  30,000, and she has now confirmed that she intends that the limit will be set at the very top of that range. I am afraid that she has thrown the baby out with the bathwater. She has probably been the victim of the Inland Revenue's continuing dislike of self-employment. This will ensure certainly outside the south-east, where labour rates for tradespeople in the building industry are comparatively high that there are no self-employed single tradespeople operating in the building industry. No sole trader plumbers, no sole trader electricians 
<P>
<B>Mr. Patrick Hall </B>(Bedford): I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way. If, as he says, the Inland Revenue has a culture that is opposed to self-employment, could he enlighten me as to why that is the case after 18 years of Conservative Government?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am not sure what the hon. Gentleman is driving at. My hon. Friends alluded during earlier sittings to the need for Treasury Ministers to master their briefs and to be prepared to resist relentless pressure from officialdom. Inland Revenue officials will naturally seek to make it easier to collect the revenue and to maximise the tax take. They will not necessarily have the kind of regard for the interests of small businesses in the community that we should expect from elected representatives.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the contribution that we have just heard from the Labour Benches confirms our worst fears that Labour Members believe in the politicisation of the civil services?

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend has interpreted the hon. Gentleman's remarks in a Machiavellian sense. I am afraid that I simply did not understand what he was driving at: perhaps that is my fault.
<P>
The Financial Secretary is, in effect, saying that nobody in the building industry who earns less than  30,000 a year can be genuinely self-employed. That sets the building and construction apart from all other sectors of the economy. People who are working in other sectors with an income of  15,000 or  20,000 a year can be treated as self-employed. Those figures do not represent total turnover, but the labour element only.
<P>
The test for self-employment has been set in an artificial way at a level that many tradespeople who are operating on their own outside London and the south-east will fail to meet. It takes no account of the other tests of genuine self-employment that the Inland Revenue employs elsewhere: whether, for example, the business is taking genuine risks or whether the self-employed person is genuinely seeking and finding his own work. It places self-employed people working in the building industry at a disadvantage against all the other self-employed people in the economy. There is no justification for that.
<P>
The Financial Secretary's response made no mention of the disadvantage that will be suffered by those who lose their 714 certificate when they look for work with local authorities or with other public or quasi-public bodies. Will she consult her colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions to ensure that local authorities and other bodies at least will be under pressure not to exclude those very small businesses from future work? Such bodies should take the trouble to modify their systems so that they can operate the SC60 system for subcontractors.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am getting a little tired of the argument that the Inland Revenue is wicked, and that somehow the figures are simply plucked out of the air. I was genuinely polite when I responded to the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, who clearly is familiar with the industry. However, the Government consulted widely with the construction industry about the figure. If the Government have to choose between the hon. Gentleman and the industry, they will choose the industry.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman talked about the threshold figure. I assume that he knows that the relevant figures were set in accordance with 1996 prices. In real terms, the  30,000 at 1996 prices will be equivalent to  27,000 in 1999. That is a reasonable approach. The regulations will be published. We have heard a lot of rubbish about the Government attacking small businesses, but we are introducing measures to tackle late payment and thus protect small businesses. Those proposals have not come from Conservative Members.
<P>
The Government have made it clear that although the Exchequer must be protected, so must small but genuine businesses. Those who exploit tax regimes undercut such businesses and consequently undermine and damage them. We are trying to achieve the balance recommended by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, whose response to me was ill-judged and ungenerous.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 57 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> For the convenience of the Committee, I must inform hon. Members that there have been some minor changes to the provisional selection of amendments made available this morning. Perhaps it would be helpful if I made clear how we intend to proceed.
<P>
In relation to schedule 9, I intend that Government amendments Nos. 166 and 167 will be selected. However, there appears to have been an error in connection with clause 59: amendment No. 135 ought to be debated when we come to clause 60 and not to clause 59. Hon. Members may wish to amend their selection lists accordingly.
<P>
I gather that the Opposition do not intend to move amendment No. 60, which applies to clause 61. That has implications for the selection list, in that we shall now debate amendments Nos. 125 and 124 when we come to discuss schedule 10. Otherwise, I think that the list is as published earlier.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>". (1)Tax is not charged under section 148 on a payment or other benefit provided in pursuance of any such scheme or fund as was described in section 221(1) and (2) of the 1970 Act or as is described in section 596(1) (approved retirement benefits schemes, etc) in the following cases.

<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 167.
<P>
<B>Down Primarolo:</B> Amendments Nos. 166 and 167 are necessary to reinstate existing exemptions from tax for lump sums from approved pension schemes.
<P>
The drafters of this Bill were deliberately given scope to rework the existing legislation using techniques developed as part of the tax law rewrite project. In broad terms, clause 58 and schedule 9 small administrative changes to provide for simpler and fairer tax treatment of redundancy packages. However, the redrafting went much wider than necessary, simply to give effect to the modifications of the rules. That complex and labour-intensive process involved comprehensive restructuring of the existing legislation, including the disposal of several provisions that were considered obsolete.
<P>
It is now clear that one of the discarded provisions is less dispensable than thought. Its absence would mean that the lump sum from an approved pension scheme could, in certain circumstances, be vulnerable to tax. That would override provisions elsewhere to exempt such payments from charge. That was not our intention. Having now eaten humble pie, I commend the amendments to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> The Government are the recipients of your generosity, Mr. Butterfill, as you immediately selected amendments that have only just appeared. We must give the Government the benefit of the doubt about why they have suddenly appeared at this late hour.
<P>
There is a problem with the drafting of schedules. On Tuesday, we had problems with the drafting of schedule 5. On top of these amendments to schedule 9, amendments have now been proposed to scheduled 13 and 7. That is not the tax law rewrite project, but the tax law second rewrite project it is being rewritten as it goes along. The Financial Secretary has produced a new excuse: "one of the provisions is less dispensable than thought". We shall chew over that excuse, which the hon. Lady offered honestly to the Committee. We will not oppose the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I also have some interest in the clause as a result of representations made to me by one of my constituents. I should be grateful if the Financial Secretary would explain whether her amendment will help in this situation. I refer to those who retire from their company and receive a lump sum, but want to continue in some consultancy role. There are several cases of individuals who had the right to take a lump sum and did so quite legitimately, with no attempt at tax avoidance. They used it to pay of their mortgage, for example, and then took on another consultancy in the same company. They were then hit by a bombshell they received an assessment from the Inland Revenue out of the blue for tax on the entire amount of their lump-sum payment. As a result, they faced a nightmare. They had never anticipated such an assessment. They knew other people who had had a similar arrangement with a company for which they used to work and who had not suffered in the same way. There has been a change in practice by the Inland Revenue the sort of Revenue action that gives rise to concern among Conservative Members that the Government are not properly controlling and directing the Revenue's actions and policies.
<P>
What comfort can Ministers give people in that position? Will they tackle the problem and ensure that the Government deal with cases that are being made against people who have retired and who do not have the means immediately to meet large tax bills with which they should never have been served in the first place? Are the changes that they have just proposed to the clause intended in part to alleviate the problem?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The restoration of the parts that should not have been deleted is intended to maintain the current position of those who retire. The amendment will have no effect on the case that the hon. Member for Guildford mentioned because there is no change of practice. The rules always require people who retire and get benefit to be looked at in the context of their retirement. They are part of the discussion under the pensions review.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman interprets the amendments more widely than was intended. They will ensure that people continue to receive what they received before, which would not have been certain had the provisions not been restored.
<P>
If the hon. Gentleman wants to ask me about detailed constituency casework, he can write to me.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am referring not to detailed constituency casework but to a problem to which I was alerted by an actuary who works in my constituency and who advises people who are worried that they might be in the position that we are discussing.
<P>
The Minister said that there had been no change of practice, but I want to show her an article in the The Tax Journal, which is headed just that "A Change of Practice?" There is evidence that the Revenue has changed its practice in relation to the treatment of lump sums. That is causing disquiet among many people who are contemplating retirement. For a few unlucky individuals, it is creating great personal anxiety because they have been served with alarming tax bills. That is quite unfair because they saved for their retirement for many years and are fully entitled to expect to take their tax-free lump sum; now the Revenue is trying to tax them on it.
<P>
I urge the Financial Secretary to look into the matter and to consider what additional amendments she might table at an appropriate stage to make it clear that there has not been a change of practice by the Revenue and that those who plan over many years how they will afford their retirement will not suddenly be tripped up by changes in practice at the last moment.

<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I have two questions about paragraph 6, which applies the new  30,000 threshold. Am I right to understand that threshold to be a lifetime limit? For example, what would be the position of an employee who worked in a company for 20 years and received a sum of  20,000 but dropped out of the labour market and started an entirely new period of employment with another company? Is  30,000 a lifetime limit, or does it apply consecutively to different periods of employment?
<P>
Secondly, I should like to ask about practicality. How would an employer operating pay-as-you-earn on a cash basis know when the  30,000 limit had been used up? How will employers know when the exemption has been used up?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman please repeat that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I apologise if I was going too fast for the Financial Secretary.
<P>
My second question was about employers operating pay-as-you-earn on a cash basis. How will such employers know when the  30,000 exemption has been reached?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The hon. Gentleman asked whether  30,000 is a lifetime limit. The answer is no. Sums from the same or associated employers would be amalgamated.
<P>
With regard to pay-as-you-earn on a cash basis, I now have the answer, but I do not understand it. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman about that question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I am in the Committee's hands. As the Financial Secretary has offered to write to me, I shall have to wait for her reply. I am not sure that that is satisfactory, as the Committee wanted to hear her reply. If that is the position, however, the Opposition will await the letter.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is designed to help the Government. Its proposers stand ready to ride in on white chargers and pluck the Financial Secretary from the environmental mire in which she finds herself after the Budget announcement.
<P>
The amendment is an opportunity for the Government to atone for the complete lack of environmental credibility of the other measures that the Committee has debated. It is an opportunity for the Financial Secretary to give credence to the Government's stated intent of putting the environment at the heart of policy making. It is an opportunity for the Financial Secretary to back up a statement that she made some time ago, when she said that she would ensure that the environment is placed at the centre of objectives for the tax system. She also gave an undertaking to the Select Committee on Environmental Audit about deciding that the Revenue departments should require proposals for Budget consideration to answer the environmental assessment question. The amendment, which concerns road fuel gases, is an opportunity for the Financial Secretary to redeem herself, which is especially relevant after the display that the Committee just witnessed.
<P>
All the clauses show that the Budget was an environmental damp squib. We were promised that it would be a green Budget that would attack environmental concerns. All that we have seen so far is the use of the fuel escalator as a blunt instrument to raise more revenue. The Government have failed to extend the duty advantages to cleaner road fuels such as road fuel gases. They have not cut duties for liquid petroleum gas or for compressed natural gas. The Government have merely tinkered with low sulphur fuel, as we have discussed. Clause 60 tinkers with company car taxation. There are no incentives to promote oxidation catalysts, nor to promote public transport use, for example through the tax treatment of company season tickets. The Budget contains nothing to tackle the distortions on company car mileage scales, which provide an incentive to drive more miles. Nor does it do anything to promote the remaining panoply of environmental measures such as water pollution 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not give us a catalogue of his wish lists for the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> The catalogue that I have given has been brief, Mr. Butterfill, and I shall go no further. The Government have offered fine rhetoric, but I fear that their words amount to an action-free zone. It is no wonder that Friends of the Earth has said that the Budget is as "green as smog".
<P>
The clause is supposed to go some way towards helping the Government realise the Kyoto targets calling for CO2 emission cuts of 20 per cent. by 2010. The national air quality strategy also requires a drastic reduction in particulate emissions, and in addition the Government must tackle the problem posed by the estimated 24,000 people killed every year by road exhaust pollution.
<P>
I hope that I do not have to explain the attractions of compressed natural gas and liquid petroleum gas, the two main road fuel gases under discussion. They produce almost no soot or particulate matter, and account for 70 per cent. less carbon monoxide and 10 per cent. less carbon dioxide than normal car fuels. Sulphur and lead emissions are practically eliminated when they are used, and car engines are typically 50 per cent. quieter.
<P>
Before you frown any more heavily, Mr. Butterfill, I assure you that all that is germane to the amendment. Through the albeit modest tax breaks that are proposed, the Government have acknowledged the attraction of converting engines to road fuel gases. Indeed, the Minister of Transport, the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh (Dr. Strang), visited my constituency a few weeks ago to endorse the move by the local council's commercial fleet to LPG. That visit was very welcome.
<P>
However, that switch will not happen on a wide scale without a serious kick start from the Government. The model should be the achievement by the previous Government, who took unleaded petrol seriously: 10 years ago they cut the duty on that fuel to the extent that most people now run their cars on it. It is so difficult to get hold of leaded four-star petrol that vintage car drivers have complained that it may disappear altogether.
<P>
The amendment deals with the fact that this country has by far the highest level of excise duty on liquid petroleum gas in the European Union. The detailed figures will be useful, and I shall give them in ecu, which I know is the favourite currency of Labour Members.
<P>
In the United Kingdom, the excise duty for 1,000 litres of liquid petroleum gas is 318.2 ecu. The next highest EU member state duty for LPG is 201.9 ecu per 1,000 litres, whereas France charges just 63 ecu virtually one fifth of the UK rate. Some countries, such as Sweden and Belgium, charge no excise duty, yet the Budget did absolutely nothing to cut the LPG or CNG duty levels in this country. How can we take the Government's green credentials seriously?
<P>
I maintain that company cars, the subject of this clause, are a good place to start. They account for a little more than 10 per cent. of all the cars on the road, but more than half of all new cars are company cars. [Interruption.] I can see that you, Mr. Butterfill, are vibrating, as am I. Perhaps you are trembling in anticipation of my next paragraph.
<P>
Company cars are a big hitter in the car market. Car fleets bought by companies command a large part of the market, which is why the amendment is a good place to start.
<P>
In November 1996, the last Conservative Government, as one would expect from an environmentally friendly Secretary of State for the Environment, cut road fuel duty by 25 per cent. on liquid petroleum gasses. Even that measure was not enough. Now, more technology is available to make it easier to convert cars, and we have an opportunity to take a lead in world technology and reinforce our green credentials. Britain is in an ideal position to demonstrate a much greater take-up of compressed natural gas because we have an existing network of natural gas pipes, which link 90 per cent. of homes and businesses. Indeed, from later this year, we will be connected to a continental gas system that stretches from Russia to the middle east, so the potential for expansion is enormous.
<P>
Out of 19,000 filling stations in the United Kingdom, only nine offer public compressed natural gas facilities. There are only 18 LPG fuelling pumps in the whole country. Most of the availability of those road fuel gasses comes from depots, for example council depots. In 1980, there were 500 such refuelling points, but that figure has declined over the past 18 years. Only about[Mr. Loughton]
200 such facilities are now available. We need to do something about that.
<P>
Offering tax advantages for LPG or CNG cars has certainly greatly helped overseas. In Italy, for example, mainly as a result of tax incentves for CNG cars I believe that the CNG is piped to Italy from Algeria more than 200,000 vehicles now operate on CNG. In the Netherlands, LPG vehicles are prevalent. The committee may be surprised to hear that Argentina is one of the largest markets for road fuel gas fired vehicles. In Buenos Aires, for example, it is compulsory for taxis to use CNG, and they are forbidden to use normal hydrocarbon fuels.
<P>
We need a bold move; we need the Government to reinforce their green credentials. Company cars are an important part of the market. We could gain real advantge on the fuel scales by adopting the amendment. If companies see that tax on such fuels is half the rate of tax on normal hydrocarbon fuels and diesel, it will make them sit up and think that there is an incentive for them to do something about ensuring that their company cars run on greener fuels, and their workers will also want to have that advantage. I hope that the amendment would be the first step. If the Government are really serious about their green credentials, they will drastically cut levels of excise duty on fuels next year, because they are disgracefully high.
<P>
The amendment would be easy to institute in practice. We already have tables of concessions based on the business mileage of company cars, according to which qualifying rates go down if one completes a certain amount of business mileage. That table can easily be used for company fuel scales.
<P>
I hope that the Treasury will also take the amendment into account when it considers taxation of the capital value of the benefit in kind of cars that use those fuels in future. The Automobile Association has calculated that  27 billion in road taxes are levied by the Government. On 29 April, the Financial Times reported that the Treasury had indicated its willingness to allow the hypothecation of taxes for investment in environmentally friendly modes of transport. Before we all return to our constituencies for the bank holiday, Mr. Butterfill, would not it be a wonderful gesture of reconciliation if the Government gave some oomph to their green rhetoric by adopting the amendment? The amendment would be good for the environment and for the Government's green credentials, if they want to resuscitate them. Adopting it would send out a positive signal that the problem was taken seriously.

<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I listened to my hon. Friend with great interest because three companies that are at the forefront of developing the new technology are based in my constituency.
<P>
I endorse everything that my hon. Friend said. LPG vehicles are cleaner and quieter. We should also consider the amendment's effect on trucks. Developments in the truck market have been more rapid to date than in the car market, but the problem for trucks and cars is the small number of refuelling stations. If more refuelling stations around the country suddenly sprang up if the idea of refuelling gained critical mass the truck market would also develop.
<P>
That raises a powerful thought that it might be more acceptable for trucks to make deliveries in central London, for instance, at night. We know that much of the congestion that we face on our roads is caused by commercial vehicle traffic, which tries to use our main motorway arteries and other parts of the transport system at the same time as commuter traffic. Road congestion costs this country an absolute fortune, and any proposal that spreads the use of our road system especially by making commercial traffic quieter and cleaner, and by encouraging it to run at other times of the day would have many knock-on benefits. That is another reason why the Financial Secretary should consider the amendment very carefully.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I support the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton).
<P>
Tokenism on green issues benefits nobody. In terms of green issues, the Bill is mere tokenism. If the Financial Secretary accepted the amendment, the Government could promote their green credentials.
<P>
The clause will increase car fuel scales by 20 per cent. for petrol vehicles. I am all in favour of using fiscal instruments to promote environmental measures 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Will Labour Back Benchers be a little more quiet? The hon. Gentleman is having to shout to make himself heard. [Laughter.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Mr. Butterfill, I am very grateful to you for your protection. I am sure that Labour Members will now be quiet and listen to my useful words of advice for the Financial Secretary.
<P>
The previous Government used fiscal instruments with much success. For example, the fiscal instruments on rebalancing the charge for petrol in favour of unleaded over leaded petrol was an outstanding success. It reduced airborne lead levels by 70 per cent. My hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham said that liquid petroleum gas produced about one 20th of the PM 10 particulates and about one third of the nitrogen oxide gases produced by diesel engines. There is a clear benefit to be had from any fiscal instrument that encourages a switch to LPG vehicles.
<P>
Unfortunately, I do not think that the Financial Secretary will accept the amendment, although she should. The national air quality strategy is a key government objective, but it is freely admitted that there are significant policy gaps and that current policies are insufficient to deliver the hoped-for improvements. If so, we should go further and encourage the switch to LPG vehicles and help to set up the infrastructure to deliver gas to LPG cars. The Committee may be interested to know that Calor Gas and its partner, Helfords, are investing significantly in a network to do that.
<P>
On tax and physical incentives, the previous Government started the process, as you will remember Mr. Butterfill, of encouraging low emissions and a switch to LPG vehicles. As my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham said, we cut the vehicle excise duty for LPG vehicles by 25 per cent. We also cut vehicle excise duty for low emission lorries to  500, but that has yet to be implemented by the Government.
<P>
It would be possible to come up with a whole package of amendments, of which amendment No. 136 could be one, to help to encourage a switch to LPG vehicles. I am thinking in terms of zero VAT on the cost of conversion and concessions on the capital allowances on conversion. The amendment would halve the benefit in kind that becomes taxable, which would be a significant step because all fiscal measures take some time to come into effect. The Government should come up with a proper, concerted strategy to ensure that that considerable environmental benefit is brought about. There are between 700,000 and 1 million LPG vehicles in Holland and in Japan. It would be a significant improvement to the environment if we could aspire to something similar.
<P>
If the Financial Secretary cannot accept the amendment, I hope that she will give some indication that the Government will introduce a package of measures to encourage the switch to LPG vehicles so that we do not have mere tokenism on green issues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): We have certainly heard a lot of gas this evening the second wind of the bean counters. It is all very well, after 18 years, hearing all that environmental tokenism and quotes from Friends of the Earth the loyal supporters of the Tory party. It is ridiculous and absurd. My hon. Friend the Financial Secretary is wearing green and I look forward to the strategy for an environmentally sensitive Britain.
<P>
The reality is that in the Budget we have made our first moves towards the sustainable future, not just by changing the impact of taxation from usage to consumption, but in terms of the level and types of taxes that have emerged.
<P>
Anyone reading the amendment would have an element of sympathy with it because it begins to consider for the first time the key area of gas usage instead of petrol usage, but we have not heard anything about that from the Opposition in the past. The legacy of gas usage that we inherited is disgraceful. Do you know how many gas-powered vehicles there are in this country Mr. Butterfill? In Italy, Mr. Butterfill, more than 1 million vehicles are gas-driven, but in Britain there are fewer than 2,000. That is the legacy of your gas.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not have any gas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> It is nothing to do with your gas, Mr. Butterfill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman should have declared an interest in hot air before starting his speech.
<P>
On the point made by the hon. Gentleman, what is the difference between the last Conservative Budget, which cut excise duty on LPG, and the Labour Budget, which did nothing to reduce excise duty on LPG? Which of those two Budgets was more environmentally aware and environmentally friendly?
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies:</B> Obviously, we are building on the past. First, thanks to that past, there are virtually no gas-propelled vehicles in operation. Secondly, as was rightly pointed out, the marketplace lacks the infrastructure for natural gas or LPG. Clearly, a wider strategy is needed that accelerates movement towards usage of cleaner fuels, but in a way that sensibly meets the needs of the Exchequer and the environment.
<P>
Tokenist information scribbled on the back of an envelope following a telephone conversation with Friends of the Earth does not constitute serious opposition. Labour Members are sensitive to the needs of the environment. Only yesterday, as chair of the Back-Bench group on the environment, transport and the regions, I had the privilege of hosting an excellent speech by my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary. She discussed the future of the environment, the fiscal impact of incentives, and the encouragement of voluntary activity. Perhaps we shall hear some of that speech later. It made clear to those involved in the green community if one can call it that the direction in which we are moving.
<P>
When considering an environmentally sensitive future that invites greater usage of fuels such as gas, we should remember the enormous investment that the Government are making, and will continue to make, in public transport. An additional  500 million has been allocated to rural transport, for which the Opposition has acclaimed us. Moreover, we all look forward with bated breath to the transport White Paper.
<P>
After 18 years of neglect, a sustainable future for the economy and for our children, based on an integrated transport policy, cannot be achieved through words written down after a few chats with people with whom one formerly had no contact. Instead, we need a strategic approach such as the Government's, which I gladly support.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> The hon. Gentleman keeps going on about the backs of envelopes and snatched minutes on the telephone. I wonder whether he has read the reports of the Environmental Audit Select Committee, to which the Financial Secretary was dragged kicking and screaming. They were based on the input of many environmental groups, and they make interesting reading. Many of my and my hon. Friends' comments are based on those hard facts and figures. Has the hon. Gentleman read those reports?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Of course I have looked at them. I am glad to see that the hon. Gentleman's knowledge of the matter is confined to one recent report. I would have expected his knowledge to be much greater.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I will give way. I look forward to seeing the envelope backs that you will present.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> We have had a series of outrageous remarks from the hon. Gentleman. Opposition knowledge of the matter is in fact wide ranging. A presentation to the House was recently made in Westminster Hall, which some of us attended. I did not recognise the hon. Gentleman there, although he may have been standing at the back counting his beans.
[Mr. St. Aubyn]
<P>
We have not encouraged the use of gas-driven cars until now, because of questions of cost and safety. The containers in whch the fuel is held require substantial investment. We promoted the use of gas for large trucks in particular, which otherwise generate a great deal of carbon monoxide and other noxious gases. Almost 20,000 trucks in this country run on road fuel gas.

<P>
If he really wants to prove his green credentials, he should vote with us for the amendment. We shall be looking carefully at the votes of all Labour Members to identify which of them are truly green and which of them are not, and we shall ensure that the outside world is made aware of our findings.
<P>
<H5>7.00 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am afraid that I cannot ask the Committee to support this ill-thought-out piece of tokenism, which is not set within a wider, strategic understanding of the needs of the economy or of the environment. In order that we may enjoy such an understanding, I shall sit down to listen to my learned friend, the Financial Secretary.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Difficult as it is to resist the natural charm, modesty and politeness of the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham in moving the amendment, I must ask the Committee to reject it.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to introduce a reduced fuel scale charge by which free fuel is provided for private motoring in company cars that are capable of running on road fuel gases. The Government's intention is to encourage all employees to buy their own fuel for private use, whether it is petrol, diesel or road fuel gases. Drivers who buy their own fuel for private use are more likely to consider whether their private journeys are necessary. The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham often speaks on environmental issues, and he will understand that.
<P>
The problem with the amendment is that it seeks to introduce a lower fuel scale charge for cars that are capable of running on road fuel gases. Some road fuel gas cars retain the capability to run on petrol. If the amendment were accepted, employees would therefore benefit from a lower fuel scale charge even if their employer provided petrol for most of their private journeys. I know, from what the hon. Gentleman has said, that that is not his intention. His intention was to encourage greater use of road fuel gases. I am rejecting the amendment not because it is not a good idea, but because that complication means that it could not be applied.
<P>
Our policy is to encourage the use of road fuel gases by all drivers, not by company car drivers only. The duty on road fuel gases has been frozen to make them more attractive at the pump to business users and to private users. The hon. Gentleman pointed out the limited availability of road fuel gases and the need to promote that further.
<P>
Clause 60 deals specifically with the removal of benefit in kind on extra expenses that enable company cars to run on road fuel gases. The points that the hon. Gentleman made about the need to encourage the use of road fuel gases are more appropriate to this clause.
<P>
I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would accept that in developing our environmental agenda, the Government's policy is to look specifically at urgan pollution and the use of fuels; on second thoughts, I am not sure that he would accept that. The clause focuses on the availablity of free fuel to company car users for their private mileage. I know that the hon. Gentleman agrees that we should be encouraging people to reduce their private mileage. I am sure he would also agree that the removal of free fuel, which encourages people to drive more private mileage without taking into account the damage to the environment, is a good thing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am not convinced by that performance. It is always entertaining to be addressed by the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Davies) but talk of beans and trucks did not answer the issues behind this important amendment. I appreciate the Financial Secretary's comments, but when she encapsulates her response in the phrase "this cannot be applied because of this complication", her rebuttal is all about semantics.
<P>
The whole point of the amendment is to provide a bold gesture. We need the infrastructure to provide this fuel so that more cars can use it and more companies can convert their fleets. Only in that way will we have cleaner fuel-driven cars on our roads. I fear that the Minister's case was a cop-out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Did my hon. Friend note the dismissive way in which the Financial Secretary dealt with the corporate sector? Clearly, the major switch to LPG has to come from the corporate sector first, because of the volume needed to encourage investment in infrastructure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> My hon. Friend is correct. As I said, 50 per cent. of all new cars are company cars, so that is where it will have an effect. It is no good giving in rebuttal the excuse that the Government have contributed to the environment by freezing the dury on road fuel gases to make them more attractive. We do not need to freeze it we need to cut it drastically just to come down to the level of the highest excise duty in other EU nations. We need boldness and the amendment is an attempt at that, although I realise that it is not ideal.
<P>
I had hoped that the Government would have given us something on which to hang the environmental hook in other parts of the Budget. However, this is a start. From small acorns came the unleaded oak tree that we have today. I fear that I am getting slightly carried away with my metaphors. We need boldness. On the basis of a wholly inadequate response from the vast majority of Labour Members, a woefully inadequate response from the one Labour Back-Bencher and another inadequate response from the Financial Secretary, we shall press the amendment to a vote.

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 135, in page 45, line 4, leave out "1999-00" and insert "1998-99".
<P>
I will detain the Committee for only a minute because I made my point on the previous amendment as the Financial Secretary said, this provision follows on from clause 59.
<P>
The Government have acknowledged the principle of the attractiveness of road fuel gases over other hydrocarbon oils and that they are less harmful to the environment. The Government are right in this clause not to penalise companies and company car drivers who have had their cars converted to those cleaner forms of fuel.
<P>
Having conceded that principle and disgraced themselves on the previous amendment, the Government have another opportunity to appear environmentally friendly rather than shy away from appearing so. My hon. Friends and I can see no reason for them to delay a change in the tax treatment until the 1999-2000 financial year. Why can the change not start in this financial year? Exhaust emissions are no respecters of the financial year end. It makes eminent sense to me and my hon. Friends for us to introduce the measure in the current financial year 1998-99. To do otherwise would be mean-minded.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I do not know what charm school the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham went to, but perhaps he should go and get his money back if he paid for lessons on how to persuade somebody to accept his amendments. If my acceptance of his amendment depended only on the way in which he moved it, I might be inclined to oppose it. However, the hon. Gentleman has a good point.
<P>
The Government were clear when we drafted the clause that we wanted it properly to reflect the technicalities of building and adapting cars to run on road fuel gases. We did not want the measure to take effect until April 1999 so that there was an opportunity for an assessment to be carried out. As the measure has been in the public domain, and because of the scrutiny that it has received, I am happy to tell the hon. Gentleman that I accept his amendment. The bringing forward of the implementation is clearly in line with Government policy. I do not think that everybody should be in a holiday mood, but even when Ministers are provoked they are prepared to accept a good idea if one is put forward.

<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> After the success of my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham, I rise in eager anticipation of achieving a similar degree of success with this amendment. I am sad to learn that it does not stand in the name of the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) as well as in those of myself and my hon. Friends.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> In the spirit of contrition that is now in the room, I must apologise to the Chairman and to the Committee for the point of order that I raised at the beginning of the sitting. I was not aware that my name had been joined to amendment No. 125. My colleagues perceptively tabled the same amendment. Their names were lost, and mine remained. I join the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham in apologising, not to the Financial Secretary but to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> I am delighted to learn that the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon is back on board with the amendment.
<P>
I understand that the purpose of the schedule and the clause to which it is attached is to clarify and simplify the tax treatment of employees' travelling and subsistence expenses. Employees have long been able to obtain tax relief on the costs of travelling to a temporary place of work. Tax relief should be restricted to a temporary place of work. It is obviously right that it should not be extended to the normal commuting costs incurred by employees travelling from home to their permanent place of employment.
<P>
In tightening the defnition of the place of employment and simplifying the rules, however, the Government have made a change that will have a dramatic impact on people employed on short-term fixed contracts to work in a location that cannot possibly be regarded as a permanent place of employment. That is precisely what happens in the film industry: crews are hired to work for a short period on location, anywhere in the United Kingdom.
<P>
The film industry is unusual in that regard. Skillset, the industry's training body, estimates that 60 per cent. of employees work as freelances on short-term contracts. Typically, each contract lasts for a few weeks or months the time taken to make a film or television programme. Contracts lasting more than a year are highly unusual.
<P>
Where possible, film makers choose to use local staff, but electricians, cameramen or sound recorders perform highly specialised work and are unlikely to be available locally. So when films are shot in remote locations, it is often necessary to bring in staff from outside the area and to accommodate them in hotels for the duration of the shoot.
<P>
That is not a benefit for such staff. I am sure that people would prefer to work closer to home, but it is typical of the needs of the industry. The short-term nature of the contracts means that the people involved must maintain a permaent home residence as well as meet the costs of accommodation. It has always been possible for film crews to obtain tax relief on the cost of travel and accommodation. The clause will change that, so that tax will be paid in future.
<P>
No employee will accept a contract under which he or she will be liable for tax on the cost of hotel and travel expenses, especially when, in may cases, the liability will exceed the net earnings for the job. The clause will mean that the production companies will have to gross up expenses payments to allow for the additional income tax and national insurance costs. That may mean that they will pay an extra 40 per cent. in income tax costs, plus an additional 10 per cent. in national insurance.
<P>
For instance, a hotel bill of  1,000 might cost a producer nearly  2,000. Moreover, curious anomalies will be created. A film may be shot in one main location and in one secondary location, so that the secondary location may be regarded as a temporary workplace and thus tax relief will be allowed on the travel. Yet if, when filming is completed at one location, the production moves on to a second location for a similar length of time, the Inland Revenue will determine that both locations are permanent workplaces and so are not liable for tax relief on travel.
<P>
The industry has made representations to the Minister, and I have seen a copy of the Financial Secretary's reply to Mr. Hastie, the chief executive of the Producers Industrial Relations Service. In that, she states that the changes in rules represent a significantly more generous approach to relief than the current arrangements. That is right in one respect. Previously, tax relief for travel costs from a permaent place of employment was available for people working in a temporary place of employment. In future, that relief will be available from people's homes, which might be of benefit. But the Financial Secretary's reply to Mr. Hastie went on to say that she was not sure why those in the film industry were worried that the new rules may cause a substantial cut in relief for employees engaged on employment contracts that last only for the duration of a particular work or film project. I must tell the Financial Secretary that it is already happening. When the industry's representatives met Inland Revenue officials from tax office LP10, which deals with the film industry, they were told of the intention no longer to provide tax relief. Since then, the Inland Revenue has already advised producers that tax relief is no longer available. The purpose of amendment No. 125 is to provide an exemption for this category of film industry employees.
<P>
The effect of the removal of tax relief will be substantially to increase location filming costs in Britain. It might help the Committee if I were to give a few examples. "Divorcing Jack", which is currently one of the UK's entries in the Cannes film festival, was shot on location in Belfast and should shortly be screened in this country. The expenditure on crew, hotels and travelling expenses from London to Belfast for that film was around  183,000 out of a  2.4 million budget. Under the proposed legislation, the company would have spent a further  160,000, which represents a 6.67 per cent. increase in the total film budget.
<P>
"The Avengers" a major film opening in London in about a week or 10 days, starring Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman and Sean Connery was made in this country and cost  90,000 in location expenses. If this measure had been in force, a further  75,000 would have been added to the film's budget. "Cider with Rosie", which is currently being filmed in Stroud, would be hit to the tune of  15,000.
<P>
David Scott, the managing director of Channel Four Television Corporation, has written to me to say that his estimate of the additional costs in tax and insurance are likely to be between 1 per cent. and 4 per cent. of a film's budget. He goes on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The adverse impact will of course be felt more by productions outside of the main centres therefore production in Scotland, could be particularly badly affected by this unwelcome increase in the cost of production."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The cost of making "Trainspotting", which had a budget of around  2.5 million, would have increased by perhaps  100,000 under this measure.
<P>
My final example is a film called "Elizabeth I", which stars Cate Blanchett, an Australian actress. It will open in this country in the autumn, and its budget was around  15 million. If the proposed rules had been in place, the additional cost of paying the grossed up rate on travel expenses and hotel costs, would have been  330,000. While that might still seem a relatively small proportion of a  15 million budget, film industry budgets are tightly drawn and can be tipped over by just a small increase. I have a letter from Maggie Phelan, who was the financial controller for "Elizabeth I". She states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Our film was very tightly budgeted at around  15 million sterling and many difficult choices were made to be able to contain the project within the amount of money... If we had had to find another  330,000 from the fixed budget it would probably have led to the cancellation of the film as the integrity of the project would have been damaged beyond repair by further cuts that would have been required to meet the financial target."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a measure of the seriousness of the Government's proposed change. It may lead to films no longer being made in this country and it may have a devastating effect on the industry. Steven Norris, the British film commissioner has said that the proposals strike at the core of the decision making consideration for producers that is, the bottom line costs. He stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The immediate result of the increase will clearly be the message that Britain has higher labour costs, not inherently due to the nature of the production sector, but because of a short-sighted tax policy... be assured that the UK will lose productions to other countries and international producers will be hard to entice back, if at all. In terms of perception, be absolutely assured that these proposals will be viewed by international producers as a short-term, narrow-minded policy."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>7.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The British film commissioner also made the point that the proposal will hit in particular those films that are to be made in the regions. Films will be more likely to be made in London or close to the main centre of production and fewer films will be filmed on location in the regions. As he clearly states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"This result will be in direct opposition to the Government's manifesto to encourage the growth of the media industry on a regional basis."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is not just the big budget films that will be hit by the measure. Earlier this afternoon I spoke to Cecilia Garnett. She is the chairman of the Advertising Film and Videotape Producers Association which represents almost every maker of commercials in this country. The industry has a turnover of about  500 million. She told me that there is no doubt that if the measure proceeds, productions will be lost to the UK because they will go to lower cost production centres, probably in eastern Europe.
<P>
One of the ironies of productions going overseas is that travel and subsistence costs will enjoy tax relief. The special rules under sections 193 and 194 of the Taxes Act 1988 will apply to employment carried on wholly abroad. As Mr. David MacLean of Ernst and Young said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"This suggests... the point that the new rules, if they are not changed, will force film makers to prefer locations in (say) the Irish Republic to locations in the UK, and this will be to the detriment of the UK film industry and, indirectly, to the UK economy."<P>

Nearly a year ago in this Room we debated the Government's concession to the film industry, which granted 100 per cent. tax relief on production and acquisition costs. I welcomed that measure which I though would do real good for the film industry, and the experience over the year is that it has helped a great deal. At that time the Paymaster General, who was answering on behalf of the Government, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"This is a defined and limited measure; it is to encourage films that meet the criteria to be made in Britain to contribute to our ouput in a sector that is growing very quickly." [Official Report, Standing Committee A, 23 July 1997; c. 485.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He went on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"if we could locate more of the American film making industry in the United Kingdom, there would be a sound case for encouraging such films to be made here." [Official Report, Standing Committee A, 23 July 1997; c. 507.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Since then, we have had the publication of the report by the Film Policy Review Group which was chaired by the Minister responsible for film and tourism and Mr. Stewart Till, the president of Polygram International. The report, which I understand is now Government policy, stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Government should also consider the case for introducing tax incentives which encourage investment in the business of film."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, it went on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the industry members of the Group agreed unanimously"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that tax incentives are one of the most important issues under review. The report also said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is precisely the big-budget pictures that are the most internationally mobile, since slight cost advantages, in percentage terms, can make a big difference in absolute terms to the final budget."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Did the Financial Secretary consult the Minister responsible for film and tourism and the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport before introducing the change, which seems to fly in the face of the report by the Film Policy Review Group? I would be interested to know whether she has received representations from the Secretary of State because she has certainly received representations from the entire film industry. During the past year, the Government have made much of the support that they are giving to the film industry. Indeed, the Chancellor of the Exchequer seems to be extremely fond of throwing parties for film stars in No. 11 Downing street, in order to pat himself on the back for everything that he is doing for the film industry. Yet, in this measure, he has managed to unite the film industry against him.
[Mr. Whittingdale]
<P>
To demonstrate that, I want to tell the Committee which organisations oppose the clause and are campaigning against it. They include the Producers Alliance for Cinema and Television, the Guild of Film Production Executives, Channel 4, Channel 5, the British Film Commission, the Broadcasting Entertainments Cinematical and Theatre Union, the Guild of Film Production Accountants, the Independent Television Association, the Advertising, Film and Videotape Producers Association, the Production Managers Association and, finally, the Producers Industrial Relations Service Ltd.
<P>
There can be no doubt that this measure will cause real damage to the British film industry and if it is accepted, more films will be made abroad. If the Government really support the film industry, they will support our amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I rise to support the hon. Gentleman's remarks and apologise to him for my temporary amnesia with respect to the name of his constituency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> Maldon and Chelmsford, East.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman because he made much of my speech for me and quoted many of the real life examples of which I had been informed. He put his case eloquently and showed that this tax proposal will hit the film and television industry in this country, resulting in significant cost increases and damage to the industry. As he said, the problem arises from the definition of permanent workplace. While that definition is reasonable for most people, for others who earn their living from a series of short-term contracts, working at a variety of locations for short periods, the definition is seriously flawed. One can think of several jobs and groups of professionals that will be badly affected, but the film and television industry will be extremely damaged if the proposal is unamended.
<P>
When films are shot, often on remote locations, the travelling expenses of employees can be high. Those employees, such as electricians, cameramen, cooks and cleaners may not be well paid. It is possible that their employers will bear the brunt of the tax increases, but some employees will have to bear the brunt, which is an important factor for the Government to consider. By increasing their tax bill, it is likely that film producers will bear the cost for the most part, and that will lead them to take different decisions. They will have much higher production costs, which may cause some producers not to make films at all. Indeed, they may decide to make their films outside the UK, reducing employment and exports.
<P>
The damaging effects of the clause seem to fly in the face of the Government's proposals for the film industry. As the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale) said, the Government recently published the report of the Film Policy Review Group. One of the key objectives in that report was to provide a financial framework to facilitate and encourage sustained investment in the British film industry. Indeed, the report says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"we need to create an environment that is attractive to foreign investors and supportive of British exporters".</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the clause is enacted, the contrary will be the case. The clause flies in the face of the Chancellor's words. He admitted in his Budget speech on 2 July 1997 that too many British films that could be made in Britain were being made abroad or were not being made at all, and he went on to announce some encouragements for the British industry. The welcome encouragements from the previous Budget will be offset by the clause.
<P>
I agree with the point that was made earlier about the clause's negative effect on our nations and regions. Northern Ireland and Scotland have many remote locations that are ideal for filming. Those countries have wonderful scenery and therefore enjoy a natural comparative advantage in the competition for locations for filming. Given the Scottish hue in the Treasury, I would expect Ministers to be especially concerned about that.
<P>
One of my colleagues was written to by a Glasgow-based production company called Scottish Screen, which is concerned about the clause's effects on the Scottish economy. It paints a nightmare picture of the ending of location shooting in Scotland and it describes how it would be affected and how production might become more studio-bound and therefore less innovative and creative. It also made an interesting point about how tourism could be affected. After the film about William Wallace was released, many people visited the sites that were shown in the film. Scottish Screen estimated that location filming has injected  102 million into the Scottish economy over the past eight years.
<P>
The Government told the television and film industries that there is no problem and that they need not be concerned. In a letter that the Financial Secretary sent to Graham Benson of the Producers Alliance for Cinema and Television, she wrote:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"where an individual spends most of his or her employment whether it is a short-term or a long-term contract at a particular location, that place will be the employee's permanent workplace and under the normal rules, no relief will be available for the costs of home to work travel. The new rules are no different from the present rules on that score."</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have to tell the Financial Secretary that people remain concerned. As the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford said, the advice that is coming from Inland Revenue officials seems to be that the film industry is right to be concerned.
<P>
I hope that the Financial Secretary will clarify the situation. If the television and film industries will not be affected, will she state that for the record? If not, will she support amendment No. 125?
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaun Woodward </B>(Witney): It is very sad to have to say this, but this is an absolutely dreadful Budget for the arts. The amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford is necessary because the clause contains an appalling contradiction in Government policy. The left hand in this case, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport has claimed that it wants more films to be made in the United Kingdom. The right hand in this case, the Treasury saw an opportunity to raise the amount of tax revenue, and it went for it. There is a central contradiction at the heart of the clause, just as there was in the clause relating to historic houses, which we discussed two days ago.
<P>
The hallmark of these clauses is the fact that the Government do not understand the situation, although I do not believe that there is any malign intent. They have simply not understood the impact that the clause will have. That is why I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and Chelmsford East on moving this sensible amendment, which has the wholehearted support of those in the film industry.
<P>
I have some experience in this sector; I worked for 10 years in the television industry, all the while on short-term contracts. They are the way of life in this industry. It is easy to see that the clause has been devised by people who do not understand its consequences. Hon. Members have spoken about its immediate impact employers will gross up payments: they will have to because it will be the only way in which they can compensate employees for the extra income tax and national insurance liability.
<P>
<H5>7.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The extra costs will pass to the tourist industry which relies on people on short-term contracts staying in local hotels, bed and breakfast places and so forth. The impact will be to send films abroad.
<P>
In last year's debate on the Finance Bill, we discussed the impact of the Government's proposed changes to the film industry and, in particular, their proposals to help film production when what was actually needed was help for film distribution. Film distribution remains a crucial problem in this country. Excellent films are being made but they cannot be distributed. For example, a good film was made recently by David Rock Savage of a Truman Capote novel, but it was unable to find a distributor in this country. The Government fail to understand the problem.
<P>
Will the Minister tell the Committee which employers in the film industry thought that the proposal was a good idea? Secondly, when the Minister replies, will she tell us whether there have been full consultations with the Department of Culture, Media and Sport over the consequences of the measure on the film industry. Are the consequences in figures and, if so, will they be made available to the Committee?
<P>
It is a bad clause. It would be improved by the amendment and I urge the Government to consider it seriously and accept it.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> It will help the Committee if I explain the involvement of the hon. Member for Maldon and Chelmsford, East in the clause and mention that he voted for it once before in the Finance Bill 1997, as indeed did the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory). It is a shame that the hon. Gentleman was unable to be on the 1997 Finance Bill Committee because it would have been interesting to hear his comments about his own Government.
<P>
The clause replaces the legislation on tax relief for business travel expenses. It was introduced, voted on and passed into the Finance Act 1997. The 1997 provisions were due to take effect on 1 April 1997 and they would have replaced legislation that was in force for 150 years. Unfortunately, the previous Government had drafting problems and it became clear to employers that there were considerable difficulties in applying the regulations as well as substantial compliance costs for employer organisations. After much discussion, it was announced in September that we would remove the faulty provisions and replace them in the Finance Bill that we are now considering with proposals that had been discussed and agreed. The matter concerns all employees and whether they can claim travel-to-work expenses. No employee can do so, as a general rule.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman voted for the very definition that he now claims to dislike when he supported the Conservative Government on the issue in 1997. That was not all that long ago. One might have expected him to remember, or at least to have had the good grace to acknowledge someone must have pointed it out to him during all the lobbying and discussion that the current rules were suspended because of their inadequacy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> The hon. Lady is missing the point. The taxation relief was not removed as a result of the 1997 Budget. It continued. It is being removed by the measure that we are discussing. That is the advice that the Inland Revenue is giving the film industry.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> If the hon. Gentleman cares to scrutinise the Conservative Government's last Finance Bill, he will see what he voted for. The amendment which is not as narrow as has been suggested by virtue of its relevance to the film industry would open the way for all employees with short-term contracts to claim relief for the full cost of travel for all their journeys from home to their place of work. That has never been the intention of tax law and it is not the intention of the Government now.
<P>
The new travel rules apply equally to all employees. That is clearly the right approach. We cannot make a commitment to alter the rules to fit certain circumstances or favour a certain group. The letter that has been referred to was about the fact of which I assure the Committee that the Inland Revenue will carefully consider any difficulties to which the new rules may give rise. They are always ready to discuss those.
<P>
The film industry claims that in the past, workers employed for one-off production have received tax relief for the relevant type of travel, even though it was not due under law. That may have been so. The fact is that in the years before 1997 several local concessions and administrative practices grew up, often with little basis in law. The fundamental point is that now, regardless of past events, the same rules should apply to all employees across the board. Representative bodies have made it clear that now that the travel rules have been overhauled by the Government, they should be applied consistently to all employees.
<P>
For the reasons that I have given, we find it difficult to justify legislating for special rules for particular industries. What the hon. Gentleman missed is the purpose of the rules and their effect on employees. In discussions in the Standing Committee which considered the previous Finance Bill, Opposition Members showed their considerable knowledge of the [Dawn Primarolo]
film industry. However, that has no relevance to the clause. I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I think that I speak on behalf of my hon. Friends when I say that the Financial Secretary's response is inadequate. She has failed to answer the questions asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Malden and East Chelmsford and other hon. Members, who have shown great expertise about the industry, about how the industry's international standing and success will be damaged by the clause.
<P>
The Financial Secretary cannot argue that the rules have changed for everyone, and that therefore the film industry will have the lump it, if the legislation is bad. We have no quarrel with the application of the rules to the generality of employees, but we insist that their probably unintended consequence will be extremely damaging to a mobile and international industry in which Britain must fight to retain investment and activity in competition with several other countries, which will continue to treat employees in such industries with more generosity and understanding. The Financial Secretary has not even referred to the points made about how the clause will advantage London, as against the regions the opposite of devolution and how it will help foreign film-makers as against those in the United Kingdom. It will increase costs in an industry that is assessed globally in terms of costs and of what it can offer foreign investors. We are driven to conclude that the well-thought-out submission made by the industry is of no interest to a Government whopretend to be on the side of the film interest, and dole out lottery cash to a few lucky recipients, but hit people who make small films, on which the future of the industry rests. We intend, therefore, to press the amendment to a vote.
