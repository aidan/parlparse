<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012115000249"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Good morning, everyone. I remind
colleagues&#151;you probably do not need reminding&#151;that this
sitting finishes at 10.25 am; it is relatively
short.</div>
<a name="10012115000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome our
witnesses. I am not sure whether all of you have given evidence before
to a Committee such as this, but it is pretty straightforward. We have
asked you here this morning so that colleagues can gather evidence,
which will be helpful when the Committee stage of our proceedings
starts next week. As I have said to other witnesses, relax and enjoy
the experience. Will you kindly introduce yourselves, and perhaps make
a brief comment on the Bill? May we start with Sir Jim
Rose?</div><a name="10012115000015"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Jim Rose:</b></i> I am Jim Rose. I retired from Ofsted,
director of education and director of inspection, in 1999. Since then,
I have done several reviews. The latest, of course, was the primary
curriculum review, which to some extent may be on the table
today.</div>
<a name="10012115000016"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sue
Barratt:</b></i> I am Sue Barratt. I am head teacher at
Bournville junior school in Birmingham. I have been working for quite a
few years on the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority advisory
committee, which for part of that time was the lead vehicle for Sir Jim
Rose&#146;s review. At present, I am working with the national
college of school leadership on the implementation of the new primary
curriculum, particularly on the leadership aspect.</div>
<a name="10012115000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">I generally
support the Children, Schools and Families Bill. From my point of view
as a head teacher, I really don&#146;t want it to cause unnecessary
work and bureaucracy in schools. I also ask that careful consideration
is given to the lead-in times for the new initiatives, so that they do
not all fall on schools at the same time&#151;that is, in September
2011&#151;and we are not faced with all these things coming at
once.</div>
<a name="10012115000018"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
McIntosh:</b></i> I am John McIntosh. I was headmaster at the
London Oratory school for just under 30 years. I retired three years
ago. I now do some advisory work with local authorities, mainly
Hammersmith and Fulham. I tutor on two postgraduate certificate in
education courses at Buckingham university, and I am a governor of
three schools.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column82" />Column number: 82</div><a name="10012115000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">My stance on
the Bill is that it increases central prescription and introduces a lot
more unnecessary bureaucracy. It shifts the balance of responsibility
from governors and heads to the state and, to some extent, it
undermines the rights of parents and families. It will distract primary
schools from focusing on improving the quality of teachers,
particularly in reading, literacy and numeracy, and undermine the
integrity of individual
subjects.</div><a name="10012115000020"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012115000250"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Thank
you.</div><a name="10012115000021"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">122</b><a name="10012115000251"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Nick Gibb</b> (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton) (Con): I want
first to ask Sir Jim Rose a couple of questions. What is the difference
between mathematics&#151;the current national curriculum for primary
schools under section 84 of the Education Act 2002&#151;and
mathematical understanding, which is what you propose as an area of
learning in clause 10 of the
Bill?</div><a name="10012115000022"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Jim Rose:</b></i> I am not sure that it is anything different
from what we have now. The existing national curriculum requires
knowledge, skills and understanding to be the structure under which we
decide the content of subjects or otherwise. My recollection from
sitting on Sir Peter Williams&#146; review of maths was that the
pattern that he was promoting and, in fact, recommended was just that.
We have simply supported it. In other words, the national curriculum
was structured originally, and still is, under knowledge, skills and
understanding. My review takes that forward and simply says that we
need to make absolutely sure that the knowledge content is well
defined, that the skills that go with it are clearly well defined and
that we apply the knowledge and skills to win
understanding.</div><a name="10012115000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am pleased that you picked on mathematics. It is a particularly good
example. In the recent past, Ofsted commented on maths and said that
children are taught sums, but often do not know what sums to do or how
to apply that knowledge when it comes to a practical situation. Given
that sort of evidence, which has come forward fairly consistently, I
think that the way in which we are suggesting things should be
structured is very
sensible.</div><a name="10012115000024"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
123</b><b class="B"><a name="10012115000252"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> But you said initially that you were not sure that
it was anything different from what we have
now.</div><a name="10012115000025"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Jim Rose:</b></i> We say quite clearly in the review that we
support the national curriculum as an entitlement. I think that there
is too much in it, and that has always been the problem for primary,
which I shall elaborate on if you wish. We should certainly be doing
something about that. We are not stepping back. In fact, I would like
to think that what we have achieved is a massive reinforcement of what
everyone recognises as the basics for primary education&#151;with the
biggest impact hopefully being on
literacy.</div><a name="10012115000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
124</b><b class="B"><a name="10012115000253"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b><b class="B"> </b>Well, let us pick up literacy and your
comment about prescription. You say in your report that the criticism
was that the existing curriculum had so much prescribed content. I have
here the programme of study for the English subject or area of
learning, as you call it. It has 84 objectives. Why do we need so much
prescription for our professional teachers in this country? Why do we
need objectives? Why do we need 84 objectives? Why do we need
objectives like M15</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column83" />Column number: 83</div><a name="10012115000220"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to recognise how
authors of moving image and multimodal texts use different combinations
of words, images and sounds to create effects and make
meaning&#148;?</div><a name="10012115000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
does that mean, and why do we have to have so much prescription for our
professional
teachers?</div><a name="10012115000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Jim Rose:</b></i> Two things: first, when the national
curriculum was introduced, it contained probably three times as many
statements of attainment, which corresponds, I think, to what you are
now pointing out. Over time&#151;it is not due to my review
alone&#151;we have actually reduced
that.</div><a name="10012115000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">125</b><b class="B"><a name="10012115000254"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Why not just scrap the whole thing?</div>
<a name="10012115000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Jim Rose:</b></i> Well, let me just take an area in which you
are very interested and have done a lot to support&#151;literacy; the
teaching of reading. If you look at the teaching of reading, one of the
great sins of omission in the past was the attention that was given to
phonic work in the broader programme of English. It was the one thing
that, immediately the pressures were on, tended to be neglected. We
brought that back to a very important status within literacy, and if
you wish to make sure that that is secure, you have to recognise that
teaching children how the alphabet works is crucial, so what is said
there, somehow, somewhere, will
be:</div><a name="10012115000221"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Grapheme-phoneme...correspondences...in
a clearly defined, incremental sequence.</div>
<a name="10012115000222"></a><div class="hs_brev">To apply the highly
important skill of blending (synthesising) phonemes in order, all
through a word to read
it.</div><a name="10012115000223"></a><div class="hs_brev">To apply
the skills of segmenting words into their constituent phonemes to
spell.</div> <a name="10012115000224"></a><div class="hs_brev">That
blending and segmenting are reversible processes.&#148;</div>
<a name="10012115000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other words, reading
and writing&#151;spelling and reading&#151;are reversible
processes. If we are going to help teachers see the progression that is
needed, and what it is that they actually need to do, you have to have
some level of prescription. The issue is how
much.</div>
<a name="10012115000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">126</b><b class="B"><a name="10012115000255"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> That is E8 that you read out:</div>
<a name="10012115000225"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to hear,
identify, segment and blend phonemes in the order in which they occur
in words to decode
text&#148;.</div><a name="10012115000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is one objective out of 84. It is the only one that mentions that. Are
you saying that teachers in primary schools should spend only one 84th
of the time on the English
curriculum?</div><a name="10012115000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Jim Rose:</b></i> No, no.</div>
<a name="10012115000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">127</b><b class="B"><a name="10012115000256"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> So these objectives do not carry equal weight? It is
an important point.</div>
<a name="10012115000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Jim Rose:</b></i> Of course they do not carry equal weight.
The other important thing, which I think you are pointing out, is that
some of them are so closely related that you will be teaching them
almost simultaneously.</div>
<a name="10012115000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012115000257"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I am not sure that is true.</div>
<a name="10012115000038"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Jim Rose:</b></i> I could certainly give you case histories
that could illustrate that.</div>
<a name="10012115000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">128</b><b class="B"><a name="10012115000258"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> May I open this up now and ask John McIntosh for his
view of the new primary curriculum? I understand you were a headmaster
at the junior school at the London Oratory.</div>
<a name="10012115000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
McIntosh:</b></i> Yes. It has admitted boys at the age of
seven for the past 14 years. It was a department that I established in
the school.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column84" />Column number: 84</div><a name="10012115000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">129</b><b class="B"><a name="10012115000259"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Can you tell us about personal, social, health and
economic education? I would like your views on that as well.</div>
<a name="10012115000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
McIntosh:</b></i> As far as the curriculum is concerned, my
views are perhaps rather more general than those expressed in the Rose
review and the proposed legislation that arises out of it. I feel that
the over-prescription and regulation of the curriculum&#151;not just
in primary but across the board&#151;has to a degree led to what I
might call the deprofessionalisation of teachers, who are now expected
to behave in an almost robotic way in accepting orders from QCA and in
secondary legislation. A lot of the discussion I hear in schools as I
go round now and, before I retired, among one&#146;s colleague heads,
was not about what children should really be learning&#151;about the
real nature of the curriculum&#151;but what children need to do to
meet the Government requirements in respect of the national curriculum
and the targets that they are expected to achieve. Their approach to
the curriculum seems not to be a question of deciding what curriculum
to provide for the particular children they have in their school, but
what they need to do in order to meet the targets and the requirements
of the orders. To add to that at secondary&#151;I find a lot of heads
talk in terms of what they need to do in order to maximise the position
of the school in the league tables rather than what they should be
teaching children at key stage 4. So my criticism of the
Bill is that it just compounds something which I believe is already
seriously flawed, and adds to what I call the deprofessionalisation of
the teaching profession. Teachers are no longer entering into the
dialogue that they really ought to be entering into about the nature of
what they are teaching, and what children in schools ought to be
learning.</div><a name="10012115000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
far as PSHE is concerned, I am looking at the items listed in the Bill.
I do not think I could quibble with most of them. Most good schools are
probably already covering most of those items in the curriculum. What I
do quibble with is the idea that PSHE should be a discrete subject in
the curriculum. Although the Bill does not actually say that, the
effect of putting it in a Bill like this and is that it will become
just that&#151;a discrete subject. The curriculum is already
seriously overcrowded. Heads and senior staff out there are probably
already gearing up to include this in the curriculum. Personally, were
I a parent looking around schools and at prospectuses, if I saw PSHE on
the school curriculum, that would be a school to avoid. I would want to
see all the things that are included in the Bill in the curriculum, but
they should be taught through other
subjects.</div><a name="10012115000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the Rose review, a lot of reference is made to cross-curricular things
and links. This is a good case for cross-curricular work. These things
should all be embedded in the curriculum in other subjects, but you
should be very careful about putting them into legislation in this
form, where they will almost certainly finish up as a discrete subject
in an overcrowded curriculum. These are things that every teacher
should be taking responsibility for; they should not just be
specialists in schools for
PSHE.</div><a name="10012115000045"></a>

alluded to in her opening statement, about just how different teaching
to an area base rather than a subject base will be? What is really
involved between now and 2011, before this comes in, in terms of
training, changes in the classroom and changes in how these previously
subject-based areas were
taught?</div><a name="10012115000055"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Jim Rose:</b></i> Let me have a go at that. First, it is not
right to imagine that what we are doing is displacing the subjects with
areas of learning. What we are saying is that you go through subject
disciplines to get to cross-curricular studies, which will add to
children&#146;s understanding and give them the enthusiasm for
learning that we all want to
see.</div><a name="10012115000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sorry to go over this in historical terms, but it is important to
understand where we are coming from. If you look at the territory as it
exists, the six years that define primary&#151;five to 11&#151;all
seem to be the piggy in the middle. What we do is we sort out early
years, we sort out secondary and then&#151;the problem for this
remit&#151;we have to think about how we get from one to the other.
The early years foundation stage curriculum, is still very largely, and
should be, play-based, with all that that means&#151;not
unstructured, not play all day by whim as it were, so that children are
not being enriched and taken forward in language and so forth. There
are very important goals for play, which are now well and truly
embedded in that early years foundation stage. It 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column86" />Column number: 86</div>is a triumph in my view, apart from one thing, which, if you ask me, I
shall tell you about, which is to do with how much of the curriculum is
atomised into boxes for assessment.</div>
<a name="10012115000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">We look at
primary, and we are saying that we have to get from those six areas
which the foundation stage will have promoted: communication, language
and literacy; personal, social and emotional development; physical
development; knowledge and understanding of the world; creative
development; and problem solving, reasoning and numeracy. That is how
they define their curriculum&#151;not a word that they find easy, but
that is nevertheless what it amounts
to.</div><a name="10012115000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Then
we go to secondary, where we have 13 subjects, or seven plus religious
education. There is no way in which we can pursue a primary curriculum,
which is what we are doing at the moment under that secondary
definition of having boxed off subjects taught in that way&#151;I
mean physically, never mind whether it is right to do so in educational
terms.</div>
<a name="10012115000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">We then ask
what are the other priorities for primary. Surely no one, in this day
and age, is going to step back from saying that we should major on
literacy and numeracy. I have also said that it is important, in
Gibb&#146;s terms, to get information and communications technology
sorted out. That is the new kid on the block, and certainly we should
have done quite an interesting job there. By the end of the primary
phase, however, if we can get the resources right&#151;it is mainly a
matter of human resources; people who know their stuff&#151;we should
be moving more towards a subject designation that ties in to secondary.
That tapestry, that mix and that balance is really what the review has
been about. It has not been easy, and I don&#146;t think we shall
ever be able to get the sort of perfection that many people believe is
possible. I certainly don&#146;t think that defining these things as
objectives sends the right message. What we are trying to put together
is a path of progression.</div>
<a name="10012115000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">If you take
science, at the moment there are things called level descriptors. One
of them is making sure that children understand over that six-year
period, contributing to the secondary curriculum as best we can, how
science works. What is it about science that defines it as a territory
that is a worthwhile investment in educational terms? What constitutes
evidence in science? Organisms and their behaviour and the environment
is another level descriptor&#151;materials, their properties in the
earth, and energy forces in space. That is just for science.</div>
<a name="10012115000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have tried
to indicate what primary teachers also have to do for literacy,
English, mathematics and the rest of it. Remember that by and large we
are talking about a generalist class teacher, with a class of somewhere
around 30&#151;perhaps with support from teaching assistants and so
on. There is nothing new about that; it has been going on since Adam
was a lad. But those are some of the constraints on primary that we
have to
address.</div>
<a name="10012115000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">134</b><b class="B"><a name="10012115000265"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> Do you think that the transition is an enormous
task, or is it an adaptable one, given what people are doing already?
To be honest, in many of the primary schools that I visit, that sort of
thematic work is already happening.</div>
<a name="10012115000063"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Jim Rose:</b></i> Yes, it is. I hope that they do it by
making sure that they do not neglect what they are able to do by way of
subject definition.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column87" />Column number: 87</div><a name="10012115000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Last year, for
example, was Darwin&#146;s bicentenary, and there has been a lot of
hoo-hah about evolution and so on, and teaching it in primary schools.
Lots of primary schools adopted the Kew kits, which furnish a really
good programme for the Darwin bicentenary. What were they studying
under that thematic approach? In history, they are looking at a great
Victorian. In science, certainly, as far as they can understand it, I
can give you some graphic and interesting examples. In geography, where
are the Galapagos islands? How did Darwin get there? Who did he meet on
the way? What are they like now? Who owns them? All of that, in my
view, is a very enriching pattern of learning for primary
children.</div>
<a name="10012115000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">This week, as
we speak, we&#146;ve got some really remarkable stuff going on at the
British Museum&#151;the history of the world in 100 objects. It has
been exhilarating, just the kind of thing that primary children will
latch on to and enjoy&#151;much more, actually, in the subject
domain. What is history? How do we find the evidence? The museum
director said, &#147;It is not to do with looking at all our stuff as
dead objects. We are researching them all the time. We are finding
Saxon hoard gold in Shropshire or a new way of interpreting this axe
and so on.&#148; History is a living thing&#151;terrific. We are
trying to get some of that zest into the primary curriculum.</div>
<a name="10012115000066"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sue
Barratt:</b></i> I would like to give an example of something
that we have been doing at Bournville that relates to the question.
Three years ago, we decided that we did not want to be straitjacketed
by the present curriculum, so we set about writing our own, which we
called the learning journey. It was written to suit the needs of our
pupils, and we wanted to make it more localised, as it would be more
meaningful. As a school, we did a lot of research beforehand with the
children, the parents and the staff to look at the ways in which our
children learned best. We looked at the content that we needed to use
under the national curriculum and the content that would be applicable
for our school, and we blended it. Within our curriculum, we blended
well-focused subject teaching with cross-curricular things.</div>
<a name="10012115000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example,
our year 6 has just completed a study of the frozen house, which is
actually an in-depth historical study of world war two. In year 3, we
have &#147;Where in the World&#148;, where we make a local study of
Bournville and look at its geography and history. Another example is
geography in year 5, where we have &#147;Our World, Our
Responsibility&#148;, which is on the Arctic and the Antarctic. So we
do go into focused subject areas, but we do it as part of our
cross-curricular approach.</div>
<a name="10012115000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Within that,
we obviously have to look at the core skills of literacy and numeracy.
We have been working hard on both of them, looking at transferring our
learning across. In literacy in year 5, we do a study of the Birmingham
Hippodrome, and the children will be required to write play scripts,
reviews etc. Everything is moved across, so you would expect children
in a cross-curricular lesson to produce things for literacy that are at
the same standard as the things that they would produce in a literacy
lesson so that they get the same understanding.</div>
<a name="10012115000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Commonly in
schools, that is not the case. When children are outside the literacy
lesson, and you put them in another situation, they do not apply the
same skills, and that is something that we really have to teach them
for later life so that they get a depth of understanding. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column88" />Column number: 88</div>The school has worked very hard on the issue, and our level 5s in
literacy increased from 35 to 55 per cent. this year, and we think most
of that is due to this cross-curricular approach and taking literacy
across.</div>
<a name="10012115000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should add
that before I came here, I talked to my co-ordinators, and they said
that everybody is welcome to visit us at Bournville if they want to see
how we use cross-curricular themes with this focused subject
teaching.</div>
<a name="10012115000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">135</b><b class="B"><a name="10012115000266"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> I want to come back on a point that John made about
PSHE. On one level, John, I agree with you that, in an ideal world,
teachers would incorporate matters relating to life skills rather in
the way that we have talked about in relation to thematic learning. It
would be lovely if we could incorporate matters such as how to open a
bank account or how to work out the percentages in relation to your
bank interest. I absolutely agree with that, but we do not necessarily
live in an ideal world, and you might need something more specific in
areas such as sex and relationships education, where you might want to
take groups of girls and groups of boys outside the classroom on their
own. Sometimes, the person marking your homework is not necessarily
always the best person to provide support for your emotional and social
development. To be honest, I do not see this is an either/or.</div>
<a name="10012115000072"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
McIntosh:</b></i> First, may I say that my uneasiness about
all this and about all the legislation that has gone before comes from
the fact that I do not think that there is an ideal model out there
somewhere in the ether or a template that can be created centrally to
suit all schools? What works in my school probably will not work in the
school three blocks down the road.</div>
<a name="10012115000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a
general point, but to come back to your more specific point about PSHE,
the job of a good head and his senior staff is to ensure that these
things are properly embedded in the other subjects and to make
arrangements in the curriculum to ensure that that happens. For
instance, when citizenship was made a statutory requirement in schools,
there was no way in which the word citizenship was going to appear on
my timetable or in my curriculum. But we mapped the statutory
requirements right the way across the existing curriculum and, at the
end of it all, we found that we had a number of things that we could
not easily accommodate, even if we had wanted to.</div>
<a name="10012115000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the end,
we introduced a new period each week at key stage 4 called
complementary studies, and we got the best staff we had to teach
half-term modules. That was our way of tackling the issue and making
sure that the statutory requirements were covered. There is no reason
why PSHE should not be approached in the same way. However, rather than
putting it in the Bill, I think it would be much better in a code of
practice. If schools then did not follow that code, they would have to
explain why they were not implementing it and what they were putting in
its place. That would be a much more professional way to treat the
teaching profession and governing bodies that have responsibility for
curriculum, saying, &#147;This is what we believe should be in your
curriculum. It does not have to be a separate subject, but it should be
there, including sex and relationships education.&#148; I agree with
all that, but not that it should be enshrined in primary legislation as
though it is a discrete subject.</div>

David Laws</b> (Yeovil) (LD): I am struggling to understand
what difference your review and its implementation will make on the
ground in primary schools. Can you imagine for a moment that you are
not in front of 15 brilliantly informed MPs, but in a pub in Yeovil
trying to explain to the average man in the pub how primary education
for their child will be different after your review&#151;what there
will be more and less of. In a few sentences in pub language, what does
it boil down
to?</div><a name="10012115000076"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Jim Rose:</b></i> The Australians have an interesting view of
that. They reckon that, apart from pub language, you ought to be able
to explain something to Ministers in the time that it takes a lift to
travel between three floors. My answer, I am afraid, is that I cannot.
However, what I can say is that I think it is extremely important to
ensure that we understand that this is modelled on the best practice
that we have
found.</div><a name="10012115000077"></a>

in your head as reading, writing and arithmetic, but more to do with
getting children to be much more articulate so that their speaking and
listening skills&#151;their oral language&#151;is given a rich
boost. One of the things that we know is that reading and writing feed
off speaking and listening, and speaking and listening, as
communication skills, are very important in their own
right.</div>

done through important subjects such as drama and, not literacy, but
literature, being enlarged and made much more available to children, so
they are getting enrichment in all that. You have to read the
background to understand why we are doing what we are doing to get to
where we want to be. We will also be looking much more effectively at
what I would call a modern curriculum, in terms of where our children
will be when they have gone through the whole of that process and come

The question is whether they are doing them well enough. It is a
qualitative issue as well. That is exactly where we were with reading.
Of course they are all teaching reading, and they will all tell you
that they are teaching phonics. The issue is how well that is being
done, and whether it is being done in a way that secures learning for
children. Very often&#151;this is an inspectorial view&#151;when

worse?</div><a name="10012115000109"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sue
Barratt:</b></i> I personally think that it will make a great
difference to the primary curriculum. I asked Jim Knight some time ago
whether we could have a review of the key stage 2 curriculum, because
it was incredibly overcrowded. Everything just seemed to be dumped into
it, and we were being ignored. There was a key stage 3 review and an
early years review, but key stage 2 was totally left out. As the head
teacher of a junior school, I am very pleased that some attention has
been given to primary, and in particular to key stage 2.</div>
<a name="10012115000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think it
will give us much greater flexibility within our curriculum. We will
not be straitjacketed by the overloaded curriculum. We did a series of
conferences last year with the national college, and the support from
the head teachers was phenomenal. Now that primaries are being taken
notice of for a change, people are really keen that something actually
happens and that we have something to get our teeth into. We can
localise it and tailor it to our school; we will have that freedom. We
can also provide deeper and richer learning experiences because we are
not so straitjacketed.</div>
<a name="10012115000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Because of
those three areas of progression, certainly in the higher years 5 and 6
we can tailor more subject teaching, and we can also lead that going
through into 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column92" />Column number: 92</div>key stage 3. The other thing, certainly in a junior school, is that we
are sort of capped at level 5. If I have level 6 children, I cannot
take them beyond
that.</div>
<a name="10012115000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012115000284"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> That is really useful. I must move on to John,
otherwise the Chairman will cut us off I suspect.</div>
<a name="10012115000113"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
McIntosh:</b></i> Clearly, Sue and I approach the curriculum
from different angles. I have spoken to three primary heads in inner
London about this, and they view it with some dismay. They feel that it
is a distraction.</div>
<a name="10012115000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">152</b><b class="B"><a name="10012115000285"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Do they say that it will make it worse, or no
different?</div>
<a name="10012115000115"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
McIntosh:</b></i> It is a distraction. They happen to be
three strong heads who&#151;I won&#146;t say that they ignore the
current arrangements, but they get on and plan a curriculum and hope
that it meets the statutory requirements. They see this as a
distraction.</div>
<a name="10012115000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">153</b><b class="B"><a name="10012115000286"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> They do not think it is worse?</div>
<a name="10012115000117"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
McIntosh:</b></i> No, they do not think it is worse, but it
is a distraction that will get in the way and take teachers away from
the school for more courses and conferences and so on, to discuss the
implementation of all this, which they feel is unnecessary.</div>
<a name="10012115000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">We come at
this from a different angle. Sixteen years ago when we decided to open
a junior department at the school, I was on the governing body of a
local prep school, and on the governing body of a local primary school
which, as it happened, was only a stone&#146;s throw away from the
prep school. The contrast between the teaching and the curriculum in
those two schools was staggering. In the prep school, the children had
specialist teachers. They had a curriculum that was similar to that of
a secondary school&#151;a subject-based curriculum with properly
qualified subject teachers teaching them. In the primary school, in
spite of the national curriculum and its provisions at the time, there
were still theme-based, generalist teachers. The achievement was, by
comparison with the children in the preparatory school, pretty
dreadful.</div>
<a name="10012115000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">We were
designing a curriculum, and where I went for advice on how I should go
about designing that curriculum for my junior section will be no
surprise to Committee members. We did that, and one of the things I
learned was that so many primary schools were not demanding enough of
these pupils. A lot of the youngsters&#151;seven, eight, nine and
10-year olds&#151;have a lot more to give, but that expectation is
not there. They are not being worked as hard as they should be. We are
not getting as much out of them.</div>
<a name="10012115000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">We introduced
a curriculum that covered all the national curriculum requirements,
plus a modern foreign language plus, in year 4/5, Latin. Those children
were also doing a specialist music course, and they rose to that
challenge. They still rise to it. They are still there and still doing
it, and they are the better for it. There is a marked difference
between those pupils who started in the school at the age of seven and
have come through into the secondary section, and many of the pupils
who come from outside. I am convinced that we need separate subject
teaching and specialist teachers in primary schools. That is another
issue in a sense, and a big one to be tackled at some other
time.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column93" />Column number: 93</div><a name="10012115000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since I have
mentioned music, as somebody who is not only passionate about it, but
believes that we need it back in the curriculum in our schools, I am
surprised that the Rose review says so little about it as a subject in
primary school. The recommendations in the annexe at the back of the
report refer to music, but not as a subject, which I feel ought to be
fairly central to what we are doing. That is not just because I believe
that children ought to learn a musical instrument or sing, but there
are enormous benefits for them personally. It nourishes them
spiritually in a non-religious sense. It enables them to grow in
self-esteem and to work with others in teams; in ensemble groups. This
is anecdotal, not evidence-based, but I am in no doubt that the
boys&#151;it was an all boys&#146; school&#151;who studied music
through the school were two or three years ahead in social development
by the time they got to the age of 14 or 15. Yet that is not
addressed. There are lots of cross-curricular things to be learned in
music. Children who learn to read music early on have a good idea of
ratio, of rational numbers. We cannot read music unless we learn to
divide up bars&#151;sometimes in quite a complex way with compound
time. I am sorry that the opportunity to put the music back where it
should be in our primary curriculum has been lost. It is not
there.</div><a name="10012115000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">154</b><a name="10012115000287"></a><b class="B">Mrs.
Ann Cryer</b> (Keighley) (Lab): I have a very mixed
constituency. I mention that to you, so you know where I am coming
from. One ward is called Ilkley, a small spa town. It is very
professional and very middle class. I know just what John is talking
about. It is the sort of thing that is going on in the primary school
and the senior school
there.</div><a name="10012115000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
two wards in the centre of Keighley, about 30 per cent. of the children
go to school at the age of four without a word of English. English is
not spoken in the home; it is not spoken in the mosque; it is not
spoken in the community centre, the street or on the football pitch.
They speak just one language&#151;Punjabi or sometimes Urdu and
occasionally, Bangla. Is there anything in the Bill that will help
those children get off to a good start in primary school, given that
they do not speak a word of English when they enter? Not only that,
many of them do not have a very good grasp of their mother tongue. Many
of their mothers have large families, and the mother has little help
because her own family are in Pakistan. She is thrown in at the deep
end with a large family. She does not have the time to talk and play
with the children. They are starting from a difficult place. Many of
the girls are ready to do A-levels at the age of 18, and that is
wonderful&#151;it says a great deal for the schools. Is there
anything in the Bill that will make things even better for those people
or is something missing that should be in
it?</div><a name="10012115000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree with the points about music. Through Bollywood, we are at last
getting a bit of music into what are mainly Pakistani schools. It is
perhaps not the best source, but Bollywood is coming into it. Can you
just talk us through a few things that you think will be really useful
to those kids, or should something else be in the
Bill?</div><a name="10012115000126"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012115000288"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Just before you answer, I wish to say to
everyone that we have now used up more than half our time. All
colleagues want to ask our witnesses questions. Our witnesses are very
passionate, but I am just a little worried that we will have
disappointed colleagues unless we shorten the answers and the
questions.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column94" />Column number: 94</div><a name="10012115000127"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Jim Rose:</b></i> I will try to give a short answer. I agree
entirely&#151;surprisingly perhaps&#151;with what John said about
music. If I had specialists at our disposal to that degree, that would
obviously be the way to go. I think that we are getting quite a good
deal on music, as it happens. I have tried to say in the report that
music is one of the performing arts that makes a fantastic contribution
alongside drama and all those things. An epitome of that is the lady
sitting next to me whose school is doing remarkably well in music. I
sat in that school with my eyes closed, listening to the violins and I
thought that I was in the Albert hall. Sue delivers on
music.</div><a name="10012115000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have illustrated the huge range that we must cope with in not just
primary education, but education throughout. The variations of coping
with that are phenomenally difficult in many respects. This is a very
good example of it. It greatly turns on whether the language group that
we are speaking about is literate in its own language or
not.</div>
<a name="10012115000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012115000289"></a>Mrs.
Cryer:</b>
No.</div><a name="10012115000130"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Jim Rose:</b></i> I am saying that there is a strong division
between those children who know how to read and write in their mother
tongue, and those who do not. You will find that there is quite a quick
transfer into English, if they can read or write in their mother
tongue&#151;whatever it is. If not, we clearly have to do more
enrichment, with them getting absolutely immersed in spoken English. I
really believe that&#151;and the earlier, the better.</div>
<a name="10012115000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">You&#146;ll
find through the Sure Start centres and everything else that has been
developed along those lines that the message has now gone out; into it
goes some very structured work to get those children well ahead on
spoken English. That is why we are making such a fuss about
communication skills sitting alongside English and languages; there is
a strong read-across. If we can get teachers in line with all that, it
will work very well to promote the sort of progress that we hope for
with those children. It is interesting, particularly with the girls,
once they have acquired English, to see the speed with which they catch
up&#151;not only catch up, but overtake. However, we have a problem
with the boys throughout.</div>
<a name="10012115000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012115000290"></a>Mrs.
Cryer:</b> I am afraid so, yes. Does no one else want to talk
to me about that?</div>
<a name="10012115000133"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sue
Barratt:</b></i> Only that you have more flexibility in this
curriculum, that you can tailor it more to some of the children. You
could tailor some of the teaching for them, with curriculum modules and
things that would suit the children, perhaps relating to where they
come from to give them a sense of identity. There is scope to do
that.</div><a name="10012115000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">155</b><b class="B"><a name="10012115000291"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> At the heart of this debate and across political
parties is the question of how much should be prescribed by the state,
and how much should be left to the professionals. I believe that the
man or woman in the pub or on the bus&#151;or anywhere
else&#151;will find it difficult to understand why we are still
talking about having to explain to teachers why communications skills
are so important.</div>
<a name="10012115000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sir Jim, you
said that you found a lack of understanding in some of our schools
about the importance of being  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column95" />Column number: 95</div>able to make a phone call or to speak in public. Why are we finding this
inability among professional teachers? It requires the state to make it
more
explicit.</div><a name="10012115000136"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Jim Rose:</b></i> That is a very good question. I asked 300
trainee teachers who had taught them to text. The answer was,
&#147;Nobody. We taught each other.&#148; There is a movement going
on out there, and young people are driving forward in a way that will
make them ICT competent&#151;well beyond our experience as adults.
However, we have to handle all that sensitively and
intelligently.</div>
<a name="10012115000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">I certainly
feel that this whole business of communication is a broad resource. For
instance, when I listen to my seven-year-old grandson using a cell
phone and the rest of it, it is astonishing to me that it is all part
and parcel of life. There is no wonder at the buttons being
pressed and so on. We haven&#146;t missed the message in schools, but
we certainly did not do anything like enough on that side of
things&#151;actually getting children to find a
voice.</div>
<a name="10012115000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">156</b><b class="B"><a name="10012115000292"></a>Caroline
Flint:</b> Why would teachers not think that important? As
well as being able to read, a child should be able to get up and read
aloud in front of a group&#151;perhaps an essay&#151;or to
communicate. I am not saying that it does not happen in schools,
because I have seen it, but I know of schools where the challenge is
enormous, with children having very few words in their vocabulary.
Those children have not developed the general skills of speaking to be
able to do that. The public find it hard to understand that the subject
is not covered in teacher training. It is a foundation skill to be used
in the subject-based areas of history, geography and so on.</div>
<a name="10012115000139"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Jim Rose:</b></i> You do not get to that by just saying it,
I&#146;m afraid. You are absolutely right that we are now
well-researched. There are significant numbers of children who come in
with impoverished language, and something has to be done about that. In
a rich curriculum of the kind that we are talking about, and certainly
in the early years foundation, that has been a big emphasis.</div>
<a name="10012115000140"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sue
Barratt:</b></i> Initial teacher training needs to address
that problem, too.</div>
<a name="10012115000141"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
McIntosh:</b></i> It does. I agree to some extent, but it
goes back to what I was saying earlier. We have to push the
responsibility for this back to the teaching profession by allowing it
to develop professionally in a way that it not happening. We have gone
through a phrase when teachers and adults&#151;it is not just
teachers&#151;have been reluctant to tell children what they have to
do and correct them when they get things wrong. I was once part of a
debate at the National Association for the Teaching of English, and we
were told that we have no right to correct children&#146;s speech:
&#147;What right do we have to impose middle-class patterns of speech
on these children?&#148; That was from a professor of English at
London university. Of course, his own child did not need correcting,
and when he went up to an interview at a university, he would do very
well, thank you very much. But the child from the local estate, who was
not corrected, would be seriously
disadvantaged.</div><a name="10012115000142"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">157</b><a name="10012115000295"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Graham Stuart</b> (Beverley and Holderness) (Con): The Select
Committee report on a national curriculum found that there was no
consensus on the need to reform the nature and, particularly, the
management of the national curriculum. Typically, the debate, as has
been followed today, is about the nature of the national
curriculum&#151;different political fads and different powers take
charge and change subjects and the nature of the curriculum. It is the
management of the curriculum&#151;the inexorable rise in mass and
prescription, whoever is in power&#151;that is the threat, is it not?
Is there anything in the Bill&#151;I cannot see it&#151;that will
stop a Government of whatever hue interfering and sending papers daily
to schools that demoralise teachers, disempower heads and remove the
sense of professional empowerment? That is the real secret that we need
to embed in our
schools.</div><a name="10012115000145"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
McIntosh:</b></i> Absolutely. As far as I can see, there is
nothing like that in the Bill. In fact, the Bill entrenches the current
legislation and make matters worse. That is my complaint about the
Bill&#151;it adds no value and, if anything, makes matters far
worse.</div><a name="10012115000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">158</b><b class="B"><a name="10012115000296"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Sue, you are extremely enthusiastic about the
Bill. The Select Committee suggested that to stop whoever was in
power&#151;we are sitting here, trying to make ourselves useful, so
we pull on the levers that we have&#151;we should have a five-year
cycle. It seems to me that if a new idea was in the tabloids&#151;if
it was the story of the week in the<i class="I"> Mail</i> or <i class="I">The
Sun</i>&#151;the Secretary of State could, under the Bill, issue
another order in a couple of weeks&#146; time and get himself a
positive headline. Would you like to see changes to stop that
happening?</div><a name="10012115000147"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sue
Barratt:</b></i> There is a recommendation in Sir
Jim&#146;s report that I thoroughly agree with. The curriculum should
be reviewed as a whole, not piecemeal. That should be done in a certain
time that is denoted. That would be far better. We would have it
straight throughout; we would know that it was coming; and it could be
done. There is something in the Bill&#151;I cannot find it
now&#151;that should stop the plethora of initiatives coming into
schools; it says so in
here.</div><a name="10012115000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012115000297"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> They always do so, but they do not put it into the
law. Every Secretary of State has said that, but none of them has
followed
it.</div><a name="10012115000149"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sue
Barratt:</b></i> Yes, that is what I would like to
see&#151;a date when the curriculum would be reviewed, but right
across, so that we have continuity, coming right from early years
through to
secondary.</div><a name="10012115000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">159</b><b class="B"><a name="10012115000298"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Would the three witnesses support the Select
Committee&#146;s proposal that there should be a five-year cycle, in
between which Ministers would not be able to endlessly change the
national
curriculum?</div><a name="10012115000151"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Jim Rose:</b></i> I think that I have made that point in the
report. Some of the first things that I said was, whatever we do, it
has to be made more manageable. It is in the remit letter, which
addresses teachers as much as anything else. It is important to
consider whether the draft programmes of learning have struck the right
balance between prescription of essential content and manageability for
the primary teachers and the school. That is in the remit
letter.</div><a name="10012115000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">160</b><b class="B"><a name="10012115000299"></a>Mr.

change?</div><a name="10012115000153"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Jim Rose:</b></i> Well, there is a need, in my view, to step
back. We are taking something as large and essential for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column97" />Column number: 97</div>our children&#146;s education as the curriculum, among the three
things that support a successful learner&#151;good parenting, good
teaching and good curriculum, which are the three things that we are
trying to
secure.</div><a name="10012115000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012115000300"></a>Mr.

amend the
Bill.</div><a name="10012115000155"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Jim Rose:</b></i> There should be some agreed cycle, where we
do not do it by piecemeal arrangements, but carry it
through.</div><a name="10012115000156"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sue
Barratt:</b></i> And schools should know when that cycle is
going to be.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012115000301"></a>Mr.

<a name="10012115000158"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
McIntosh:</b></i> I certainly agree to that, yes. I would, as
you would have gathered, go a lot further than
that.</div>
<a name="10012115000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">161</b><b class="B"><a name="10012115000302"></a>The
Minister for Schools and Learners (Mr. Vernon
Coaker):</b> Assuming that this new curriculum arrangement
becomes law, what do you think will need to be done to prepare teachers
and primary schools, so that it has the smoothest and best possible
introduction? Could Jim, Sue and John say something about
that?</div>
<a name="10012115000160"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Jim Rose:</b></i> First, we have always had a continuing
issue with what you might, these days, call continuous professional
development, and it is the same with any profession. You do not just
learn your trade in the training period; you go out with L-plates and
you get better. You need to have the nourishment of professional
development; that is true across the board. We have an enormous
commitment to helping teachers to get better, if I can put it that
way.</div>
<a name="10012115000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">In that
respect, we can get ICT to work a darn site harder for us. Where there
is subject impoverishment in a school&#151;nobody there knows how to
teach music or knows a great deal about science&#151;we could help
through ICT, and a lot is being done on that. You can take what people
these days call learning platforms virtually off the web and adapt them
to your purposes. To some extent, you will be able to help through
those means, although you will probably never be as good as a trained
music specialist or foreign language specialist.</div>
<a name="10012115000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">Whatever
resources are available to us in the future, limited though they might
be, we should prioritise those areas where we feel that the need is
greatest. We should certainly not give up for one moment on being
extremely vigilant on the basics, continually foregrounding them, so
that primary schools are able to defend themselves against being
overwhelmed. Teaching things such as reading, writing, basic maths and
all the rest well is very time-consuming and extremely reliant on good
planning. We have to make sure that these realities are
recognised.</div>
<a name="10012115000163"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sue
Barratt:</b></i> May I also come in? Looking at it from a
head teacher&#146;s point of view, heads will obviously be looking
for guidance from bodies such as the National College for Leadership of
Schools and Children&#146;s Services, QCDA and the Training and
Development Agency for Schools. We would be looking for them and Ofsted
to work together, so that they would tell us with the same voice what
they expected from the primary curriculum and would give us guidance
and help.</div>

<a name="10012115000170"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sue
Barratt:</b></i> There is a series of NCSL conferences that
heads can go to if they need some guidance. There are also handbooks
coming out from the QCDA, so there are a lot of things there. The
national strategies are also preparing some information for us. I
understand&#151;I hope&#151;that we have been given a teacher day
from September 2010, so that we as heads can work with our schools on
the curriculum that we want and that will best suit our
schools.</div><a name="10012115000171"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John

these measures going through unamended. You must bear it in mind that
as a head&#151;certainly for the past five or six years of my
service&#151;I have seen my principal task as protecting my teachers
from a lot of the stuff coming out of the various agencies, so I am
slightly cynical about it all.</div>
<a name="10012115000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, I
would ask that you as politicians bear in mind that a lot of your good
intentions are mediated through agencies and civil servants at the
Department. I suspect that a lot of what arrives down at schools, which
has been mediated through the various agencies, is very different from
what Ministers intend when they first propose the legislation. I think
that is a very serious issue. I have found over the years&#151;not
just with the current Government&#151;when speaking to politicians
about what they intended, that even they have been surprised at what
has finished up on the desks of heads at the end of the day. I would
ask you to ensure that your good intentions are not distorted through
that mediation
system.</div><a name="10012115000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other thing is that you would remind heads and teachers&#151;and
their governing bodies, of course, but on a day-to-day basis, we are
talking about heads&#151;that they are responsible at the end of the
day for the curriculum and that they are required to meet the statutory
requirements of the orders, although that does not mean that they
should follow the statutory orders as a template for their curriculum.
In designing their curriculum, they should ensure that they cover the
statutory requirements, but you are not suggesting that how the
requirements are laid out in the Bill should provide the template for
the curriculum. We have got to get back to making heads, supported by
their governing bodies, responsible for the
curriculum.</div><a name="10012115000174"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sue
Barratt:</b></i> I do not disagree with that. In addition to
being a head, I am also chair of the Implementation Review Unit, on
which we monitor all bureaucracy coming down into schools. We are at
present doing a review of all the obstacles to delivery, which come
down 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column99" />Column number: 99</div>from policies that come from the Department for Children, Schools and

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">164</b><b class="B"><a name="10012115000307"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Thank you for those answers. I think that the use
of more specialists in primary schools, as all of you alluded to, is
something that we shall all have to see how we can do right across all
the various
areas.</div><a name="10012115000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">May
I go on to another area of discussion: the age at which children start
school, the debate on the relationship between early years foundation
stage and key stage 1, how children are taught and the relationship
between play-based learning, enjoyment and fun, and more formal
learning? It is an interesting debate, which generates a lot of views.
I wonder whether you have a view, between you, about the relationship
between the early years foundation stage and the beginning of key stage
1, and the pedagogy around all that. What do we think about
that&#151;what the age is and what the relationship is between that
and how children are
taught?</div><a name="10012115000177"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Jim Rose:</b></i> We have a whole chapter devoted to that, as
you know. We were asked to do specific things within it, such as
looking at, for example, the writing goals and whether things were
being well and truly tailored. The big question that we are looking at
here is how the curriculum should change as children develop through
the primary years, actually starting pre-school. Very often, it is
forgotten that the deal is done in early years as far as the importance
of play is concerned.</div>
<a name="10012115000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">There has
always been a strong voice in this country&#151;in fact, it has got
stronger as a result of these reviews&#151;about the purpose and
place of play and what that should mean in the early years. Of course,
that is why the early years foundation stage is structured very largely
as it is. It is a totally false dichotomy, actually, to think that that
is in any way unsympathetic to what we are looking for
thereafter.</div>
<a name="10012115000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue of
course is how to deal with some of the tricky issues within it, such as
relative age. So we know that summer-born children clearly find it more
difficult if the provision is not appropriate for them, because of the
distance that they have not yet travelled. We tried to do the best we
could with that in the report. It is a matter of what the children do
in the school when they get there, it seems to me, and of teachers
recognising that in any given incoming group, there will be variation,
among which the vulnerable will be the summer-born. They need to know
which children in front of them are summer born. They might then be
able to think through much more carefully what they should offer in
that play-based
programme.</div><a name="10012115000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Within
all that, we then begin to move forward on things such as that&#151;I
will come back to language, because it is clearly very
important&#151;and mathematics in how we make it palatable for young
children. There is tremendous scope in the early years for paving the
way for things that will take place in year 1. The criticism that we
are getting is that there is a much sharper cliff face when children
move from reception to year 1, because play suddenly disappears and
teachers begin to concentrate on end of key stage standard assessment
tests. They no longer exist in the form in which we first had them, but
nevertheless, schools feel constrained to ensure that that is done, and
done particularly well.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column100" />Column number: 100</div><a name="10012115000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">The argument
is that a lot of children suffer as a result of that rather sharp
difference. Therefore, should we extend play into key stage 1? The
argument, again, draws on European experience and all the rest of it:
the Finns go that way, and the Swedes. I had an interesting seminar
with the Swedes last Friday. We also got the Finnish curriculum, to see
what goes on there.</div>
<a name="10012115000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
watch the sleight of hand. It is not always, as it seems&#151;that
nothing is done before the age of six or seven to prepare children for
school in those countries. All the time, a great deal is done. It is
done on the basis of well-conceived play programmes that lead
significantly into learning. That is probably a lesson that we can pick
up on.</div>
<a name="10012115000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012115000308"></a>The

Loughton</b> (East Worthing and Shoreham) (Con): A quick
question: if PSHE is not made a statutory subject, why would head
teachers not want its healthy living elements to be part of other
subjects, as we have heard described, as part of more formalised,
extended schools or by arrangement with outside voluntary bodies, for
example?</div><a name="10012115000185"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
McIntosh:</b></i> I think that they would. I am not
suggesting that they would not. In fact, I think that I said that I
would expect a good school already to include most of it, but not as a
discrete subject. I am not quibbling with that.</div>
<a name="10012115000186"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sue

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">166</b><b class="B"><a name="10012115000310"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> So we do not need to make it a statutory
subject, as the Bill would do. Is that the view of all of
you?</div>
<a name="10012115000188"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John

view.</div><a name="10012115000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012115000311"></a>Tim

witnesses?</div><a name="10012115000190"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012115000312"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Well, the Bill will put on a statutory footing
the inclusion of PSHE subjects on a formal basis. Given that we have
had evidence that it already features in the
curriculum&#151;</div><a name="10012115000192"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Jim Rose:</b></i> Yes,
but&#151;</div><a name="10012115000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">167</b><b class="B"><a name="10012115000313"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> In your own example, Sir Jim, of the British
Museum programme, almost half the elements of the PSHE requirements in
the Bill were contained in a 15-minute radio programme about an upper
palaeolithic hand axe in the third part of the series. That would have
been taught in any decent school as part of a history lesson and
informed half the requirements that, according to the Bill, we must now
put on a statutory basis. Do you agree with that, and can you say
why?</div><a name="10012115000194"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Jim Rose:</b></i> I agree that we should define the content.
What I say in my review&#151;this is paragraph
40&#151;is that how schools choose to organise their curriculum and
timetable will remain a matter for them. You can take the ingredients
of PSHE and put them where you 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column101" />Column number: 101</div>will. I would like to see&#151;I am sure it is going to
happen&#151;a lot of PSHE in understanding physical development,
health and well-being. I would also like to see some of it coming
through the science and technology side. This is, I think, going to be
one of the big advantages of that way of working. They will be able, as
I am hearing from all sides, to make that essential choice, according
to their circumstances, about how to organise
things.</div><a name="10012115000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">168</b><b class="B"><a name="10012115000314"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> Why can they not do that already? I do not
understand why we need the Bill to make happen what is happening
already in good schools, and what any decent head would want to happen
in any case without the legislation.</div>
<a name="10012115000196"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Jim Rose:</b></i> Do you want it to happen in all schools
without
fail?</div><a name="10012115000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">169</b><b class="B"><a name="10012115000315"></a>Tim
Loughton:</b> I want heads running all schools to want it to
happen as part of the way they teach because they are good teachers and
are giving their pupils a good learning experience, without having to
be shackled and to make compromises with other parts of the
curriculum.</div><a name="10012115000198"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Jim Rose:</b></i> Okay. This is the tug of war we always
have, isn&#146;t it? If we go back to pre-national curriculum days,
which I lived through as a primary head in two schools, there is no
doubt that the argument that Jim Callaghan, in the speech at Ruskin
college, and then Kenneth Baker took up on the national curriculum was
right. In primary schools, there was far too much plateauing, with no
real sense of direction, when it came to that awful stuff called topic
work. That is not what we are suggesting under this arrangement. That
is why I have called it cross-curricular studies, underlining studies.
It is a totally different model and one that will take us from early
years to secondary level, giving, I hope, optimum freedom, but you
cannot have total freedom unless you want to revert to what we had
prior to a national curriculum. You either agree that children are
entitled to certain things country-wide&#151;nationwide&#151;or
not. I just think that we should agree there is an
entitlement&#151;we call it a national curriculum&#151;and try to
spell it out in ways that are helpful to
schools.</div><a name="10012115000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012115000316"></a>The
Chairman:</b> May we now have questions from Mr.
Timpson, followed by Martin Linton and then Annette Brooke? We can see
how little time there is
left.</div><a name="10012115000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">170</b><a name="10012115000317"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Edward Timpson</b> (Crewe and Nantwich) (Con): The Government
response to the Select Committee&#146;s report on the national
curriculum
states:</div><a name="10012115000227"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Limiting
the statutory curriculum requirement to the core subjects allows
Academies to focus on the basics and to tailor the content of the wider
curriculum to the needs
of...pupils.&#148;</div><a name="10012115000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
was a response to a recommendation by the cross-party Select Committee
that the freedoms that academies enjoy in relation to the national
curriculum should be extended to all maintained schools. Do you have
any difficulty with substituting the word &#147;primaries&#148; for
&#147;academies&#148;?</div><a name="10012115000202"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
McIntosh:</b></i> Would you like me to answer first? Your
question is slightly rhetorical, I suspect. I agree with the tenor of
it. I do not know why academies should be singled out for different
treatment, by which I mean that I think the rest of the schools in the
maintained  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column102" />Column number: 102</div>system should be treated in the same way. If it is good enough for
academies, I do not see why it is not good enough for the other
schools.</div><a name="10012115000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will also say&#151;I know I am slightly repeating myself and trailing
my coat on this&#151;that 7 per cent. of children in this country,
who are among the highest-achieving pupils in the country, are not
subject to the national curriculum, because they are in independent
schools. The teachers in independent schools provide a rich, broad
curriculum for their pupils, and their pupils achieve excellent
results, without a national curriculum. Apparently, from what you have
just said, academies are expected more or less to do the same thing,
without the same statutory framework. I do not see why that cannot be
extended to all
schools.</div><a name="10012115000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
I have one moment to go one step further, my own view on the national
curriculum is that I would take it out of primary legislation. I would
make it a code of practice and I would give Ofsted the power to force
schools that are not performing properly and do not have an adequate
curriculum to use the provisions of that code of practice, but I would
leave the other schools that are performing well and whose pupils are
achieving well the autonomy to do what they want. That seems to me to
be the way round this
issue.</div><a name="10012115000205"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Jim Rose:</b></i> I think that we are all out for the same
ends; the issue is how you get there. Frankly, I still think that it is
important to make sure that we do define a core curriculum and give the
profession as much authority as possible to decide what happens in the
way in which they teach it, and additionality, if you like, beyond the
national
curriculum.</div><a name="10012115000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">171</b><a name="10012115000318"></a><b class="B">Martin
Linton</b> (Battersea) (Lab): I want to ask Jim Rose about his
conversations with the Finns and the Swedes about the transition from
foundation stage to primary level. Does he agree that the evidence from
Finland and Sweden is that they start formal education later, yet have
better outcomes at the age of 11 and certainly 13? Does he draw the
conclusion that we in this country finish learning through play and
start formal education at too early a stage? Would he agree with my
conclusion, as a governor of a nursery school, that the reason for that
is that learning through play teaches children to enjoy going to
school? That enjoyment, if it can be sustained in primary school, will
affect the whole of their receptivity to education, whereas starting
formal education too early turns them off education and gives them a
negative attitude towards it.</div>
<a name="10012115000207"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Jim Rose:</b></i> It all turns on what is meant by formal.
When talking with the Scandinavians, it seems to me, certainly with
work that I have seen in Denmark, that there is a bit of a sleight of
hand. If one looks at what goes on in nursery-level education there,
things are being started that we would recognise as more informal, but
which are definitely directed towards a learning goal.</div>
<a name="10012115000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">If you take,
for example, a group of young children in a nursery, and look at their
reaction to a really well-told story, you will generally find
that&#151;if it is done well, and a bit of drama, or puppets or
whatever is brought into it&#151;they are so engrossed that their
language leap forward is palpable. It is observable. You get that sort
of interaction again with music and the arts. All of that does not seem
to be a label that fits, but that is actually what is happening. The
same ingredients are being used to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column103" />Column number: 103</div>stimulate children&#146;s interest, and certainly to get the social
interaction that you are talking about, which is absolutely fundamental
in the early years.</div>
<a name="10012115000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
looking through different eyes at some of this. I use Sure Start as a
starting point, but how do we build forward from there? Let us not get
hung up on what is formal and informal; let us look at it in terms of
the developmental pattern that we want to see served by whatever
curriculum we can devise to get children moving forward progressively,
and no holds barred. Those who need more help with spoken language are
going to get it. Those who are racing ahead will also be
well-served.</div>
<a name="10012115000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">172</b><b class="B"><a name="10012115000319"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> But the fact that the Finns and the Swedes have
quite a high educational content in their nursery provision, up to the
age of 7, does not invalidate that point but rather strengthens
it.</div><a name="10012115000211"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Jim Rose:</b></i> Well, yes, but it does not necessarily mean
that we cannot do it in our own way. We have to look very hard at year
1, and think in terms of whether there is that sharp cliff face between
what goes on before, and the sudden change. Someone said to me the
other day, &#147;My child comes home, he is only in year 1 and has
all these worksheets. He is fed up with
it.&#148;</div>

two minutes left. Annette Brooke has been waiting patiently with the
last question.</div>

Brooke</b> (Mid-Dorset and North Poole) (LD): I would like to
question the panel about the Alexander review. If there is to be a
change, we want to be assured that we are going in the right direction.
My understanding is that the Alexander review focuses 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column104" />Column number: 104</div>more on specialist teaching, and I wonder if the panel could comment on
that and whether we have the right mix here in front of us.</div>
<a name="10012115000214"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sir
Jim Rose:</b></i> I do not think there is any difference
between what Robin Alexander is saying about specialist teaching and
what I am saying. We would both advocate properly structured specialist
teaching for primary schools where it can be provided. The communality
between his report and mine is that both of us&#151;he calls them
domains, but they are areas of learning, however they are looked at.
There is a good deal of cross-curricularity in what is being
suggested.</div>
<a name="10012115000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">That review
is not the same as mine in terms of its scope. I was not looking at the
whole of primary education in the way that Robin would say he is, which
is really a re-run of the Plowden report&#151;I think that is where
it starts from in the way it is described.</div>
<a name="10012115000216"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John

as a whole, but as far as specialist teaching in primary schools is
concerned, it is a very serious issue that we need to tackle,
especially in mathematics, arithmetic or numeracy&#151;whatever you
would like to call it at that level.</div>
