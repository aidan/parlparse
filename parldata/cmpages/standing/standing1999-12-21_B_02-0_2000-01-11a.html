<H4><center>(Morning)</center></H4>
<H4><center>[Mr. Edward O'Hara in the Chair]</center></H4>
<H3><center><a href="/pa/cm199900/cmbills/005/2000005.htm">Freedom of Information Bill</a></center></H3>
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill, copies of which are available in the Room, and that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, my co-Chairman and I do not intend to call starred amendments, including any reached during an afternoon sitting of the Committee.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That the Bill be considered in the following order, namely, Clauses 1 and 2; Schedule 1; Clauses 3 to 16; Schedule 2; Clauses 17 to 54; Schedule 3; Clauses 55 to 60; Schedule 4; Clauses 61 to 66; Schedule 5; Clauses 67 to 72; Schedule 6; Clauses 73 to 84; Schedule 7; Clauses 85 and 86; new Clauses; new Schedules.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As we begin to consider the Bill in the new millennium, I hope that we can make good progress and have good and lively debates on the issues. I further hope that the motion will be acceptable to most hon. Members; it is fairly straightforward. It may be helpful, when considering the order of consideration, if members of the Committee bear in mind the position in Northern Ireland. As members of the Committee are aware, the Bill was drafted and introduced before agreement was reached to establish the Northern Ireland Assembly. The Bill therefore covers all Northern Ireland public authorities because, at the time of drafting, only Parliament had authority to legislate for those bodies.
<P>
Freedom of information is a devolved matter, however. As the new Northern Ireland Assembly has been established, it is for the devolved administration to determine whether authorities dealing with wholly devolved matters should be subject to United Kingdom legislation or to legislation specific to Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Executive Committee will debate the matter; we are unable to anticipate the outcome of the debate. The committee may be content for UK-wide legislation to cover Northern Ireland bodies. The Assembly has the power to amend such legislation in relation to bodies fully under its jurisdiction, and it may later choose to exercise that right.
<P>
Alternatively, the Northern Ireland Executive Committee might want to legislate on the matter, in which case it would be necessary to amend the UK Bill to remove references to those bodies.
<P>
Without knowing the intentions of the Northern Ireland Executive Committee, it would be inappropriate for this Committee to consider differently the order of consideration, or to amend the Bill with regard to the Assembly, the executive committee, or the bodies that fall within their jurisdiction. Given the structure of the Bill and the order of consideration, it will not be possible for the Committee to order its consideration of clauses and schedules to avoid, initially, matters affecting Northern Ireland.
<P>
I propose, therefore, that the Committee proceeds with its consideration in the order set out on the amendment paper. Any amendments needed to reflect decisions taken by the Northern Ireland Assembly about the coverage of Northern Ireland bodies will be considered together on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Greenway </B>(Ryedale): I wish you, Mr. O'Hara, a happy new year. I hope that, like me, you and other members of the Committee had an enjoyable break and did not spend too long considering the deliberations that we are now beginning.
<P>
I have two brief points. The Opposition are content with the order of consideration. It seems eminently sensible to proceed as the Under-Secretary suggested while we await the Northern Ireland Assembly's decision on the matter. I dare say that we look forward to the prospect that the Assembly will, like other parts of the United Kingdom, reach a different judgment from the Government's on key aspects of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This seems an appropriate moment to point out, without interrupting the hon. Gentleman's flow too much, that the amendments would be subject to acceptance by the Chairmen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Indeed so. I was about to conclude by saying that, aside from my slight teasing of the Under-Secretary about the Northern Ireland Assembly, we are content to go ahead as he suggested.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>General right of access to information</center></H4>
held by public authorities
<P>
<B>Mr. Mark Fisher </B>(Stoke-on-Trent, Central): I beg to move amendment No. 18, in page 1, line 12, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) A public authority shall take all reasonable steps to assist any person in seeking to exercise any right under this Act.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am delighted that the Government have placed the statement of general right of access to information at the head of the Bill. It is not a purposes clause; no doubt we shall have an opportunity later to consider the virtues of that, which I would press. However, the present statement of a right to access is a move in that direction. The purpose of the Bill is to help people and organisations obtain access to information to which they previously did not have legal rights, and it should therefore do all that is reasonably possible to that end. It is a matter of attitude. Other freedom of information regimes which have informed the debate in this country, and which have been examined by the Government, vary in their shaping of the law. However, their experience, which, in the case of Commonwealth countries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand, stretches over 18 years, shows that the manner of implementation—the Government's attitude—is every bit as important as the law itself.
<P>
Clearly, the Committee's responsibility is to prepare the law as well as possible, but I expect that it will also give frequent attention to the matter of implementation, which is very important. This aspect of the Bill needs strengthening. There could be a much more positive approach to helping people and organisations gain access. Some organisations and people, such as big media companies, experienced and skilled investigative journalists and large charities and campaigning organisations, will have no trouble. They will have legal advice. They already understand the relevant legislation and they will not often be inconvenienced by difficulties over access. However, the Bill is, as the Home Secretary and Under-Secretary stressed on Second Reading, for individuals as much as organisations, and it will be difficult for those individuals to become familiar with it and find their way round it. It is a new measure, providing new opportunities, and its very novelty means that people will not have any experience and will not know their rights. No one ever pretends that laws passed by this House are presented in a way friendly to the members of the public who might read them. Hon. Members of many years' standing struggle through and need much hand-holding help to understand all the implications of the drafting of Bills.
<P>
The Bill will not be user friendly for the public. I accept that the Government have done what they can to make it literate and clear, but no legislation, for good legal reasons, is transparent to the public. Therefore, we must do everything that we can to ensure that the public know what information is available to them and how they can easily access it. To produce legislation of which we are proud, the Government need to provide easy access to it by implementing a large public information and advertising exercise comparable to the previous Government's launch of charter marks. Although we must take the trouble to open up people's minds to what is available, they still need help to know their rights—to understand what is and is not available to them—so that they know how to apply for access to information.
<P>
It is clear that much can go wrong. Various clauses identify what constitutes an invalid request. Clause 1(3) entitles a public authority legally to turn down an inadequately identified request. Clause 7(1)(a) and (b) respectively allow requests to be rejected if they are applied for orally rather than in writing and where a correspondence address is not provided. Clause 11 makes it clear that a request can be rejected when the cost of complying exceeds the appropriate level, which is, understandably, not defined. Those would be innocent, easy mistakes for individuals to make.
<P>
Behind those four specific tripping points we may discern the Government's attitude. Although proud of the Bill, they want people to go through hoops or risk a request being turned down. That may be necessary in some circumstances, but as a general attitude that informs the Bill, it does not seem helpful or right. Amendment No. 18 puts a statutory obligation on public bodies to assist individuals or authorities to make a request. After all, the people who hold and form the information are the experts. It is not beyond their wits to understand the intention behind an application. It would not greatly inconvenience Government Departments or public authorities or bodies to have the good manners to assist, in a co-operative spirit, anyone who genuinely wanted information. Many aspects of the Bill deal with frivolous or vexatious information, but anyone who genuinely wants information should be able to look to the authority to which they are applying for help.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Minister will probably say that clause 17 allows for a code of practice, but that is not the same thing; it is unenforceable. Although the previous Government's stab at regulating legislation in their code of practice was not bad, will all agree that a code of practice contains weaknesses. People will need help, especially in the early states and that is a crucial consideration. The legal obligation for authorities to assist them should not be covered by a code of practice, but included in the clause. An amendment, such as mine, is necessary to require bodies to have a legal and statutory obligation to assist authorities or individuals.
<P>
Problems with the appeals mechanism, which is dealt with in clause 15 and elsewhere, will make the need for that more apparent. Clause 50 allows requests to be rejected if an applicant was slow to complain or suffered because of undue delay. Furthermore, under clause 15, the body from which information is sought is under no obligation to inform applicants of their rights of appeal. Such matters are small and niggling, but they form a colour wash throughout the Bill whereby authorities can challenge an applicant and say, ``You must justify to us that you know what you are asking for; what it is all about; that you know how to apply and what your rights are, and how to appeal if you are turned down.''
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
In the early stages, the Government will have the task of helping members of the public to understand the potential of the Bill and not placing small barriers in their way. The duty to assist under amendment No. 18 will help individuals along those lines as does other freedom of information legislation. For example, under New Zealand law, there is a duty on every department to give reasonable assistance. In Australia, there is a duty on agencies to take reasonable steps to assist. Under legislation in Ireland, public bodies have a duty to give reasonable assistance. It has not been found that such legislation places an enormously cumbersome, onerous or expensive additional obligation on public bodies.
<P>
The amendment is realistic and constructive. I accept that it is asking a lot of the Government to accept the first amendment that has been tabled in Committee, but if they could, it will be a genuine case of the Government demonstrating their desire to ensure that people will benefit from the Bill. For that to take place, a statutory obligation should be placed on public bodies to assist applicants.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> We sympathise with the argument of the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher); his amendment has got the Committee off to a good start. Obviously, we shall listen with interest to the Minister's response and decide whether the Bill will already do what is being sought by the amendment. The more that I read clause 1, the more I become convinced that it is intended to create a clear unambiguous entitlement to information. As that is a statement of purpose in respect of an entitlement, we can move on to the different issue of presumptions of release of information. However, the amendment calls for a pretty strong clear entitlement.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman referred to clause 17. Later in our proceedings, the Committee will be able to explore in greater depth the mechanism by which people can obtain information and seek help in so doing through the publication schemes that all public authorities will be required to provide under the Bill. I have some sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's objective, but I am not entirely convinced that the Bill does not already create an entitlement—subject to a significant caveat in respect of purpose—and provided an obligation for public authorities to give the assistance that the hon. Gentleman seeks.
<P>
I have another brief caveat. While we are all greatly in favour of the availability of information, we must consider the effect that that will have on the public authorities. We are dealing not just with Government Departments, but with the many bodies that will find it difficult in the early days to come to terms with many of the obligations that the Bill will place on them. While we want to help individuals, we must have regard for balance and consider the obligations that are being placed on public authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central that the way in which the law is implemented is crucial to its success. It is about the attitude of public authorities and Government to the cultural change that needs to take place. The culture that has grown over a couple of hundred years has been much too secretive. The purpose of the legislation is to open up that culture within public authorities, in a balanced way—as mentioned by the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway). We must ensure that such authorities become more open and that they do so in a reasonable way, thereby providing new rights to British citizens, while ensuring that the proper administration of public authorities is not encumbered in a way that makes them unable to do their public business.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central rightly said that the way in which such legislation has been implemented in other countries is crucial. In Canada, the freedom of information commissioner has said that after 15 years of freedom of information, the culture in that country has not changed to the extent that he had hoped. However, New Zealand, which does not have such a strong law, has seen a considerable cultural change and information is much more readily available.
<P>
It is important to accept the points made by my hon. Friend about the need for a change in the attitude of public authorities. That is why the Government set up a working party on freedom of information in the public sector, which reported just before Christmas. Public authorities must now start to bring about the changes that will be required when the Bill becomes law. We want to ensure that people understand their rights and that they are assisted by public authorities when such rights are proper, reasonable and balanced. The public must be informed about their rights and how to ensure that they are enforced. Forms may need to be produced—I do not want everything to be overly bureaucratic, but we want to ensure that the legislation is complied with and that people get easier and ready access. As my hon. Friend said, the public should not have to go through unnecessary hoops. We do not want lots of frivolous applications for unnecessary information. Determining the nature of applications will, to some extent, be the right of the citizen. We need to open up the secretive world of Whitehall and public authorities; citizens should have the right to greater access to information.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central says, the amendment, which would require public authorities to be helpful, assisting applicants to exercise their rights under the Bill, is a good idea in many ways. However, good ideas sometimes make bad law. I am sympathetic to the concept, but not to the amendment as worded. Attitudes, and the way in which Government implements the law, are crucial, and we intend to address the matter differently.
<P>
When we replied to the report on the White Paper by the Select Committee on Public Administration, we accepted the need for authorities to give assistance. After taking advice, the Government have decided that the best way in which to ensure that that happens is not to create a statutory duty as proposed by my hon. Friend. Statutory duties must be clear, defined and definite if they are to have meaning, not only so that authorities will be sure how to follow them, but so that the enforcement body—in this case, the commissioner—can be sure when the duties have been breached.
<P>
The amendment would place a vaguely defined duty on authorities that would be difficult to enforce. Steps might be reasonable in one situation but not in another, depending on the type of request, authority and questioner. The assistance that a large Department might reasonably give to an individual requester is different from the assistance that a general practitioner might reasonably give a multinational drug company making a request. As the hon. Member for Ryedale rightly noted, we must remember that, in achieving balance in the legislation, much of the Bill may apply to small businesses exercising public duties and having to give information, of which general practitioners are an obvious example. The duty that my hon. Friend proposes is too vague. Unfortunately, in practice, the good concept would make bad law for many of those smaller businesses.
<P>
It would be good practice for authorities to help where appropriate and in ways that are appropriate. Therefore, we included in clause 44(2)(a) a requirement for the Secretary of State's code of practice to contain guidance on
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the provision of advice by public authorities to persons who propose to make, or have made, requests for information to them''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The assistance that authorities should give can thus be described more broadly than would be possible in a statutory provision, and the commissioner, when issuing practice recommendations to authorities who have failed to comply with the code, can have regard to current best practice in making his decision, not just to the strict letter of a statutory provision.
<P>
True, as my hon. Friend noted, the commissioner will not have powers to enforce directly such practice recommendations. However, he can include in his report to Parliament details of authorities failing to comply with the code. The power of naming and shaming should not be underestimated in relation to public sector bodies keen to keep the confidence of the public that they serve.
<P>
The distance between my hon. Friend and I is small. We shall, by another route, do something similar to what he proposes. The code of practice will require authorities to inform applicants of internal appeal procedures. The appeal, in the first instance, is to the authority, rather than to the commissioner, and the code will require that information to be provided. In the light of what I have said, and in the light of the need to achieve a sense of balance throughout the Bill, I hope that my hon. Friend will feel able to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am grateful that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary thinks that the idea in amendment No. 18 is good, although he considers that it would make bad law. However, he has not provided evidence to show how it would make bad law. As he knows, similar provisions exist in all other relevant legislation, which the Government have studied in detail. If there is evidence of such provisions making bad law and leading to either undue cost or other problems in New Zealand, Ireland or Australia, he should tell the Committee. His view is purely theoretical and I doubt whether he can show evidence of a problem.
<P>
My hon. Friend's second point was that the relevant duty was not definable. However, it will have to be defined in the code, and if it can be defined well enough to be workable there, it should not be beyond the wit of my hon. Friend' s officials to define it in the Bill.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Finally, my hon. Friend said that the commissioner would be able to report to Parliament organisations and authorities that were obstructive or unhelpful. That, though undoubtedly true, will be no consolation to an applicant who is not assisted and who is therefore thwarted. The Bill's purpose is not to thwart such people, but to provide them with information to which they have a right and in which they have an interest. A report, a year afterwards, to Parliament, will be of no assistance to them.
<P>
The issue that I am concerned about would be important if, for example, one wanted to know the circumstances of one's father's death in hospital—something of enormous importance to those concerned. There might be a variety of complicated reasons for an unhappy end to a stay in hospital. To ask the right question requires an understanding of medical, clinical, administrative and bureaucratic procedures in a hospital trust that is probably beyond most people. The member of the public concerned would want to know, ``Why did my father die—unnecessarily, it seems to me?'' If such a question is not put in the right terms it is easy for a hospital to treat it as meaningless, or not to give the crucial information, whether that concerns diagnosis, staffing, theatre time, bed availability or something else. Unless a person knows enough to ask the right question, the right answer will not be obtained. That is why people who understand the purpose of a request should be obliged to assist the questioner. It is not much to ask. It is, after all, good manners, when asked a question and when one knows what the questioner is getting at, to offer to help.
<P>
I do not think that there is any evidence from abroad that the approach that I advocate is unduly expensive or bureaucratic. If my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has evidence that such provisions have crippled the legislation in Australia or New Zealand, he should say so. The Committee could then consider it. I do not believe such evidence exists. It would make all the difference if authorities were to be asked to help people. The Bill is intended to help people gain access to information. Frankly, a code of practice is not good enough.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Authorities will, of course, be asked to help people. I do not think that the code of practice will lead to the outcome that my hon. Friend expects. He underestimates the way in which naming and shaming a public authority can affect its behaviour. The idea that, without his amendment, everyone will be thwarted by public authorities is nonsense.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I did not say that.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> My hon. Friend appeared to say that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> No, I was setting out an extreme case. Of course, I hope and believe that most authorities will want to co-operate and be positive. However, as my hon. Friend knows well—we shall come across this fact time and again in the Bill—the purpose of legislation is to deal not with the common run of requests but the difficult cases. Contrary to what is written in the press, we have, as the Minister said on Second Reading, an open society in which an enormous amount of information is available. The Bill is necessary to help with the difficult cases where it is inconvenient or embarrassing for a hospital trust or other body to provide crucial information. It is in those circumstances that a code of practice would not be satisfactory, which is why we reject the route that was often effective in the 1990s. I ask my hon. Friend to reconsider this issue. An obligation to assist, which is simple to include and courteous, would denote the attitude of authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The way in which authorities respond will be important, and we propose to address the process of changing the culture within Government and public authorities. My hon. Friend asks what evidence there is to suggest that his amendment would produce bad law. I thought that I had explained how that would happen in the context in which it would be applied. I do not need to draw on examples from other countries. Our law differs in many ways from laws in other jurisdictions. Indeed, Canadian law is very different from Australian, New Zealand and Irish law, especially in the detail of its application.
<P>
Although we do not want to place unnecessary burdens on public authorities or those who exercise public functions, such as general practitioners or businesses that will have to comply with some of the duties to produce information, neither do we want to establish unnecessary hoops for the public to go through to get information. We need to strike a balance to accommodate the different natures of public authorities. Government Departments may be able to do what my hon. Friend wants to provide substantial assistance in getting access to information, but smaller bodies may find it more difficult.
<P>
To set out in detail in a code of practice the way in which we want a public authority to respond is the right way to deal with the different authorities that will be affected by the Bill. My hon. Friend complains that I say that that is not definable; it probably is definable, but only at great length if we are to include all the ways in which different types of public authorities should provide assistance. That should not be included in the Bill, and certainly not in the way that he suggests in the amendment. A code of practice will allow the definition to be set out at greater length to take account of the differences between public authorities.
<P>
Reporting to Parliament and naming and shaming will cause public authorities to think carefully about not providing information. I do not know what the hospital trusts are like in Stoke-on-Trent, but those in my constituency take seriously any request to know why someone has died in a hospital. I hope that hospital trusts, even without the Bill, will respond more positively to requests than my hon. Friend thinks they might.
<P>
Authorities will be asked to assist people to gain access to information. That request will be contained in a code of practice which will be effective in ensuring that the needs and requirements of different public authorities and citizens who seek information from them are taken into account.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Maclennan </B>(Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross): I beg to move amendment No. 21, in page 1, line 14, after `sections' insert `(Purposes),'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following: Amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 14, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(2A) Subject to the provisions of subsections (4) and (5), a public authority, when considering whether to comply with any request for information under subsection (1), shall have regard to an overriding presumption that information should always be released except where disclosure would not be in the public interest.''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
`New clause 2—Purposes—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``.—(1) The purposes of this Act are to extend progressively the right of the public to information held by public authorities to the maximum extent possible, consistent with the need to protect interests specified in exemptions, so as to promote—
<P>
(a) the accountability of public authorities;
<P>
(b) informed public debate on public affairs;
<P>
(c) public participation in the making of decisions; and
<P>
(d) public understanding of the powers, duties and operation of public authorities.
<P>
(2) This Act shall be interpreted so as to further the purposes specified in subsection (1) and to encourage the disclosure of information, promptly and at the lowest reasonable cost.''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> The intention of the amendments and the new clause is to bring into the Bill a clear statement of its overriding purpose. That is not a novel concept and I shall cite examples of recent legislation in which such a provision has been introduced. It is a course that was strongly favoured by the Public Administration Committee in its July 1999 report on freedom of information in which it provided reasoned information that we would be wise to follow.
<P>
Paragraph 55 of the report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Purpose clauses can be used to indicate clearly which of two or more competing values should be uppermost when a decision is made. In this Bill, such a clause could have the effect of encouraging Commissioner, Tribunal and judges to lean towards disclosure. Perhaps more important, though, it could influence those people in departments and other authorities who actually have to operate the legislation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Paragraph 59 explains:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The effect of adding a purpose clause would be to encourage an authority to exercise its discretion under''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the relevant clause
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in favour of disclosure, and indeed, we have recommended''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that if that clause
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``is to be retained, a specific requirement to regard the public interest as being in favour of disclosure should be inserted within it''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The paragraph goes on to say that a purpose clause might
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``influence the exercise of every discretion under the Act, including the discretion to charge; the manner in which publication schemes are published . . .  the nature of the model publication schemes issued by the Commissioner and of the `practice recommendations'''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in clause 47, and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the meaning of `a reasonable interval' in''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
clause 12.
<P>
The Public Administration Committee makes a compelling argument which acquires greater authority from the support of the Data Protection Registrar, Elizabeth France, who is to become the first Information Commissioner. The Committee reported that she strongly supported a purpose clause to make it clear how the balance should be struck between privacy and freedom of information, in particular to ensure that the in-built advantages that privacy has under domestic law from the European data protection directive and the European convention on human rights do not overwhelm the right to information.
<P>
No one has more experience of the operation of such legislation than Mrs. France. Having appointed her, the Government should pay particular attention to her views about what is required to make her job—and the job of everyone who is trying to put the Government's intentions into effect—easier.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
In her oral evidence, Elizabeth France said, in criticism of the draft Bill.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``I think what I find lacking, when I look as the potential enforcement authority, at the FOI Bill is what I could use to hang a view that a discretionary decision had been improperly taken. If you have not got something which says `One of the weights and balances is the desire to have as much access as possible to public information' . . . then you are lacking something to go with the weight on the other side which says that there is a fundamental right to privacy where it is personal data and you lack something to assist decisions on whether a disclosure is obligatory or discretionary.''<P>

The Government have heard those arguments before and have modestly responded to the desirability of a purpose clause with two minor modifications to the original draft. The first is to change the long title so that the phrase ``to make provision about'' becomes ``to make provision for'' the disclosure of information. The second change, which I advocated, was to the order of clauses, making the right of access the first. The Public Administration Committee did not, however, consider those changes adequate. It noted in its report that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``there is still no clear presumption in favour of disclosure.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are not treading on wholly uncharted territory in advocating the development in question. Some countries that have introduced freedom of information legislation have already taken that course, and I draw the Committee's attention to the example of New Zealand. Its Official Information Act 1982 included just such a purpose clause. That is not precisely the basis of my new clause but it sets out a broad approach that I would recommend the Committee to adopt. It is worth noting that in 1992 a leading commentator noted that the purpose clause
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``ensured that the number, tenor and generality of the exemptions would not overshadow the raison d'etre of the Act.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That, it seems to me, is a valuable thought to keep in mind in considering the Bill, for although the right of access is set out in four lines, it appears at first blush to be heavily counterbalanced by the huge number of exemptions that constitute a large part of the Bill, running to more than 12 pages. There is a question of discretion. Deciding the bounds of public interest and where the duties for and against disclosure should be balanced to conform with the purpose of the Bill is not straightforward. Where there is a need for a decision, and the arguments for and against disclosure are clearly finely balanced, a purpose clause will make it simpler to come down on the side of publication, if that is the legislation's intention.
<P>
In a New Zealand case following the use of that provision, the judge said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``If the decision-maker, be he Minister or departmental head or Ombudsman or Judge, adjudicating in a claim of denial of right, is in two minds in the end, he should come down on the side of availability of information.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That ought to be the position here. The judge was able to say that because the New Zealand Act provided guidance in that respect. The Act exemption contained statutory public interest tests; the ombudsman has often referred to the purposes clause in the Act when considering those tests. In one case, the New Zealand ombudsman said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``I also noted that the Trust received public funding. I pointed out that the Official Information Act is an instrument to promote accountability . . . it could go without saying that one of the primary elements of the accountability of Ministers and officials is their responsibility for expenditure of the funds voted by Parliament. The various provisions of the section headed `interpretation'{**?h 1pt**}''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is, the purposes clause—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``must, in my view, be read with that purpose in mind.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We should bear in mind several helpful examples from that jurisdiction when considering the appropriateness of the amendments.
<P>
In this country, we have given specific and clear protection to the individual's privacy, not merely by the Data Protection Acts, but by article 8 of the European convention on human rights. That makes a counter-balancing general right and purpose, which we should entertain.
<P>
My amendment would emphasise that the Bill was intended to extend progressively the public's right to information, as is the case under New Zealand law. There is probably common ground between the Government, others and myself on that point. It is not a once and for all situation—interpretation will be required, rules will have to be drawn up and the operations of specific authorities will have to be adapted to comply with the new openness and accountability that the Bill is intended to promote. It is clear from clause 17 that the intention is for authorities to produce publication schemes setting out the information that they publish and intend to publish. Those will have to be reviewed from time to time.
<P>
Such progressiveness is part of the argument for the enshrining in law of a purpose, in line with which development is intended to occur. The amendment specifies four interests that the Bill is intended to promote: the accountability of public authorities, informed public debate and public affairs, public participation in decision making and public understanding of the powers, duties and operations of public authorities. Those interests informed the attitude of the Government when they first published their proposals. Most recently, the approach towards the purpose clause was set out in paragraph 105 of the paper entitled ``Your Right to Know—Background Material'', published in January 1998 by the Cabinet Office, which was then responsible for the Bill. It was envisaged that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The definition of `public interest' for these purposes might be set in terms of certain stated objectives of the Act e.g. in promoting better informed discussion of public affairs and the greater accountability of public authorities.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In making those proposals, I am merely following the Government's logic so clearly expressed in that document.
<P>
I said earlier that I would mention a couple of examples in which purpose clauses had been incorporated recently in our legislation. The Arbitration Act 1996 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The provisions of this Part are founded on the following principles and should be construed accordingly—(a) the object of arbitration is to obtain the fair resolution of disputes . . . (b) the parties should be free to agree how their disputes are resolved . . . (c) in matters governed by the part the court should not intervene except as provided by this part.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Similarly, section 37 of the Government's Crime and Disorder Act 1998 stated that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It shall be the principal aim of the youth justice system to prevent offending by children and young persons. 
<P>
(2) In addition to any other duty to which they are subject, it shall be the duty of all persons and bodies carrying out functions in relation to the youth justice system to have regard to that aim.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Although purpose clauses have not always been regarded as necessary or helpful, that has increasingly become a part of our jurisprudence. The officer principally made responsible by the Government's decision regards it as a part that we should incorporate.
<P>
I hope that I have not spoken at too great length on that point, which is of considerable importance to the way in which the Bill will be developed and construed by those required to do so.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I should like to speak to our alternative amendment—amendment No. 1. I should begin by saying that the hostility to the Liberal Democrats' amendment No. 21 which I first had when I saw it on the amendment paper yesterday, abated somewhat when I discovered this morning that it had been proposed to members of the Committee by the Campaign for Freedom of Information, for which I have the highest regard. That notwithstanding, the amendment, rather than new clause 2, still seems the most remarkable element of what we are being asked to consider concerning clause 1. It is remarkable chiefly because it would insert the word ``purposes'' three or four words ahead of the point at which I had chosen our amendment to be inserted. By that mechanism, the Liberal Democrat amendment became the lead amendment and not ours, which, for courtesy and to help the Committee, we had tabled some time ago. Our amendment included a proposal for the way in which the issue of purposes, raised strongly on Second Reading, could be met.
<P>
I am bound to say that, although there is ingenuity in linking the amendment to a new clause so that it is debated now, where the word ``purposes'' is to be inserted seems to make no sense because subsection (2) is restrictive. It creates, for the first time, reasons why information may not be available, perhaps because a fee has not been paid, as set out in clause 8, or because the request has been made repeatedly, as outlined in clause 11, or is vexatious, as stated in clause 12. The tone of subsection (2) is to introduce an element of restriction instead of encouraging greater openness. Nevertheless, we support the concept that a purposes clause should be inserted at the beginning of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The key question for the Committee is whether the new clause that has been tabled by the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Mr. Maclennan) meets what is required. I am not convinced that it does. We need to reflect on what has encouraged the demand for a purposes clause. What is the mischief that we are seeking to overcome by inserting a purposes clause at the beginning of the Bill? It is not that clause 1 fails to state a clear enough entitlement, as I made clear in my response to the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central. In fact, the more one reads clause 1, the more one is reassured that the Government intend to create an entitlement to information. The mischief is that the discretion not to release information under clause 13 could be improperly applied. The Data Protection Registrar, who will become the Information Commissioner, made that point in her oral evidence to the Public Administration Committee last summer, to which the right hon. Gentleman rightly referred, when she said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``I think what I find lacking, when I look as the potential enforcement authority, at the FOI Bill is what I could use to hang a view that a discretionary decision had been improperly taken.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We must be clear that we are debating the issue of purposes so early in our deliberations not because the Government have not stated a clear intention in clause 1 that information should be released, but because clause 13 gives public authorities the ability to apply discretion. There is a concern that the lack of a clear purposes clause at the beginning of the Bill will provide an opportunity for the discretion to be used to withhold information instead of releasing it. The Data Protection Registrar wants a form of words to be included that gives a clear presumption that information should be released. Those words are lacking.
<P>
Paragraph 16, page 20, of the Select Committee's third report in July last year sets out the key principles on which freedom of information law should be constructed. The very first principle is that there should be a clear presumption in favour of disclosure as a right of citizenship. The Select Committee report points out at paragraph 22 that the draft Bill contains
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``no governing statement—no `purpose clause'—which clearly commits the Government to the principles that should underlie the Bill,''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``sets out a presumption that information will be disclosed''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We come back to the word ``presumption'' and the need for the Bill to establish a presumption in favour of disclosure and the release of information.
<P>
Following the publication of the Bill that is before the Committee today, the Select Committee published a further report on 30 November—the first of this session. Paragraph 4 of that report drew the attention of the House to the fact that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Although the right to information is now stated at the beginning of the Bill, in Clause 1''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and I have mentioned several times that I welcome and appreciate the Government's intention, in making that change, to show a clear entitlement to information—there is none the less
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``still no clear presumption in favour of disclosure.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I could draw attention to other views that have been expressed on the issue, where the words ``presumption'' or ``assumption'' have been used to describe the reason for change. In its Second Reading briefing to Members of Parliament, dated 7 December, the National Consumer Council commented, in favour of a purpose clause, that such a clause should, among other things,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``establish the presumption that all information should be disclosed unless there is a greater public interest in keeping it secret''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is virtually the same as amendment No. 1.
<P>
The parliamentary brief drawn up by the Law Society states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Instead of a presumption in favour of disclosure of information we seem to have one which favours secrecy.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``A presumption in favour of full disclosure would be entirely consistent with the approach of the Lord Chancellor's Department in promoting the `Woolf' reforms of the Civil Justice System.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are the considered opinions of two extremely different organisations, which both favour incorporating the phrase ``a presumption in favour of disclosure'' in the Bill.
<P>
To refresh my memory I referred to some of the fine Second Reading speeches. I shall not provide precise references unless challenged to do so, but if hon. Members check they will find that the right hon. Member for South Shields (Dr. Clark) talked about the need for an assumption in favour of disclosure as the underlying objective of a purposes clause; that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Helen Jackson), whose excellent contribution to the debate will be remembered, talked about the need for an assumption in favour of disclosure in respect of all clauses in the Bill where an opportunity not to disclose might arise; and that the hon. Member for Warrington, South (Ms Southworth), who I am glad is a member of the Committee, referred to the need for presumption. On Second Reading, there was the continued use of the phrase ``presumption in favour of disclosure''. My final piece of evidence in support of our amendment is the code of practice that was published by the previous Government in 1994 and amended in 1997. The second sentence of the first paragraph of part I of the code states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The approach to release of information should in all cases be based on the assumption that information should be released except where disclosure would not be in the public interest''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is intended to reflect not only all the concerns that I have outlined to the Committee this morning, but the fact that the code to which the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central paid tribute, and which was seen as an important step forward, outlined an assumption in favour of disclosure. It is that same assumption that we want to place in the Bill by amendment No. 1. Not only will clause 13 pose a potential difficulty, but a presumption to inform would help to overcome the potential for other clauses to be used as a blocking mechanism. The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central referred earlier to clauses 11 and 12 and to what may happen in terms of the code of practice, and all such matters can be considered later in our proceedings.
<P>
The phrase ``presumption in favour of disclosure'' is a separate issue from the level of harm that might be appropriate when considering whether disclosure is in the public interest. For example, an assumption in favour of disclosure may be what the Government intend, but we consider that the Bill should make more clear such an intention. Earlier, in response to the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central, the Under-Secretary said that his overriding aim was clearly to encourage and bring about a change in the attitude towards the culture of secrecy. To achieve that, a stronger provision is necessary. The Bill must contain a form of words at the beginning to create the presumption that information will be released. The Government rightly acknowledged their concern about that by redrafting the Bill and moving the right to be informed from what was clause 8 to clause 1, and we welcome their clear intention of entitlement under clause 1. However, clause 1 should be strengthened. Amendment No. 1 is significantly different from new clause 2 tabled by the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross. We are disappointed that we cannot press it to a Division because it is not the lead amendment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to press amendment No. 1 to a Division, he may do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. O'Hara, for that advice. Depending on the Minister's response, we may indeed press our amendment to a Division. I was simply about to make the point that, if the right hon. Gentleman chooses to press his new clause 2, we are willing to support him. It is not that we are entirely satisfied with the new clause, but it would show our concern that something needs to be done and reflect the overwhelming view on Second Reading that the Bill is deficient in that important respect.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
However, a far better approach would be for the Under-Secretary to consider the amendments, which reflect all the concerns that were expressed on Second Reading, and to say that the Government intend to find a way of strengthening the Bill in the way that we have described and for the reasons that we have given. The Under-Secretary knows that it is not my style to press for unnecessary Divisions, but I want to stress our overwhelming view that the Bill, as drafted, is not acceptable. By the time that it goes to another place, it should be amended to deal with the issue of presumption in favour of disclosure.

<P>

<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I urge the Under-Secretary to consider new clause 2 sympathetically and not to be confused by the extremely detailed support that the hon. Member for Ryedale gave for the word ``presumption''. In the 20 minutes, he could have said that he supported the idea of a general presumption in the Bill, and many of us would have been sympathetic to that. New clause 2 has some important aspects. As the hon. Member for Ryedale said, a purposes clause was referred to by a number of people both in evidence in the Select Committee and on Second Reading. At that time, I thought that the most elegant purposes clause available in draft was the New Zealand version. Its 10 lines seemed to capture everything, but the new clause, which has been drafted by the Campaign for Freedom of Information, is even more elegant. It is shorter and has one or two extra factors. It has been extremely well thought out and it is elegantly drafted.
<P>
If my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary is not going to be persuaded by the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross or me, I hope that he will give thought to the new clause, or perhaps seek a meeting with Elizabeth France because, rightly, she has been garlanded with praise by hon. Members in the Select Committee and on the Floor of the House. There are many expectations and hopes resting on the way in which she will fulfil her responsibilities. Like the right hon. Gentleman, I thought that Elizabeth France's oral and written evidence to the Select Committee was persuasive. The right hon. Gentleman mentioned some of it, but a further comment that she made was:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``I think it would be very helpfull in making judgments about discretionary decisions''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
``it'' refers to a purposes clause—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``but it fits also with my view that discretionary decisions should be reviewable in substance, the two are a package, if you like. You have a purpose clause in order to help public authorities make discretionary decisions, otherwise how does it know what to weigh? I would agree with Lord Burns that officials will look in detail at what is written in the statute unless a very clear lead is given from the top of the public bodies as to what action is appropriate. If there is nothing there that tells them to weigh in the balance a general interest in disclosure then they will not do so.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That oral evidence was given by Elizabeth France, who considered the matter carefully. If she is one of the key instruments by which the Bill is to be implemented, and if she feels that it would be helpful to have a purposes clause, the Government will need a very good reason not to include one. It would not weaken the Bill in any way; it would simply provide a reference point. As the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross said when he quoted from the New Zealand Court of Appeal ruling, it could be used as a tie-breaker when it is difficult to understand which way to go, and as a finder of the balance.
<P>
The last point made by the right hon. Gentleman about the role of Mrs. France and her successors is important. I am sympathetic to, and interested in, the Government's view that her role, as protector of privacy through data protection, should blend in an interesting, though complicated, way with freedom of information. There will be tensions and complexities, which makes her role even more important. Mrs. France undoubtedly has a big weight of evidence to take into account, including the data protection Acts, article 8 of the European convention on human rights, the European directive on data protection, and so on. A large body of important and valuable weight will be taken into account, and I want to give her the benefit of the doubt when she says that she wants a purposes clause. It would not weaken the Bill, but it would assist her.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen O'Brien </B>(Eddisbury): I support amendment No. 1 tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale and I shall be referring to new clause 2, which was tabled by the right hon. Member for Caithness and—
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> Sutherland and Easter Ross.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The steep learning curve has not quite reached the full length of the right hon. Gentleman's constituency title.
<P>
In reflecting on this morning's discussion, I note that there is a tension between the amendments and the approach of my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale in seeking to create an overriding presumption and between those who might wish the Bill to create a climate of policy direction over time. The Bill must be grounded in what will make it easy to operate for those who have to comply with it and for those whose rights are defined. It is analogous to the burden of proof. We are well used to the phrase, ``innocent until proved guilty''; we are trying to discuss the approach of disclosure until proved exempt because it is not in the public interest. That implies a presumption.
<P>
It is notable from Second Reading that because of the operation of clause 13, referring to a discretion to withhold, the right approach is to have a clause of a presumption. The mindset of those who have to operate the system is the most important element. If a presumption is not defined, there is a danger that a discretion to withhold information under clause 13 will allow unequal weight to be applied either to the operation of that discretion or to those seeking the information—the applicants.
<P>
In considering the operational effectiveness of the Bill, it would be sensible to frame a purposes clause in the nature of a presumption. It must be right for the best guidance of those who are obliged to comply. As I said, presumptions create mindsets. The legislation will work well only if it is operated by individuals who have to make the right judgments. We are not looking simply for motherhood and apple-pie statements of future policy direction, but for genuine operational effectiveness. The legislation must clearly define the parameters of citizens' rights. They need to know that the mindset of the approach is a presumption in their favour for disclosure. The expectations defining accountability must be correctly focused. One starts by recognising that there is a presumption to disclose and that accountability therefore starts at that point. Otherwise, there could be a danger that accountability starts from the point of whether it was right to have the discretion to withhold. That frames the entire accountability point in the reverse direction from what the Government—rightly, honouring their 1997 manifesto commitment—wish to create. As the Under-Secretary said, it is a culture change.
<P>
Amendment No. 1, which would create an overriding presumption, is the right approach to take. It distinguishes itself from amendment No. 21 and new clause 2 tabled by the Liberal Democrats. We must take such a step either in Committee or on Report, given that cases will come before the court when great delay, expense and distress might be caused to those involved. In such cases, under the tradition of common law, judges would create the presumption by saying that it was clearly in the minds of the legislators to have a presumption to disclose, which would help them deal with difficulties when they arise. Naturally, I accept that it is difficult to foresee such difficulties; otherwise, specific provision would be made for them in the Bill.
<P>
The problem is reinforced by what the Government said in their 1997 manifesto. They stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We are pledged to a Freedom of Information Act, leading to more open government''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and went on to criticise the code of practice regarding access to Government information that was introduced by the previous Administration, claiming that it contained too many exemptions. Interestingly, while that code of practice has 15 grounds for exemption, there are 21 under the Bill.
<P>
Despite the criticisms of the code of practice, the Government announced on 10 July 1997 in a Cabinet Office press release that, over the previous five years, an additional 77,500 records had been released by Departments and the Public Record Office. That shows that the code of practice has worked to some degree at least. I am sure that, when forming an approach to such important matters, we all want to ensure that the Bill is an improvement on the past and that it builds on best practice instead of ditching what has gone before. That would be consistent with what the Government have said many times and, as has been noted, the code of practice that contains the presumption that is put forward under amendment No. 1 contains the precedent on which to build the Bill. That would be better than the Government trying to start afresh.
<P>
Let us consider the ``Purpose'' clause of the ``Code of Practice on Access to Government Information'', the second edition of which was published in 1997. It was introduced originally in April 1994 and has been in operation for nearly six years. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The approach to release of information should in all cases be based on the assumption that information should be released except where disclosure would not be in the public interest, as specified in Part II of this Code.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that the Minister will regard amendment No. 1 as an evolutionary and positive step and accept that it would build on what has already been proved to be successful. It is not too radical a step and, above all, it meets by logical inference the concern expressed by the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central about wanting assistance from public authorities. If there were a presumption, there would be an inference within that presumption that public authorities are required to assist. That will be their mindset and assistance will therefore come with it.
<P>
In all candour, the amendment would be a correct purposes clause in contrast to what is proposed by the Liberal Democrats. Although I have much sympathy with their worthy amendment and new clause 2 and accept that such proposals are an aspiration, they would not set a purpose. The logic of our proposal is that we need a presumption to define the purpose.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The debate is important. The Government have considered carefully whether we should have a purpose clause. We have reached to the view that we should not and I shall set out our reasoning in a broader context in a moment. That is not to deny the elegance of the amendment proposed by the Liberal Democrats and, I understand, the Campaign for Freedom of Information. However, we are not currently convinced that it offers the right approach. General purpose clauses can have value when set in the right context. To some extent, a judgment must be made about whether they are appropriate in a Bill. Our aim is to ensure that the Bill strikes the right balance; that balance is carefully struck within the wording of the Bill as a whole.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Ryedale noted, clause 1 creates a new right and entitlement to information, which we think is important. Our aim is to open up public authorities much more. Not only legislation but cultural change will be required, and we are committed to ensuring that that happens.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross says that the general purpose clause might apply when the decision about whether information should be disclosed is finely balanced. A general purpose clause would allow a gloss to be put on the legislation. The Government believe that the legislation has, in this case, been carefully drafted to strike the right balance in the wording: to create a new gloss would not be desirable.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman also referred to the views of the Data Protection Registrar, Mrs. Elizabeth France, which we value highly. However, Mrs. France appeared to desire such a clause as a means of interpreting the interaction between the Bill and the Data Protection Act 1998. She felt that such a clause might be helpful in that context.
<P>
We cannot agree because we are constrained by the meaning of the European Union directive on which the data protection legislation is based. A purpose clause could have no effect in so far as it sought to place a gloss on an EU directive. We considered carefully the view of the Data Protection Registrar but, if that was her intention—it appeared to be from the way in which she argued—we would not have been able to achieve her desired end by including a general purpose clause.
<P>
Before I deal with the amendments, I should note that I regard the points to be important. A difficult and complex judgment is to be made about a purpose clause. Clause 13, in particular, is the correct place for a broad-based statement regarding the public interest. Indeed, the public interest is referred to in clause 13(4), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``In making any decision under subsection (2) or (3), the public authority shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case and to the desirability of . . . informing the applicant whether it holds information, and . . . communicating information to him, wherever the public interest in disclosure outweighs the public interest in maintaining the exemption in question.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I must explain to the hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien) that there is no discretion to withhold. The Bill creates a right to information unless it is exempt. Incidentally, that is much better than a presumption of there being no right to information. Clause 13 requires an authority to consider disclosing the information while taking into account the public interest.
<P>
Let me deal more generally with the issue of a purposes clause and explain our view. Amendment No. 21 would require clause 1 to be interpreted in the light of new clause 2, which aims to define the purposes of the Bill. A purposes clause along the lines of new clause 2 would not be appropriate. We must assume that such a clause would be given legislative effect by the commissioner, tribunal and courts, and that it would therefore change the balance of rights and put a gloss on the Bill as a whole. That may be unpredictable and uncontrollable. It is right that legislation should be as precise as possible. The right of access to information must be balanced against other rights, such as the right to privacy and the right to confidentiality. Too strong a presumption in favour of disclosure for certain purposes, however worthy, over competing rights to privacy, confidentiality and so on, could put us in conflict with, for example, the Human Rights Act 1998. We are conscious, as the Government who introduced that Act with broad-based support in the House, that we need to create the right balancing mechanism in all legislation so that we do not put ourselves in conflict with it.
<P>
Openness does not have a monopoly on righteousness. Confidentiality has a proper and legitimate place. The right of the public to know must not place an unnecessary burden on, for example, small business, or undermine proper, legitimate and effective government, which is also in the public interest. If we did that, the purposes clause could backfire. For example, if business is inhibited from giving commercially confidential information to Government on the basis that it might be released under freedom of information legislation, effective regulation of the financial sector's trade and commerce would be undermined. The public interest in exercising freedom of information could therefore conflict with the public interest in regulating business.
<P>
I again draw attention to the fact that in the United States, freedom of information legislation has been used by companies to find out the commercial secrets that are held by the Government on other companies far more than it has been used by members of the public or the press. Indeed, up to 60 per cent of applications under the United States freedom of information legislation relate to companies that are seeking to find out information about competitors. That is a difficult matter. When we produce legislation, we must bear in mind not just the benefits that have arisen from similar legislation in other countries, but the difficulties that it has caused which we might not want to replicate. It is important to get the balance right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> My hon. Friend says that there would be difficulties. Can he be specific? No one, including Mr. Robert Hazell who examined similar legislation in other countries on behalf of the previous Government, has said that difficulties stem from a purposes clause. He should tell the Committee if he knows differently.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> My point is that the purposes clause would shift and possibly undermine the balance in the Bill, which has been carefully achieved. It would put a gloss on the Bill. The Bill's objective is to achieve a balance between the proper and rightful needs to open up public authorities and to respect the rights of privacy and of confidentiality, and the ability of public authorities to carry out their duties in the public interest. Our aim is to achieve that balance. We believe that we have achieved it. If the Bill included a general purposes clause, any interpretation of the Bill's provisions would be skewed, glossed and altered. Right hon. and hon. Members want us to consider including a general purposes clause to put a general gloss on the Bill and to include a presumption that would affect the way in which the Bill was interpreted. We believe that the balance is right. If we include a general purposes clause, the Bill will become unbalanced.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Members on both sides sympathise with what my hon. Friend says. The reason for the Bill's complexity is that it seeks to find a balance between a general thrust, presumption or assumption, which the Government rightly laud, and how it should be applied in particular circumstances. If it is a good Bill, it will find the balance in sophisticated and subtle ways. I am sure that it will do so, but it must have something that it can balance. It therefore needs an up-front, general statement of its purpose, to be balanced against the rest of the Bill. That is what the new clause is about; that is why Mrs. France felt that it would be helpful.
<P>
I urge my hon. Friend at least not to close his mind to the amendment and the new clause. He should meet Mrs. France and explore with her how such measures could get the best out of the Bill. The new clause is not a devious trick to unbalance the Bill. We all agree that the Bill is a complicated mechanism that seeks a balance. However, to achieve a balance one must have something on the other side. A clear statement that would be sophisticatedly interpreted in other parts of the Bill would be an important part of that balance.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I must remind hon. Members that a balance should also be struck between interventions and speeches.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> My apologies, Mr. O'Hara.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> My hon. Friend asks if I would meet Elizabeth France. I have met her on several occasions and I would be happy to meet her again to discuss those matters further. It is not a problem.
<P>
My hon. Friend said that the Bill needs a general purposes clause, but that might unbalance the Bill and cause an undesirable gloss to be put on it. It is a matter of judgment. My hon. Friend and others have reached a different conclusion. The Government have considered the matter with great care. Our mind is not completely closed, but we shall need an awful lot of convincing that we are wrong and I am not yet convinced. We want the Bill to work. We believe that it will. We do not need to include a provision that would put a gloss on the Bill.
<P>
Amendment No. 1 would require authorities considering applications for information under the Bill to have regard to an over-riding presumption that information should always be released, except when disclosure would not be in the public interest. The amendment would in effect introduce such a purpose clause. Aside from the general arguments against a purpose clause, which I outlined earlier in relation to the need to achieve a balance and which we believe that we have achieved with the current wording, it is important to note that the effect of that particular provision would be unclear.
<P>
The amendment states that the obligation to consider the over-riding presumption is subject to the exemptions in part II. However, it is not clear what that is intended to achieve. Would the presumption apply in the case of information to which an exemption applies? Nor does the amendment place the public interest in any context; it merely floats around—unlike in clause 13, which sets it in a very clear context.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Part II specifies that the competing interests are in the exemptions from the general right of access. It is only when a particular need requiring information not to be disclosed is specified that the public interest in maintaining an exemption from the general right of access can be defined, given due weight and balanced. For example, the public interest may require the protection of information on grounds of national security. That is different from other public interests and from the weight given to the need to protect information because it is commercially confidential or commercially sensitive. Several issues are involved, all of which need to be properly balanced, and that is why we have drafted the Bill as we have.
<P>
As I said, the Government are prepared to consider arguments on clause 13. That is the appropriate point at which to explore some of those issues, and, in due course, with your permission, Mr. O'Hara, we shall have a wide debate on clause 13, which is an important clause. That is where a strengthening would be introduced if the Government were to be convinced of the need for it. I give no undertakings at this stage, but that is the point at which we should have this debate, rather than introducing a provision that, elegantly phrased though it is, would create something that floats about in the ether rather than fitting neatly into the Bill.
<P>
Several points have been made, with which I hope that I can deal briefly. The hon. Member for Ryedale said that the previous Government's code contained a purpose clause. However, the code had no legislative effect and did not create statutory rights. When a clear statutory right is being provided, we must be careful to understand the effect of a presumption on that right in ways that we cannot predict.
<P>
As the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross said, the second report of the Public Administration Committee recommended a purpose clause. The House of Lords ad hoc Committee on freedom of information said that the draft Bill did not need a general purpose clause but that the long title should be amended. That is the approach that we have taken. The Government amended the Bill's long title along the lines proposed by the House of Lords ad hoc Committee on freedom of information. We are not convinced that a purpose clause would have the benefit suggested by the right hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty—sorry, for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross; Ross and Cromarty are from the gale warnings.
<P>
I hope that I have explained how we have approached these important issues. It is right and proper that they should be raised in Committee, and I hope that we shall be able to discuss them in a more defined and clearer context when we reach clause 13, on which, as I have already noted, the Government do not have a closed mind.

<P>

<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I begin by expressing my appreciation to the Minister for the careful, subtle way in which he has answered the debate; from previous experience, I entirely expect that of him.
<P>
I should like to deal with one or two of the Minister's arguments but, before doing so, I should offer an apology to the hon. Member for Ryedale, whose concerns about the positioning of my amendment on the amendment paper clearly disposed him to be uncomfortable with its substance. I must admit to being completely innocent of the charge of which he has accused me. I acknowledge that the circumstantial evidence might have been powerful but, when the amendment was tabled, I was one of those swelling the ranks of people with influenza not recorded in the Government's official figures. I was not aware of the hon. Gentleman's amendment, although I should have been. Having said that, I am not sure that I would necessarily have been convinced that the order of consideration was wrong.
<P>
I accept with gratitude what the hon. Gentleman said about his fallback position. Such support is important if progress is to be made towards strengthening the Bill. I would not be disposed to exacerbating any ill feelings that may have arisen by taking a point. His amendment was a good shot, but I doubt that it would deal effectively with the problem that he and I agreed existed, not least because although it speaks of the importance of the over-riding presumption it also proposes a massive exemption regarding what would be considered not in the public interest to disclose. What would be meant by ``the public interest'' in that context is not defined. It would not be especially helpful in resolving tie-break situations over where the public interest lies—exactly what the purpose clause is designed to deal with.
<P>
The Minister's arguments side-stepped and smacked of the justifications for the drafting of legislation with which one is familiar from parliamentary counsel, who have never liked such general clauses. Even the Human Rights Act 1998 faced considerable opposition from the professional drafters of legislation because they thought that that was not the way in which British courts liked to proceed.
<P>
We still get sputtering attempts to damn general clauses that are intended to guide or to help decision makers. I hope that we can dispense with them; they surfaced in what the Minister said about skewing the whole Bill, which I do not believe to be so. Even under the old canons of statutory interpretation there was a rule—generalia specialibus non derogant. In other words, if the Bill provides in particular for something, no general havering, cloudy definitions or aspirations will be set aside. The Government have been most careful to provide the special circumstances in which they consider there to be a danger from disclosure. Nothing that I do to seek to amend the Bill to provide for a general proposition about its intents would affect that at all—even under the rules of interpretation as they were 20 or 30 years ago and, basically, as they are today. The genera1 objection about skewing the Bill is wrong. The amendment is designed to deal with real difficulties when determining where the public interest lies, and it will prompt the memory that it was Parliament's wish, in those particular respects and for those particular purposes, to help to improve the accountability of public authorities and to promote the other factors set out in new clause 2.
<P>
As the Minister said, the clause is balanced; it has to take account of certain other guaranteed rights, not least privacy and confidentiality. But we are used to doing that sort of thing. The Human Rights Act 1998 is a great balancing act between freedom of expression and privacy. The Government have failed to strike the balance in the Bill as nicely as they did in the 1998 Act. That Act contains a clear statement of the importance of the right to freedom of expression and the right to privacy and confidentiality. No one could argue that one outweighed the other; they are both guaranteed in the 1998 Act.
<P>
The complaint—I am not the only one to complain; the amendment was recommended by the Campaign for Freedom of Information, and it reflects the views of many constituent organisations—is that the Bill does not get the balance quite right. It contains pages of special provisions for class exemptions in circumstances where the public interest can be defined in a way that would preclude disclosure. However, the Bill does not contain a straightforward statement of its purpose. It has only a marginal note that states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``General right of access to information held by public authorities'';<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
but which is not part of its operative text.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I have been listening with care. The right hon. Gentleman seems to be contradicting himself. On the one hand, he says that the amendment would not put a gloss on the Bill so it is not quite so important, that it will deal only with when a fine distinction needs to be made, and that one might need the added benefit of a general purpose clause. On the other hand, he seems to be saying that the many exemptions might require a general purpose clause to aid interpretation, so we are not talking about a small number of cases. I am not clear in which direction the right hon. Gentleman is placing his argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> The Under-Secretary's comments make it quite plain that I have not made myself clear. I am saying that the Bill is clear in many of its definitions and exemptions, and the circumstances in which information should not be released. Those provisions cover many pages of the Bill. In those cases, there is no argument; the Government have set out clearly what the authorities must do. A purposes clause would not necessarily help in such circumstances because the Bill already says precisely and clearly what is to be done. A purposes clause would be helpful where no such precise, special prescriptions are given.
<P>
As the Under-Secretary said, we shall debate cases where general statements of a discretionary nature are made when we come to clause 13—by then we shall have almost lost sight of the reason for the Bill. In such cases, a purposes clause would remind the authorities of the reason for the Bill when taking decisions. The Bill's purpose is not to stop the disclosure of information; it is to make information more freely available. In some cases, one may lose sight of that fact, and, unless it is so stated, of the fact that there is a public interest in disclosure. However, the point should not be laboured.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Under-Secretary spoke about Elizabeth France's view that the proposal would be helpful in resolving difficulties that might arise from the interaction of the Data Protection Act 1998 and this Bill. I do not grasp the Minister's point that we could not use the Bill to aid interpretation of the interaction between the two pieces of legislation. The European Union directive lies behind the Data Protection Act 1998. It is not the purpose of the Bill, or of the amendment, to cut the protection under that directive. The Bill will assist interpretation; it is not against a clear prescription of law. We want to deal with the factual position when it is not entirely certain how the law should be applied. It should not be regarded as an inhibition on the freedom of the House if, to assist interpretation, an Act on another subject is referred to that touches on this matter. If the commissioner has to deal with the Data Protection Act 1998 in practice, I cannot think of anyone better placed to make that judgment. She already has experience of the operation of the 1998 Act. If she says, ``I would be assisted by such clarity of purpose'', who are we to quarrel with her?
<P>
I am extremely grateful to the Minister for saying that he has not wholly set his face against the proposal. He said that at this stage he was not disposed to accept it. I hope that, with the passage of time and our continuing discussion, he will accept the wisdom of Elizabeth France and others and that he will agree that it is a proposal that the Government, in their own way and in their own time, want to see embodied. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 19, in page 1, line 17, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`provided that it has notified the applicant promptly that such further information is required.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When we debated amendment No. 18 this morning, we had a brief discussion on the idea of a duty to assist applicants. Amendment No. 19 refers to a specific instance when such assistance would be helpful to applicants. The amendment places a duty on a public body to tell an applicant whose request for information has not been satisfied that further information is required before the requested information is released. At present, clause 1(3) allows an authority to refuse an application if it has not been
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``supplied with such further information as it may reasonably require''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have no objection to that provision, which is a reasonable one. In practice, the public body can remain silent and not say what further information would bring the request for information in order. That the applicant would be required to guess in what way he or she has not provided sufficient information for the request to be considered would be bizarre.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Clause 1(3) contains the words ``may reasonably require''. A requirement must be made in order to rely on the clause so, in effect, what my hon. Friend is asking for already exists.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> That is not how I understand it. I am pleased if my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary believes that the clause will be interpreted in that way, but I am not sure that he is right. If he is interpreting the verb ``require'' in a transitive sense and saying that the authority will have to require further information, my argument falls and I shall withdraw the amendment. However, the only requirement for an authority to comment when it refuses an application is specified under clause 15 in which there are four circumstances in which a public body must comment on its refusal, such as if the information were exempt, if it were too costly, if it were vexatious or if there were an identical application.
<P>
I do not see elsewhere in the Bill a provision under which an authority would have to assist an applicant to get information. I am delighted that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary thinks that the way in which clause 1(3) will be interpreted and will operate in practice is that, when an application is turned down on the grounds of inadequate information, the public authority will automatically go back to the applicant and say, ``Look, I am sorry, we cannot supply this because we need to know more about what you are applying for.'' If my hon. Friend believes that that is how the clause will be interpreted, I shall be delighted to withdraw the amendment.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The amendment is unnecessary. Clause 1(3) provides that authorities are not obliged to comply with the duty to communicate information unless the authority is supplied with such further information as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it may reasonably require in order to identify and locate the information requested.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is therefore already implicit in clause 1(3) that the authority can rely only on the provision if it had actually asked the applicant for further information.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath </B>(Somerton and Frome): I am most grateful to the Under-Secretary, but he is placing an odd construction on the word ``require''. Most people would interpret that as information being needed rather than as information that the applicant has been asked to provide. Will he consider whether that word may be replaced by a more suitable word in later proceedings even if he will not accept the amendment? There is an ambiguity in the clause as he will recognise he considers it further.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> If I identify other problems with the amendment, the hon. Gentleman might recognise the way in which I am approaching the matter. There is no need to spell out further in the Bill what we mean by the provision. We are saying that the authority can rely on it only if it has asked the applicant for further information.
<P>
There are some other problems with the amendment. The subsection is linked with giving assistance to applicants, which is a matter that is dealt with properly in the Secretary of State's code of practice. However, the need for further information may not become apparent until some time after the application has begun to be processed. Thus, the requirement that the applicant be notified promptly is a problem. It poses a particular difficulty. It is the intention of the word ``promptly'' that the authority must consider well before the 20-day limit whether it needs further information? The amendment is unhelpful, because such a duty would place an unreasonable burden on authorities.
<P>
The word ``require'' makes an element of informing implicit in clause 1(3). People must be made aware that the public authority's objective is to rely on not giving information because it requires further information. The requirement is implicit in clause 1(3). An authority cannot rely on the clause without asking for the information.
<P>
The clause should be read as a whole. ``Require'' is probably best interpreted as ``need''. If possible, the authority should inform the person involved at the earliest opportunity what extra information is needed.
<P>
I do not want to create a bureaucratic and legalistic set of requirements that require local authorities and applicants to jump through unnecessary hoops in order to achieve their aims. A reasonable and proper approach involving a change of culture will make it clear to authorities that if they try to rely on the clause, they must be clear about how they are doing so. The word ``require'' means that they should at least inform the person who wants the information what they require, if they are reasonably able to do so. If the person has not provided information about his address, for example, and the authority cannot comply, I do not want to place a requirement on the public authority to provide the information to someone who is difficult to identify.
<P>
We shall end up delving into complex legalistic issues if we are not careful. Hon. Members will be aware of Pepper v. Hart. It is implicit in clause 1(3) that the authority may rely on the provision only if it has asked the applicant for further information.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I was encouraged by and sympathetic to some of what the Under-Secretary said. It is interesting that we have sat through an entire sitting without Pepper and Hart rearing their joint heads.
<P>
The Under-Secretary made a clear and helpful statement that the intention of the Bill relates to an authority that cannot supply information but would be able to do so if it had slightly more information in order to understand what was being required of it. I became less sympathetic to his argument when he said that the amendment would be terribly complicated legally and terrifically onerous. Is he saying that that is what will happen anyway, and that his interpretation of his Bill is that authorities will in practice have to request further information? That is not complicated, and would involve nothing very legalistic. It is plain common sense to enable people to request information in a practical form.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> My anxiety about legalistic complications related to the word ``promptly'' in the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I hope that the Under-Secretary will consider that small but important point, and perhaps also consider—although I am not tabling verbally a manuscript amendment—the insertion of the phrase ``and request'' after the word ``require'', so that the authority may reasonably ``require and request'' in order to identify and locate the information required. I agree with the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) that a requirement is slightly different from a request. For the sake of greater clarity, inserting the word ``request'' as a belt and braces for ``require'' might be one way out of the problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I shall consider my hon. Friend's points and write to him and other members of the Committee in due course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Given my hon. Friend's constructive and helpful comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher: I beg to move amendment No. 20, in page 1, line 22, after `that', insert `it has established that'.</B><P>
<P>
The amendment would place the burden of demonstrating that information is exempt on the authority. In a dispute, the burden of proof would be placed on the authority, not on the applicant or even the commissioner, to show that certain information was exempt. It is right that an authority, having a request made to it, should have to demonstrate that the information is exempt.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> The fact that Liberal Democrat members of the Committee have not spoken in support of many of the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central does not mean that we do not agree with them. We simply wish to avoid repeating arguments that have already been advanced.
<P>
Amendment No. 20, however, is a critical amendment. We are discussing whether the public body concerned must establish that it is correct in exempting information or a specific piece of information from the Bill. We are following two arguments, one of which is about clarity in any subsequent challenge to that decision. The amendment would be beneficial. Let us consider its effect on public bodies when they consider whether specific information is within or outwith the provisions of the Bill, which will apply to the heads of those organisations listed in schedule 1, which is almost a ``Who's Who'' of the quangocracy in this country.
<P>
Amendment No. 20 would also have a beneficial effect on democratically elected bodies, such as local authorities, police authorities and so on. Implicit in it is the requirement that local authorities or police authorities should take reasonable precautions to ensure that they correctly apply the Bill when deciding whether a piece of information is exempt from its provisions. Many matters will flow from that in the considerations of the authorities, the activities of their officers and, in the case of a local authority, as a result of the appropriate officer alerting the authority to the possibility that it may be in contravention of the Bill when deciding to declare exempt a specific piece of information.
<P>
Taken together, such effects will be wholly beneficial. They will move us away from a position of assertion that something is exempt to a point at which people must make a decision in the context of the requirements of the Bill and the information. For all those reasons, the Under-Secretary might be well advised to look carefully at the amendment and, if he is not prepared to accept it today, at least accept the spirit in which it was moved: to improve the Bill and avoid a possible difficulty in interpretation at a later date.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The amendment would place a burden of proof on a public authority in demonstrating that information was exempt from the duty to communicate it under any provision in part II. However, it is unintentionally technically misguided and would undermine openness. It would not achieve the intended effect. The provision as drafted removes the obligation to communicate the information requested if the information is exempt as a matter of law. Instead, the amendment would have the damaging effect of removing an obligation where the authority had established that it was exempt. Since the authority is not the final arbiter on whether information is exempt, and the commissioner, tribunal and, finally, the courts may arbitrate on the matter, the amendment would allow the authority and not the final arbiter to determine when an obligation did not arise. That cannot be the intention of those who moved the amendment; indeed, from what they have said, it clearly is not.
<P>
Even if the aim of the amendment is to make authorities justify their claim that an exemption applies, the Government are satisfied that under the Bill authorities are sufficiently accountable for their decisions. Under the Bill, authorities cannot arbitrarily claim that information is exempt or do so without explaining why. Clause 15 requires authorities to give applicants reasons why an exemption applies, which means that they cannot simply quote an exemption when refusing a request for information. Authorities must therefore already give an account to the applicant when claiming that the information requested is exempt. In other words, the proposed amendment is superfluous. Moreover, if the applicant disagrees with the decision of an authority, he can complain to the Information Commissioner, who has the power to make a decision on whether the exemption properly applies and, if appropriate, to substitute her own judgment for that of the authority. However, the amendment would require her to apply the authority's criteria rather than making a judgment herself, in the way intended by the Bill. As the burden of proof is sufficiently weighted in favour of openness, and as the amendment is technically deficient and would achieve the opposite to what he intends, I ask my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary. I was interested in his view that the drafting of the amendment would weaken, not strengthen, the duty to explain and I would like to consider that in more detail. On his second point, perhaps we should return to the matter when we debate clause 15. I am encouraged by his interpretation of that clause, but I suspect that we will have a considerable debate about refusals when we reach that clause. Perhaps that is a more appropriate time to return to the amendments—by which time I might have worked out my numbers. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 22, in page 1, line 24, leave out subsection (6).
<P>
The amendment would remove subsection (6). On first reading, that subsection seems extraordinary. It provides that if an authority—a public body—were already minded to delete a piece of information, an application for disclosure would not alter that. The authority would still be able to delete it. That seems to sit oddly with the Government's clear intentions in the Bill. The explanatory notes tell us that it
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``is intended to help ensure that requests for information under the Bill do not interfere with the other day-to-day work of an authority or with sound record management.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That sounds like the elevation of a bureaucratic principle and a sense of order above the essence of the Bill, which is to allow members of the public access to information that they need or in which they are interested.
<P>
It is not hard to see that there is potential for abuse of that process to avoid disclosure. I know that the Minister will immediately direct my attention to clause 75, which lists the offences relating to the deliberate deletion or withholding of information that would come under the terms of the Bill. I understand that entirely, but it makes it all the more extraordinary that an internal tension has deliberately been introduced to the Bill by clause 1(6), so that, if a piece of information were to be deleted under certain circumstances, there would be an immediate need to establish the intentions of the person or authority in deleting. Was it part of a routine process? Was the decision taken before receipt of the request for disclosure?
<P>
There is the possibility of a lot of future legal discussion, with no benefit to anyone. The basic premise should be that if someone requests information, it should usually be easy for the authority not to delete that information before a copy is made and provided to the applicant. Deliberate circumvention of the Bill would be possible under subsection (6), and none of us wants to provide for that, nor do we see it being a common practice. Nevertheless, if an authority determined a 19-day cycle for deletion of sensitive information, which would be within the 20-day requirement under the Bill, it would have a class defence against disposing of any sensitive material that it wished not to provide to members of the public.
<P>
The provision is a strange anomaly, and I am not sure what its intention is. I can suppose only that it is to bring the Bill in line with the Data Protection Act 1998, but the similar provision in that Act serves a very different purpose. I do not believe that the provision is necessary. It is at least otiose and could be more serious than that, as it could provide for those ill disposed to the terms of the Bill and its intentions to find a class defence against it.
<P>
Will the Minister explain why subsection (6) is in the Bill? What advantages does it have for the vast majority of public bodies that it covers? Why does he see it as essential to retain the capacity for abuse and further legalistic argument?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> For the sake of clarity, I think that it is right to confirm what the hon. Gentleman said about the Government's intention to prevent authorities from altering or destroying information to thwart the purpose of the freedom of information.
<P>
Clause 75 makes it an offence for authorities to alter or destroy records with the intention of preventing disclosure. In view of what the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome said, it is right that I quote part of clause 75, as it is relevant. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Where—
<P>
(a) a request for information has been made to a public authority, and
<P>
(b) under section l of this Act or section 7 of the Data Protection Act 1998, the applicant would have been entitled (subject to payment of any fee) to communication of any information in accordance with that section,
<P>
any person to whom this subsection applies is guilty of an offence if he alters, defaces, blocks, erases, destroys or conceals any record held by the public authority, with the intention of preventing the disclosure by that authority of all, or any part, of the information to the communication of which the applicant would have been entitled.''<P>
