Hughes</b> (North Southwark and Bermondsey) (LD): I presume
that it is still acceptable for us to be jacketless, if we choose to be
so, Mr. Bayley.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column392" />Column number: 392</div><a name="10012152000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000527"></a>The
Chairman:</b> It
is.</div><a name="10012152000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000528"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> Thank you. I had just finished by accepting that
we understood some of the points that the hon. Member for Wealden had
made about the difficulties of an over-precise clause. He made the
perfectly acceptable general point that there is a
consensus&#151;certainly on the Opposition Benches. His party, my
party and the Scottish National party agree that there should be a
provision for emissions performance standards in the Bill.</div>
<a name="10012152000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our proposal
expresses what we think should be the starting point for that debate. I
absolutely understand the points that the hon. Gentleman made; we need
to allow for the flexibility and definition that he suggested, although
I would not go as far as he would in having a completely open and
general clause. That would not be my preference.</div>
<a name="10012152000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman made one other point, which was that there probably needs to
be a more precise definition of a new coal-fired power station. I
understand that the intention of the drafting was that it would be
defined as a power station that had not started operating before 2020
and was to start operating from then on. I think we can
accommodate that difficulty and that question of definition.</div>
<a name="10012152000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Angus, who was very sympathetic to the idea that we should
have emissions performance standards in the Bill, expressed a
preference&#151;not a lack of support for new clause 1, but a
preference&#151;for new clause 5. He said that we absolutely need
certainty, not least so that there can be the drive towards the
technological solutions that we all need down the road for carbon
capture and storage.</div>
<a name="10012152000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The response
from the Minister of State was partly helpful, but not as robust as I
would have liked it to have been. Perfectly reasonably, she set out the
Government&#146;s general commitment and her specific commitment to
the cause of dealing with carbon emissions. It is a point that clearly
differentiates us from some people in other parts of the Committee and
the House. I noted her phrase&#151;accurately, I hope. In respect of
emissions reductions, she wanted as much and as quickly as was
feasible. Of course, there is always the question of what is
feasible.</div> <a name="10012152000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">My starting
point in the general debate, on advice, is that the ETS in the current
EU system will not be sufficient. The market of buying and selling,
although progressive and innovative, does not in the end&#151;as it
were&#151;capture the whole problem. As I understand it, that is the
Government&#146;s position. That is certainly my interpretation of
the Committee on Climate Change&#146;s position in its last report at
the end of last year. We need to find ways in which the cost of carbon
is better integrated into business decisions. The Minister very
specifically said that the Government had come to the conclusion that
the ETS does not entirely do that; it is a way of doing that, a
proposed step on the road. There will be a bigger debate about that
issue as more people become aware of the implications.</div>
<a name="10012152000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
was right to say that the ETS was not the only option. Although I
prompted her, I did not hear her say where the Government had a
preference; I am not suggesting that we open up the issue again, but I
would be grateful to be told, in writing if not now, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column393" />Column number: 393</div>about the other options. She has listed two other options: a cap on
emissions of individual power stations and a rising hours limit. I do
not think that I heard her come back to that. If she wants to
intervene, I will be very happy to let her do so for the
record.</div><a name="10012152000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000529"></a>The
Minister of State, Department of Energy and Climate Change (Joan
Ruddock):</b> I was hoping that we might finish this morning;
that is why I suddenly speeded up and tried not to, perhaps, remember
as many questions as I might have. It is not our place at this stage to
look for preferences at all. The burden of my case is that we have the
rolling review and we look at the options as we progress in learning
about CCS. We will then look at what else might be necessary. That will
be the time to look at specific
choices.</div><a name="10012152000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000530"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> That is consistent with what the Minister has
said. I do not accept that a rolling review by 2018 will be sufficient;
it has all sorts of weaknesses in relation to determining the
market&#146;s decisions. I understand the argument, but we could be
much more certain and thereby get much better
outcomes.</div><a name="10012152000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
last group of issues that the Minister raised related to the road map
and its budgets and consequences. She undertook to look at the question
of whether she would put into the public domain the rest of the
correspondence between our Government and the European Commission. It
would obviously be very helpful if she did so. I have shared the parts
of the correspondence that are, perfectly properly, now in the public
domain. The Minister says that there has been a further response, but
we have not seen the reply from the Commission. We would all benefit
from seeing that. I hope that there will not be a row about that, and
that the Minister can facilitate it at the earliest possible
opportunity after Committee
stage.</div><a name="10012152000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
note the intervention of the hon. Member for Southampton, Test, who, as
always, asked pertinent questions. The debate is about how we best end
up with a system that minimises emissions and maximises certainty while
making sure that we incentivise people to find the solution that allows
and does not prevent coal to continue to be used. I think there is
consensus on that. We need a harder view to enable us to drive towards
that conclusion. Industry generally shows itself to be responsive,
given a long enough lead time. There is a competition issue, but, as
most of the consortiums are unlikely to be wholly British or only
British, and as lots of other international companies are
participating, there is an international, not just a national, interest
in our moving as far and as fast as
possible.</div><a name="10012152000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
had a substantial debate this morning, as befits a really important
issue. I accept that the new clause that I and my colleagues have
tabled will have to be modified. Instinctively, I would not want to go
as far as new clauses 2 and 5 unless I was driven to it. However, I am
absolutely clear that it would be much better for the Bill to include a
provision for emissions limits.</div>
<a name="10012152000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we come up
with a different formulation of words, I hope we will be able to
persuade the Minister that a clause on a carbon emissions performance
standard would be acceptable and of benefit. As in other areas, I am
happy to talk to colleagues from other parties and the Government to
see whether we can make some progress between now and Report.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column394" />Column number: 394</div><a name="10012152000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
from the Leader of the House&#146;s business statement that we are
likely to have a couple of weeks before the Bill returns. It was not in
the business announced for next week or the following week, so it
sounds as though we have a clear fortnight before it comes back. That
should give us time to get a substantial amount of work done. I hope
that we will be able to make progress and that the issue under
discussion will be included in the
Bill.</div><a name="10012152000047"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10012152000531"></a><b class="B">Charles
Hendry</b> (Wealden) (Con): We have had a useful debate about
the emissions performance standard. It is important for us to establish
a principle that we are in favour of the ability to introduce an EPS. I
agree with the hon. Gentleman in that respect. The benefit of the
approach that we have taken in new clause 2 is that that can be done
through secondary legislation, rather than through a new Energy Bill or
Act.</div><a name="10012152000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister said earlier that she did not think that the EPS would be good
in relation to encouraging investment. That depends, however, on where
the EPS is set. An EPS set at a level with which industry is
comfortable and that it believes achievable would actually be helpful
to it in its investment discussions. It would know exactly what was
required by 2020, 2025 and 2030. The issue, therefore, is not whether
the EPS encourages investment, but the level at which it would be
set.</div><a name="10012152000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
think that new clause 5 has significant attractions. It also has
significant cross-party support, and there is a basis for developing it
further on Report. As the hon. Member for North Southwark and
Bermondsey does not plan to press his new clause to a vote, I seek your
permission, Mr. Bayley, to press new clause 2. It is
important that we have the chance to say that in principle we support
the idea of an EPS and that Ministers and the Secretary of State should
have the power to put it in place in due
course.</div><a name="10012152000050"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000549"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> We have a number of new clauses left, and I am
keen that we should make as much progress as possible. Under earlier
clauses on fuel poverty, we discussed some of the energy efficiency
issues in great depth. The new clause would introduce a programme to
roll out energy efficiency across the country, which would help people
in homes across the nation. The Government have set a target that all
homes should have cavity wall and loft insulation by 2030.</div>
<a name="10012152000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Prime
Minister announced a year or so ago that the Government intended to get
6 million households insulated between September 2008 and 2011. The
plans that we have seen lack ambition, and the new clause sets out a
much more robust, determined and comprehensive approach. Every home in
the country would have proper 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column397" />Column number: 397</div>insulation, worth up to &#163;6,500, and the onus of repayment would,
fundamentally, stay with the property rather than the
individual.</div>
<a name="10012152000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
we announced the approach a year or so ago, the energy efficiency NGOs,
the fuel poverty NGOs and the energy industry reacted genuinely
positively. The subsequent enthusiasm from high street retailers,
including Marks and Spencer and Tesco, has surprised us. They say that
they want to be actively involved and that they can contribute greatly.
They think that they can bring in new innovative funding mechanisms
that minimise the cost and make the scheme more attractive to
householders. Critically, there are shared systems, which means that
the work is carried out and the benefits of reduced energy bills begin
to accrue to the householder before they have to start to pay for the
work. They would gradually pay for it over 20 to 25
years.</div>
<a name="10012152000486"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div><a name="10012152000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
policy is endorsed by the National Housing Federation, WWF and the
Green Building Council. We have support from the energy companies,
which are keen to be involved, and from high street retailers. It is
important to note that the figure of &#163;6,500 is not going to be
an absolute maximum. That is a figure we have worked on in conjunction
with others, where they have said that that would appear to provide the
right level of insulation for the average home. It would not get a
bad-quality home up to a perfect level but it would move poor-quality
homes up to a good level or beyond, and we think that is
important.</div>
<a name="10012152000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will give
way to the Liberal Democrat spokesman, but I am keen to pick up on
something that he said in earlier proceedings. He
said:</div><a name="10012152000461"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
&#163;6,500-per-dwelling contribution figure is the lowest, which, as
I am sure the hon. Member for Wealden will either confirm or deny, is
the one that the Conservatives still use. The more realistic proposed
and accepted figure is in the order of
&#163;10,000&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,
Energy Public Bill Committee, </i>14 January 2010; c.
209.]</div><a name="10012152000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
came as a bit of a surprise to me, because my recollection of when we
announced this policy was that a similar policy announcement quickly
appeared from the Liberal Democrats. We went back through our records
and came across a February 2009 press release, in the name of the hon.
Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey, entitled &#147;Warm Homes:
an opportunity offered&#148;. It sets out the scheme and
says:</div><a name="10012152000462"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;On
best estimates obtained from the Energy Saving Trust the average cost
will be &#163;5,000 for the installation and an additional
&#163;1,500 for the administrative costs of the survey and the
organisation of the
programme.&#148;</div><a name="10012152000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">His
press release, therefore, said that the figure should be &#163;6,500.
Now we hear that the Liberal Democrats have moved on and that that is
not sufficient. We were intrigued to see the way that story was written
up in the <i class="I">Guardian</i> at the
time.</div><a name="10012152000463"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
the announcement today...Hughes will propose the government
underwrite renovation work worth
&#163;6,500&#148;.</div><a name="10012152000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
said this was a
recommendation</div><a name="10012152000464"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;originally

on:</div><a name="10012152000465"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
fact the policy is a pure copy of the Conservative proposal&#151;down
to the exact figure of &#163;6,500. The Energy Saving Trust

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000551"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> With that understanding, I give way to the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="10012152000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000552"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I have the relevant document and probably even the
press release with me. I remember exactly what we said last February;
it was indeed based on the best advice of &#163;6,500. However, we
have done a lot of work, as a result of which we believe that the
average figure would be higher. In the interests of transparency, we
believe that we need to be clear that the costs will be
higher.</div>
<a name="10012152000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">I asked the
hon. Gentleman a simple, straightforward question: does he have a
figure on advice as to what the average cost of a full energy
efficiency refurbishment programme would be for a property, either in
England or the UK? He has an aspiration that people should be lent
money to achieve energy efficiency, but what rating of energy
efficiency does he have in
mind?</div><a name="10012152000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000553"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> The advice that we have been given is that
&#163;6,500 would move most homes from a poor to a good level. We
have not set a specific standard assessment procedure rating because we
want to be flexible to respond to the needs of individual houses. Once
one starts setting a SAP level that every house must meet, the figure
will not necessarily be one that can be averaged out in that way across
the housing stock.</div>
<a name="10012152000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have been
encouraged that Sam Laidlaw, chief executive of Centrica, has
said:</div><a name="10012152000466"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Green Deal is a bold vision to cut household energy bills and reduce
CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>emissions...As Britain&#146;s largest energy
supplier we are committed to making these proposals work in
practice.&#148;</div><a name="10012152000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
goes on to
say:</div><a name="10012152000467"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Green Deal could require as much as &#163;150 billion of capital by
2020. Energy suppliers such as British Gas would be willing to provide
some of the finance necessary but we believe that if the Green Deal
follows our design, the financial markets will come forward to provide
the capital. In order to ensure the energy bill savings outweigh Green
Deal repayments, it is vital that the interest rate associated with
financing is low. This means minimising the repayment risk and our
paper outlines a range of proposals to enable
this.&#148;</div><a name="10012152000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a great deal of support out there. The basis on which the proposal
has been calculated has not been questioned. There are financial
organisations keen to work with us to develop the detail. All we need
now is the authority for this programme to be rolled out. One of its
most important aspects is that it relates to an individual
property.</div>
<a name="10012152000459"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">One
concern that we have about other approaches, which require the energy
efficiency of the homes of those living in fuel poverty to be improved,
is that the work would be carried out where people were living at that
time, but there would be no guarantee that they would continue to live
there. If a family in fuel poverty were living in privately rented
accommodation, work would be carried out, as legally required, but that
family could move on, and a different family could move in. The other
approach means that, at every single moment, somebody would have to
monitor the family in every 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column399" />Column number: 399</div>single home to see whether they were in fuel poverty and entitled to
support. Therefore, to achieve the change that we are looking for, it
is better for a scheme to run on a household
basis.</div><a name="10012152000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not doubt Ministers&#146; commitment to energy efficiency. I am
not sure which Minister will respond to the new clause&#151;the
Minister of State has a personal commitment to dealing with the issue.
The unsatisfactory aspect is that we seem to lack ambition about what
we can do in this country. We start from the position of being one of
the worst in Europe for the energy efficiency of our housing stock.
There is an element of an accident of geography in that. Had Britain
been further north, we would have had to have such energy efficiency
and insulation measures, otherwise our homes would be too cold in
winter. Had Britain been further south, those measures would not be
necessary. We have an enormous amount to do to catch up with those
countries that have been investing over many years. The Germans, Danes
and others look askance at the appalling energy efficiency of our
homes. We need to show determination to drive change.</div>
<a name="10012152000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause gives the Government the power to start rolling out the
necessary measures. It is an idea whose time has come. We hope that the
Minister will support
us.</div><a name="10012152000101"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10012152000554"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Alan Whitehead</b> (Southampton, Test) (Lab): I should like to
address my remarks to new clause 17. I say in passing that
two other new clauses in the group refer to the essential link between
fuel poverty and household energy efficiency. As far as I can see, new
clause 7&#151;forgive me for saying it in this way&#151;is entirely
stolen from the Fuel Poverty (No. 2) Bill, which I introduced last
spring. That may be accidental but a small footnote would be
nice.</div>
<a name="10012152000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 3,
as the hon. Member for Wealden suggested, requires something like
&#163;150 billion, which I think is the lowest estimate, to
underwrite the programme. Among other problems, it would not
necessarily deal with those households in fuel poverty. It may have the
opposite effect. I want to be brief this afternoon as I recognise that
we have a lot of business to get through before we finish.</div>
<a name="10012152000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">My new clause
makes the direct connection between fuel poverty and energy efficiency
energy in homes in terms of an offer made to households in fuel poverty
by those bodies required under the scheme to provide assistance to
them, and requiring part of that assistance to be energy efficiency
measures. That is important as it is clear that there is a close
correlation between those in fuel poverty and those in houses with a
low SAP
rating.</div><a name="10012152000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Almost
40 per cent. of those in fuel poverty live in houses with a SAP rating
under 30. Over 80 per cent. of the fuel-poor live in properties with a
SAP rating below 50. Conversely, once a property reaches a SAP rating
of 65 or above, which is where energy performance certificate band C
mentioned in new clause 7 comes in, it is extremely unlikely that any
householder living in it would have to spend more than 10 per cent. of
their income on fuel. The correlation is clear.</div>
<a name="10012152000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">While it is
true that not everybody who is fuel-poor lives in a house with a low
SAP rating, or that everybody who lives in a house with a low SAP
rating is fuel-poor, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column400" />Column number: 400</div>if one goes to a property that has a low SAP rating, one is quite likely
to find someone who is also fuel-poor living in it. Therefore, when
assistance is given under the scheme for those people who are in fuel
poverty, the requirement to include an element of fuel efficiency in
the offer means inevitably that that property&#146;s SAP rating will
be increased. The likelihood of that family&#146;s being in fuel
poverty will be lessened over time.</div>
<a name="10012152000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the SAP
rating of properties across the UK is 65 or above, one can effectively
say that it is unlikely in general that people will be in fuel poverty.
Clearly, that has to be the target over the medium to long term.
Although the Government have made extraordinary strides to increase the
energy efficiency of properties in the UK, and the average SAP rating
of properties in the UK has risen over the last few years as a result,
that outcome is still a little way off. We know that fuel poverty is
linked to the energy efficiency of the house, so including a
requirement that the energy efficiency of that house should rise over
time so that it is eventually within the range of SAP 65 would ensure
that fuel poverty was all but extinguished for UK
households.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000555"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I, too, am keen that we should have a chance to
debate the groups of new clauses so that we can complete our business
in time. I will not go over the ground again that we covered when we
put forward our proposals the other day. I simply ask the hon. Member
for Wealden to be more precise about how the funding mechanism would
work. Obviously, we are talking of a ballpark figure of more than
&#163;100 billion. The scheme has to start somewhere. The idea is
that the payback is attached to the electricity bill of the property.
Clearly, there needs to be some funding upfront. I am keen to hear him
elaborate on who lends the money. Will it all come from the utilities
companies? Will it come from the partners he has talked about? What is
the division? Is there any underwriting? What are the guarantees? We
need a bit more meat on the bone to be persuaded that this is a
credible
system.</div><a name="10012152000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000556"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> No set funding scheme is necessary. The companies
are keen to develop their own funding aspects and are trying to see how
they can make this scheme work best for them, too. Our initial
intention was that the onus would be on the energy
companies&#151;they would have to borrow. There might then have
needed to be an element of Government guarantee for that borrowing so
it did not conflict with the building of new plant and infrastructure.
Subsequently people have come forward and told us that they are talking
to organisations in the City and that they can fund this on a long-term
loan basis. They are happy to do it on that basis, so we do not think
it is necessary to have a single prescriptive scheme; the largest
companies in the country believe that it is workable and that they can
fund
it.</div><a name="10012152000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000557"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> With respect, I do not think that that quite
works. New clause 3(1)
says:</div><a name="10012152000468"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State may by regulations introduce a scheme whereby every
household shall have an entitlement for household energy efficiency
measures.&#148;</div><a name="10012152000460"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">That
means a right. If there is a right it means that everybody could in
theory on day one say, &#147;I want my energy efficiency
measures.&#148; That therefore has to be backed up by a system of
financing because it cannot be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column401" />Column number: 401</div>done without the necessary funding. A suck-it-and-see answer is not
sufficient here. If the new clause said &#147;shall have a potential
opportunity&#148;, that would be something else, but an entitlement
is a different kettle of
fish.</div><a name="10012152000487"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000558"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> Would the hon. Gentleman care to raise the
question of whether the savings that would result from energy
efficiency measures of &#163;6,500 per house could be entirely
funded, considering the interest that will arise, at a reasonable rate,
from that &#163;6,500 over time, by the difference between the
savings the householder might make and the money the administering body
may take? Would the householder&#146;s bill be genuinely reduced? If
that is not the case, the proposal will simply not
work.</div><a name="10012152000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000559"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I note and respect the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
inquiry. He has posed a similar question to me. The Minister replied
that because the issue is so important, we need a pilot scheme and we
need to make sure that the sums work. The hon. Member for Wealden needs
to answer the question put by the hon. Member for Southampton, Test.
Such a scheme is not credible unless it guarantees that the addition of
the energy bill as reduced by the energy efficiency measures plus the
payback is less than people will be paying. That is a key
issue.</div><a name="10012152000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are two areas of common ground, and other areas of difference, between
the hon. Member for Wealden and me. First, we think the system should
attach to the property, not the person. If the property changes hands,
it is much more manageable in Britain to track properties than people.
That is therefore the right system. Secondly, we think that there
should be a scheme. Beyond that, we are in the area of debate and
competition. We know that the Government have their great British
refurb programme ready in the wings for the final proof-read by
Ministers. We hope the Minister will say that we will see it before
Report. We discussed it the other day and the Ministers tried to be
helpful; it would be nice if they could be really helpful today and
say, &#147;Yes, we&#146;ve signed it off. It will be coming down
the track and the Secretary of State will be on his hind legs in the
Chamber announcing it next week or the week after, which means that we
are guaranteed to get it.&#148; I am being light-hearted, but I am
serious about the need for it. It would be nonsense for us to debate
how we deal with the issues without the Government
plan.</div><a name="10012152000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
support new clause 17, which was tabled by the hon. Member for
Southampton, Test and his colleagues. It would make sure that the
scheme is not just a payback, but a wide range of energy efficient
measures to be offered in schemes for reducing fuel poverty. We had
part of that discussion the other day. It is clearly a step in the
right direction and I hope that the Government will be sympathetic
towards
it.</div><a name="10012152000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman merits much more than a footnote in relation to new
clauses 7 and 8. I intended to say, without any prompting, that both
new clauses have considerable parliamentary progeny, because they have
appeared elsewhere. They appeared in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
presentation Bill, for example, and my hon. Friend the Member for
Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) was using the same song sheet
when he introduced his 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column402" />Column number: 402</div>private Member&#146;s Bill last year, which, all too sadly, the
Government blocked. I give credit to the hon. Member for Southampton,
Test for the work that he has done and for suggesting the idea. It is
absolutely not meant to be unattributed. To be fair, he and I and
others benefit from work done by people outside the House who seek to
come up with schemes that might find favour with Ministers. The scheme
in new clauses 7 and 8 is one of
them.</div><a name="10012152000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Government will be favourably disposed towards new
clauses 7 and 8, because they have a common, cross-party heritage. Not
only are we trying to make sure that there is a whole-house
package&#151;to use the summary phrase&#151;but that there are then
regular reports. We need to see progress on the issue, because systems
may need to be tweaked and adjusted, there may need to be greater
incentives, and more money may need to be put in the kitty. We are
committed to a scheme, the ballpark nature of which I set out the other
day. The hon. Member for Wealden has presented the Conservative scheme
and will answer in a second the question of exactly how we deal with
the entitlement question when no money is guaranteed in the kitty.
I still do not understand how there can be entitlement in
that situation. I hope that the Under-Secretary will reply positively
to the concept, and bring us up to date since last week, by telling us

will appear any day

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000560"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change
(Mr. David Kidney):</b> It is a pleasure to welcome
you back, Mr. Bayley, to your position overseeing our
deliberations.</div><a name="10012152000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Across
the parties, we share the ambition for our country to do much better at
making our built environment energy efficient. Although today&#146;s
debate will be about domestic properties, it applies equally to
commercial and non-domestic properties. It makes sense in terms of
hitting our targets for tackling climate change, and in terms of our
energy security and fairness for citizens and affordable prices, which
is particularly on our minds as we debate fuel-poverty measures in the
group of new
clauses.</div><a name="10012152000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 3 would give the Secretary of State the power to introduce a
scheme giving every household an entitlement to energy efficiency
measures, with repayment charges added to their bills. This is not my
answer to the debate, but at one level everyone is already entitled to
access a subsidised offer for energy efficiency measures under the
supplier obligation. Since the beginning of the energy efficiency
commitment in April 2002, the supplier obligation has delivered 3.4
million cavity wall insulations and 3.6 million professional loft
insulations. We have already committed to insulating all lofts and
cavity walls where practicable by 2015&#151;not 2030 as the hon.
Member for Wealden said. We also intend to support a whole-house
package for 7 million homes by 2020. Financing those measures is
critical to their success, and to encourage take-up of the energy
efficiency measures available and to test various financing models, we
launched the home energy pay as you save pilots on 7 December. Through
those pilots, we aim to assess consumer interest in pay as you save
finance and identify the best delivery mechanisms, including the
repayment route. Another important consideration is the extent to which
finance 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column403" />Column number: 403</div>packages will be appropriate to support low-income and vulnerable
customers, particularly the fuel-poor. It behoves us to give particular
attention to ensuring that people who cannot afford the payments are
not overlooked in the delivery of the
service.</div><a name="10012152000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 7 would require the Government to introduce a scheme offering
whole-house packages of energy efficiency and heating measures to
fuel-poor households. A combination of supplier obligations mandated by
the Government&#151;the carbon emissions reduction target, for
example&#151;and public expenditure programmes such as Warm Front
have formed the backbone of our fuel-poverty strategy, and work is
under way on a household energy management strategy, which will build
on the current range of programmes to take us through to 2020. I am
afraid that I cannot give the hon. Member for North Southwark and
Bermondsey a date, nor can I say precisely in which week the matter
will be dealt with, but progress has been made since I last reported to
the Committee. We have all heard the announcement for the next two
weeks&#146; business in the Chamber, and the Bill does not feature. I
am thus on good course to ensure that Members will see the strategy
before Report, but I am not able to give that
commitment.</div><a name="10012152000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000561"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> That was helpful. We are encouraged, but we await
the
date.</div><a name="10012152000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Under-Secretary made a point about the pilot scheme. Does the work done
by the Building Research Establishment and others not already produce a
lot of the evidence needed to answer the sort of question that the hon.
Member for Southampton, Test asked about the benefit of certain types
of insulation and the money saved by an average family? I know that the
BRE has had a family of four&#151;two adults and two
children&#151;living in several of its houses to test average use for
different
materials.</div><a name="10012152000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000562"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I would be diverted slightly by answering that
intervention, but I will. BRE is doing excellent work to devise the
kinds of technologies&#151;or accrediting, or identifying them for
us&#151;that will help us to tackle the so-called hard to treat
properties, such as those with solid walls, and the components that we
would need in a whole-house package to get the kind of SAP ratings that
hon. Members, including my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton,
Test, have pressed on Ministers today and in the past. That work is
very valuable and will feed into the final conclusions for a programme
to make energy efficiency universal in our built environment&#151;in
properties.</div>
<a name="10012152000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">CERT will
remain a key component of our strategy. Forty per cent. of CERT
activity now must be delivered to low-income or vulnerable households.
Many such householders have benefited from insulation for little or no
cost as a result. It is estimated that between 2008 and 2011,
approximately &#163;1.9 billion of the total &#163;3.2 billion
invested in CERT will be directed to households in the priority group.
That is why we are currently consulting on an extension of CERT and,
within it, a new super-priority group, with an obligation during the
CERT extension period to 2012 to identify those in particular need due
to fuel poverty who ought to have help through the CERT
programme.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column404" />Column number: 404</div><a name="10012152000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s Warm Front scheme has assisted nearly 2.1 million
homes in England since 2000, with energy efficiency and central heating
improvements bringing average reductions in fuel bills for those helped
of &#163;300 or more each year. Additional funding announced in the
recent pre-Budget report will take the total allocation to &#163;1.1
billion over the current spending period up to
2011.</div>
<a name="10012152000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000563"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> Can the Minister confirm that actually the Warm
Front budget was cut and has now been largely restored to &#163;1.1
billion? It is not an increase to &#163;1.1 billion; it is a
restoration of cuts the Government have
made.</div>
<a name="10012152000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000564"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> No, that is a shocking representation of the
reality. The three-year settlement for Warm Front was extremely
generous, far exceeding any previous funding. However, because of the
pressures on the Budget and the needs of an impending and then growing
recession to keep workers in jobs we spent more money in years 1 and 2
than the profiled spending would otherwise have taken. That left year 3
looking sick, with just &#163;195 million left from that record
spending. I am eternally grateful to the Chancellor for being brave
enough, in the middle of a very difficult economic crisis, to be able
to find &#163;150 million more for Warm Front when it was very
difficult for him to do so. It is a mark of the man that he found the
money that was needed.</div>
<a name="10012152000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our view is
that there can be no one-size-fits-all approach for delivering those
ambitions, especially given the wide variation in housing, tenure and
the socio-economic characteristics of households. That is why we are
trialling various new approaches; for example, the community energy
saving programme.</div>
<a name="10012152000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition
to attacking the issue of energy efficiency, tackling fuel poverty
requires us to have regard to household incomes and the prices that
people pay. I do not want to remind the House again, at great length,
of the measures we are taking in those areas, but for incomes winter
fuel payments and cold weather payments are clearly of great assistance
to people in fuel poverty, as are other measures from the Government,
such as working tax credit, child tax credit, child benefit and pension
credit.</div>
<a name="10012152000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
feature of household income is the ability to help people to claim the
benefits to which they are entitled. Benefit entitlement checks are a
very important component under Warm Front and a very important
component of our thinking for the schemes we are devising. Under Warm
Front, for example, every applicant to the scheme is offered a benefit
entitlement check. In 2008-9, 78,000 checks were completed. In more
than 40 per cent. of those cases additional benefits were
identified, resulting in an average weekly increase in household income
of
&#163;31.</div><a name="10012152000488"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45
pm</div><a name="10012152000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other element concerns prices and, again, I do not wish to repeat
matters we have previously debated. However, I remind hon. Members that
for three years the voluntary agreement is delivering consumer support
in the prices that people pay for their electricity and gas, and other
measures that we heard the energy companies 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column405" />Column number: 405</div>describe. We are taking that forward in the Bill to make social price
support mandatory in the future for a larger number of
recipients.</div>
<a name="10012152000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my list
shows, we are working across all three drivers of fuel poverty. Where
appropriate, we are looking at ways to tie together the different
strands.</div>
<a name="10012152000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
brings me to new clause 8, in terms of reports to Parliament. The
Government have no objection to making timely reports about progress on
each item they are dealing with, but there are already a number of such
reports. For example, CERT has several layers of reporting and
evaluation; Ofgem reports annually on the suppliers&#146;
contributions to the voluntary agreement and we publish official annual
fuel poverty statistics. Going forward, effective monitoring and
reporting will be a central pillar of our work to deliver the household
sector carbon budgets to 2020 and beyond.</div>
<a name="10012152000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition
to all that, we have already established the independent monitoring
arrangements through the Committee on Climate Change, which now
publishes a high-profile report each year on the performance of the
Department&#146;s policies. I would like to say to Members interested
in the reporting aspect that I am happy to think about new ways to
deliver adequate transparency and accountability, but I do not think we
should put in place the reporting at this stage, when we have not yet
settled the UK&#146;s strategy for the work we are to do. We ought to
consider it as part of what we do and perhaps bring in some of the
things I have described, rather than duplicate or add to the
bureaucratic burden of those who have the responsibility of
reporting.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000565"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I understand the logic of the timetable the hon.
Gentleman proposes. Two things would be really helpful: to have an
annual occasion when people could see the report on all the
schemes&#151;or one scheme, whichever it happens to be&#151;and to
have a document that collected progress in each of the four home
countries. When we asked the other day about figures elsewhere, they
were clearly not as easy to find in some cases as one would wish. If we
are looking at the UK&#146;s international responsibilities, seeing
figures arranged by the separate internal countries put together, would
allow far better assessment of relative progress in each of the four
countries.</div><a name="10012152000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000566"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I am not resistant to any of that. We have
reporting impositions already. For example, on fuel poverty there is
the annual fuel poverty report from the Fuel Poverty Advisory Group to
which the Government publish an annual response. The Committee on
Climate Change, as we have seen, is to make an annual report to
Parliament, to which the Government will deliver to Parliament and the
Committee a formal response. Those mechanisms already exist. I am
willing to arrange, either in those mechanisms or in a new one, the
same kind of arrangements for a major programme for this
country to make its building stock more energy
efficient.</div><a name="10012152000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
turn to new clause 17, proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for
Southampton, Test. I share his ambitions but I do not want to tie the
social price support measures in the Bill to the more pressing and
major requirement for the country to deliver universal improvements in
the energy efficiency of our housing stock. The new social price
support will play a specific role in providing direct 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column406" />Column number: 406</div>financial help with the cost of energy for vulnerable consumers.
Although some benefits other than direct financial ones should be
allowed under the scheme, social price support must predominantly focus
on ensuring that suppliers provide financial assistance towards the
cost of household energy bills.</div>
<a name="10012152000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is not
to say that our energy efficiency policies, particularly those targeted
at the fuel-poor, should not be joined up with our social price support
policy. That is why, for example, subject to meeting any necessary data
protection requirements, suppliers should be able to use the
information and data they have on households receiving social price
support to identify those eligible for measures under CERT. We do not,
however, need additional powers to introduce
that.</div><a name="10012152000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have said a little about each of the individual proposed new clauses
and have talked about the work that we are doing on fuel poverty, which
I believe shows that we are doing all that is reasonably practicable to
tackle fuel poverty, having put in place an extensive programme of
works across all three drivers. I have explained that we plan to link
our energy efficiency measures for the fuel-poor to our work on social
price support in the ways that I described. I have outlined the reasons
why our social price support policy must remain predominantly focused
on helping most of the most vulnerable with their energy
bills.</div><a name="10012152000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
I restate our commitment to the proper monitoring and reporting of our
schemes, and I have given examples of work that we already do. I ask
hon. Members not to press the new clauses to a vote, but to join us in
making the most successful scheme that we can when we have all the
evidence for the UK-wide national strategy, to greatly improve the
energy efficiency of our entire built
environment.</div>
<a name="10012152000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000567"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for his
response to the arguments so far and for the detail that he has gone
into. What comes through clearly is the desperate need for a strategy.
At the moment, we have a range of schemes, some of which work well and
some of which work poorly. They need to be brought together into a
system that can be widely understood by the people who will be
affected. If we went into the street and said, &#147;What do you know
about the community energy saving programme, CERT and Warm
Front?&#148;, overwhelmingly, people, particularly those in fuel
poverty, would say, &#147;I&#146;ve never heard of them. I
don&#146;t know what they&#146;re about and I don&#146;t know how
to access them&#148;. A readily understandable system is
crucial.</div>
<a name="10012152000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">I emphasise
the point made by the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey
about the imperative need for the Government to publish the strategy
before Report. I know that the Under-Secretary is not in charge of
timetabling, but the Government are. They were in charge of deciding
when we went into Committee. They are in charge of deciding when we
will get to Report and they are in charge of publishing the document. I
will write to the Speaker to say that in the event of the plan not
being published, I hope that he will refuse to allow the Report stage,
because that document sounds so important to the consideration of the
Bill. It would be a discourtesy to the House if it was not available
for consideration at that time. I know that is a strong expression, but
we need to understand the Government&#146;s wider strategy in detail
before we consider the Bill further.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column407" />Column number: 407</div><a name="10012152000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">There have
been discussions about the schemes being proposed. The Under-Secretary
said that we need to ensure that people who cannot afford to make the
payment are not excluded. The key to the scheme&#146;s working is the
principle that the payment should be less than the savings made. That
should help to answer the point made by the hon. Member for
Southampton, Test. People would inspect the house and then assess where
there would be reasonable savings in the amount of electricity or gas
being used and, therefore, where the saving would be greater than the
cost spread over a period of
time.</div><a name="10012152000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to the point made by the hon. Member for North Southwark and
Bermondsey, we started by thinking that the obligation would be on the
energy companies, but companies from the energy sector, retailers, the
financial sector and elsewhere are now all saying that they want to
work to make the scheme possible. They want to use their particular
expertise to make schemes different from those that might be offered by
others. There is a real desire to offer competition. People might be
able to go to a range of different providers to get the work to which
they were entitled carried out on their homes. We want to end up with a
range of providers, so people can see who can carry out the work, who
they trust most and what the financial regime is. The scheme will only
work&#151;this is its fundamental building block&#151;if the
savings continue to be greater than the
cost.</div>
<a name="10012152000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000568"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> Is the suggestion that, following an
inspection, only energy efficiency measures that could be profitable,
in terms of the person&#146;s energy bills, would be countenanced?
Would those items that proved not to be profitable simply not be
done?</div>
<a name="10012152000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000569"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> No, that is not the case. One would look at the
totality of the measures to be put in place. The total would have to
deliver greater savings than the measures cost, or else it would not be
an attractive package to the person living in the property. There might
be a big gain from one measure, such as roof insulation, and that would
enable other measures to be included, which would still keep the cost
within &#163;6,500. The guarantee would be that the saving has to be
greater than the cost. It is encouraging how many companies are keen to
help to develop the detail of the scheme and make sure that it is
something that they are happy to roll out in their
name.</div><a name="10012152000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000570"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> If anybody wanted to exercise their entitlement,
what would be in place to guarantee that they could get the
&#163;6,500 from the day they did
that?</div><a name="10012152000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000571"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> There is nothing that says that the entitlement
would be from day one; the details would set out the relevant period.
Clearly, there simply are not the skills available to roll this out
nationwide in a couple of months. There would have to be some degree of
processing to make sure that it could be done in an orderly and
sensible way. There would be some early adopters who were keen to have
it done; there would be others who would be less keen and would want to
see how it worked for their neighbours before doing it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column408" />Column number: 408</div>themselves. So this programme would be rolled out over a period of
years, perhaps up to 2020. This is not an entitlement about which on
day one, everyone can say, &#147;Here is my entitlement. I want to
have
this.&#148;</div><a name="10012152000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000572"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> A rolling
entitlement.</div><a name="10012152000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000573"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> Absolutely.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000575"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> The hon. Lady sneers, but instead of doing 7
million houses by 2020, this would do the entire housing stock by then.
I hope that she will recognise the difference in ambition between what
she advocates for her constituents and what we
advocate.</div><a name="10012152000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000576"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman not accept that as this
is an offer and an entitlement the question of who takes it up could be
very important? If the hon. Gentleman&#146;s sums are correct, it is
highly likely that those who would take up the offer would be those who
could more or less afford it in the first place. Those people in fuel
poverty or close to it, who would have difficulty in contemplating how
this all works, would probably not take up the offer. Yes, it would be
an improvement for certain houses, but it would probably not increase
the SAP ratings of the houses of those in fuel
poverty.</div><a name="10012152000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000577"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> On this rare occasion, the hon. Gentleman is
absolutely wrong. The important aspect is that people would be able to
make their evaluation about whether the provision worked for them;
critically, they would have to know that the saving was going to be
greater than the cost. If they were going to make a saving of
&#163;300 or &#163;400 a year on their electricity and gas bills
and the measure would cost &#163;300 a year, even for those in fuel
poverty it would be easy to decide to make that happen.</div>
<a name="10012152000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Above all, we
want to use this provision to help people in fuel poverty. This is not
the only measure; we are not saying that we should scrap everything
else and just do this. There will be a range of other measures, and we
would agree with the Government about the validity and importance of
some of them. This measure is one of a number of ways to tackle the
problem.</div><a name="10012152000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that Labour Members will take note of the fact that huge
organisations that do not take these decisions lightly&#151;Marks and
Spencer, Tesco and the energy companies&#151;believe that the measure
will work for consumers and for them as well. At the end of the day,
this will work for people in that it will deliver a greater saving than
the cost involved.</div>
<a name="10012152000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">What it all
comes back to is ambition. The hon. Member for Islington, South and
Finsbury, who sneers from her large house in
Islington&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>Sorry, I thought that people
who were married to QCs lived in large houses in Islington. She will be
aware that the Government&#146;s ambition is 7 million homes by 2020.
Ours is for the entire nation to be sorted out in that time&#151;a
much greater ambition.</div>

Mike Weir</b> (Angus) (SNP): As I understand the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s scheme, the repayment will be made through energy
bills, but if it is over 20 or 25 years, how does that fit with the
right to switch suppliers? How will that be dealt with under his
scheme?</div><a name="10012152000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000579"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> The scheme will be done in such a way that the
payment for those who switch suppliers will continue to be made through
the bill to whoever has carried out the work on their behalf. That
straightforward element would be included in the bill; although people
could switch, they could not get out of that obligation. As the hon.
Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey was saying the other day,
there might be a case in which when somebody sold their home, the
remaining part of the bill was paid off, so that that aspect would be
sorted out. That detail, however, can be developed in due

issue comes back to ambition. We want a comprehensive programme that
addresses the inadequacies of energy efficiency in this

of support in business, among consumer groups and among those who are
concerned about fuel poverty. We have been working through the detail
with them and no one has said that the proposal has a fundamental flaw
and cannot work. There is a principle and a desire to raise the level
of
ambition.</div><a name="10012152000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister says that the Government are doing all that is reasonably
practical to tackle fuel poverty. Under this Government&#146;s watch
in recent years, since the Prime Minister came to power, the numbers in
fuel poverty have been increasing inexorably. There is virtually no
prospect of reaching the Government&#146;s targets for removing
vulnerable households from fuel poverty by 2010. The targets for 2016
look pretty challenging as
well.</div><a name="10012152000155"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10012152000580"></a><b class="B">Paddy

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000581"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> The target for 2010 looks virtually unachievable,
because of what has happened over time. The Government have failed to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000594"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="10012152000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause covers a ring-fenced issue. However, it reverts to the
practice, structure, operation, popularity and effectiveness of the
regulator. My belief that the regulator is not a great friend of the
consumer is on the record; I do not resile from it. The implementation
of the new clause would be a very positive step to improve the chance
of the regulator becoming more respected and valued by
consumers.</div>
<a name="10012152000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause proposes an amendment to the Utilities Act 2000 that would
improve the regulator&#146;s governance and board by requiring it to
have a majority of lay persons as members. It would also require it to
have a lay chair and to hold its meetings in public, except when
commercially sensitive information was being discussed. That would help
ensure that Ofgem fulfilled its primary objective of protecting
consumers, which is what it says on the tin. The new clause would also
ensure that Ofgem offered more effective consumer representation and
transparency in its decision-making at the highest level.</div>
<a name="10012152000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Which? is a
well respected and popular consumer organisation that stands up for
consumers. Its experience of other regulators, such as the Food
Standards Agency and the Legal Services Board, has shown that a lay
independent majority helps to drive accountability and better outcomes
for consumers. We can discuss how to define &#147;lay member&#148;.
In the new clause, a lay member is defined as
someone</div><a name="10012152000469"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;who
has been independent from the energy industry, the government and civil
service interaction with the energy sector for a period of at least
five
years.&#148;</div><a name="10012152000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Government have a better definition, I am entirely open to
discussing it between now and Report. The proposal, however, stands as
an absolute win-win; if the Government resist it, they will be being
conservative. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column411" />Column number: 411</div>I hope that the Minister can be positive. Ofgem needs rescuing from
being seen as principally looking after the industry and being too
close to the Government. If it were given the ability to speak for the
consumer, that would make a significant difference and would be a
popular move. I hope that the Government see the merit of the new
clause.</div><a name="10012152000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000595"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I am very sorry that I rise to disappoint the
hon. Gentleman, because I understand very much where he is coming from.
We all share the desire that Ofgem be seen to be on the side of the
consumer, because that is clearly where it is supposed to
be.</div><a name="10012152000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause would require the chairman of Ofgem and a majority of the
board to be lay members, and it would also require the board to meet in
public unless considering commercially-sensitive information. The
provisions seek to ensure that Ofgem is a consumer-focused body and is
transparent in its decision-making. Those are, of course, aims with
which the Government sympathise, and which they seek to reflect in the
current regulatory regime. Ofgem&#146;s principal objective is to
protect consumers, and it will remain
so.</div><a name="10012152000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
achieve that aim, Ofgem clearly needs people on its board who
understand the consumer perspective. In the last recruitment exercise
in 2008 we appointed two new board members with a background in
consumer issues, including the chief executive of Citizen&#146;s
Advice. It is important to note, however, that Ofgem regulates a vital
sector within the economy and the decisions it takes are often highly
complex, covering issues such as price controls for the monopoly
network businesses, and licence modifications that affect the various
industry codes that are crucial to the smooth running of energy
markets. It therefore needs a broad range of skills and experience on
its board, including people with not only energy industry and consumer
backgrounds, but skills in and experience of law, economics and
regulation, finance and audit, and wider commercial
areas.</div><a name="10012152000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do not object in principle to the chair of Ofgem or a majority of its
board being lay members as described by the new clause, but the crucial
criterion in appointing members is that they should have the necessary
expertise and competence to consider the often complex matters that the
board is required to consider and decide. To require that the chair and
most members of the board be lay persons with no recent experience of
the energy industry or of energy issues through the Government or the
civil service, could seriously narrow the field of available and
interested candidates to the extent that we might have difficulty in
appointing suitable people. That would adversely affect Ofgem&#146;s
ability to regulate
effectively.</div><a name="10012152000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is, of course, vital that Ofgem regulate the markets in an unbiased
way, and both the Government and Ofgem go to considerable lengths to
address potential conflicts of interest. We consider that major issue
during the recruitment process, and otherwise well-qualified candidates
have not been appointed because of that. Ofgem will exclude any board
members from discussion of an issue if there could be a conflict of
interest.</div><a name="10012152000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
considering future appointments, we will continue to look at the wide
range of experience and skills, including experience of consumer
issues, that Ofgem needs, but putting constraints on the background of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column412" />Column number: 412</div>board members could adversely affect our ability to ensure that the
board is made up of people with the broad range of skills and quality
of leadership it needs to regulate
effectively.</div><a name="10012152000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning
to the other requirement&#151;that the authority should hold its
board meetings in public where possible&#151;I again sympathise with
the underlying aim that the regulator should be transparent. Ofgem has
taken steps to improve transparency by holding one board meeting a year
in public, and that is welcome.</div>
<a name="10012152000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">In practice,
however, almost all of Ofgem&#146;s board discussions are
commercially sensitive. Many of its decisions are also market sensitive
and hence covered by stock exchange rules on announcements. There is
relatively little, therefore, that would be suitable for discussion in
an open meeting. The changes proposed by the hon. Gentleman would
simply lead to the creation of expectations that could not be met.
Meetings could be open on only a small proportion of occasions, and
probably only a small proportion of any agenda of any meeting could be
made open to the public. Therefore, it is unlikely that this would do
very much to improve transparency. For the reasons outlined, and on
this occasion with some regret, I urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw
the
amendment.</div><a name="10012152000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000596"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> That was a very unsatisfactory response. I
understand that the Minister was trying to let me and the Committee
down gently by saying how much she regrets this, but she read the case
for the secret, closed cabal of the self-interested. That is exactly
what she put to us. I have to say, with respect, that the argument she
made&#151;put two people on the board who have experience of consumer
interests&#151;is almost tokenistic. Whatever the best intentions,
the majority of people on the board would come with an industry
background, focus and involvement.</div>
<a name="10012152000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
went on to say that the industry is highly complex and therefore no one
else can understand it. I have to say that I have met many people in
Britain who are capable of understanding highly complex things, and who
may not come from a particular sector. They are often called on by
Government, from their list of the great and the good and others, to
apply their skills in an area where they have not traditionally worked.
That is what Governments have always done&#151;Governments of all
persuasions.</div>
<a name="10012152000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
said that there is a need for a broad mix of skills. Of course there
is, and that absolutely does not contradict our proposal. A broad mix
of skills means that there are people with experience of&#151;she
cited five qualifications&#151;the law, economics, regulatory
practices and financial audit. It is entirely possible. It is not
impossible to find people in all those sectors who do not come from the
energy industry, the Government or the civil service. I just do not
believe that that would pose a difficulty&#151;it has not in the
other examples I gave&#151;and that is not the experience of those
who deal with such things all the time. The Minister defies logic to
say that the UK does not have, among its more than 60 million people,
the people from other sectors who have the skills to do the
job.</div>
<a name="10012152000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000597"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I wish to intervene only on the point where the
hon. Gentleman said that he had given other examples, because the
examples he gave are not comparable. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column413" />Column number: 413</div>To cite Which? is in no way comparable to citing an independent
regulator that has enormous potential effects on commercial
markets.</div>
<a name="10012152000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000598"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> The examples I gave were the Food Standards Agency
and the Legal Services Commission. They both do jobs that involve a
considerable amount of complex work, and both have a large range of
skilled people. They have both been changed relatively recently, as I
understand it, from the tradition of a non-consumer majority. I have
not heard a criticism that suggests they are doing a less good job now.
Indeed, the Government say that they are doing a better job now. The
Minister needs to look again at the practice of other agencies where
the regulator&#146;s composition has been changed to reflect, and
have more people from, the consumer sector.</div>
<a name="10012152000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have to say
that I am completely unpersuaded. Of course this is a complex area and
of course the energy industry is fundamentally important. However,
there are plenty of people in the industry who can put the case, as
they do in any complex area of activity. Many MPs do not have such
skills, but we are called on to make decisions on the basis of the
evidence and advice given to us.</div>
<a name="10012152000490"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div><a name="10012152000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000599"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> The hon. Gentleman asked me to look and think
again, which I am more than happy to do, but I think he is seeking a
majority of lay members. From my understanding of the needs of the
board, it would be a complete misjudgment to suggest that a majority of
lay people could do the jobs required. The hon. Gentleman may be
correct in saying that perhaps more than two would be a good idea, and
I would not demur from
that.</div><a name="10012152000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000600"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I hope there is no misunderstanding between the
Minister and me. I am not suggesting by &#147;lay&#148; people with
no qualifications, A-levels, degrees or academic qualifications. They
can be lay in this context, but still be lawyers, economists, or people
with a regulatory, audit or financial background. I am not seeking to
say that such people are not lay. I am saying that there should be
people who do not come with an energy involvement or close liaison with
energy, so that they can look at the situation from the point of view
of the consumer&#151;the majority of us, who are not energy experts
but who consume the products for which these people regulate the price,
tariffs and all the other things we have
discussed.</div><a name="10012152000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause contains two proposals: on the composition of the board and
on the nature of the meetings. Of course, there will be matters that
are price-sensitive and that need to be dealt with in private because
they are stock market-sensitive, and there may be more than in many
business activities. The Minister will know that&#151;be it local
government, health trusts or other regulatory bodies&#151;people can
order into public agendas and confidential elements. It may be that
some agendas involve significant discussion that is price-sensitive,
and that would have to take place behind closed doors. The presumption
should be that the boards are open to the public. One open meeting a
year can often be a tokenistic attempt to placate people when they
know, as everybody does, that all the other meetings are in
secret.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column414" />Column number: 414</div><a name="10012152000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was disappointed that the Minister did not even say, &#147;I am
sympathetic. I do not think we can go as far as the hon. Gentleman
wants us to, but we are willing to go some of the way. We are willing
to come back with a new clause on Report that says a third, or perhaps
an additional three members, will be lay members.&#148; I have not
heard any such response. I have heard the Minister say, &#147;We have
done a bit and for the moment that is sufficient.&#148; The
Government would do everybody a service by adopting a more
consumer-focused view in this area. In the end, we would get a much
more positive view about Ofgem, and I have no reason to believe we
would not get a much more effective Ofgem as a
result.</div><a name="10012152000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000601"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I happily say that I have heard the case the hon.
Gentleman has made. Of course, we do have the power to
recruit&#151;as and when appropriate, as seen by Government&#151;in
liaison with Ofgem. I do not see the need for a new clause&#151;I
certainly reject the one he is putting forward&#151;because we have
the powers and ability to do what he suggests, if we
wish.</div><a name="10012152000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000602"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I hear what the Minister says. Prompted by that I
will ask her one question, as I am obviously not managing to persuade
her with the new clause tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for
Harrogate and Knaresborough and me. Will she at least be willing before
Report to meet Which?&#151;formerly the Consumers
Association&#151;which has experience of persuading government in
other sectors to change the nature of the regulatory authorities in
entirely beneficial ways? If she accepted that as a reasonable next
step, that would be something. I would still be minded to press the new
clause to a vote, Mr. Bayley, but at least she would be
accommodating the possibility of hearing the argument and responding
more positively the next time the issue is put to
her.</div><a name="10012152000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000603"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> For the record, Mr. Bayley, I
mentioned two lay appointments that we have made that may indicate the
direction in which things are moving. In fact, three of the eight
non-executive directors are lay people at present. I am certainly
willing to have a&#151;not too lengthy&#151;meeting with
Which?</div><a name="10012152000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000604"></a>Simon

suggesting that it need be a lengthy meeting.</div>
<a name="10012152000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr.

about the Gas Act 1986 and new clause 11 is about the Electricity Act
1989. They would amend those two Acts to change the rules about the
process for the modification of licences. The current position is that
Ofgem regulates the activity of the gas and electricity markets.
Companies involved in those activities must be licensed by Ofgem. The
Utilities Act 2000 amended the procedure for the collective
modification of gas licences in line with new arrangements that were
being introduced for electricity licences. It removed the need for each
standard condition in each licence to be modified on an individual
basis.</div><a name="10012152000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section
11A of the Electricity Act 1989 and section 23 of the Gas
Act 1986, as amended by the Utilities Act 2000, state that
Ofgem must consult with the licence holders on any collective
modifications proposed to the standard licence conditions. If enough
objections are officially lodged by the consultees, Ofgem cannot
proceed with the collective licence modification. Those sections in the
1986 and 1989 Acts also gave the Secretary of State power to prescribe
the market share calculations&#151;the blocking minority&#151;that
is to be used by Ofgem to determine whether a collective licence
modification can be
made.</div><a name="10012152000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
July 2002, the Department of Trade and Industry consulted on a draft
statutory instrument that set out the proposed market share
calculations and blocking minority threshold percentages. The
Electricity and Gas (Modification of Standard Conditions of Licences)
Order 2003 SI No. 1746 came into force on 16 July 2003. It provides for
two blocking minority thresholds. If those thresholds are exceeded,
Ofgem may not make the modification. Ofgem then published guidance
alongside the regulations to explain how the two blocking minority
tests work. The guidance
states:</div><a name="10012152000470"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Order prescribes that if the number of relevant licence holders that
have made a statutory objection is equal to or greater than 20 per cent
of the total number of relevant licence holders, the proposed
modification cannot be made. If the number of relevant licence holders
that have made a statutory objection is less than 20 per cent then the
second test will be
considered.</div><a name="10012152000471"></a><div class="hs_brev">The
second test will consider the market share of relevant licence holders
that have made a statutory objection to the proposal. In this second
test, the market share of licence holders will be calculated with
reference to a specific time and date (referred to in the Order as the
&#145;relevant time&#146;). If the market share of objectors so
calculated is equal to or exceeds 20 per cent the proposed modification
cannot be made.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column416" />Column number: 416</div><a name="10012152000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is possible, in some
circumstances, for a modification to be made even when the blocking
minority threshold has been
met.</div><a name="10012152000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
guidance&#146;s last point on the subject
states:</div><a name="10012152000472"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As
set out in Section 11A(8) of the Electricity Act and Section
23(10) of the Gas Act, Ofgem may make a collective licence modification
even if one or both of the two blocking minority thresholds have been
met provided that Ofgem is satisfied that...the existing SLC
imposes a burden which affects relevant licence holders in the carrying
on of their activities... the proposed modification would remove
or reduce the burden without removing any necessary protection,
and...no holder of that type of licence would be disadvantaged in
competing with other holders of such licences...Ofgem will
indicate at the earliest practicable stage whether it considers that
these tests are likely to be relevant. This may be during an informal
consultation. Ofgem will in any event indicate this in the statutory
notice so that interested parties can comment on whether they consider
that the tests are
satisfied.&#148;</div><a name="10012152000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
guidance also states
that</div><a name="10012152000473"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;section
12 of the Electricity Act and section 24 of the Gas Act would still
enable Ofgem to make a reference to the Competition Commission on a
proposed licence change in respect of any matters relating to
activities which are authorised or regulated by a particular licence
which operate or may be expected to operate against the public
interest.&#148;</div><a name="10012152000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
blocking minority test does not preclude Ofgem from making a reference
to the Competition Commission, which can then order changes to the
licences if the existing arrangements were found to restrict or distort
competition.</div><a name="10012152000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
far as I can tell, we are unique, with the possible exception of
Ireland, which followed our legislation, in having that blocking
system. In the UK, one of the big utility companies can block a change
to the licence condition. The proposal is to remove that right of veto.
It is not in the interests of consumers and it does not give equity to
the system. At the moment, if Ofgem proposes a licence change, energy
suppliers have the opportunity to block it, but consumers do not have
an equivalent power. Some consumer organisations, such as Consumer
Focus, argue that they, too, should have the power to block licence
changes. If the Minister is not willing to go as far as to accept that
proposal, I hope that she will consider positively that the position
should change so that nobody, as a matter of right, should be able to
block the licence changes. I hope she sees the logic of the proposal,
which is significantly supported by consumer
organisations.</div><a name="10012152000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000619"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> New clause 10 aims to make it easier for Ofgem to
change the standard conditions of gas licences by removing the
condition that such amendments cannot be made if a specified proportion
of relevant licence holders object. New clause 11 has the same aim with
respect to electricity licences, as the hon. Gentleman has said. I
sympathise with the need to ensure that Ofgem can make timely changes
to further its remit. However, that needs to be done in a way that also
gives companies a way to object when licence conditions have, or could
have, significant implications for their operations. To remove that
recourse altogether could reduce regulatory certainty, increasing costs
and therefore prices. It could also act as a deterrent to new
entrants.</div><a name="10012152000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
current rules allow the industry to block the introduction of licence
conditions by ensuring that a change to a standard condition of a gas
or electricity licence is subject to its not being objected to by 20
per cent. or more of the licence holders, measured by market 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column417" />Column number: 417</div>share and the number of licence holders. The collective licence
modification process was introduced by the Utilities Act
2000.</div><a name="10012152000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">Previously
it was more difficult for Ofgem to change standard licence conditions,
because each modification had to be agreed with every individual
licence holder. The Electricity and Gas (Modification of Standard
Conditions of Licences) Order 2003, to which the hon. Member for North
Southwark and Bermondsey referred, sets out the proportion of licence
holders needed to prevent a standard licence condition being adopted or
amended. Before that order was made, there was a consultation on what
that proportion and the method of calculation should be. The changes
introduced strike a balance: they have made it quicker and easier to
alter standard licence conditions, while ensuring that when a
significant proportion of licensees object to a proposal, their
objections are taken into
account.</div><a name="10012152000491"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30
pm</div><a name="10012152000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
a significant share of licensees wish to object to a proposal, their
objections must be taken into account. It is not necessary for a
majority of licensees&#151;whether by number or by market
share&#151;to object, only a significant number or a significant
player. As the hon. Gentleman said, Ofgem can appeal to the Competition
Commission when a modification to a standard licence condition is
blocked.</div>
<a name="10012152000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
considering any such appeal, the Competition Commission will consider
whether the modification is in the public interest, with Ofgem&#146;s
remit in mind. That means that a change vital to the interests of
current and future consumers can be made, even when licence holders
object. The effect of the new clauses would be to remove that safeguard
for companies holding electricity and gas transmission and supply
licences, and their only recourse would be a lengthy and costly
judicial
review.</div><a name="10012152000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">Changes
to licence conditions could have significant implications for
companies&#146; operations and profits, which in turn could affect
their willingness to invest or even participate in the market. It is
therefore appropriate that they should have a means of challenging the
decisions. The collective licence modification process provides a
balance, as it requires there to be significant concern about an issue
across the industry. It therefore provides an appropriate mechanism
whereby companies can block a licence condition that causes them
legitimate concern, without unduly fettering Ofgem&#146;s ability to
act.</div><a name="10012152000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is also worth remembering that if the Government consider that market
arrangements are not delivering essential change, there is the option
of legislating for amendments to licence conditions, as we are doing
with the introduction of a market power licence condition in the Bill.
For those reasons, I put it to the hon. Gentleman that the matter is
not as straightforward as he suggests. I understand where organisations
such as Consumer Focus are coming from, but we must have some regard to
the complexities of the market that Ofgem
regulates.</div><a name="10012152000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000620"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> May I ask the Minister two factual things before I
conclude on the new clauses? First, will she confirm the implication of
what I understand her to have said&#151;that it would be possible for
one of the big six to exercise a blocking veto under the current
system? Secondly, even if she is not willing at the moment to deal with
that blocking veto threshold issue, will she 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column418" />Column number: 418</div>consider whether there might be the ability for an
organisation&#151;logically, Consumer Focus&#151;to have an
entitlement either to veto or at least to trigger a review process, so
that the consumer is directly represented in the licence modification
system, rather than just the
companies?</div><a name="10012152000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000621"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I understand that because of its market share,
British Gas is in a position to exercise that power in relation to the
licensing. However, the hon. Gentleman is wrong to represent it as a
veto, because there is a mechanism whereby Ofgem can go to the
Competition Commission. It is not an absolute block. The block is not a
veto as one understands a veto in other forums.</div>
<a name="10012152000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">On his
suggestion about the ability of Consumer Focus, he almost implies that
Ofgem in its primary aim of protecting consumers should have to be
second-guessed by another organisation. On the face of it, that does
not seem to be an appropriate way to proceed, but I will reflect on
what he has said.</div>
<a name="10012152000240"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000622"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s last
comment, and I will reflect on what she has said in answer to my

the sensible thing is to go away, look at the exchange on another day

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000623"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div>
<a name="10012152000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
we can deal with the new clause briefly, to provide additional time for
the remaining new
clauses.</div><a name="10012152000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have talked about the range of different approaches necessary for
dealing with the challenges of fuel poverty, including some of the
financial and social support mechanisms and energy efficiency. The new
clause suggests an additional way to help some of those people who are
in fuel poverty by ensuring that they are first to get the benefits of
a smart metering roll-out.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column419" />Column number: 419</div><a name="10012152000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
commitment to smart metering was incorporated in statements in the
House of Lords on the Energy Act 2008. The Government had
resolutely refused to agree to the changes made in Committee in the
House of Commons, and this Bill may follow the same pattern. The
Government have become enthusiastic in their words about smart meter
installation and the need for a national roll-out programme, but there
is great concern about the programme being very slow. Most people in
industry believe that 2020 is a very unambitious target. The Minister
may believe that it is ambitious, but everybody in industry believes
that the roll-out could be done in three years, or perhaps sooner, with
the right degree of commitment and enthusiasm from the Department
and
Ministers.</div><a name="10012152000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
case for the new clause is that smart meters will bring significant
benefits. We can see from the roll-out in Northern Ireland that people
on prepayment meters pay less for their electricity than those who are
on ordinary tariffs. That is in stark contrast to the situation in
other parts of the UK. The people who have the most to gain by being
able to choose the tariff best for them and to opt for arrangements to
minimise their charges are those in the greatest fuel poverty.
Therefore, there is a case for saying that, in deciding how the
roll-out should be done&#151;and there are still decisions to be
made&#151;the Government should prioritise those in fuel
poverty.</div><a name="10012152000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
people least likely to have access to the internet and least able to
shop around for the best tariff, given some of the complexities of that
approach online, will be some of those in fuel poverty. That is not to
stigmatise them as people who are not best able to use the internet; it
is to recognise that the households least likely to have broadband
connections are those homes where poverty is
greatest.</div><a name="10012152000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">Through
the installation of smart meters, those people can be given access to a
wider range of tariffs and options for using power at times when the
charges are lower. It may have the additional benefit of bringing
broadband into their homes, as that is a requirement for smart
metering. The scheme is a way of trying to do more to help the fuel
poor and give an extra kick-start to the roll-out of smart meters. I
hope that the Minister will accept the
prioritisation.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000624"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> This is clearly a good idea. Like the hon.
Gentleman, I am troubled that the current plan will be executed over
such a long period. I think that the Italians did it in three years,
although no countries are exactly comparable. If that is possible in
Italy, which is not always regarded as the most organised country in
the whole world, we can do much better than 10 years. It is clearly
important as a sub-process that the fuel poor, people in particular
need, should have smart meters first.</div>
<a name="10012152000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can I just
make one other technical point? I understand that there has been a
debate about who should receive the information that the meter
displays. It is absolutely paramount that all the information is
received, by not just the companies but the customer, in a way that is
easy to read, understand and interpret, so that it is clearly visible
for the individual in their
home.</div><a name="10012152000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000625"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> The new clause would enable the Secretary of
State to require energy suppliers to give to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column420" />Column number: 420</div>the fuel poor, those living close to renewable energy generators and any
other group, priority in receiving smart meters. It would also allow
the Secretary of State to specify a deadline, within seven years, for
achieving full
roll-out.</div><a name="10012152000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure that members of the Committee are aware of the
Government&#146;s strong commitment to smart meters and our continued
progress in implementing the comprehensive roll-out programme. As
announced by Lord Hunt on 2 December, the Government have made a series
of key decisions on the implementation of smart metering in Great
Britain, and put in train a major implementation programme led by the
Department of Energy and Climate Change and Ofgem.</div>
<a name="10012152000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">The programme
follows the taking of some broad implementing powers from the Energy
Act 2008. Under the enabling powers set out in the 2008 Act, the
Government already have wide discretionary powers to require energy
suppliers to give priority to particular groups of customers, who might
include those mentioned in the amendment, and also other groups. The
first part of the proposed new clause would not, therefore, add
anything to existing
powers.</div><a name="10012152000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second part of the new clause focuses on a deadline for the roll-out of
all smart meters. There is a considerable amount of work to do before a
formal mass roll-out of smart meters starts, covering the regulatory
framework, market design, standards, consumer protection, data
protection, access rules and other matters. Our current estimate is
that the work under the implementation programme will take about three
years. I really suggest to the hon. Members for North Southwark and
Bermondsey and for Wealden that those issues, such as design,
standards, consumer protection, access arrangements and data
protection, are all things that every one of us would want to be done
properly. We believe that the time is required to ensure that those
factors are accommodated and considered properly, so that when we begin
our roll-out it will be supported and welcomed by people, without lots
of household conflicts.</div>
<a name="10012152000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that
basis, the start of the roll-out under the mandate would happen at the
end of 2012. We remain committed to our target of completing the
roll-out by the end of 2020. That target is based on previous
experience of the complexity and time involved in delivering major
change projects in the energy industry, and a detailed economic
analysis of the costs and benefits profile of a range of options.
Setting an earlier deadline for installing smart meters would be likely
to lead to significant increases in costs and risks to what is widely
recognised to be the largest and most complex energy industry change
programme since the conversion to North sea gas in the 1960s and
1970s.</div><a name="10012152000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, the power contained in subsection (1) is unnecessary, as
the Secretary of State could already prioritise groups under section 88
of the Energy Act 2008. In relation to the remaining
provisions, I do not believe that it would be appropriate to set a
deadline in legislation for the achievement of such a complex
undertaking as the roll-out of smart meters. Nevertheless, I am happy
to confirm to the Committee that we are committed to delivering the
smart meter roll-out as quickly as possible for a programme of this
magnitude. For those reasons, I regret that I cannot support the
inclusion of new clause 12 in the Bill. Within that roll-out, the
Government will consider whether there can be targeting of the
fuel-poor 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column421" />Column number: 421</div>and how the balance will need to be created between efficiencies, and
therefore costs, and how the programme itself is rolled out. That is
why we need to take great care over doing it, so that when we do it, we
do it well and do not have to revisit
it.</div><a name="10012152000492"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000626"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I am happy to continue to support the hon. Member
for Wealden. I will not argue that technically the new clause is
needed. Perhaps it is not, but the politics and the delivery is
certainly needed, which I guess will be the burden of his
song.</div><a name="10012152000259"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000627"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> The hon. Gentleman has absolutely identified what
I should focus on. I am grateful to the Minister for her commitment to
try to ensure that the installation of smart meters will bring benefits
only to those who are in fuel poverty. Her words will be welcomed
generally. There are times, however, when one wants to shake the
Department and ask it to get a grip on the emergency, the challenge and
the opportunities that are there rather than just saying that it is
really difficult and we are going to have think about it for another
three
years.</div><a name="10012152000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Gentleman pointed out, Italy has done this; it has gone
through those difficult discussions and completed the
roll-out&#151;primarily only for electricity rather than for dual
fuel issues, but a great deal more energy has been directed there.
Sweden will have completed its roll-out programme to 5 million homes in
the next few months, and it has been done in Ontario in the last few
months. Around the world other countries are grappling with the issue,
but they have reached the stage of implementation and roll-out, rather
than conversation, discussion and
consultation.</div><a name="10012152000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister talks about the consultation conclusions that were announced
last December. What caused huge dismay in industry was the extra
element of consultation that came from that. Rather than reaching
conclusions and a delivery programme, which is what industry had hoped,
the consultation said that we need to think more about a huge range of
different issues.</div>
<a name="10012152000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">What people
want now is leadership. The way forward is to ask what we can agree on.
There are a range of important issues. I do not in any way minimise the
importance of the issues that have to be resolved, but which of them
can we readily agree on? Let us get agreement and let us park them.
Then let us focus on the ones where there is no agreement and put in
place a rigorous time-constrained approach to try to sort them
out.</div>
<a name="10012152000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">I always
thought the programme could be sorted out in the course of a long
weekend. If the President of Europe can be chosen over dinner, it
should be possible to sort out a smart metering programme over a few
days. The Government should just lock the doors and not let people home
until the detail has been agreed. A few long weekends might be needed
to agree the different elements of the various sections, but there just
is not enough drive and enthusiasm to make it
happen.</div><a name="10012152000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey is absolutely right
about information. The key issue in the roll-out of smart meters is
that the public must trust the system. They will trust the system only
if they have access to all the information their 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column422" />Column number: 422</div>electricity and energy companies have. If there is that proviso, they
may not want to use it; however, they must feel that there is nothing
about their consumption patterns that someone can access remotely but
they themselves cannot see. That is a fundamental building block and I
hope there can be early agreement on it.</div>
<a name="10012152000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that
the Minister has powers to prioritise within the existing powers and so
the clause would not be necessary. We will not seek to push it to a
vote but I wish we could get a greater sense of dynamism and urgency.
What do we need to do to move things forward&#151;from 2020 to 2017?
How do we shorten the three-year consultation period to something that
can be achieved much more rapidly? We are falling behind other
countries. They have all managed to do it. They are ahead of us on the
roll-out programme. There are issues that make it more complex in the
United Kingdom than elsewhere but we are being unambitious. We hope
that the Government will take away a strong message from this debate.
We want greater drive and greater urgency to make the programme
happen.</div><a name="10012152000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I am not quite sure what the

perhaps.</div><a name="10012152000272"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000630"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> I am sure the Minister will clarify. It will get
more enthralling by the minute as we proceed into the final
hour.</div>
<a name="10012152000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed new
clause 13 is about how we give greater impetus to the development of
carbon capture and storage in this country. There is frustration within
the business community that we have not seen greater urgency attached
to the development of carbon capture and to the putting in place of the
pilot schemes. There is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column423" />Column number: 423</div>frustration about the way the initial competition was mounted, the fact
that it ruled out pre-combustion technologies and how long it is taking
to choose a
winner.</div><a name="10012152000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the course of the Bill, the Government have put in place a levy, so we
have a funding system. There are two potential funding systems because
we may still be able to work on another. The funding issues are now
being addressed and resolved. There is a whole range of other
managerial issues about what is necessary to take us from where we are
to commercial reality in the development of the plants.</div>
<a name="10012152000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">A year ago we
asked Lord Oxburgh, former chairman of Shell, to bring together some
people from all aspects of industry to look at what was necessary to
make the roll-out happen. They included the chief executive of Scottish
and Southern Energy, a company that will be producing CO<span class="Sub">2</span>;
the executive vice-president of Shell, a company with expertise in
sequestration; Professor Jon Gibbins of Imperial College, who gave
evidence and is a pre-eminent authority on the development of the
technology; and Tony White, who has tremendous expertise in the
financing of such issues.</div>
<a name="10012152000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those people
were asked what was needed to make the roll-out happen, and they
concluded that there needed to be an authority to handle aspects of the
process. Before Christmas, I provided members of the Committee with a
copy of the brief, three-page report that shows clearly why they
believe those steps are necessary. The purpose of proposed new clause
13 is to put in place a CCS body responsible for pipelines and
associated infrastructure. Lord Oxburgh initially said an authority; we
have referred to it as a body, because that gives the Government
greater opportunities to decide how best to structure it. Clearly, a
case could be made for its being a regulated monopoly, as Lord Oxburgh
set out.</div>
<a name="10012152000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">The body
would be responsible for the development of hubs. We believe that the
real potential for the United Kingdom to develop the technology comes
from identifying clusters of particularly large use and demand, for
example, in the Thames estuary; or where we have particular expertise
already, as at the Forth, or a particular amount of CO<span class="Sub">2
</span>emissions, as in Humberside and Teesside. Those are areas where
co-ordination is needed with a body responsible for doing that. There
needs to be somebody who will put in place the oversized pipelines and
set out the contracts requiring that to be done. It would be absurd to
go about CCS with pipelines that were simply the right size for the
power stations that would be emitting. If we are to roll it out as a
major programme, the pipelines need to be oversized.</div>
<a name="10012152000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
other contractual aspects in developing CCS and the disbursal of
funding, however it is arranged. We think that needs a strategic body,
at arm&#146;s length from Government and with the ability to take an
overview.</div>
<a name="10012152000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government may refer to examples and say, &#147;This will be done by
the office of carbon capture and storage,&#148; which, I have to say,
has had a frustratingly slow start. Ministers will have often heard me
referring to the Office for Nuclear Development, which has been an
important way of driving forward investment in nuclear, with an
approach orientated towards problem  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column424" />Column number: 424</div>solving, identifying the challenges and seeing what solutions can be
identified. We are not seeing the same drive yet from the office of
carbon capture and storage. It may happen, but six months since its
announcement the office is not yet up and running. It still has a blank
sheet of paper for its objectives and priorities.</div>
<a name="10012152000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">Somebody
ought to be putting in place a road map; we will shortly come to a vote
on the need for a road map for the development of carbon capture and
storage. There is a case&#151;as set out by Lord Oxburgh and his
unparalleled team of experts&#151;for giving the Secretary of State
the power to set up a body to take on the
role.</div><a name="10012152000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Government decided in due course that such an authority was
required, it would almost certainly require primary legislation. That
is not to say that there must be a body, but that the Secretary of
State has the power to create such an organisation. The detail could be
sorted out in secondary legislation so that we did not end up, as this
time with the levy, with people saying, &#147;How&#146;s it going
to be done? We&#146;re under great time constraints&#148;. It could
be done in a timely, sensible manner to enable the measure to go
forward at maximum
speed.</div><a name="10012152000282"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10012152000631"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Brian Binley</b> (Northampton, South) (Con): I very much
welcome the new clause, for a number of reasons. We now know that there
will be four test projects, which is welcome, but if we look at how the
pace for clean coal has picked up and gathered momentum over the past
year, we see that things are beginning to move quickly. The concept of
clean coal, which was seen by many to be a bit of a fantasy a year ago,
is now seen by a greater number of people as a real opportunity for
this country, especially for the coal industry, which will go to the
wall unless clean coal becomes a reality. There are some real issues.
We need to move beyond saying, &#147;Is clean coal going to be a real
part of our future?&#148; to saying, &#147;What else do we need to
do to ensure that it is an effective operation in as short a time as
possible?&#148; I therefore welcome the
operation.</div><a name="10012152000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to talk about a couple of other issues, beyond those that my hon.
Friend the Member for Wealden raised. There is a real opportunity for
oil enhancement. Unless we take action by 2015 many of the oil wells
that we will need could be closed down, and we know how difficult it is
to maintain them once they have been capped&#151;it cannot happen
because the opportunity has gone. The body, if approved, ought to think
about that as well. It also ought to think about the impact on our coal
communities, and the opportunities it offers them. To areas that
traditionally produced coal, setting up the body would bring great hope
of a new opportunity for the product they sit on. There are sizeable
amounts of energy possibility. We need to talk about that
too.</div><a name="10012152000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
the proposal would give the message&#151;the most important thing at
the moment&#151;that the Government are thinking beyond, &#147;Will
clean coal work?&#148;, and that would give people the confidence to
say, &#147;This is going to happen&#148;. Clean coal will be an
important part of where Britain will be, not over the next 10 to 30
years, but over a longer period, and it provides an opportunity to
ensure that people see that there is real export potential, in
technology and manufacture. That ought to excite industry as well, and
ensure that it is geared up to be a part of what I think will be a
movement of major importance for our nation. I support my hon. Friend. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column425" />Column number: 425</div>The new clause is important and I hope that the Government will accept
it. If they do not, I hope they will do something similar in the near
future.</div><a name="10012152000493"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000632"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> Clearly, the issue is important and it is proper
for the hon. Member for Wealden and his hon. Friends to raise it. The
new clause is sufficiently drawn to probe how we can have the
infrastructure in place to deal with the CCS implications. We need to
make sure that it is led by the Government and that they make sure that
the private sector, which is trying to fix its own arrangements, puts
the grid in place. Given the advice that I have received, I share the
view of the hon. Member for Northampton, South that the future of
carbon capture in the coal industry will be in three or four
significant parts of the country at most. They are all predetermined;
the industry is fairly clear about
that.</div><a name="10012152000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Thames estuary will play into the Kent coalfields, and the Humber
estuary feeds into the Yorkshire coalfields, which my hon. Friend the
Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough has referred to in the past.
There is also what is described as either the third or the third or
fourth area, depending on whether one views the north-east as part of
the Scottish sector or not. Part of the industry views the area as the
Scottish sector plus the north-east, but calls it Scotland. It is the
same area.</div>
<a name="10012152000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
bound to be collaboration; we have been around that circuit before. We
are talking about several companies working and putting their expertise
together. We need to make sure that we do not end up with something,
driven by a short or immediate interest of the individual company or
consortium, that does not play into the bigger picture. That could
relate to pipeline size or other things. Everything needs to be
integrated.</div><a name="10012152000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am a legatee, as is the Minister of State to a lesser extent, of the
decision on where the Jubilee line extension went. The extension was
made because it was driven by the contribution offered by and
eventually negotiated with Canary Wharf plc after a lot of to-ing and
fro-ing by the then Conservative Government. The extension, as
originally proposed, was going to be a fast line from places such as
Waterloo to Canary Wharf. However, we persuaded people that stopping
once south of the river in London Bridge, between Waterloo and Canary
Wharf, was a good idea. To put it bluntly, it took a hell of a battle
to persuade the then Government and the promoters of the private Bill
that we needed stations for the people who lived above the line if a
line was to be built disrupting everybody beneath
it.</div><a name="10012152000289"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000633"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. We are straying a little wide of the new
clause.</div><a name="10012152000290"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000634"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> No, I am not. I am being careful to ensure that
the example is relevant. There was a hell of a battle, because we had
to block the private Bill to make sure that we had the additional
stations to meet the general and not just the particular need. I am
making exactly the same point in relation to the new clause. We need to
get the agreement in place at the beginning, not afterwards.</div>
<a name="10012152000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
make sure that a structure is in place that meets the needs of the
wider community as well as those of the operators. I will be interested
in what the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column426" />Column number: 426</div>Minister has to say about that. The debate on the issue will not finish
today, but it is sensible that we all work together to ensure that the
infrastructure is in place. The new clause is an attempt to ensure that
the Government are reading from the same
page.</div><a name="10012152000292"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000635"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I know that Joan Ruddock has a great knowledge
of transport in London. When responding to the hon. Gentleman, however,
she should centre on the merits or otherwise of establishing a body at
the outset rather than his points about public
transport.</div><a name="10012152000293"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000636"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> Mr. Bayley, you have disappointed me.
I was going to explain the merits of the Surrey Canal Road station on
the extension of the East London line, for which I am campaigning. I
will turn to new clause 13
instead.</div><a name="10012152000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause would give the Secretary of State powers to establish a new
body, the primary function of which would be to facilitate the
transport and long-term storage of CO<span class="Sub">2</span> from not just power
stations, but all carbon emitters. The new clause provides that the
body&#146;s duties may include a range of activities considered
necessary to develop a national network for the transport and storage
of CO<span class="Sub">2</span>&#151;for example, organising competitive tenders
for the provisions of pipeline capacity and storage monitoring
services.</div><a name="10012152000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Member for Wealden said, his proposed new clause arises from
the paper, prepared for his party, that he has kindly circulated to the
Committee. The paper raises an important set of issues. I very much
welcome the contribution that Lord Oxburgh, with whom I worked at GLOBE
International, and others bring to the debate. I will look carefully at
the suggestions he makes as we develop the policies required to make
the successful transition from the demonstration of CCS to realising
its future wide-scale deployment.</div>
<a name="10012152000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
there are many interrelated and complex issues that need to be
understood before we decide how the infrastructure needed for the
deployment of CCS can most effectively be developed. Those include how
we implement the requirements of the EU directive on geological storage
of CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>to ensure third-party access to storage sites; the
approach that might best be taken within the context of the
demonstration programme in order to best provide a platform for the
further long-term expansion of CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>infrastructure, including
the question of oversizing pipelines; and how we best facilitate the
development of the CCS value chain to maximise opportunities for UK
business.</div><a name="10012152000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the light of those complexities and our ongoing work to define the
scope and role of the office of carbon capture and storage, we are not
clear whether a body such as that proposed in the new clause offers the
best way forward at this time, nor are we in a position to determine
exactly what functions any such body should be given. There are also
genuine uncertainties currently about the extent to which CCS will be
deployed in the economy and the consequent need for pipelines and
storage sites.</div>
<a name="10012152000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">Establishing
a statutory body whose sole focus is the development of such a network
could well be a distraction from our main priority of demonstrating CCS
at the present time, and could well lead to considerable inefficiency
in undertaking such investment. Our priority is to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column427" />Column number: 427</div>demonstrate CCS on a commercial scale and this Government have done more
than virtually any other to help bring that about. We are not
neglecting the important issues associated with the future development
of infrastructure for the transport and storage of carbon
dioxide.</div><a name="10012152000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
part of our work to implement the third-party access provisions of the
EU directive on the geological storage of carbon dioxide, we will take
steps to encourage those investing in CCS infrastructure to anticipate
foreseeable future demand and also to allow for the expansion of
initial investments into the network. We will also publish further
thinking on infrastructure shortly in the forthcoming CCS strategy, and
then discuss more widely with stakeholders how those might be
developed.</div><a name="10012152000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
recognise and sympathise with the intent behind the new clause, but to
accept it would be premature given the current stage of CCS and the
many complex aspects of the framework that will need to be developed
and put in place, over the coming years, if we are to realise our
ambitions for this technology. Therefore, I hope that the hon.
Gentleman will withdraw his new clause, confident in the knowledge that
the Government will certainly continue to consider the
issue.</div>
<a name="10012152000301"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000637"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> I was just talking to my hon. Friend the Member
for Leominster and saying, &#147;Who was the American President who
used to talk about the &#145;vision thing&#146;?&#148; I think it
was the first George Bush, although it could easily have been the
second George Bush.</div>
<a name="10012152000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">What comes
through is the lack of vision. Some of the steps taken by the hon. Lady
will be read by people outside here. They will accept that the
Government have done one thing: the great compliment paid to the
Minister and the Government is about the step forward on the levy
system, which people say was a potentially world-leading
approach.</div>
<a name="10012152000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
there is also frustration. People will say, &#147;Where is the rest
of it? Where is the rest of the package that is really going to drive
this forward and make it all happen?&#148; My hon. Friend the Member
for Northampton, South made extremely valid points about some of the
wider implications. It is important that we move forward so that we can
address issues such as enhanced oil recovery and the additional
benefits that it will bring.</div>
<a name="10012152000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must
recognise that if something does not happen soon, it will be too late
because the fields in question will have closed. It is important to
bring hope and help to coalfield communities and to present them with a
better, brighter future. We want this to be a technology that brings
extraordinary gain to parts of Britain that have had a difficult period
over recent years. We totally understand those difficulties and we want
to see those communities revitalised and investment returning to many
different parts of our
economy.</div><a name="10012152000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister&#146;s approach seems to be characterised by her taking a
little step here and another one there, rather than having an overall
strategic approach and asking, &#147;What do we really need to do to
send a signal to some of the biggest companies in the world, which are
looking at this, that we are determined to move from a position of
following to one of leadership?&#148; This is not just an issue of
funding; it is about the whole 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column428" />Column number: 428</div>structure that needs to be put in place, not only to conduct the
competitions but to take the process beyond that
point.</div><a name="10012152000306"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000638"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> The hon. Gentleman does a disservice to his own
arguments by suggesting that we are followers, not leaders, in this
matter. We are widely acknowledged in the world community to have a
leading role. If we are successful in getting the Bill through the
House, it will put in place a framework funding mechanism and enable us
to go ahead with a programme unprecedented anywhere in the world. That
is real ambition, and everything that the hon. Gentleman wants us to do
can be done regardless of whether a body such as the one that he
proposes
exists.</div><a name="10012152000307"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000639"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> The hon. Lady has been rather partial in the
evidence that she has accepted from those who appeared before us. Jeff
Chapman, of the Carbon Capture and Storage Association, did indeed say
that the levy system was one of the best in the world, but he was also
asked which countries had moved ahead of Britain, and he
said:</div><a name="10012152000474"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
are a number of countries. The USA certainly has extensive plans with
support arrangements already in place. Canada has three projects which
were between the time that the funding was announced in total, and the
projects were selected through competition and
allocated.&#148;</div><a name="10012152000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
also
said:</div><a name="10012152000475"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
first commercial size power project in the world may well be in China.
The second one may well be in Abu
Dhabi.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Energy Public
Bill Committee, </i>5 January 2010; c. 38,

simply not true to say that we are still leading the world. We are
leading the world in talking about this, but we are not leading the
world in delivering it.</div>
<a name="10012152000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
send a message to people who are looking to invest in this technology
that we are thinking about all of it and how the whole jigsaw fits
together. Although the funding system is, of course, crucial, there is
also a need to look at the overall strategic vision and ask how we
intend to deliver the technology as we start to make
progress.</div>
<a name="10012152000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
talked about decisions on pipelines that need to be made. I refer her
to what Tony White said in his
evidence:</div><a name="10012152000476"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;An
overall organisation could take the judgment that a nine-inch pipe
would do for one plant, but that if there is another plant nearby that
will come on later, a 14-inch pipe should be used. By being able to
anticipate where the demand will come from, such an organisation would
not fall into the problems that the National Grid has had of being
unable to anticipate where generation will come
forward.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Energy

that overall strategic vision that we think important&#151;working
out who should be doing what and by when, to make everything
happen.</div><a name="10012152000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
will do all we can to support the development of this technology in
Britain. We see it as being incredibly important. The Chairman of the
Energy and Climate Change Committee has often spoken about the big
difference that it can make for us. We feel that we are creeping
forward when we could be moving with much greater drive and
determination.</div><a name="10012152000314"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000640"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I remind the hon. Gentleman that, as I have said,
there will be a CCS strategy, which will be published in the
foreseeable future. He needs to suspend his judgment until that has
been produced.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column429" />Column number: 429</div><a name="10012152000315"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000641"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> The hon. Lady has made her point. We have tabled a
new clause to meet the need for a road map, and an obligation and a
time scale&#151;six months&#151;for that to be produced. I hope
that she will support that because, for a Government facing an election
in a few months, six months must be well beyond the foreseeable
future.</div>
<a name="10012152000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">The argument
comes back to vision and strategy, and to having a real sense of trying
to make a difference, so that companies around the world will say,
&#147;Look what they are doing in Britain. There is no doubt that
this is the most exciting place to do it.&#148; However, if the hon.
Lady had come with me to many of the meetings with the companies, she
would have heard the frustration about the slow progress. We want to
move forward to make a real difference, which our measure can.
Therefore, I shall press the new clause to a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000656"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div>
<a name="10012152000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the
hon. Member for Halton for giving guidance to the hon. Member for
North-East Derbyshire, in respect of her momentary aberration during
the Division.</div>
<a name="10012152000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 14
is about how we try to change attitudes in communities around the
country towards developments such as wind farms. Our approach is to do
that through partnership. We are passionately committed to localism and
believe that local communities should be empowered  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column430" />Column number: 430</div>to make the decisions about what is right for them. We also completely
accept that certain sizes of project&#151;the Government&#146;s
threshold of 50 MW is broadly right&#151;should be considered
national schemes, and that decisions on them should be made in the
wider interest, which requires a separate decision-making body. We part
company with the Government on how decisions on those national schemes
should be made, but nevertheless accept the need to decide such matters
in a different
way.</div><a name="10012152000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
projects below 50 MW, the decision will stay with local communities.
Our concern is that often when a community learns that a wind farm is
proposed in its area, it sees downsides, such as visual intrusion,
noise and construction work, but cannot see the benefits of having a
local wind farm. The Government&#146;s approach has moved through
different phases. Initially they were saying, &#147;You should have
it because it is generally good for us all.&#148; That approach has
not won round local communities. The Government went through a phase of
saying, &#147;If you don&#146;t have it, you are really rather a
bad person&#148;, and the present Secretary of State likened such
communities to people who drive across pedestrian crossings without
stopping. That was not going to win hearts and minds either. We need a
different approach to how we win people round to the idea that such
developments may have benefits for their communities, not just
downsides.</div>
<a name="10012152000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other aspects
of our proposals should be taken into account. Elsewhere, we have
proposed that, for the first six years, the business rates from a new
plant be kept within the local community. A wind turbine brings in, on
average, &#163;7,000 or &#163;8,000 a year in business rates per
megawatt, so a 3 MW turbine would bring in more than &#163;20,000 a
year in business rates. A few turbines paying that money into the local
community would mean a significant financial gain.</div>
<a name="10012152000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause is about finding ways to bring more direct benefits to the
communities that decide to host such facilities. Looking at how the
applications have worked in different parts of the country, one can see
a clear pattern emerging. In areas where projects were seen to have
been imposed with no benefit to the community, there was significant
opposition and people argued strongly against them. There are
examples&#151;particularly in Scotland, where there has been a much
more constructive approach&#151;of communities seeing real benefits,
financially and otherwise, and actively supporting the applications,
rather than seeking to block them. We want to move people to a more
balanced situation, in which they can see both sides of the equation
and make decisions based on those
values.</div><a name="10012152000340"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000657"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> The hon. Gentleman will have seen that my hon.
Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough and I support the new
clause, and I am encouraged by his argument. Will he, however, concede
that people find it difficult to buy into supporting local renewable
energy projects? That is the case with people in our party, the Labour
party, and certainly the Tory party; I do not know about the Scottish
National party. Will he explain why, for example, it was impossible for
the Conservatives in the Isle of Wight to see that if they were so
opposed to wind farms they would lose the manufacturer that provided
jobs for the community? Sometimes I do not understand how people just
do not see the upside and can see only the downside, when the
implications are so obvious.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column431" />Column number: 431</div><a name="10012152000341"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000658"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> If one looks at the facts of the decision to close
the factory, one finds that the decision was in part based on the
nature of the turbines being manufactured, which were for offshore
facilities. The company had to decide whether to build a new facility
in the United States to meet demand there as a result of the changes
being made by President Obama, and it had to consider the implications
for its factory in Denmark. The choice was very much to do with
internal decisions; it was not simply because the Isle of Wight did not
want the facilities. I have to recognise, however, that a proactive
approach by a local authority may influence investment
decisions.</div><a name="10012152000342"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000659"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I just want to put on the record that the turbine
factory was not producing turbines that were being used in this
country. It did, however, comment that it saw a difficult future, and
therefore had to consider whether it was worth investing in turbines
for the UK when it had people on its doorstep saying, &#147;We
don&#146;t want
turbines&#148;.</div><a name="10012152000343"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000660"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> That makes the case for a different approach. The
approach up to now has been one of antagonism and entrenched
opposition. We need to find people who can be persuaded to look at the
merits of both sides of the case. The new clause states that there
should be a change to regulations, so that people living close to a
renewable energy facility benefit from cheaper electricity. That has
long been the approach in France. Someone living near a nuclear power
station there gets cheaper electricity as part of the deal for that
community. Some people say, &#147;Is that not bribery?&#148;, but I
think that it is saying, &#147;We recognise the fact that you have
this facility nearby that is of greater benefit than to just your
community&#148;. We are keen to see that issue
addressed.</div><a name="10012152000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">Wherever
possible in such developments, we are keen to ensure a degree of shared
ownership. Perhaps that could even be obligatory. A turbine could be
erected free of charge but be owned by the local community, or there
could be a shareholding within the overall development. Money would
then come into the community on a continuing basis, and the community
could spend it on improvements and the things about which it cared
most.</div><a name="10012152000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are trying to find a way through the entrenched opposition that so
often causes blockages. We want to leave it to local authorities to
decide what is right for their communities, but we want to ensure that
when they say to their people, &#147;This is the application,&#148;
people can say, &#147;Okay, I understand that there may be some
downsides, but I can see that there is a real benefit for us as
well.&#148; There can then be a much more balanced and constructive
debate about what is right for the community. That is an important way
of encouraging the development of renewable facilities on land in
Britain. We are grateful for the Liberal Democrats&#146; support. The
new clause could start to make a real difference, and I hope that the
Minister will be
supportive.</div><a name="10012152000346"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000661"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> I have a lot of sympathy with the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s argument. As he said, there is some experience of
such developments in Scotland. However, community benefit does not
always work in the way that he outlined. A community can be split
between those who want a community benefit&#151;a new sports centre,
for example&#151;and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column432" />Column number: 432</div>those whose main concern is the view, or whatever. My concern, however,
is not so much about that but about the road that the approach takes us
down.</div><a name="10012152000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we decide that we will give cheaper energy to those who are close to a
wind farm, why not give it to those close to a nuclear power station or
a power line, too? We know about the huge opposition to the
Beauly-Denny power line because of the impact on views and the alleged
impact on property values. The new clause will open up a can of worms
that could be very dangerous and very
expensive.</div><a name="10012152000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying. However, there are
proposals for two significant wind farms off the coast of my
constituency. One is at Bell Rock, which is a national monument, but it
will have turbines around it. I strongly support those applications;
not only will they provide energy for our future, but they will bring
huge economic benefit to the community. They will provide work in the
area and will benefit local ports and firms. That is my argument in
favour of the Bell Rock and Inchcape wind farms. The idea of seeing the
economic benefit of a wind farm is a much stronger argument with which
to try to win over the local
community.</div><a name="10012152000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
trouble with smaller applications is that relatively small numbers of
people get involved in the argument, but both sides are extremely
passionate. I do not think that it is a question of money. It is a
question of the passions that wind farms arouse. Sometimes it is
difficult to see the rational argument. People have real concerns about
views and amenities. I can understand
that.</div><a name="10012152000350"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000662"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> May I tell the hon. Gentleman that his comment
about it being a small number of people who get involved flies in the
face of all that I know about the matter? There is nothing that stirs a
community up more than a proposal to site eight or 10 great windmills
above them. There is a problem here that we need to deal with. I
understand the point that he is making about benefit, but such
proposals involve a great many people in a given
community.</div><a name="10012152000351"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000663"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying. The
number of people involved varies from application to application.
Sometimes it is small. I accept that in some cases it may be large.
Again, that would depend, I suspect, on the size of the application. I
was speaking from my experience in my constituency. None the less, my
principal point is that the new clause opens up a huge can of worms. If
we go down the route proposed in the new clause, we will have to give
compensation to anybody who lives near any massive, disruptive
development. Any such development is disruptive. I mentioned nuclear
power stations, but coal stations, carbon capture and storage, power
lines and even motorways can come into it. I am happy to go along with
community ownership, but the cheaper tariffs would be a step too far.
That would be a very dangerous road to go
down.</div><a name="10012152000352"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000664"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> The Committee will see from the amendment paper
that my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough and I
support the new clause. As the hon. Member for Angus has made clear,
the proposal is not without its difficulties, but on balance, we all
have an obligation to try to do something to increase public acceptance
of renewable power.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column433" />Column number: 433</div><a name="10012152000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">The most
important point to make, particularly to the hon. Member for Angus, is
that the new clause is specifically drafted to apply to renewable
energy generation facilities. I understand that it can be argued that
once we have something in legislation or regulations that incentivises
people to think that they might support such facilities, it could be
used as an example to show that the approach could be extended to
nuclear power stations and other things. He knows that our party, like
his party, opposes nuclear power as an answer to the question of the
UK&#146;s energy
needs.</div><a name="10012152000496"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30
pm</div><a name="10012152000354"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000665"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying but
my point is that in the Bill we are setting up a levy for CCS
demonstration projects. Presumably we are going to have some new
coal-powered stations as a result of that. That raises an immediate
problem, because it is not something that may happen in the future; it
is something that is going to come over the hill within the next few
years.</div><a name="10012152000355"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000666"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I understand that. My view and that of my hon.
Friend is that we support this on the basis that it is only for
renewable energy projects. That is how it is drafted and that is as far
as we go, because we think they are in a different category. They are
entirely about using the elements to increase our energy supply. It is
true that at the moment we struggle in our communities to tell people
of the benefits of renewable energy facilities. It is often paradoxical
because, as Scotland in particular knows from recent experience, the
alternative has often been great big transmission lines across the
country, which are far uglier and less pleasant neighbours than wind
turbines, either on or offshore.</div>
<a name="10012152000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">Wind turbines
are often not visible to most of the people who complain or, when they
are visible, are not audible, even though people think they will be.
When they are visible and even sometimes audible, they add to rather
than detract from the countryside. There are different views; beauty is
in the eye of the beholder. Going around Europe, one sees many
turbines; people do not find them offensive and they see the
benefit.</div><a name="10012152000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">Two
points follow. Proximity is an issue. My Friends and I opposed a
ten-minute Bill introduced by the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire
(Peter Luff) because it seemed a nimby-ish proposal. This is a less
nimby-ish proposal, because it realises that the best way to develop
renewable energy, certainly on a small scale, is for the community to
see the direct benefit. We have always argued for that; that the energy
should power the supply for the village, local community hospital or
school. We believe that is the way energy should go.</div>
<a name="10012152000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why
nuclear power is so hopeless as an alternative. There is no community
ownership proposed for the nuclear industry&#151;that is beyond
imagining. It is the least susceptible to community involvement of any
industry in the world, unless the Tories or Labour were to espouse it
as a new policy, to get them off the hook at the election. I cannot see
that coming. Renewable energy is best linked to communities&#151;as
it has been in the past, can be in the future and is in many countries.
If communities&#151;villages, town and cities&#151;see themselves
as linked to their project, they are far more likely to be supportive.
So this probing new clause is a good idea to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column434" />Column number: 434</div>put to Government and we look forward to their response. We need to do
something so that all the people who at the moment are still reluctant
can be encouraged to realise that renewable energy is the future. It is
the future of this country and of many other countries in the world. If
we cannot show the way in this country, we cannot expect many other
countries to do the
same.</div><a name="10012152000359"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000667"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I have to say I have rarely heard the hon. Member
for Angus say anything with which I agree, but on this
occasion&#151;[<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span>
&#147;Oh!&#148;] I am being completely honest. I do think he showed
a degree of common sense on the issue that has not been demonstrated
elsewhere.</div>
<a name="10012152000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
constituency, being in the inner city, is unlikely to host wind
farms.</div>
<a name="10012152000361"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000668"></a>The
Lord Commissioner of Her Majesty's Treasury (Steve
McCabe):</b> They could put them on the river
bank.</div><a name="10012152000362"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000669"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> It is not impossible, as my hon. Friend says.
Places such as hostels for the homeless or the mentally ill attract the
strongest objections. The corollary would be a rebate on the council
tax if someone lived next to something they thought was objectionable
and was taking the value from their home. My hon. Friend asked earlier
what would happen if someone were living next to where a new prison
about to be built. What would be the compensation? If enacted, this
proposal would set a precedent that would lead us into an immense
number of difficulties. Frankly, the way it is written does not make
sense. What we are trying to do, as I understand from the hon. Member
for Wealden, is win people round. I do not believe that we can do that
by saying, &#147;You will have this, but you or the community will
get a bit of money in compensation.&#148; I do not think that that is
the way. There are many other arguments, and the Government try to
engage people in thinking about what is beneficial overall and what can
be beneficial to their communities. I shall say a little in a moment
about how we are doing
that.</div><a name="10012152000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Gentleman said, the new clause would introduce powers to make
a scheme to make provision for the community local to a renewable
energy development to benefit directly, either through cheaper energy
bills or through part-ownership of the development. Community
involvement in renewable energy projects is a key element of our
renewable energy strategy. As well as helping to deliver renewable
energy projects, effective engagement of communities that will be
hosting such projects is recognised as playing a vital part in gaining
public acceptance of renewable energy
sources.</div><a name="10012152000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
our view, the most effective way of promoting and encouraging the
provision of community benefits by developers is on the basis of a
voluntary rather than prescriptive approach. We believe that that will
engender effective joint working and proactive partnerships in a way
that imposing a statutory obligation would not. Renewable energy
projects vary widely, as they depend on many factors. Any prescriptive
scheme would need to be carefully developed so that it would fit the
specific circumstances of a large variety of
projects.</div><a name="10012152000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, due to the way in which the grid is set up, it is not clear
that those living near a wind farm would obtain their electricity from
that wind farm. A better 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column435" />Column number: 435</div>way to ensure that people benefit from lower electricity prices is by
ensuring a competitive market, while making sure that the necessary
investment can be made to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to ensure
long-term security of
supply.</div><a name="10012152000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are already taking forward several measures that will provide benefits
to communities. Those include developing and demonstrating models of
community engagement through the low-carbon communities challenge and
setting effective financial subsidy levels through feed-in tariffs and
the renewable heat incentive, all of which will benefit communities. We
have also provided capital grants to community renewables projects
through initiatives such as the low-carbon buildings programme. The
low-carbon communities challenge is a two-year programme to provide
financial and advisory support to 20 test-bed communities in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland that are seeking to cut carbon
emissions.</div><a name="10012152000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have already been involved in considering the programmes of those who
have come forward. The scheme is incredibly popular. Those who have won
the first places in the low-carbon communities challenge have produced
the most remarkable plans, involving whole communities working together
to introduce a complete range of renewables&#151;not just turbines
but, for example, solar photovoltaics on small businesses, a turbine in
a school and even, in the case of one project that I have seen,
including further micro-hydro in a local weir. There is enormous
enthusiasm in many communities, and we must harness that and ensure
that they can engage and develop renewable energy facilities in their
communities.</div><a name="10012152000368"></a>

provided for different wind energy developments across the UK. It is
hoped that the toolkit will encourage communities to become directly
involved in renewable energy projects, as they will be able to see what
is possible from the examples provided and use the information to start
considering what could be practical for their particular
circumstances.</div><a name="10012152000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, we very much recognise the important role community energy
installations have to play in promoting renewable energy and gaining
public acceptance. We think that it is through these routes, which are
voluntary and which the Government are doing everything possible to
incentivise, that there will be greater public acceptance and, as I
have already said, in some areas there is real enthusiasm for moving in
this direction. We are taking many steps to encourage such projects to
come forward and I am therefore not persuaded of the need for the new
clause. I also think that it has real problems on practicality and I
urge the hon. Member for Wealden to withdraw
it.</div><a name="10012152000375"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000674"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for her response and
the tone in which she gave it, although I think it was disappointing in
its content. I am surprised by the opposition from the hon. Member for
Angus. People in Scotland would be some of the prime beneficiaries of
the new clause. It is suggested that Scotland could have 60 GW of
renewable energy. That would overwhelmingly have to be exported. There
could be a sense of anger among many people living in rural areas in
Scotland that they live where England&#146;s electricity is being
generated. They get the disadvantages, in terms of the visual
intrusion, but they do not get the benefit from it, apart from the
initial, short-term job creation. I thought that the new clause could
be very popular indeed in Scotland, but it may be a case that we need
to put to the Scottish people as the Opposition to the Scottish
National
party.</div><a name="10012152000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are very keen to encourage methods of community engagement. There is a
strong case for saying that we should be going a stage further. There
is a difference between the hostel and the homes for the mentally ill,
to which the Minister referred. There is local authority provision for
people within that borough&#151;that community. Therefore, one
recognises that they need to go somewhere in their local community,
whereas with a renewable energy facility one is potentially generating
electricity for people many hundreds of miles away. One therefore wants
to do more to encourage them to see the case for doing it.</div>
<a name="10012152000377"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
separate debate to be had about other installations. For example, I
always felt that people living in the shadow of Drax, one of the
biggest coal-fired plants in Europe, had a strong case for receiving
cheaper electricity for putting up with that near their homes, while
the benefit of the power plant goes elsewhere. That is a different
debate for a different time, but this debate is about how we make
communities more accepting of the idea of having renewable energy
facilities.</div>

another place. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000690"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="10012152000402"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the course of our deliberations the word &#147;finally&#148; has
been used on many occasions, but this is probably the first time that
it has been genuine. The new clause has profound implications and is
one of the more serious things that we have been discussing. It is a
shame that we will not have longer to do so, but I hope that we can
conclude the discussions before we reach the 4 o&#146;clock
deadline.</div><a name="10012152000403"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue of a carbon price is one of the most significant hurdles in
securing investment in low-carbon technology; it goes to the heart of
investment in new-build nuclear, in coal with carbon capture and in
renewables. People need to be certain that they are going to secure a
return on their investment, and to do that they need to know the likely
price of carbon. The price of the EU ETS has been up to €30 a
tonne in mid-2008; it has been 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column438" />Column number: 438</div>€10 a tonne in early 2009; it is trading at about €13 a
tonne today. It has not provided the necessary robustness and
certainty, and we need to look at a better means of doing
so.</div><a name="10012152000404"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
the Under-Secretary gave evidence to the Energy and Climate Change
Committee, he said that he was hoping that Copenhagen would resolve the
matter. He said
that</div><a name="10012152000477"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if
we have a positive outcome in Copenhagen we know that the European
Union has said that it will raise its target to 30 per cent. carbon
emissions reductions by
2020&#148;.</div><a name="10012152000405"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
was linked to whether further market signals were needed. He
continued:</div><a name="10012152000478"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
it does not then you are right, we need to be talking about other
measures about taxation. I agree that we cannot put that off forever,
but at the moment Copenhagen is a very, very important part of the
equation.&#148;</div><a name="10012152000406"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
was the day before the Copenhagen discussions broke down without the
agreement that was
necessary.</div><a name="10012152000407"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
key players in investment in the sector are all talking about the
importance of a carbon price. Vincent de Rivaz, the chief executive of
EDF, wrote in the <i class="I">Financial Times</i> on 8
January:</div><a name="10012152000479"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Some
believe we can leave it to the market to guide the right investments.
But so far it has not done so. The price of carbon is the
key.&#148;</div><a name="10012152000408"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
went
on:</div><a name="10012152000480"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;To
be effective the UK carbon market needs one additional feature: a
floor. This is the most cost-effective way to discourage investment in
carbon-emitting plant and encourage all low-carbon investment including
nuclear, renewables and clean
coal.&#148;</div><a name="10012152000409"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
a submission to the Committee, Centrica told
us:</div><a name="10012152000481"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
clear and long-term floor in the carbon price will provide greater
confidence to investors about the viability of low carbon power
generation within the
market.&#148;</div><a name="10012152000410"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
the evidence sessions we asked witnesses whether they thought that the
carbon price was an important element and would like to see it dealt
with in the Bill. Those from the energy sector were universal in saying
that they thought it was an important
element.</div><a name="10012152000411"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
France, President Sarkozy has indicated that there will be a carbon
floor price, which will start at a low level in some areas&#151;not
across the board&#151;but gradually build up. The power in the new
clause would not require the Government to set a carbon floor price; it
does not set the arrangements for doing so. It would simply provide a
permission, meaning that instead of primary legislation being required
to allow a carbon floor price to be set, it could be done through
secondary legislation, in a much more straightforward way than
requiring a new Act of Parliament. That would start to remove one of
the key areas of uncertainty and unpredictability.</div>
<a name="10012152000412"></a><div class="hs_Para">On nuclear,
the Government have done an enormous amount to remove barriers to
potential new investment, but talking to the companies involved, in
renewables and in carbon capture, one finds that the big remaining
element is concern about carbon. The new clause would give the
Secretary of State the power to give people the certainty they are
looking for, at a time when he feels it would be appropriate. I hope
the Minister will accept it on that
basis.</div><a name="10012152000413"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10012152000691"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Phil Willis</b> (Harrogate and Knaresborough) (LD): We have
come to the final clause, and the hon. Member for Wealden is absolutely
right in saying that this is the most important issue we need to deal
with, regardless of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column439" />Column number: 439</div>whether the Minister accepts the clause. I genuinely hope that she will
accept it, and I compliment the hon. Gentleman on tabling
it.</div><a name="10012152000414"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
the European emissions trading system came in, there was huge hope that
it would drive the reduction of carbon throughout the EU much more
significantly. I understand that the price today is under €13 a
tonne. At that price, it is hardly worth collecting because it has no
incentive at all to force the behaviours of the biggest polluters.
Therefore, the new clause, which is relatively simple in its
construction and would not bind the Government&#146;s hand with
specific prices or dates, would establish the principle that Britain
can lead Europe in creating a floor price for carbon, and that would
enable us to be a major player with other nations around the world in
achieving a global
system.</div><a name="10012152000415"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reality, which I hope the hon. Member for Wealden will accept, is that
we do not need a floor for Europe, but a global carbon trading system.
The only way we will effectively get China, Indonesia and other large
polluters in terms of the use of carbon for energy into a system is to
ensure that there is a significant
cost.</div><a name="10012152000416"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
compliment the hon. Gentleman on his new clause. I hope that the
Minister will support it, and that we can finish our debates in
Committee on an extremely positive, if final,
note.</div><a name="10012152000417"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000692"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> First, I must declare an interest. I am a director
of an anaerobic food waste disposal company, which is perhaps the
greenest of all ways of disposing of waste. That is the point I want to
make: the matter is wider than energy production; it has an impact on a
number of other industries. I ask the Minister to take that into
account when replying to the new
clause.</div><a name="10012152000418"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
whole business of setting a bottom carbon price is massively required
by industry on a wide scale. We need to get on with it very quickly. I
hope the Minister will give us some hope in that
respect.</div><a name="10012152000419"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000693"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> First, it is important that I query what has been
said about France. I have no knowledge of France seeking to establish a
carbon price floor. President Sarkozy has, as I understand it, proposed
a carbon tax, which would be for sectors outside the EU ETS. I think
what has been suggested is not
correct.</div><a name="10012152000420"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
new clause 16, the UK remains strongly committed to using the carbon
market and ensuring that there is a robust carbon price to help drive
emissions reductions and provide certainty for industry. There are,
however, risks involved with the Government intervening in the market
to control the carbon price, so we do not support the introduction of a
price
floor.</div><a name="10012152000421"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is also worth noting that there is no consensus among
industry&#151;indeed there is some strong opposition&#151;that
establishing an EU ETS price floor is the right intervention to drive
investment. The carbon price and its long-term certainty is just one of
many factors&#151;perhaps not the most significant&#151;that
attract investment decisions in low-carbon electricity
generation.</div><a name="10012152000422"></a><div class="hs_Para">Gas
price volatility and its relationship to energy price is a key driver,
as are uncertainty about future electricity demand, the impact of
renewables, the oil price, construction and capital costs, and capacity
factors. The independent Committee on Climate Change noted 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column440" />Column number: 440</div>that supporting the carbon price is one of a number of market
interventions that could help support investment in low-carbon
capacity. Other options it cited included extending the exemption from
the climate change levy to all new low-carbon generators, tendering for
low carbon capacity and introducing a low-carbon
obligation.</div><a name="10012152000423"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government believe that the best approach to give the long-term signal
sought by investors is through setting the right, long-term regulatory
framework with a reducing cap on emissions. Under the revised EU ETS
directive, the EU ETS cap will fall by 1.74 per cent. compared with the
cap in the first carbon budget period each year after 2013. Longer
term, the most effective way of strengthening the carbon price is by
limiting the supply of allowances by tightening the
cap.</div><a name="10012152000424"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
efforts will now be focused on taking forward the work agreed at
Copenhagen to secure an ambitious legal treaty. We are committed to
reviewing and tightening the cap further as part of a move from 20 to
30 per cent. in the EU emissions reduction target for 2020 in the
context of a new global climate agreement. Tightening the EU ETS cap
would deliver a higher carbon price and provide clearer incentives for
investors. In addition, the Government are taking forward work to
ensure that the electricity market framework can most effectively
deliver a fair deal for the consumer and the low-carbon investment
needed in the long term. We will report our initial findings at this
year&#146;s
Budget.</div><a name="10012152000425"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
those reasons, we do not believe that the Government should intervene
in the carbon price. We are tightening the cap and reducing emissions.
That is the way forward. Indeed, as the hon. Member for Harrogate and
Knaresborough said, it is important to have global trading systems and
link them, but an intervention by one nation in the carbon price would
be incredibly problematic in the global carbon market that we are
trying to achieve. That has to be the future and that is what we are
concentrating
upon.</div><a name="10012152000426"></a>

co-Chairman, Mr. Atkinson, and to all those who have made
these proceedings possible. I extend particular thanks to the
officials, who have been extremely
assiduous.</div><a name="10012152000451"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have failed to make progress on the Bill. It may have to return to
another place so that we can change it  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column442" />Column number: 442</div>for the better, as happened with the previous Energy Bill. My favourite
rebuke was from the Minister when she rejected an argument of mine by
saying:</div><a name="10012152000483"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
cannot dispute the hon. Gentleman&#146;s intellectual
argument.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Energy
Public Bill Committee, </i>19 January 2010; c.

still disagreed with it though. We have had good discussions, but sadly
we have not made much progress. Nevertheless, we thank you,
Mr. Bayley, and the Clerk and the other officials for
running things so
smoothly.</div><a name="10012152000453"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10012152000712"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> Thanks to you, Mr. Bayley, and to your
co-Chairman, Mr. Atkinson, on behalf of my hon. Friend the
Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough and me. We join in the thanks to
the Ministers and the Conservative and SNP representatives for their
courteous participation. We also thank all those who in their different
roles have supported us as a Committee. Without them, we would not be
able to get on with our
business.</div><a name="10012152000454"></a><div class="hs_Para">I,
too, am frustrated that the Bill is unamended. We will have further
goes in the Chamber and elsewhere, and I hope that at the end of the
process it will be a better Bill. We have certainly flushed out a lot
of issues, and I hope that we have done the public a decent service
with our
deliberations.</div><a name="10012152000455"></a>

debating the
