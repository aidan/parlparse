                  </strong> Good morning, everyone. Before we begin, I have a
few preliminary announcements. It is not particularly warm, but if hon.
Members want to remove any articles of clothing, that is perfectly
acceptable. Please will all hon. Members ensure that mobile phones and
pagers are turned off. I will not be pompous and draw attention to it,
but I can hear phones when they go off, and our proceedings are being
broadcast. Devices should be placed on silent mode during the
proceedings.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000008">&#160;</a>

inform hon. Members that as a general rule, I and my fellow Chairman do
not intend to call starred amendments that have not been tabled with
adequate notice. We are blessed with a wise Clerk, who will help hon.
Members if they do not understand proceedings, and I am sure that if
that can all be done privately, we will proceed efficiently. The
required notice period in Public Bill Committees is three working days.
Therefore, amendments should be tabled by the rise of the House on a
Monday for consideration on a Thursday and by the rise of the House on
a Thursday for consideration on a
Tuesday.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000009">&#160;</a>

realise that although it is 16 months since the election, not everyone
has served on a Public Bill Committee before. We are here to help. They
may not be familiar with the procedure in Public Bill Committees, so I
will briefly outline the way in which we proceed. The Committee will
first be asked to consider the programme motion on the amendment paper,
on which debate is limited to half an hour. Then we will proceed to a
motion to report written evidence, much of which is arriving. Then we
will begin line-by-line consideration of the Bill. I first call the
Minister to move the programme motion agreed by the Programming
Sub-Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000010">&#160;</a>

                  </span> Like the Minister, I welcome
the opportunity to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Amess. This is the
first time that I have done so. Your reputation runs well before you.
You are a fair but firm Chairman. I have made this comment before: I
hope that you will be fair with us but firm with the people on the
other side of the room. I am sure that that will be the case and that
your wisdom but also your wit will keep us in order and at least
slightly amused as
well.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000014">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is good to see the rest of the Committee assembled here. I see many
bright eyes and bushy tails, so we can look forward to an interesting
set of debates. The matter at hand is the programme motion. The House
is aware, because we raised the issue on Second Reading, that we are
uncomfortable—I will seek a ruling from you on this in due
course, Mr Amess—with the fact that members of the public were
able to make representations on the Bill only prior to its appearance
in the House of Lords. After having made that point in the House, I was
told that it is the convention with a House of Lords Bill, which this
is, for evidence to be taken from witnesses at the time at which the
Bill appears in the other place. Of course that is true, but it seems
to me that although conventions are there to take heed of and to pay
careful attention to, they should be flexible enough to allow for some
variation from time to
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000015">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">This
Bill changed very substantially between the point at which it was
tabled in the other place and when it was put in front of us. It is now
such a different Bill. Moreover, large numbers of people believe that
we should have had the opportunity to hear from interested members of
the public. I wonder whether any other Member has had the pleasure of
receiving several hundred e-mails per hour in favour of S4C. Perhaps it
happened only to myself and one or two others. I must say that my
knowledge of written Welsh is not as strong as it should be. I was
helped by the fact that there was a translation at the bottom of the
page.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000016">&#160;</a>

                  </span> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman
for giving way so early in our proceedings. I can confirm to the
Committee that I too have received several hundred e-mails. I just
wanted to say that the translation into English is fully equivalent,
and I hope that hon. Members scrolled down the page and spotted that
particular
facility.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000017">&#160;</a>

                  <strong> </strong>We did scroll down, although after doing
so several hundred times we decided that all of them were quite similar
in character. The point I wanted to make was that it is unusual to
receive that number of e-mails. Given that the Government’s
ideas on S4C and other serious matters have evolved, it might have been
a 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 5<a class="bkMark" name="Column5">&#160;</a>
                  </div>reasonable idea for us to have had the opportunity to hear from
interested members of the public before we decided
how to proceed.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000018">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">S4C is a
serious matter. We know that it is a major national issue in Wales.
Equally important, though—or perhaps even more
important—is the chief coroner issue, which is a serious matter.
I totally accept that the Government have a point of view, and we will
hear it argued later. The truth is that many people in our country,
including the relatives of people in the armed forces who have fallen,
are deeply concerned about the decision to press ahead with changes to
the manner in which we deal with the coronial service. The British
Legion has been to see me—and probably other Members,
too—and said that this is not the right decision. It would have
liked the opportunity to say a few words here, so that we could
understand its point of view. We do not necessarily have to accept what
the British Legion has to say about the coronial service, but the
organisation does represent our heroes and there is no difference
between the various sides represented here about the esteem in which we
hold it.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000019">&#160;</a>

been good—and it still may be—for us to have found time
to listen to witnesses. There are other people, too. I noticed that the
safety in sports ground issue, which I will refer to later, is also up
for abolition. Tens of thousands of people went on the website that No.
10 created, which is a good innovation, to talk about what happened at
Hillsborough. There will be relatives of people who died at
Hillsborough who have a view about how safety at sports grounds can be
guaranteed. They might well have wanted an opportunity to make their
points. I raise these matters not in a partisan way—we will be
partisan from time to time—but to say that the wisdom of the
House is that if we are to bridge the gulf between ourselves as
politicians and the wider public, we have to open up our procedures and
processes. No. 10 has set up this site, which is a good innovation, and
said that if 100,000 people sign a petition it can be debated and voted
on in the
House.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000020">&#160;</a>

On the question of how we are to conduct ourselves over the next few
weeks, I seek your advice, Mr Amess, on whether it is still possible
for the Committee to find a little time, if the Government are prepared
to do so, to listen to some key witnesses. That would perhaps help the
people in S4C; at least they would know that their voice was being
heard—if only briefly—by this Committee. Others may have
points to make on the
matter.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000021">&#160;</a>

for a number of the sittings currently scheduled within the programme

Programming Sub-Committee. There would be an opportunity within the
current programme motion for the Government, if they chose, to come
back and say they are willing to break and take evidence.
Alternatively, the Opposition are happy to add sittings to the
programme motion in order to invite people in to give evidence. I place
that before the Committee because the Opposition are keen to ensure
full scrutiny of the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000025">&#160;</a>

be happy to look again at the programme motion and break at any point
to take evidence, or to add sittings. To be fair to the Government, I
think there is sufficient time within the programme motion to consider
the Bill in some detail. We do not have a particular axe to grind on
the out-date of the Bill, but we think it would be good to have
additional scrutiny and the opportunity for witnesses to attend the

               <p class="tabbed">I add to the
call for witnesses to this Committee. As a lawyer, I am concerned about
some of the powers in the Bill. I have never read any Harry Potter
books. I got to the first page and thought it was not for me; it was
not my level. However, reading the Bill, indeed the first clause, is
like waving a magic wand and saying, “Expelliarmus! You are
out.” That causes me, as a lawyer, great concern. I have had to
write to some of the bodies affected by the Bill because I am not clear
what consultation has taken place. I would like to ask the Minister:
what consultation has taken place with these bodies? We are talking
about huge, important serious bodies such as the Human Tissue Authority
and the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. They all have
brand names. They are going to be shoved into an organisation. I have
sat on the Health Committee, so I have seen and heard the way the Care
Quality Commission operates and I have serious concerns about
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000031">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I would like
to know what consultation has taken place, and whether we can look at
the possibility of hearing evidence from some of these serious bodies,
because the powers in the Bill are huge. The Minister might happen to
be in a good mood on one day, and decide to absorb and get rid of some
of the bodies, but he might be in another mood on another day and
decide 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 7<a class="bkMark" name="Column7">&#160;</a>
                  </div>that he does not want to do so. As someone who did constitutional law,
that rankles. I plead with the Minister to allow those bodies to come
forward; whether they do so in Welsh or English, I do not
mind.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000032">&#160;</a>

                  </span> It is a great pleasure to
serve under your chairmanship, Mr Amess. I would like to express my
view that it is imperative that witnesses are called to the Committee,
simply to broaden and deepen our knowledge of certain issues. I, too,
have received many e-mails about S4C, which reflects in no small part
how important this issue is across Wales. If one goes back into the
history of the Welsh-language channel, when Welsh-language broadcasting
was first mentioned in this House—I think it was in the 1930s,
although obviously I do not remember that—the speaker was
laughed at. Things have changed so much, however, and one might argue
that the reason why S4C exists is because listening took place at a
very senior level. The opportunity to call witnesses is important. Many
Members of Parliament have said that they were unaware of the strength
of feeling until receiving such e-mails, and it would be even better if
we heard from witnesses in person as well as via
e-mail.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000033">&#160;</a>

interrupting you, Mr Amess. I am, like others, grateful for the
opportunity to endorse the comments that the hon. Member for Clwyd
South, in particular, has made about S4C and the need to broaden the
information base of members of the Committee. She and I both have the
luxury of serving on the Welsh Affairs Committee and of having
undertaken a detailed inquiry, and, of course, there was also an
extensive debate in the House of Lords on the matter. The debate has
moved on sufficiently in Wales for many of us who have a Welsh interest
to take evidence from S4C and from other interested parties such as
Cymdeithas, but I suspect that there is a slight bafflement or
bemusement among other members of the Committee. The opportunity to
call witnesses, not least because the Opposition have said that that
could happen within the existing time frame, would be immensely
helpful.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000035">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I wanted to
say to Members at the outset that this whole procedure of taking
evidence before the Committee stages of Bills is quite new; indeed, I
chaired the first 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 8<a class="bkMark" name="Column8">&#160;</a>
                  </div>evidence session. The procedure is only just over two years old. We are
in new territory here. If we want to break precedent—I am
looking at the two Whips—I know that things
are normally done through the usual channels, and
there could be a discussion when we break at 10.25 am. It is, however,
a matter for the Committee ordinarily in consideration of the
resolution of its Programming Sub-Committee, to determine whether it
wants to take evidence. Of course, I chaired that committee. Hon.
Members should know that it has not been the practice for Committees on
Bills starting in the Lords to take oral evidence, but there is no
prohibition in the Standing Orders on their doing so. This is the first
time that I, whether as a Chairman or ordinary Member, have had all
these e-mails. I am not even computer literate and I do not quite
understand, although I am now told there is an English translation.
This is a new phenomenon and it is entirely up to the Committee to
decide.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000037">&#160;</a>

Committee will have noted your remarks about your susceptibility to
flattery. You can expect to bathe in the stuff over the next few
sittings. In a way, we have had this debate before. The Government take
great pride in our commitment to transparency and genuine consultation.
But the programme motion was agreed at the meeting of the Programming
Sub-Committee and we will not change our mind. You made it clear what
is considered precedent and process here. I think the Committee needs
to be reminded that evidence sessions were never programmed for Bills
starting in the Lords under the previous Administration. So the current
passion for doing so seems to be a conversion on the road to Committee
Room 9.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000038">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">We know full
well that the Bill contains substantial powers, as the hon. Member for
Walsall South said. Some of the issues underlying the proposed reforms
are extremely emotive, such as the Coroners Bill and S4C. We understand
that completely. The debate so far has missed an important point in
terms of the Bill’s objectives. It is an enabling Bill, which
allows Departments and Ministers to come to the House with secondary
legislation on proposed reforms. Clause 10 makes it quite clear that in
each of those cases there is to be appropriate and adequate
consultation on the specific proposed reforms. Therefore the public
will have an opportunity at that secondary stage to make their views
known. As you made clear right at the start, Mr Amess, there is nothing
to stop the public making written submissions to the Committee at this
early stage. So I must make it clear that the Government are not
prepared to change their mind.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000039">&#160;</a>

force a Division, but I am prepared to do so. When the orders are
placed before the House, will there be an opportunity for the British
Legion or S4C to appear before the House to give their opinions? I

said earlier, both the emotive issues mentioned so far have been
extensively debated in the House of Lords. As we speak, the Departments
responsible for those reforms are in consultation with the bodies.
There is a very active process of engagement on these issues. But there
is no precedent for evidence sessions for Bills that start in the
Lords. It is a duplication of scrutiny as far as we are concerned and

                  </strong> If all the votes are as close as that, we could
be in for an interesting sitting. I dare say we will all be hanging on
the edge of our seats as the votes are counted. Nonetheless, one would
hope that there will not be too many Divisions, as, in principle, there
should not be a great gap between the parties. The truth is that the
non-departmental public bodies, which are more popularly called
quangos, have grown exponentially over the years and that is not
something that anyone can view with great pride. All parties, when in
government, have seen quangos being created. To an extent, they are
unaccountable bodies because they stand independent of the state. They
stand independent from the normal agencies of the state, which report
through Parliament and via Ministers. They also stand aloof from the
general community.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000073">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">A few moments
ago, I referred to the gap that appears to be opening up between the
governed and those who govern. The idea of an unaccountable state and
of bureaucracies that are frequently enormous and remote is one that no
one can view with equanimity. In principle, we are all agreed that
there should be a careful review. It is good that the Government have
agreed on an ongoing basis, as was said in the House yesterday, to
review the agencies that have been created. We want to agree with the
general principle of the Bill. Moreover, we want to deal expeditiously
with the Bill. We will not be indulging in any delaying
tactics.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000074">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">At the same
time, Parliament itself determined that the exercising of a particular
public function, whether it is S4C, the coronial service or whatever,
should be done in an independent way. Ministers must have had their
reasons for saying that this would be better dealt with at arm’s
length from the normal systems of accountability. Therefore, it is
incumbent on us to look carefully at the changes that are being made.
As the Opposition party, it is our duty to ask searching questions both
about the powers that the Minister is giving to himself and his
successors and about the agencies that he intends to abolish, change,
merge, adjust or reform. Our purpose is to address the meat of the
Bill—the schedules—in some detail, but also to ask
questions about the powers that the Minister has given
himself.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000075">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">Clause
1 is one of the five clauses that deal with ministerial powers to
change the structure of these non-departmental bodies, and it has two
parts to it. The first part gives the power to a Minister to abolish,
by order, bodies or offices specified in schedule 1. The Committee will
gather that we have no problem with a Minister holding that power,
provided that it is exercised in a reasonable way. Later in the Bill,
we will see that other powers might be exercised in a way that is not
reasonable, but for the moment we have no quarrel with Ministers having
the power to abolish such bodies, provided that that is done
appropriately.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000076">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">However,
the second part of clause 1 worries me. When we reflect on the quango
state, we recall that those institutions were created because
Parliament decided that their functions were necessary to the
community—they were in the public interest—but that they
should not be exercised by Ministers
directly.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000077">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> From time to time, all Governments of whatever
party have attempted to take what might be described as Henry VIII
powers. Henry VIII himself certainly took those powers. Whether he used
an Act of Parliament to do that, I am not sure. Perhaps he just took
administrative measures. However, the truth is that all Ministers are
tempted to do that. Generally, the two Houses will look with some
dismay at such powers. Many Members on the other side of the Committee
believe themselves to be, and no doubt are, libertarians and do not
want to see an enhanced power for the centralised state. The Minister
is a reasonable man. He would not wish to create an over-mighty
Executive who were not properly accountable to Parliament. When we get
to the relevant clauses, we will want to ask searching questions, as
Members in the other place did—and the Bill is very different as
a
consequence.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000079">&#160;</a>

the previous Parliament, there was a great deal of controversy and some
consternation among Conservative Members about the legislative
competence order mechanism that was used to confer powers on the Welsh
Assembly Government. Some very good points were made. I cannot at the
moment spot any hon. Members who might have made those points, but that
was a controversy then and the argument seemed to be going the other
way at that
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000080">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention.
I will look with interest at <em>Hansard</em> and particularly at those
comments made by members of the Committee who were here in the previous
Parliament, although there are not many of them. Perhaps we can use
some of those phrases to help our thinking—to clarify what is in
our own
minds.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000081">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
point that I was attempting to reach relates to clause 1(3). To follow
the thread of the argument that I was making, at the time when each of
the bodies was created, Parliament had established to its own
satisfaction that there was a social need or a public function that
needed to be met or exercised. At that stage, it decided that that
function should be exercised by an independent body albeit a state
body. The Government propose that that power should either cease
or—this is more likely—be exercised in another way, in
another institutional form.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000082">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">What does
clause 1(3)(a) to (e) do? In effect, it says, “We acknowledge
that, when we abolish a particular body”—let us take
safety at sports grounds as an example—“it may contain
functions or residual functions that we would like to see continue, but
we don’t want them to be exercised by a quango.” That is
the core of the Bill. The Ministers and his advisers have clearly gone
away and thought, “Hang on a minute, this is a great
idea—let’s abolish quangos.” We all applaud that.
We do not want to see more quangos than necessary. However, if we stop
and think for a minute, what happens to the function or residual

quango?<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000083">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That
leaves the Minister with a problem. His solution is to create some
other bodies to carry out the functions with which the quangos are
currently charged. They will not, however, be called quangos, but
something different. They will be some other kind of institution. That
is the problem that all Governments have faced. How do we deal with
this? These are sometimes delicate 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 12<a class="bkMark" name="Column12">&#160;</a>
                  </div>functions that, frankly, Ministers ought not to get
involved in. On human embryology, for example, it is clear that the
most difficult ethical, scientific and technical problems are connected
with it. On S4C, politicians ought not to get involved in how a
television station is organised. They definitely ought not to be
engaged in the process of human embryology. We can provide guidance,
but at the end of the day some of the questions are very difficult.
Therefore, it will be necessary for those functions to continue to be
exercised, but the Minister says that we will not exercise them via a
quango.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000084">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">What
does the Minister say he will do in clause 1(3)? He says that he will
set up an “eligible person” who will be required to
exercise the functions. That essentially explains what clause 1 does.
Clauses 2, 3, 4 and 5 include references to eligible
persons, because in some cases quangos will not be abolished but merged
and their functions will be handed on to a successor body. That is the
core of the whole Bill and it is the knotty problem with which the
Minister must have wrestled with his
advisers.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000085">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
would suggest that the Minister has had problems. None of the solutions
are totally satisfactory and our amendments are intended to help. I
imagine that the problem has been difficult for the Minister. He
suggests five eligible persons. I am not a lawyer, but “eligible
person” is a legal expression. Clearly, a person can have a
corporeal form, like most members of the Committee—as far as I
know, we are all

be a legal person, as in law, non-human beings can also be persons.
Therefore, the term “eligible person” refers not to you

look at clause 1(3)(e)—I will do this in more detail
shortly—we will see that it contains an extraordinary two
separate bodies corporate. One is “a body of
trustees”—I will come to that in a moment—but what
is alarming is the “unincorporated body of persons.” As I
have said, I am not a lawyer, so I went to Google—perhaps even
you do this, Mr Amess—and typed “unincorporated body of
persons.” The first thing that appeared was that an
unincorporated body of persons is a legal nonentity. So my mate Bill
and his two friends who go down to the Brown Cow in our village could,
if they had a committee meeting, be argued to be an unincorporated body
of persons. They would have no legal

number of these bodies have fairly large consultative groups related to
them.  
<div class="columnNumber">

                  </div>Even though the powers of the body that are to be transferred may rest
with an individual or a group of individuals, many of these
organisations have large consultative structures that debate with the
public about their strategic priorities. The case could be made that
the consultative approach of such an organisation would be narrowed by
its transfer to an individual or perhaps one or two individuals as he
is
outlining.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000090">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> That is a very important point. That is why
after much discussion we have tabled amendments that call on the
Minister to produce regulations that we can then scrutinise. The
regulations must indicate precisely how all those structures are going
to be incorporated into the instrument that the Minister is
creating.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000091">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let us take
safety at sports grounds as an example. I referred to Hillsborough a
few moments ago. There is clearly a problem from time to time with
large crowds in sporting venues, who are sometimes difficult to
control. We have seen that throughout the world. We saw the most
devastating series of personal tragedies at Hillsborough, and
elsewhere. I believe my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester South has
two sports grounds in his constituency. He will be concerned that the
quango that deals with this is to be abolished. He will want some
assurance that that function will continue and that it will be handed
over to a proper body.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000092">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The proposal
that it can be handed over to Charlie and his mates at the Brown Cow or
a similar group in a pub in Leicester is extraordinary. The people of
Leicester want to know that the lives of the people who go to matches
at those rugby and football grounds are properly protected. Later we
will want to know how the bodies that will be abolished were chosen,
but for the moment we want to know which bodies will be handed over to
which types or class of eligible person. After all, it is odd to
imagine that a private company, even one that is not profit making and
is limited by guarantee could manage the safety of the people of
Leicester. That cannot be right. There is no indication in the Bill
exactly which legal vehicle will be used for which body that will be
abolished. Yet the power of abolition and the concept of eligible
person are in the same
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000093">&#160;</a>

the disaster, everyone in the country was alarmed at what had happened.
The Government at the time, with the support of every party, agreed a
way forward: the standards that should be expected from grounds of a
certain size and calibre, and a way in which they could be financed;
and a way in which safety at football grounds could be secured and
monitored. As part of that, as the Committee is aware, it was
recommended that a separate authority should be established.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000095">&#160;</a>

friends or relatives who go, or we ourselves go, to football matches,

proceed with the abolition, how will he decide how the Football
Licensing Authority will be administered and how will he decide the
type of eligible person? None of the independent bodies listed in
subsection (3)(c), (d) and (e) would work. They would not work very
well for S4C, and for things such as embryology and safety at sports
grounds they simply would not work. We will try to help by suggesting

the big society seem to be narrowing it down. I do not claim that
quangos are part of the big society—they are part of the
bureaucratic state and ought to be accountable—and I am not
convinced that the answer is simply to renationalise those functions.
Yet subsection (3)(a) and (b) effectively states that the
residual functions that we have just discussed should be repatriated
into the state. The Government say that they are a libertarian
operation and that they want to see the diminution of the state and the
expansion of the civil society, the  good society, or whatever
expression we agree on. It is extraordinary that the Conservative
party, supported perhaps—I do not know, we will see—by
the Lib Dems, is saying, “We want to renationalise a whole
series of functions.” The Labour party, in our modesty, as the
true agency of the good society, wants to say, “Hang on a
minute. Do you really want to renationalise things like embryology
research, safety at sports grounds, S4C, or any of the other
functions?” I do not think

succinct way. There may be some Divisions, but I hope that is not the
case. The Minister is a reasonable person and we hope to convince him.
The Government have already voted to exclude witnesses. Frankly, I
would be amazed, looking at the manifestos and personal political
credos of Government members of the Committee, if any one of them had
ever said that they believed in the renationalisation of state
functions. Clearly, that is what the clause will achieve. Clause
1(3)(a) clearly states 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 15<a class="bkMark" name="Column15">&#160;</a>
                  </div>that the Minister regards—this is the core agenda—an
“eligible person”, who will be the recipient of these
residual functions, to be a Minister, a Scottish Minister or a Minister
of one of the other devolved Administrations. There is no other way of
putting it: there is a democratic deficit in how it works at the
moment. Is it beyond the wit of Parliament to come up with other ways
of increasing democratic accountability without repatriating functions

state?<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000101">&#160;</a>

were made by many of my hon. Friends earlier about the wide-ranging
powers in the Bill and the failure of the Committee to take evidence.
The problem is that the independence of many of these bodies is
crucial. I notice that, after consultation, Ministers changed their
minds about the original decision to include the Office of the
Children’s Commissioner. Having worked very closely with the
Children’s Commissioner over many years, I know that the
independence of that body is essential. Because of the wide-ranging
powers in the clause, we have no guarantee about where those bodies
will be placed—not just those in the Bill, but for any body that
the Minister chooses to pick on in the future. That is why, though it
is very entertaining, my hon. Friend’s speech and the point that
he is making is very important.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000102">&#160;</a>

points that I am trying to make. It is important to communicate my
concern about this issue properly. It is good to do so in a reasonably
light-hearted way, but there are some serious problems in the way that
this will operate.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000103">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We have no
idea whatever about which body, or class of bodies, will be used for
each of the organisations that are in schedule 1. We have do not have a
clue. Clause 1(3) indicates the only kind of eligible person
that the Minister envisages to be fit to be a recipient of the residual
functions. It may be that some residual functions could be appropriated
back into the civil service. We are not opposed to that in principle,
but we want assurance, either in this debate or in the debate on
schedule 1, that none of the more sensitive functions—most of
them are sensitive—will be exercised by politicians directly.
For example, control of a TV station ought to be nowhere near a
Minister. That is currently the case.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000104">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There is a
secondary problem with the eligible person issue. Once the Minister
decides what class of eligible person is appropriate for which residual
function, the next job is for the Minister to then decide, and no doubt
submit it to the House in due course, which company or other vehicle
within that class will be used to carry out that function. Let us take,
for example, a company limited by guarantee. Let us say, for example,
that the Minister thinks that S4C being administered by a company
limited by guarantee is a good idea. First, he would have to explain
why he wanted such a company. Secondly, there is a possibly more
important question of which company should exercise that
function.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000105">&#160;</a>

there is an inconsistency here? They want to have control over S4C, but

a distinguished record of service in Government. He knows how
Government work, and how sometimes Government do not work, but we will
not discuss that because that has been the subject of various books to
which we do not want to refer here. He is right that the Minister is
clearly quite advanced in some of his considerations, but my point is a
different one. If the Committee bears with me, I want to come on to the
general principle behind the types of “eligible person”
on which he has latched—none of which work for one reason or
another. We have tabled amendments which, in the cases of (c) (d) and
parts of (e), ask the Minister to bring forward regulations, because we
want to know how this will work before we can agree on the kind of
powers that he is arrogating to himself. If he cannot convince us how
this will work, we have to question whether the Committee should give
him the powers that he seeks.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000117">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Once the
Minister has decided on the class of vehicle to use, how will he choose
the appropriate instrument to carry out those residual functions? There
are thousands and thousands of bodies corporate that come under the
title of “company limited by guarantee”. He has two ways
in which to proceed. He can go out to tender, which is clean, but there
may be no single body corporate within that class that is fit to
tender. We need to know how he will decide into which class the
particular residual function will go and how he will make such
decisions, so I want a generic discussion rather than one that deals
with each specific item. Secondly, once he has decided the class of
instrument, how will he decide which corporate body will give that
residual function? If we think about it, if we decide to go out to
tender for S4C or for any of the other bodies, we invite all companies
limited by guarantee in the country to make a submission. Think of the
complexity of the tender document and the tender judgments that will
then have to be made.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000118">&#160;</a>

these bodies and their functions transferred out to community-based
organisations or co-operatives, but the cost of doing so may well drive
a Minister to decide that it is far cheaper and easier to keep the

to. It is difficult to imagine that the tendering process is the right
way in which to do it. My hon. Friend is right; the temptation will be
to go for what I will provocatively describe as
nationalisation—to take the powers back in house—and we
will want to resist that.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000120">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The tendering
process is complex and extremely expensive. We have asked the Minister
to publish regulations, telling us how he intends to proceed. He does
not necessarily have to do it now, but he can agree to our amendment
and produce the regulations. Then we could debate how a tendering
process would work. I think something other than tendering will be
used: the Minister will set up made-for-purpose bodies. I think they
will say, “It is too complicated, too expensive and too
difficult to tender. How do we secure the right levels of technical
expertise and independence from the existing sector?” Civil
servants will say to the Minister, “We have had a good idea,
Minister. Set up a company limited by guarantee.” I imagine that
is what is currently being whispered in the Minister’s
ear.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000121">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The problem
with that is cronyism. The Minister would never be tempted into
cronyism, but there has been a debate in the press about the Secretary
of State for Education, who has handed over large sums to the New
Schools Network to deal with free schools. Whether or not we agree with
free schools is a separate issue. They may be a new set of quangos, but
we will leave that debate to another day. The point is that the New
Schools Network is managed by a possibly very able young person who was
known to the Secretary of State while he was an Opposition Member, and
she is now the recipient of very large amounts of money. It may be that
she is the only person in the country who is capable of carrying out
the function. However, the Secretary of State left himself open to the
charge of
cronyism.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000122">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I return to
the amendment to clause 1(3)(c), which calls for regulations to be
published by the Minister. I want regulations published because I want
to know how the Minister will decide which company within that class is
to be the one that administers the residual function. I will keep to
that point, which is the one I 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 19<a class="bkMark" name="Column19">&#160;</a>
                  </div>thought I was making, though perhaps I had strayed. The regulations
should indicate how the Minister is to do that, and whether he will be
minded to set up purpose-built bodies outside the public sector. Those
regulations should indicate the considerations he will bear in mind at
that point. Otherwise, if he sets up purpose-built companies to handle
public functions using public money, he will leave himself open, if he
is not careful, to the charge of cronyism. That was the point I was
trying to make, and I hope I have made it more relevant to the
amendment. We want to hear how he intends to do
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000125">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
want to deal in detail with the kind of instruments or eligible persons
the Minister is proposing and explain, given the context I have just
provided, why we have tabled the amendment. I have already asked him to
indicate how he will decide, if the Committee and the House proceed
with the idea that the five bodies should be the eligible persons. How
will he decide which eligible person, or category of eligible person,
is the most appropriate for each function? That is why we have tabled
the amendment calling for regulations. Having done that, will he then
indicate precisely how he intends to decide which instrument to use
within that class?<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000126">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I also want
the Minister to address the point exemplified in the amendments. Will
he table regulations, as in my amendments, which indicate how
ministerial or democratic control will be exercised over eligible
persons (c), (d) and (e), if it has been decided that the residual
function will reside with one of those three bodies? That is the reason
why we tabled amendments asking for detail in regulations. We would
like the regulations to address three issues in particular. I hope to
convince you, Mr Amess, that the questions the regulations
need to address indicate that the instruments the Minister proposes are
not the appropriate eligible persons. With that in mind, I proceed to
the main part of what I want to say.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000127">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
regulations should address three issues, which we will seek absolute
assurance on. I am particularly addressing paragraphs (c), (d) and (e),
because it is clear that eligible persons covered by paragraphs (a) and
(b) will be under direct ministerial and civil service control.
Paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) cover independent bodies of one kind or
another—we could say that they reinvent the quango in a
different corporate form. First, how will we ensure that the assets
transferred as part of the exercise of the residual function are
retained for public use? We want to know how we will secure an asset
lock, which should be part of the regulations. Secondly, we want
certainty about how the budgets of the bodies will be managed. Again,
that is to secure the public interest and should also be in the
regulations. Finally, how will the personnel issues of eligible persons
(c), (d) and (e) be dealt with in the regulations to ensure that the
kinds of salaries paid to chief executives do not continue? If we read
the newspapers, we will be well aware that some quango chief executives
are being paid totally ridiculous sums. I accept that quite a bit of
that happened on our watch. I am not making a partisan point. The
regulations should indicate how we will control all three kinds of
body.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000128">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
general point about paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) goes to the heart of
the argument. In any independent or private corporate body, there will
normally be conflict 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 20<a class="bkMark" name="Column20">&#160;</a>
                  </div>between the interests of its members and the wider community interest.
It is most clear in a plc that the duty is to both the shareholders and
the customers. There is always that conflict and I worry that unless
the regulations are specific and precise, the budgets, assets or
personnel functions of eligible persons (c), (d) and (e) might be used
to benefit the members of the company rather than the wider community
interest—the residual function I described earlier.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000129">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There would
be outrage with the Administration, and with us if we voted in favour,
if, for example, administration of youth justice fell under a body
under paragraph (c) —a company limited by
guarantee—that used its obligations to its members to reimburse
them with exorbitant amounts at public expense or by disposing of
assets. The lack of an asset lock worries me. Regulations should
indicate exactly how the Minister will deal with those problems. To be
fair to him, he has totally excluded plcs from being eligible persons,
and I congratulate him on that. It is the right decision and we support
it, but vehicles (c), (d) and (e), which he wants to specify as
eligible persons, raise problems for us. Without the regulations being
published, it is difficult to see how he intends to deal with the
problems.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000130">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Our
amendments would help the Minister by removing the legal nonentity of
“unincorporated body of persons” under paragraph (e), by
asking him to make regulations indicating how he intends to deal with
the points that I have raised and by suggesting two other forms of
corporate vehicle that would do both the things that I want, first by
guaranteeing an asset lock, so that the assets are not used for the
private interests of the members of the company and, secondly, by
ensuring that the company works only in the interests of the community
and not in the interests of its
members.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000131">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
do not want to bore the Committee, because I found it incredibly
tedious, but we can look in some detail at the kind of institutions
that the Minister is recommending—I assume that they were
recommended to him by his civil servants—and none of them quite
works. The Government have produced an organogram that looks at all the
various institutional forms that are not-for-profit companies and
clearly illustrates my point: none of the three institutions that he is
talking about, companies limited by guarantee, community interest
companies or trusts, has an asset lock that prevents the assets from
being used for the private interests of the company’s members.
Nor is there a guarantee in any of those institutions that they will
operate purely in the community interest.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000132">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To some
extent, that might be locked up with a contractual arrangement, but the
truth is that it is difficult to imagine how a contractual arrangement
can be so structured as to prevent the members of the company saying,
“We will meet the community objectives, but in doing so, we are
going to harness ourselves by using the profit motive and reimbursing
ourselves.” Remember, we already have a quango with its chief
executive on £700,000 a year. Some of these people might be
tempted to give themselves pay rises if we put them into the private
not-for profit sector. There is a distinction between paying dividends
to shareholders and reimbursing executives.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000133">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I want to see
all those things addressed in the regulations or I shall remain totally
unconvinced. I am prepared to produce the evidence, but I will not,
because other people wish to speak, that paragraphs (c), (d) or (e)
have neither an asset lock nor a singular commitment to the community
interest.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000134">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
tabled two further amendments. Those suggested other corporate vehicles
that would achieve what the Minister wants, but which would have both
an asset lock and a commitment to the community interest. I
have had to table a third amendment on co-ops. I mention that because I
know that the hon. Members for Dover and for Esher and Walton have
tabled an amendment on co-ops. We are very much in favour of co-ops. It
may be a late conversion, but the Government share that commitment
nowadays. That is good and welcome.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000135">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Generally
speaking, co-ops have to operate in the interest of their members,
whether it is the workers or those who own the shares. That is a duty
on most co-ops. We want institutions that serve the public. The hon.
Member for Dover has to convince the Committee that a co-op can work in
the interests of the community, and not in the interests of its
members. Otherwise, the public will say, “What has happened?
They’ve abolished a quango and replaced it with a co-op, and the
co-op is operating on behalf of its members and not on behalf of the
residual function that was left behind after the quango was
abolished.”<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000136">&#160;</a>

in effect creates a private institution that begins to reimburse
itself. That is the problem with co-ops sui generis. I also tabled an
amendment about co-ops, although I have withdrawn it, because they
present a knotty problem. How will a co-op, which is obliged to operate
in the interests of its members, at the same time operate in the wider
community interest?<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000138">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To go back to
sports grounds, for example, the community interest is that the sports
ground is properly constructed and managed. If the sports
ground’s residual body becomes a co-op, if we are not careful
the primary duty of the co-op will be to its members rather than to
ensuring the safety of the sports ground. The objective of the co-op is
to protect the sports grounds, but its primary duty in law is to its
members. That is the problem with all the proposed instruments, and the
way

                  </div>around it is for the Minister to make regulations, as our amendments
would require him to do, that clearly indicate how he intends to deal
with this problem of dual accountability. The central problem in clause
1 is that a private institution, whether a co-op or a company limited
by guarantee, is obliged to look after its members, but the rest of
society expects it to carry out its objectives with no reference to the
private interests of its
members.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000139">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> My hon. Friend has given me a lesson in brevity.
Perhaps I could have said all that I have said over the past hour in
three minutes. You have got the wrong guy, I am afraid, Mr
Amess.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000141">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let me come
to the point. We spoke to the Library and got a Library note, and we
spoke to various lawyers who specialise in this area. Of course, in
opposition we have no support from the civil service. We believe that
including a registered charity and a community interest society as
eligible persons in clause 1 would achieve what the Minister wants and
provide the reassurances that we and the wider public need. Neither of
those bodies can operate purely in the interests of its members, and a
registered charity has to operate according to charitable objectives.
It is extraordinary that a Government committed to the big society have
not included registered charities. Why have they not done so? We
included registered charities in our amendments as a solution to the
problem.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000142">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Community
interest societies are similar. They have an asset lock and they are
obliged to work in the interests of the wider community rather than in
the interests of their members. Even charities do not have an asset
lock, so if the Minister agrees that they might be a useful instrument,
we would require him to explain, either in regulations or in his
response, how he intends to secure that. After all, part of the Bill
concerns the transfer of assets, and we may hand over buildings or
large amounts of land. What if a company decides to flog them off and
use part of the assets to reimburse itself? We need an asset lock. That
is established in charity law; almost all big society organisations and
literature describe the need for an asset lock. I make these points not
to delay the Committee—I promised speed and
expedition—but because they are serious matters that we want the
Minister to address before we decide whether to press the amendment to
a vote.<a class="bkMark" name="11090848000143">&#160;</a>
