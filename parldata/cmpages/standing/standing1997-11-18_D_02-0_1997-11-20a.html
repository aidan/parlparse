<h4><center>Clause 2</center></h4>
<h4><center>Functions of court of directors</center></h4>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory (Wells):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 4, in page 2, line 8, at end add--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5) The court shall from time to time receive reports from the Monetary Policy Committee on the formulation of monetary policy.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would require the court to receive all the reports from the Monetary Policy Committee. I am aware that we shall return to debating that committee later in the Bill and that clause 16 also touches on the court of directors and monetary policy. However, clause 2 purports to provide a comprehensive list of the functions of the court of directors--there is nothing to suggest otherwise.
<P>
Although subsection (1) states that the court of directors shall not have a duty to deal with the formulation of monetary policy, we know from the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the court does have certain important duties relating to monetary policy more generally. Paragraph 19 of his letter to the Governor of 6 May states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The non-Executive Members will review the performance of the Bank as a whole, including the Monetary Policy Committee.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is an important duty. In reviewing the performance of a body, one needs to know what that body is up to and to receive any relevant documents or reports issued in relation to it. The amendment would put that beyond doubt and ensure that the court can discharge its functions by requiring reports to be sent to it.
<P>
We do not yet know exactly how the MPC will function. It presently operates in a non-statutory capacity but may operate differently when it has the force of law behind it. Statute law will be scrutinised by the court and the MPC to ascertain Parliament's intention in the division of responsibilities between those two bodies.
<P>
It is important for the non-executive directors to be kept fully informed. Jealousies can build up between organisations and information is power. One can envisage circumstances in which the MPC believes that information is confidential, price sensitive, should be held on to and not divulged to a third party or the outside world. That is understandable, but it is important that the court of directors is also given such information in the reports, because the court will presumably be bound by rules of confidentiality that are similar to those that bind it at present. If it is to discharge the duty--which is outlined in the Chancellor's letter--of reviewing the performance of the Monetary Policy Committee, full disclosure of the reports is essential.
<P>
To put the matter beyond doubt and to ensure that the clause sets out a comprehensive list of the court's functions, I ask the Chief Secretary to the Treasury to accept the amendment. If he cannot, will he tell us why that is impossible?
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey (Kingston and Surbiton):</B> I support the amendment. It is modest and uncontroversial, and I do not see why the Government should not be able to accept it in the spirit of constructive debate.
<P>
The Chancellor of the Exchequer's statement on the Bank of England implied that he envisaged the Bill giving the court of directors the duty to review the performance of the Monetary Policy Committee. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Monetary Policy Committee's performance will be reviewed by the Court of the Bank. The Court will be substantially reformed, so that it is able to take account of the full range of industrial and business views in this country, and for the first time it will be fully representative of the whole of the United Kingdom.''--[Official Report, 20 May 1997; Vol. 294, c. 508-9.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I made the point in a previous debte that the Bill does not set out the court's duty to take account of sectoral and regional influences on monetary policy. For example, it does not specify that the court's directors should represent different regions or sectors.
<P>
In reply to that debate, the Chief Secretary explained why the Bill does not contain such a specification. Although we might want to debate his argument that Parliament traditionally does not limit the sovereign's right of appointment--the sovereign will make these appointments--it is important that the Bill should allow the court of directors to receive information and reports so that it can check whether the Monetary Policy Committee is taking regional and sectoral influences into account.
<P>
This modest amendment would enable the court of directors to receive such information. Therefore, it would back up the Government's stated intentions. I hope that the Chief Secretary will accept it.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Ruffley (Bury St. Edmunds):</B> The Bill should refer to the specific functions of the court. It is perfectly clear that the clause ostensibly gives powers to the court on the management of the Bank's affairs, but a cursory inspection of the clause's first two subsections leaves me with the distinct impression that the court is expected to carry out narrow functions.
<P>
The clause outlines the court's functions. Clause 2(2) refers to the financial management of the Bank and clause 2(4) states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the court's aim shall be to ensure the most efficient use of the Bank's resources.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, we are being asked to believe that the court's functions are narrow. That is confirmed most clearly by clause 2(1), which states that the court's powers do not relate to the formulation of monetary policy.
<P>
I invite the Committee to consider one or two other clauses, which clearly widen the ambit of the court's powers. I assure you, Mrs. Dunwoody, that I will not stray from the amendment, but we should take a close look at the words of clause 16(1) which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The court of directors of the Bank shall keep the procedures followed by the Monetary Policy Committee under review.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Under clause 16(2) the court will look at procedures of the MPC whether or not
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the regional, sectoral and other information necessary''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
has been adequately gathered. The court clearly has a power to look into the procedures of the MPC but do not the words ``and other information necessary'' give us pause?
<P>
The MPC will be gathering all sorts of information, some of it unspecified in the Bill, and it could be very important information. There could be disputes as to how well the MPC is gathering not just regional and sectoral information but the other information with which we are as yet unfamiliar as it is not laid out in the Bill. Against that background it must be right that the court has a bounden duty to keep the procedures under close scrutiny.
<P>
It is not just in clause 16(1) that we see that the court has serious powers of scrutiny, it is also confirmed in clause (4)2--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have been reasonably indulgent. I am following the hon. Gentleman carefully but we are discussing an amendment to clause 2. It would help if he would try to restrain his remarks even though I understand the difficulty.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody. I am seeking to show that the court has wider powers to scrutinise. That is not restricted merely to the good housekeeping, resource use and financial management of the Bank. We need to advert, and I will cease to do so in a minute, to other clauses in the Bill which clearly show that there are slightly wider powers than those set out in subsections (1), (2) and (4) to which I have referred.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross Cranston </B>(Dudley, North): Can the hon. Gentleman therefore explain why the amendment is necessary?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I shall get to that. [Hon. Members: ``Oh yes.''] If the hon. Gentleman is patient he will be enlightened. The reality is--[Interruption.] Well you do need a great deal of enlightenment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I require no enlightenment at all. I am the only ``you'' in this Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I beg your pardon, Mrs. Dunwoody. I am a young kid on the block in this respect and I apologise. The Labour party needs elucidation because if they look closely at the amendment they will see, as the hon. Gentleman has pointed out, that this is uncontroversial and should add to the quality of the Bill. Clause 4(2)--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I apologise, but we are debating clause 2. Members must get used to the idea that we debate the amendments that are on the amendment paper. It is perfectly possible to refer to another clause in passing, but we cannot have long quotations from other clauses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> In passing, Mrs. Dunwoody, it is clear that the court of directors has a duty in the clause to which you have just referred, to produce a report on its activities. The Bank already has a duty to give a report to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but the Bill specifically adds a new responsibility on the Bank for the court to make its own separate set of representations to the Chancellor. That is in the Bill. That must, by its nature, mean that the court has wide powers and the wide powers are set out in clause 16.
<P>
We can, therefore, demonstrate with sufficient clarity that the activities and duties of the court of directors are not quite as narrow as is implied in clause 2(1), which says that the formulation of monetary policy shall not be a matter for the court. But some aspects of monetary policy are matters for the court. Therefore, the court has to report to the Chancellor of the Exchequer about those wider matters. The Bill proposes that the court should play a proper scrutiny role. What better way to entrench that duty than to grant it some power of scrutiny over the MPC? If the amendment is rejected, the MPC will be able to behave semi-autonomously, free from the court's scrutiny. The amendment would enable the court to carry out its duties under clauses 2 and 16.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): I, too, rise to support the amendment. The Bill gives the Bank of England independence. Part I proposes to enshrine the functions of the new Bank of England in its constitution. Clause 2(2) defines the ambit and role of the court, which is the centre of the Bank, and comprises people who control its functions. Yet it tries to define that role in only four subsections. They do not adequately set out the full scope, functions, responsibilities and duties of the 16 directors of the court, the Governor of the Bank of England and the two deputy Governors. It would help the Committee if the Chief Secretary provided some useful information.
<P>
What were the court's functions in the past? How does the Bill change and adapt them for the future? Does the Chief Secretary believe that the clause is comprehensive and that it includes an exhaustive list of the court's functions? Reading through the Bill, from time to time one discovers other functions of the court. It is odd that they have not been incorporated in clause 2. Is that down to sloppy drafting? I refer briefly to clause 16.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> That was it; that was the reference!
<P>
The function of reviewing the MPC should have been included in subsection (2).
<P>
Paragraph 18 of the letter dated 6 May from the Chancellor of the Exchequer states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The non-Executive members will be appointed for their expertise and will be drawn widely from industry, commerce and finance.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Yet I infer from statements made elsewhere, that the Government propose to reappoint the current members of the court to the new court with its new functions and responsibilities. That seems odd. Does the Chief Secretary believe it to be appropriate for directors from the old court of the old Bank to be appointed to the new court of the new Bank of England?
<P>
On 20 May, The Chancellor said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``When I studied the composition of the Court of the Bank of England, I found that what Courts had in common was that they always include the chairman of a football club in the English league. I want industry to be properly represented, and I want every region, including Scotland and Wales, to be represented on the Court of the Bank of England.''--[Official Report, 20 May 1997; Vol. 294, c.516.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is strange that the Chancellor makes exhortations and statements of intent in one place, yet the Bill reveals no intention of changing the composition of the court.
<P>
It would be helpful if clause 2 provided more detail of the court's specific responsibilities so that we could assess whether it was necessary to appoint new people to the court or whether the functions were broadly similar to those of the old court.
<P>
Subsections (2) and (3) appear circular and confusing. Subsection (2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In particular, the court's functions under subsection (1) shall include determining the Bank's objectives''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (3) states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In determining the Bank's objectives|the court's aim shall be to ensure the effective discharge of the Bank's functions.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If ever there was circular legislation, that is it.
<P>
It is important that the amendment is passed. As the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton said, it is uncontroversial. It sets out the full functions of the court in one place in the Bill, and specifies its responsibility to review and oversee the Monetary Policy Committee. Some of the court's functions are set out in the clause to which I shall not refer, which points out that in reviewing those functions the court would need to examine the information gathering of the Monetary Policy Committee. That is an important issue, because, as Mr. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve in the United States, pointed out in a recent speech, one of the most crucial aspects of establishing the credibility of an independent bank is that it has adequate information gathering procedures.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Will my hon. Friend comment on the reference to other information gathered by the Monetary Policy Committee? Does that not go to the heart of the court's functions in reviewing the procedures of the MPC? What other information should the MPC consider? What should the court of directors be looking for when they review the MPC's activities in that context?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interventions should be brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend raises an important point in relation to clause 2(4), which states that, subject to the previous subsections, 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in determining objectives for the financial management of the Bank, the court's aim shall be to ensure the most efficient use of the Bank's resources.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the Bank of England is to improve its information gathering procedures, that will be the responsibility of the court of the Bank of England; it will be one of the Bank's functions. The omission from clause 2 of any reference to the review of the Monetary Policy Committee could mean that if the court decided to set up expensive, information gathering processes in offices around the country to ensure that the MPC does have adequate information, such a decision would be ultra vires. Will the Chief Secretary clarify that matter? Clause 2 does not state that that is one of the court's objectives. The clause states that a function of the court is to ensure the most efficient use of the Bank's resources. Would it, therefore, be ultra vires for it to extend those resources on improving the information gathering procedures of the Bank of England?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> The hon. Gentleman had long experience advising corporations before he entered the House. Will he explain whether the articles of any of those corporations explicitly provided for the board of directors to receive reports from sub-committees and other committees?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Most private companies have to state precisely on what they intend to spend their money. They could not spend money on objectives that were not set out in their articles of associations. That is why such articles are drafted in broad terms. The clause needs to be drafted in broader terms.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Broad terms--exactly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> They are not broad terms. The clause excludes any reference to the Monetary Policy Committee. Information gathering is a crucial responsibility and function of the Bank to ensure its credibility. It seems odd that that power has not been incorporated in the main clause dealing with the functions of the court of directors, although I am open to the specialist legal advice that is no doubt being given to the Minister during the debate. It would be sensible for the Government to accept the amendment, which clarifies a crucial point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn (Guildford):</B> It is a measure of this piffling Bill, and of the Government's shallow understanding of the nature and importance of the role of the Bank of England, that a clause setting out the function of the Bank's court of directors should be so short and inadequate.
<P>
I welcome the attempt of my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) to add a little to Ministers' understanding by tabling the amendment. The lack of understanding is made transparent by clause 2(1), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The court of directors of the Bank shall manage the Bank's affairs, other than the formulation of monetary policy.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>The clause could not be more deeply flawed. One of the foundations of the role of any central bank is to maintain the liquidity of and confidence in the banking system. To achieve that, it is essential that the effect of monetary policy on the banking system is taken into account. The Governor of the Bank of England, speaking to some hon. Members only the other day, explained how in Japan the monetary authorities have, recently, purposely followed a policy of low short-term interest rates so that the banks which own higher-interest-earning, longer-term deposits and Government securities may earn profits through borrowing short at a lower interest rate and lending long at a higher interest rate, to cover their severe losses on historic mistakes in their lending portfolio. That is a classic central bank operation. The Governor made it clear that without that operation the Japanese banking system could collapse with devastating effects on the Japanese and international monetary systems.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Kidney (Stafford):</B> Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the court of the Bank of England now takes decisions on monetary policy?
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I take this opportunity to thank the hon. Gentleman for my friendly reception in his constituency yesterday, and for his note on the relevant matter.
<P>
The answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is that, of course, under the current arrangements the Bank would give clear advice to the Treasury on the effect of changes in interest rates and interest rate policy on the banking system and its liquidity, as well as confidence in it.
<P>
The Bill would give rise to a separation of powers. The formulation of monetary policy could be undertaken by the monetary policy committee without regard to the effect on the banking system. We shall debate later the objectives that the committee will be told to take into account. I do not intend to discuss that now.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> You will not.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The proposed new subsection (5) would clearly tie in the Monetary Policy Committee to the court of directors, in a way that clause 2(1) would not. That is a fatal flaw in clause 2(1).
<P>
I look forward to the debate on clause stand part, and discussion of the wider context and functions of the court of directors. However, in passing I want to mention how disconcerting it is that the Bill removes from the Bank not only its supervision of the banking system, and its regulatory role, but its debt management role. As I am sure I have shown, those are clearly interrelated. A central bank might want to support its banking system through such operations as I described taking place in Japan--which were very similar to action taken a few years ago by the Federal Reserve in the United States, when the banking system was in trouble, although not as much as Japan's was.
<P>
Bearing that in mind, it is disturbing that the hands-on role of debt management is to be transferred from the Bank to the Treasury. That will take away an area of expertise that is vital if support operations such as I have described are to be undertaken successfully. Yet the court of directors will still have responsibility for exercising the Bank's role as lender of last resort. It is as if one person is soldier in charge of the steering wheel while others are changing the gears and moving the accelerator. The way in which the Bill changes the Bank's operations not only displays alarming ignorance on the part of those behind the drafting, it may also lead to problems in our banking system. We have had them previously--Johnson Matthey, BCCI and Barings--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman said that he looked forward to the debate on clause stand part. I have been indulgent because some hon. Members are new, but hon. Members must get used to not straying from the amendment. A general debate should occur on clause stand part.

<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I stand corrected, Mrs. Dunwoody. Bearing in mind those cases, the proposed subsection (5) is clearly need to enable the effects of the Monetary Policy Committee's plans and thinking to be fully understood by the court of directors. Without it, that vital point will not be clear.
<P>
<B>The Chief Secretary to the Treasury </B>(Mr. Alistair Darling): The hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) raised matters that would be more properly dealt with in a clause stand part debate, if we have one. I know, Mrs. Dunwoody, that you will take a view on that at the end of the debate. If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I will give him the benefit of the doubt and assume that he has not spoilt that chance because he wandered wide of the amendment in matters relating to debt management. I shall concentrate on the amendment.
<P>
I admire the hon. Gentleman's self-confidence that he is right and everyone else is wrong; that the Governor of the Bank of England himself, and the court, who have endorsed the Bill, are, in his opinion, so mistaken that they have signed up to something that he would not have advised. However, I do not think that his self-confidence is universally shared.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> It is a matter of record that the Governor of the Bank of England considered resigning his post when the Government announced their plans in the Bill. While the Governor is being extremely loyal to the Government, I doubt that the outside world regards the Chancellor of the Exchequer's proposals as having the unqualified endorsement of the Bank of England.
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> The Governor made no criticism in relation to the Monetary Policy Committee, as will be clear to the hon. Gentleman if he cares to look back at public comment.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) made two points. On the first--appointments to the court--my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary said on Tuesday that, in terms of the Bill when enacted, all the directors vacate office at Royal Assent. The Chancellor has said that he intends to re-appoint those who resign immediately to serve out their terms office.
<P>
That means that they will either continue in office after their term of office, or they will be replaced, but on a rolling basis, exactly as if the existing court had continued. Members who are appointed to serve a given term of office will serve it; afterwards the position will be as before, regardless of the Bill. Three non-executive directors are due for re-appointment in February next year; a further four are up for reconsideration in February 1999. I hope that I have made the position clear.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and some of his hon. Friends were, I believe, critical of clause 2. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) asked how the clause differed from previous statutes governing the Bank of England.
<P>
The powers of the court of directors are in the Charter of the Bank of England, clause 3 of which bears reading: It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Court of Directors may and shall choose and appoint and remove officers servants and agents and determine their remuneration and conditions of service and generally in all matters do whatsoever they may judge necessary for the well ordering and managing of the Bank of England and the affairs thereof.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So far as I can see, they can do pretty well anything they wish. In putting the Bank on a more modern footing, we wanted to spell out more specifically the powers and functions of the court of directors without confining them in such a way that they could not operate effectively.
<P>
The point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, North (Mr. Cranston) about commercial companies was apposite in the sense that in a company's articles of association every single matter will not be tied down so that directors have no leeway whatever. We have to proceed on the basis that directors of the court are intelligent people, many of them well used to operating businesses and running organisations, and that they will know how to obtain sufficient information to satisfy themselves that they can discharge the functions imposed on them by statute.
<P>
We wanted to set out clearly in the Bill what the functions were. They are established in clause 2, which it seems we shall debate in a short while. They are further specified in clause 3, and in clause 16, to which Opposition Members referred.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Under clause 16, there is clearly a duty on the court of directors to review the procedures of the Monetary Policy Committee, which has to comment on the performance of its duty in the report that the court gives. The court can give a proper and adequate report to the Chancellor only if it understands fully the workings of the MPC, and it can do that only if the Committee accepts our amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> I agree that the court, and especially its sub-committee, which we shall come to in clause 3, will have to discharge the functions imposed on it by clause 16. Of course it has to review the MPC's procedure, and so must understand a great deal about the MPC. I shall come to the amendment that the hon. Gentleman supports in a moment because other Opposition Members touched on it.
<P>
Under clause 13, the MPC will be responsible for formulating monetary policy, and, as the hon. Gentleman said, under clause 16 the court, and its sub-committee in particular, are responsible for reviewing the procedures followed by the MPC.
<P>
Amendment No. 4 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The court shall from time to time receive reports from the Monetary Policy Committee on the formulation of monetary policy.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Opposition Members want the courts to be given reports from the MPC from time to time. I agree. There is nothing unreasonable about that.
<P>
I noticed during the first full day, and the first 40 minutes of this sitting of the Committee, the commendable team spirit shown by Conservative Members, with each supporting whatever the shadow Chief Secretary said and making useful contributions. But in the nicest possible way, I suggest that it might have benefited at least one of them to have read the Bill before speaking. There is always something to be said for reading the schedules in the Bill as well as the clauses because often--we are not alone in this respect, other Governments have done it--there is some rather interesting stuff in them.
<P>
I invite the Committee to read paragraph 14 of schedule 3 which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Committee shall submit a monthly report on its activities to the court of directors of the Bank.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, the Government have put into schedule 3 a far stricter duty on the Monetary Policy Committee. It has to send these reports not just from time to time, as the Opposition want, but every month. The amendment is unnecessary. A casual reading of the Bill would have made that abundantly obvious. That is why I recommend that my hon. Friends treat this amendment as they treated those that we have discussed hitherto and reject it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that it would have been more appropriate, and neater, clearer drafting, to have had all those points incorporated in clause2? This is the second clause of the Bill which sets out the court, the central body that controls the Bank of England. It would make perfect sense to have all those items included in that clause. That is what our amendment is about. That is all we are arguing about. There is nothing controversial; it is simply about clarity of drafting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> What Conservative Members are saying is that if we had shoved it all in clause 2 there would have been no need for them to go any further or read the whole Bill. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds is nodding.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Put it on the face of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> The hon. Gentleman must know that the face of the Bill includes every single page. I understand the problem. Having spent 10 years in opposition I have a great deal of sympathy for Conservative Members. It is difficult when faced with legislation to have the time and inclination to read the entire thing. But as they have been telling us how experienced they are in these matters and how they have brought all that experience to bear on this Committee, they might have benefited from reading the schedule. If, as they claim, all they wanted was to move schedule 3 paragraph 14 to the end of clause 2, the amendment would have been differently drafted. We are proposing a monthly report. What they propose is a report from time to time, which can mean anything: once a year, once a decade.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Surely the point is that it is all very well asking for reports, but if it is made quite clear in clause 2(1) that responsibility for monetary policy does not rest with the court of directors, to bury a request for reports in the back of the Bill rather plays down--this is our real complaint--the link between the responsibilities of the court and monetary policy. Only by adding that in a subsection to clause 2 is it made clear that the link is there and that overall there is still the responsibility for monetary policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> Not only do the Opposition not know whether they are for or against the Bill, they do not know what their amendment means. As I said earlier, the Monetary Policy Committee is responsible for the fixing of interest rates. The court as a whole, and the non-executive directors in particular, have a duty to keep under review the processes that they follow. There is a division of responsibilities. There is clarity there. The Opposition's amendment would not change that at all. It asks that the court should receive reports from the MPC from time to time.
<P>
I have made it abundantly clear that we have anticipated that because we think it a good idea that the court should receive these reports to emphasise the duty, only we think that these should be monthly reports. That is logical because the MPC meets monthly. Everyone else gets to hear what it says every month and it would be a pity if the court did not. Conservative Members would have been far better just accepting the fact that, albeit inadvertently, a mistake has been made, and that their amendment is not necessary and is far weaker than the Government's suggestion. We could then debate other parts of the Bill which, judging from the way in which Conservative Members refer to every clause but the one under discussion, they cannot wait to get to. I urge my hon. Friends to reject the amendments if the right hon. Gentleman is not now minded to withdraw it.

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> It is a great pity that the right hon. Gentleman did not listen more carefully to what we said when we moved the amendment. I explicitly recognised that the powers and functions of the court are referred to later in part II. I said that we would be getting on to that but I did not stray out of order by speaking to future clauses or schedules. I said that clause 2 purports to be an exhaustive description of the functions of the court. That it is why it is specifically titled ``Functions of court of directors''. It is therefore entirely reasonable for outside observers and those who will be affected by the legislation to turn to this clause when they want to know about the functions of the court.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Schedule 3, to which the right hon. Gentleman referred, is entitled ``Monetary Policy Committee''; the court of directors is not mentioned in the title at all. If the right hon. Gentleman had listened to what I said rather than patronise us by saying that we have not read the Bill, he would understand that if he wants the clause to be brought into line with what the Chancellor said elsewhere about the functions of the court of directors, and with other parts of the Bill, he should accept our amendment, which would put beyond doubt that the court will receive the necessary report in order to discharge its functions properly.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman's response was inadequate; he completely missed the point made by myself and my hon. Friends earlier in the debate. We shall, therefore, press for a Division.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I rise with the expectation that the Chief Secretary will now deal with the points that he said he would as we move to the substantive debate on the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> The substantive issue that the hon. Gentleman has in mind is probably debt management, which was certainly raised by his hon. Friend the Member for Guildford. If the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton wants to raise any further points, will he intervene now and I shall endeavour to deal with them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I raised a number of issues relating to clause 2(4), according to which the court is responsible for the most effecient use of the Bank's resources. The court will spend money to ensure that the MPC has all the information available to it, as set out in clause 16. Given that the clause does not refer to its functions in reviewing the activity of the MPC, is it legally possible for the court effectively to carry out the functions specified in subsection (4)? Will it be permissible for the court to spend money on activities that are not included in the clause, or will it be ultra vires?
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> I shall come on to debt management later, but I shall deal with the hon. Gentleman's other points now.
<P>
Subsection (4) is directed towards good housekeeping within the Bank. The Bank of England is like any large organisation, and the court must have a duty to ensure that financial management has clearly defined objectives and that the Bank's resources are efficiently used. The court must ensure that the Bank is well run, that it is not overstaffed and that it operates in the most efficient manner possible.
<P>
Those duties are distinct from those in respect of the MPC, which are set out in clause 16. When I discussed the amendment, I mentioned the court's duties in respect of clause 16. It must keep under review the processes that the MPC will follow. Clause 2(4) is a provision for good housekeeping.
<P>
On debt management, the issuing of debt will be a responsibility of the Treasury. Until now, the Bank has carried out that function and the transfer of responsibility will make clear to the markets how the Bank will operate. Markets will know that the Bank will not have debt management functions, because that responsibity will have been transferred to a separate agency. That will remove any suggestion of insider dealing or conflict of interest.
<P>
The Committee may be aware that we sent out a consultation paper in July, setting out the proposals to establish the new agency. The consultation period is now over, and there was general approval for our proposals. We received suggestions about the detail of the operation rather than about the principle behind it.
<P>
I hope that I have dealt with the other matters raised. If not, I shall happily clarify them.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>Functions to be carried out by non-executive members</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 8, in page 2, line 24, leave out `Chancellor of the Exchequer' and insert `Governor'.
<P>
The amendment need not detain the Committee long, because it is very narrow. However, it is important in that it touches on the constant interference in the Bank of England that the Government are anxious to retain. Much of their rhetoric has been about independence, devolution and allowing the Bank of England a longer leash, but clause 3(3) shows that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is still anxious to retain control over matters of unnecessary detail.
<P>
The clause will set up a sub-committee with certain defined functions, but subsection (3) insists that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Chancellor may designate one of the directors''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It does not say that he has to do that, but it is clear that he can override the wishes of the Governor or the directors of the court.
<P>
Earlier, the hon. Member for Dudley, North suggested that the Bank was similar to a private company and that the constitutions of private companies do not regulate their affairs in such detail. That completely misses the point. The Bank is a public body and regulated by statute. That is why we are here.
<P>
Nevertheless, the hon. Gentleman's argument raises an interesting point. The directors of the court will be hand-picked by the Chancellor--and that is a matter of controversy in itself. However, those trusted men and women will somehow not be trusted to choose one of their number--the Governor in most cases--to chair a sub-committee.
<P>
On occasions, the sub-committee will deal with issues such as the Governor's remuneration, and it is obvious that it would be inappropriate for the Governor to chair such proceedings. Responsible bodies in the public or private sector realise that. They do not require overarching powers in statute to allow the Chancellor of the Exchequer to impose a person of his choice in such circumstances. Our argument is that, the court having been set up and the members reappointed, they should for once be trusted. They should be allowed at least modest discretion to select one of their members to chair the sub-committee. If the Government are unwilling to trust those people, will they explain why?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I am concerned about clause 3. The court has important powers, which can be delegated to a sub-committee. There is worse, however. The sub-committee can be quorate with only two members present. All the powers that we have been discussing and analysing can be exercised by a committee of two directors. Presumably one of those two could be the chairman, chosen not by the Bank but by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It is astonishing that the Government claim that they favour more independence in this context. The idea that a quorum of two, one of whom could be a chairman personally chosen by the Chancellor, amounts to independence, is fanciful. Would not it be sensible to try to provide a brake on the political interference that would certainly be possible under the Bill? Would not the best check on such interference be to place some restrictions on sub-committees with a small quorum? I support the amendment, which is a modest but important attempt to bolster the independence of the court of directors.
<P>
<B>Jacqui Smith </B>(Redditch): Is not the hon. Gentleman confusing arguments about the independence of the Bank of England with arguments about the sub-committee's ability to undertake independent scrutiny of what one might call the top management of the Bank? It is to provide the possibility of that independent scrutiny that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, as the leading shareholder of the organisation, so to speak, is to appoint the chairman of the sub-committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I wonder whether the hon. Lady has been listening. The Bill gives the Chancellor great power in determining the composition of the court, which has an important scrutiny function in relation to what the Monetary Policy Committee gets up to, and the running of the Bank. The right to choose directors, and the ability personally to nominate one of two people who could form the quorum of the sub-committee that runs the functions of the court, is a matter at the heart of independence. It affects the question of whether the Bank has total independence or whether political interference intrudes into its activities.
<P>
There is no confusion. The two issues that the hon. Lady mentioned are coterminous. I should have thought that she would understand that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> I hate to interrupt the hon. Gentleman in full flow, but has he looked at schedule 1, paragraph 13(2)?

<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Yes, I have.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I merely want to compliment my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds on the pertinent points that he made.
<P>
The problem with the clause arises because the Government rejected our proposals to make the independent Bank accountable to Parliament, not simply to the Chancellor and the Government. Had the proposals been accepted, we would have acknowledged the logical consequence of providing that the Governor, not the Chancellor, designated the director who would chair the sub-committee. The amendment should be accepted because the Bill politicises the Bank's functions. That is unacceptable.
<P>
In the past, a clear division existed. The Treasury was responsible, and the Chancellor was answerable to Parliament for monetary policy, but the Bank of England's authority and experience held sway when it came to its responsibilities in the City and its role in promoting the City of London. I am worried that, under the new regime, the Chancellor will have his fingers in every pie.
<P>
I was involved in developing several new and successful markets in London. I wonder whether those markets would have come to London, provided employment for so many people in the City and contributed so much to our invisible earnings if those who contemplated establishing the markets had the impression that business in London was subject to the amount of political influence that the Chancellor will be invited to exert under the Bill.
<P>
In our previous sitting, we said that the Chancellor could pack the court with chosen members once our scrutiny of the Bill was out of the way. Yesterday, The Guardian contained a report that claimed that the Chancellor intended to do that.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The amendment is narrowly drawn. I have been indulgent, but we must be clear about one or two matters. If one moves an amendment, one speaks about that amendment; a clause stand-part debate covers a whole clause. I am reasonably indulgent, but we range widely when moving narrowly drawn amendments, I shall deem a stand-part debate unnecessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> It goes without saying, Mrs. Dunwoody, that I want to avoid that risk. However, we are considering a clear issue: political control by the Chancellor, or operational control by the Governor.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful for the Chief Secretary's advice about reading the Bill. However, it would be more appropriately targeted at Labour Members, whose speeches suggest that little reading or scrutinising of the Bill has occurred on the Government side. There is only supine agreement on the Labour Benches.
<P>
The Bill begins by mentioning the functions and objectives of the Bank. Clause 2 contains a circular argument about functions and objectives, but those functions and objectives are not defined. By the time one reaches clause 3, one hopes that it will, at last, provide a list of the Court of the Bank of England's functions. But it does not.
<P>
Subsection (2)(a) mentions
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``keeping under review the Bank's performance in relation to the objectives.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (2)(b) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the extent to which the objectives set by the court of directors|have been met.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (2)(c) mentions
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``determining how the functions|should be exercised.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, the functions are not defined. It is important to define them because those objectives will be set by the sub-committee, the chairman of which is appointed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> The Government seem to think that they have made a winning point by referring to the schedules. The schedule refers to a quorum of nine--I would like the hon. Gentleman's comments on that--but, as he said, clause 3(4) refers to the sub-committee being two members. Does not the schedule refer to a quorum of nine in respect of the court? What does my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton understand by subsection (4)? The point that he was about to make related to the choice of chairmen for the sub-committee. What is his interpretation of subsection (4)?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interventions must be brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful for the pertinent point made by my hon. Friend, and I look forward to the Chief Secretary's response. If the Government want to establish an independent Bank of England, they must ensure that it is truly independent. They cannot establish a hybrid independence for the Bank. In his excellent pamphlet, Professor Gowland says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Credibility is not simply the produce of a particular set of institutions. Instead it is the consequence of a complex mixture of history and national attitudes as well as of institutional structures.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Professor Gowland notes that it took the United States Federal Reserve 25 years to establish that independence. The court is the central organising body of the Bank, and if politicians continue to interfere in the Bank's conduct through methods that are established in the structure of the court, that will certainly not create the credibility and independence sought by the Government. It will make the situation worse than it is at present.
<P>
The amendment seeks to help the Government in their objective of seeking independence for the Bank, by removing from subsection (3) the provision that the Chancellor may appoint the chairman of the sub-committee. That provision would not be seen by the outside world as establishing the independence of the court's sub-committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> The hon. Member for Guildford has already spoken to us from his vast knowledge--I know that he is too modest to claim that. Will be explain to the Committee the debate about corporate governance and the need for boards of directors and boards of statutory bodies--I take up the point made by the right hon. Member for Wells--to have a monitoring body with some independence from the board? Perhaps he could comment on that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chairman:</B> Order. Perhaps he could not. The amendment is narrowly drawn. I conjure the Committee to look at the order paper. The amendment proposes
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``leave out `Chancellor of the Exchequer' and insert `Governor'.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Member should not be drawn to make comments on the amendment that he might like to make in the discussion of clause stand part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I should have liked to respond to the hon. Gentleman's point. There are aspects of the Bill--it is riddled with them--that would not fit well in the private sector under the corporate governance rules. The purpose of the Bill is to distance the Bank of England from the Chancellor, so for the Chancellor to appoint the chairman of one of the Bank's sub-committees goes to the root of the Bill and undermines its credibility. Moreover, as Professor Gowland said, there would be additional and deflationary costs for British industry as the Bank sought to establish credibility of its monetary policy in the country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the primal focus of the Opposition has been on clause 3(4), namely the number of people on the sub-committee? That is not what we should be discussing.
<P>
The Chancellor of the Exchequer's powers to appoint the chair of the sub-committee relate to the balance between independence and accountability. When the principle of independence was discussed in the House, the Opposition were concerned about accountability. I put it to you that if, instead of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Governor of the Bank of England had been in the House, he would have argued the opposite.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I point out, once again, that ``you'' in this Committee is me. I hope that all hon. Members will make their points to me, but only tangentially.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am grateful, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
We are debating clause 3(3), and the amendment would change ``Chancellor of the Exchequer'' to ``Governor''. That is our clear objective. Allowing the Government to appoint chairmen of sub-committees will not increase accountability, which is about allowing Parliament to scrutinise the Bank's activities on the Floor of the House and in the Select Committee on the Treasury.
<P>
That brings me to my final point. The excellent research paper prepared by the Library--it is amazing how much reading Conservative Members are doing--states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Treasury Select Committee plans to take evidence separately from this non-executive committee annually.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Yet there is no mention of the Treasury Committee: it would be helpful if there were cross-references. I know that the remit of Select Committees is extended, but that goes beyond the amendment that we are debating. Clause 3(3) fatally flaws a key element of independence, which the Government seek to achieve. If the Government accept the amendment they will enhance their own objectives.
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> We have had another wide-ranging debate. This must be the first Bill in history to have had a Second Reading debate on every amendment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If the right hon. Gentleman is criticising the Chair, he will find that it will not be well received.
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> I assure you, Mrs. Dunwoody, that having known you for the past 10 years, I would never dream of criticising you--in the Chair or anywhere else. You need have no worry on that score.
<P>
With regard to appointments to the court, I have already dealt with the matter when we debated the previous amendment. The hon. Member for Guildford referred to the front-page story in The Guardian yesterday, but it was plain wrong--a classic case of a journalist taking a flier. I have explained the position of the court quite clearly: the court members know it and the world knows it. It has not changed one jot, and the hon. Gentleman should not believe everything that he reads in newspapers.
<P>
A general point made by Conservative Members was that what we seek to achieve will be resented by the outside world. My hon. Friends would like a list of all the companies that Conservative Members have advised; he may want to stay well clear of anyone they have been advising, given their lack of attention to detail. My hon. Friends are remaining quiet only because they have read the whole Bill and they are delighted with it. [Hon. Members: ``Hear, hear.''] They cannot wait to be back on the Floor of the House hearing the Bill receive Royal Assent. That moment cannot come soon enough for them.
<P>
Political interference is another general issue. Listening to Conservative Members, it is hard to believe that for the previous 18 years--and right back to 1946--the appointment of the Governor, the deputy Governor and the court's members has been a matter for Ministers of the Crown who have used political considerations in doing so. They were perfectly entitled to do so, but the idea that there is something new in the Chancellor being able to appoint court members is wrong. That has always been the case.
<P>
The test of the appointments is their credibility in the markets and in the outside world. As to the MPC, to which we will return in part II, the perception has been that the appointments were balanced and appropriate. That one reason why long-term interest rates fell immediately after the Chancellor's announcement. I accept that the Bank's reputation will be built upon year after year, but the initial reception has been favourable. If Conservative Members truly spoke for the outside world and if they were right, the initial reaction would have been different. The general reaction of the markets and the public at large has been favourable.
<P>
Before I come to the amendment I should like to deal with the quorum. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds referred throughout his speech to the fact that there was a quorum of two. I drew his attention to schedule 1, paragraph 13(2), which says that the quorum is nine. I want everyone to be in no doubt about that. If the hon. Gentleman cares to address himself to clause 3(4) he will see that, as is the practice in just about every large organisation or company in the world, there is provision for a sub-committee to delegate functions to two or more of its members--in other words to have other sub-committees. There could for example be a remuneration committee. That is a matter for the court to determine.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways. One moment he accuses us of interfering in just about everything and now he says that we are not interfering enough. What is important is that we should establish the quorum of the court, and we have done that. But it is equally important that we should give the court the power to delegate its functions for the better management of the bank itself.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I am glad that the right hon. Gentleman has shifted his ground on this. That is perfectly clear. That is what clause 3(4) means. That was the point that I was making and have made. Two individuals are able to discharge the functions as set out in clause 3. Yes, it is sub-delegation but the fact remains that two individuals can make the decisions on the objectives and strategy. That was the point that I sought to make and nothing that the Chief Secretary has said this morning puts that in any doubt. My point is made by subsection (4).
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> The hon. Gentleman is talking nonsense. The court must have a quorum of nine members. The court is entitled, in respect of any of its functions under the Bill or anything else that it thinks appropriate for the better management of the business of the Bank, to delegate its functions to two or more people. That is perfectly normal management. If the hon. Gentleman knows so much about companies, as he is always telling us, I am surprised that he does not recognise the merit in going about these things in that way, without prescribing every last dot and comma of what these sub-committees are to do.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways: he cannot say that the Government are interfering, down to telling the members of the court what make of coffee they should order in the morning, and then say that we are not being specific enough. It is sufficient to specify in the Bill the quorum of the court. It is then for the court members themselves, who will be individuals of merit and some experience, to decide how they will organise themselves to discharge their functions. A sub-committee of a court is still subject to the court itself so decisions have to come back to the court and can be reviewed by it. I find it extraordinary that the hon. Gentleman does not understand that.
<P>
So far, I have dealt with all the matters raised by Opposition Members except the point made by the shadow Chief Secretary. He made a speech in support of his amendment which is to the effect that the Governor should appoint the senior member and not the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Let me explain our thinking here. I have said time and time again that part I of the Bill deals with the governance of the Bank itself. What we are doing here is modernising the court to ensure that it is equipped to discharge its functions which, as the shadow Chief Secretary rightly said, are similar to those of any other large organisation.
<P>
We decided that the Chancellor should appoint the senior member to ensure that he or she is there to act as a leader and focus for the non-executive members who represent the equivalent of the shareholders. In a normal company the non-executive directors are there to act as a check and balance and to act in the interests of the general shareholders. The Bank does not have shareholders as such. It is there to represent the general public good. Our proposals are exactly in line with modern practice.
<P>
Following the Cadbury and Greenbury reports, Sir Ronald Hampel has just completed the third stage in the study of best corporate governance. His report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``we see a need for vigorously independent non-executive directors. These should be led by a director other than the chairman and the leader publicly identified in the annual report.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Sir Ronald suggests that companies across the country should have a senior member to lead the non-executives and to act as a check on the executives. That person will be able to stand up to and, perhaps, take on a difficult chairman.
<P>
Most people see the merits of such an approach. The only people not to are Conservative Members, who have so much knowledge of these issues that they know better than everyone else. Our aim is to ensure that the Bank of England has a similar model of governance to any other large organisation. For that reason, the senior member should be appointed by the Chancellor.
<P>
May I point out an obvious difficulty with the amendment? However, I do not suggest that it will occur in the Bank with the present personnel. If the chief executive of an organisation appoints a senior member and one of the senior member's jobs is to fix the remuneration of the chief executive the position will become uncomfortable. [Interruption.] My hon. Friend the Economic Secretary is right. Cadbury identified that problem, too. That report recommended a separate remuneration committee, partly because of what was going wrong in the privatised utilities. Conservative Members will no doubt remember that well.
<P>
Our proposals are in line with modern good corporate governance. That is why the wording in the Bill should be allowed to stand. We should not step back, move against the flow of modern practice and do what Conservative Members want.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Did Cadbury, Hampel and Greenbury suggest that the Chancellor of the Exchequer appoint a remuneration committee for every private company in Britain?
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> The hon. Gentleman is being ridiculous. No one has ever suggested that the Chancellor of the Exchequer appoint the senior member of every single company in the land. Who on earth came up with such a ridiculous proposition? Thorough reading and thorough listening by the hon. Gentleman would not go amiss.
<P>
The Hampel report recommended that every board should have a vigorous, independent senior member to speak for the non-executives. That is what we are proposing.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> There is a clear distinction between a private company and the Government. The Government may have pay policy objectives for the public sector. If the Chancellor of the Exchequer is to make this key appointment and the committee is to consider the remunerations and pensions of the members of the court, a conflict may arise between the demands of the market place in the financial world and the demands of Government pay policy. Which do the Government think should take priority?
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> It is for the Bank's remuneration committee to fix the pay of the individuals for whom it has responsibility. The Chancellor will appoint a senior member and the senior member will then be left to get on with the job until he has discharged all the duties incumbent upon him in the Bill. That is the position and I should have thought that that would be clear to anyone who considered the matter for more than a few seconds.
<P>
The amendment is wrong in principle and has no merits whatever. I urge my hon. Friends to reject it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> That was pretty disappointing. The Chief Secretary said that members of the court had always been appointed in the past, and inferred that there is nothing wrong with appointing them in the future.
<P>
I repeat a point I have made in previous debates. The Bill will substantially enhance the court's powers, a new structure will be set up and the court will be given an enormous new job. Therefore it cannot be right to roll forward past procedures. We attempted for that reason to put some restraint on the Chancellor of the Exchequer by suggesting confirmatory hearings for these appointments. The Government rejected the idea of restraints being made that way as well as what they would describe as interference by the House of Commons, the Select Committee.
<P>
The Minister leans on the concept of credibility. It does not allow of credibility for the world to know that the Chancellor has complete discretion over the appointments and that under the Bill he will also take powers to interfere in the chairmanship of sub-committees. Credibility comes from avoiding unnecessary interference.
<P>
The Chief Secretary again offered the idea that the chairman of the sub-committee should be a ``leader'' to represent outside interests, suggesting that this should be in the interests of corporate governance. Members of the court are fully aware of good corporate governance. They have a great deal more experience of banking, finance, the City and corporate governance than the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who has no experience of running companies of any size. It is slightly patronising to select these good men and women for their expertise and independence and then say, ``We do not really trust you to adhere to the principles of good corporate governance. You cannot be trusted to avoid a conflict of interest when discussing remuneration, or trusted to select one of your members to stand up for you all, so we shall take powers to impose a chairman on you, if necessary.'' That sends all the wrong messages to everyone and shows a lack of confidence in the court of directors, which the right hon. Gentleman is so proud to promote. I thought that the amendment was rather modest and could be dealt with quickly, but in the light of those wholly inadequate replies, and the underlying philosophy which this short debate has startlingly revealed, we shall press it to a Division.

Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 4</center></H4>
<H4><center>Annual report by the Bank</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 6, in page 2, line 35, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(c) a report by the directors of the Bank on the exercise by the court of directors of their functions under section 16 in relation to the Monetary Policy Committee.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We shall now discuss the matter of the annual report, the type and content of which are, I assume, encapsulated in the clause. The Chief Secretary may tell us later that other requirements are scattered through the Bill; if they are, perhaps he will tell us now. The title of the clause allows us to assume that it sets out in full the requirements for the report, and its content. Surprisingly, the clause omits any reference to an important function of the directors in relation to monetary policy.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
We referred earlier to the Chancellor's letter to the Governor, in which he says that the directors will have the job of reviewing the Bank's performance. However, clause 16 says that the directors
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``shall keep the procedures of the Monetary Policy Committee under review.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So there is an audit and scrutiny role in relation to both procedure and performance. There is an important difference between those two, but they are both to be overseen by the directors. However, their report to the Chancellor, which will be placed before the House, will not include those matters.
<P>
Interestingly, that oversight is not repeated in the notes on clauses. The helpful note on clause 4 states that the report will cover the duties specified in clause 16 and schedule 3 relating to the Monetary Policy Committee. If the notes on clauses are correct--I am certain that it is a better description of what should be contained in the report than what is apparent from the Bill--there is a deficiency in clause 4. I can find nothing in clause 4 relating specifically to those matters. One incidental reference is that the report should contain matters dealt with by the sub-committee under clause 3, but that clause does not refer explicitly to monetary policy. The amendment seeks to correct that omission.

<P>

<B>Mr. Darling:</B> The right hon. Gentleman will be relieved to know that it is not necessary to delve into the schedules of the Bill to find the answer that he seeks. It may be necessary to have a brief look at clause 16, however. Clause 4 requires the Bank to produce an annual report, which would include those responsibilities set out in clause 3. Clause 16, which relates to the Monetary Policy Committee, makes it clear that one of the functions to be covered by the sub-committee under clause 3 is that set out in clause 16. Clause 4 therefore covers not only those matters mentioned in clause 3, but also the function of clause 16--to review the processes followed by the Monetary Policy Committee.
<P>
The amendment is unnecessary. For the avoidance of doubt, it is already anticipated that the Bank's annual report will include not only a review of the matters set out in clause 3 but also the functions imposed on the sub-committee by clause 16 to review the processes and procedures followed by the Monetary Policy Committee. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will be satisfied that the amendment is not necessary, although I agree with his objective.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I want to take up a point made by the Chief Secretary. We are trying to move to an era where legislation is clear to third-party readers. The Bill is not particularly clear. Clause 4 suffers the same problem as previous clauses. I do not know whether it was deliberate, simply hasty drafting, or whether it was decided to incorporate those functions subsequently, but the Government did not bother to move those matters nearer the beginning of the Bill. The monetary policy aspects of the Bill are important; they should be included here and not added in later clauses. If we are moving into an era of clear and plain legislation, such matters should be spelt out. If it means repetition, so be it, but such matters should be spelt out in the principal clauses to which they relate. Therefore, they should be referred to in clause 4.
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> If Opposition Members read the Bill, they will see that it is abundantly clear. Clause 16 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The court of directors of the Bank shall keep the procedures followed by the Monetary Policy Committee under review.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is as clear as day.
<P>
The Bill is drafted in such a way that the monetary policy part of it--and the Monetary Policy Committee--is introduced in part II, which we shall get to one day. It is logical to set out in clause 16 that the procedures of the Monetary Policy Committee, which is referred to in part II, should be kept under review by the Bank. It is equally clear from clause 4 what the annual report must include, which are all the matters delegated to the sub-committee of the court, one of which is referred to in clause 16.
<P>
I do not understand the point being made by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. On the one hand, he says that he wants simple legislation that is easy to understand--this is a short Bill by modern standards--and, on the other he says that it would not matter if certain provisions were repeated. That is difficult to understand. The position is abundantly clear. If Opposition Members care to read the Bill again--I shall be charitable--they will see that it is the model of clarity. If it is enacted, Parliament's intention will be clear understood not just by the court but by the whole world.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I wish that I could play back to the Committee all the right hon. Gentleman's phrases and speeches about the need for clarity of legislation when he was in opposition because this is opaque. The draftsmen may have been instructed that the annual report should include matters relating to monetary policy and the need to scrutinise the Monetary Policy Committe, but, that is far from clear in clause 4, which purports to be an exhaustive list of what will be in the report. We find that we have to go to clause 16, which I referred to in my opening remarks, then to clause 3 and back to clause 4. Attempts at making legislation accessible and clear so that it is easier for laymen or, indeed, specialists, to understand have not succeeded in the drafting of this Bill. It is disappointing, but in the light of what the right hon. Gentleman has said, I shall not press the amendment to a Division because he has given an assurance that the annual report will include the matters that should be covered. However, I still think it very odd that there is discontinuity between the notes on clauses, which refer to clause 16, and clause 4. Doubtless, that will be looked at in due course. Therefore, in the light of the right hon. Gentleman's words, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I have just one question, which again refers to the sub-committee that is to be set up. Will the Chancellor trust the directors to appoint their own chairman, or will the chairmanship and composition of the sub-committee again be laid down by the Government, rather than left to the good sense of those in the Bank of England?
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> It is a matter for the court.

<H4><center>Clause 6</center></H4>
<H4><center>Cash ratio deposits</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 9, in page 3, line 11, at end add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`only after the Government has consulted interested parties on the operation of the provisions set out in that Schedule and laid a report on those matters before the House of Commons.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it may be convenient for the Committee to consider amendment No. 10, in schedule 2, page 19, line 45, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `5A. The total burden of cash ratio deposits levied under this Schedule shall be not more than the highest level of such deposits applying in the twelve months before the Royal Assent was signified to this Act.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> We now come to an important part of the Bill, and I know that my hon. Friends want to contribute to this debate. We are here considering a form of taxation: the levies to be placed upon a number of financial institutions by way of cash ratio deposits. Equally important is the issue of how the burden will be distributed between City institutions. Both of those matters require close scrutiny, because we are effectively giving away powers of taxation, which can of course be altered by the House in future, but only by secondary legislation. We need to discharge our duties with especial care this morning.
<P>
The amendments are intended to ensure that there is adequate consultation, and that that consultation is undertaken and its results reported to the Committee and the House before the Bill is passed. There is no point in us passing a Bill when we are unaware of the outcome of consultation on its provisions. How far has the Chief Secretary got in his discussions with the City, in the light of the intention that the total burden on the banking sector should not rise?
<P>
The consultation document published by the Financial Services Authority last month says on page 7:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Ministers have made clear that, taking account of the recommendations of the Arthur Anderson Report, the combined burden on the banking sector should not rise above the level implied by the present CRD regime, and should preferably fall.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is an important statement, but it is a little difficult to see how the Government can guarantee that that will be the case, because the amount levied through the cash ratio deposits will of course vary in accordance with the amounts deposited. If deposits rise, the volume of cash ratio deposits will also rise, increasing the effective burden on the financial sector. So I wait for clarification on how the Government can deliver on their intention that the overall burden should not rise.
<P>
The other question concerns the distribution of the burden. There has been comment in the City about how the levies are to be extended beyond the banking sector. Building societies will be required to contribute. However, under the logic of the extension, it is not immediately obvious why it should involve only building societies. After all, businesses and financial institutions generally will, we hope, benefit from the Bank's activities, so why in principle should they not contribute to the Bank's funding?
<P>
If banks and building societies are to be required to contribute, someone needs to consider what range of activities are undertaken by both types of institution. Banks have a wide range of functions and products, encompassing much of what building societies do, so perhaps building societies should be assessed on a contribution lower than that for banks. That suggestion has merits, but there may be well-founded objections to it. Until we know more about the discussions between the Government and the City, we are not in a position to agree to the Bill.
<P>
The two amendments are relevant. I have already mentioned the importance of consulting in sufficient time. The aim of amendment No. 10 is to put a limit on the burden. The cash ratio deposits may fall, but many institutions will be required to contribute to the Financial Services Authority.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We want to ensure that the overall burden is, if possible, lower and certainly not higher. That may be the Government's intention, but we need confirmation. The Committee does not want warm intentions; we want it written in the Bill that that is the case. I emphasise that we are talking about taxation, so we need to put a limit on it as well as to decide how the burden will be spread below that limit.
<P>
<B>Mr Ruffley:</B> In supporting the amendment, I draw the Committee's attention to the views expressed to me this morning by several banking partners in leading City law firms--[Interruption.] Hon. Members laugh, but that is an index of their lack of understanding of what commerce and the City think. The prawn cocktail offensive--I know that it was a long time ago--does not seem to have shaped Labour Members' ideas.
<P>
There is a great deal of concern among practitioners. I have no knowledge of their political views, but they have technical worries about the proposal, centring on their belief that the consultation process should genuinely take account of their concerns.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Cranston:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman name the City solicitors from whom he has taken advice?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I do not know what the proprieties are in such matters. I shall not name the partners, as the discussion was in confidence, but the firm was Clifford Chance. There was no political bias; the partners were talking as practitioners about their concerns on the Government's proposals. The firm was speaking on behalf of many other banking practitioners throughout the City.
<P>
The view was expressed that there is a case for publishing all the representations made to the Treasury and the Bank during the consultation process. That may not necessarily be Clifford Chance's corporate view, but one of the partners said that many of his fellow practitioners in other City firms thought that it could be helpful if the representations about cash ratio deposits--an important part of the Bill--are published fully. Will the Government consider publishing the consultation representations, ensuring that the consultation referred to in the Bill is thorough, frank, reasonable and commensurate with the comments of several other practitioners, including Freshfields, Linklaters and Allen and Overy? I hope that the Government will seriously consider the amendment in that spirit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> Has the hon. Gentleman finished his speech?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Yes, but I am happy to give way if the Chief Secretary wants to get something off his chest.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Can we sort out the difference between giving way and resuming one's seat. The hon. Gentleman has completed his speech, but I am sure that the Chief Secretary will deal with the point later.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I echo my hon. Friend's concerns. The Government seem to presume that if an Opposition Member speaks with any knowledge whatsoever it is somehow to be derided. The hon. Member for Dudley, North accused me of assuming vast knowledge of this matter. All I can say is that, in my experience of the world of finance, the more you know, the more you realise what you do not know. Unfortunately, the Government know so little, but what is even more alarming is that the debate has shown that they have no idea how little they know. Nothing demonstrates that more than the way in which their proposals were announced without consultation. This is, above all, an opportunity to redress that on a matter of great technical difficulty. My hon. Friends have referred to several technical problems. The amendment is an opportunity for the Government to demonstrate that they have genuinely overcome their deeply engrained hostility to the City and their deeply engrained suspicion, of which their lack of consultation speaks all too loudly.
<P>
I have not much knowledge of this matter, except that I remember the days when there was a system of reserve deposits under the previous Labour Government. I remember the problems with the corset. I also remember, as someone trying to lend money to British business, the tremendous problems imposed under a difficult system for drafting lending documents.
<P>
I understand the anxiety, which professionals have expressed, that the Bill's structure is likely to make it hard to put together long-term loans. The Government often tell us that the City takes a short-term view, but if they want banks to make long-term loans to companies investing in this country, it is essential that they understand how the system of cash ratio deposits will impact on the total cost of a loan to a company. Such loans are based not only on the interest rate but on the hidden costs of lending to industry.
<P>
There is a need for transparency, which is not evident in what we have heard and seen so far from the Government. There has been no explanation of why this matter is so urgent that consultation can be dispensed with. I have mentioned that the previous Government made some dramatic changes without consultation--for example, the abolition of exchange control--but, of course, effective and rapid action is sometimes required when dealing with the exchange rate markets. In this case, effective and rapid action is the last thing we need. Instead, careful consultation and preparation are needed before the system is put in place.
<P>
If the amendment is rejected, it will say a great deal to the City about the Government's unwillingness to listen. We have heard many times this morning that we are the only people who seem to have a problem with the Bill, and that everyone else thinks it the best thing since apple pie. However, others will realise how ineffective it is and what a waste of time it is to make such points to the Government, because they are not prepared to listen. It is our job to make those points and we shall continue to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Bill will result in the functions of the Bank of England being much reduced. It is therefore incumbent on the Government to make it clear to the financial sector that the costs of the Bank of England will be commensurately reduced. Currently, the cash ratio deposit is 0.35 per cent. of eligible liabilities. It would help the financial sector enormously if, when the Chief Secretary has finished doing his homework today, he told the Committee that the Government do not intend to increase the percentage of cash ratio deposit. Indeed, it would help even more if he said that it would be lower. The present structuring of the cash ratio deposits and the manner in which the Bill will generate profits for the Government through the 25 per cent. dividend could be a nice little earner. It would help if that were to be scotched.
<P>
Schedule 2 and clause 1(1)(c) refer to building societies, which are worried about the lack of consultation. When I first read the schedule, it stood out that building societies had been included, yet they do not come under the Financial Services Authority's regulation. It is odd to see a reference to building societies in the schedule.
<P>
I refer briefly to a letter from Adrian Coles, director general of the Building Societies Association, who says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``given the very wide range of activities which the Bank will undertake in future, it is not clear to us why other financial institutions, and businesses generally, should not also contribute''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Building Societies Association's second worry was that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``if only banks and building societies are to be required to contribute, then in the light of the much wider and more diverse range of activities which banks engage in compared with building societies, consideration needs to be given to whether societies' contributions should be set at a lower scale than banks.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It would help to hear the Chief Secretary's response to those concerns.
<P>
The most important factor, set out in the amendments, is that of charging. Will the Chief Secretary announce today that he will not seek a higher percentage than the current 0.35 per cent?
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> First, we should apologise to the Opposition for criticising their lack of experience.
<P>
I listened with great interest to the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds, who told us of his many contacts with the City and spoke about his breakfast discussions this morning. He was good enough to say that he spoke to Clifford Chance--
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> And others.
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> And others. As far as I am aware, Clifford Chance has made no representations to the Government. I understand that the hon. Gentleman was a solicitor with that firm, so it is not surprising that Clifford Chance should speak to him rather than to us. If Clifford Chance--or anyone else--wishes to make representations to the Government on this matter or anything else to do with the Bill, they are more than welcome to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I spoke to four law firms this morning. They were not expressing a corporate view, and they were not necessarily criticising the Government. They were expressing their hope that the consultation would be transparent and full. They were not aware of the form that the consultation would take, and neither are we. I am making a non-political point on behalf of four or more firms, which genuinely hope that the publication of their above-board representations to the Bank and to Ministers--they have good relations with the Treasury--will be full and free.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Members of Parliament are not paid by the word, so interventions should be brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> The hon. Gentleman is remembering his old profession: solicitors certainly are paid by the word. He must have been an expensive solicitor to consult.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> And your old profession.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. My career is not in the law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> I also note that the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds was a strategic adviser to the Conservative party. He is clearly a man to be reckoned with.
<P>
I agree with the shadow Chief Secretary that this is an important part of the Bill, as it establishes how the Bank of England will be funded in future. The hon. Member for Guildford asked what was the urgency. Unless we establish in statute a basis for funding the Bank of England, its future funding will be uncertain.
<P>
Presently, the Bank of England--an organisation that has evolved over the years--is funded on a voluntary basis. The cash ratio deposits currently lodged with the Bank have no statutory basis. Once lodged with the Bank, there may be some leverage and it has powers of persuasion to encourage institutions to lodge deposits, but if banks are unwilling to play ball, the Bank of England could be left high and dry.
<P>
We considered all the options--fees and charges--and came to the view that the cash ratio deposit system had worked quite well over the past few years, and we are now putting it on a statutory basis. It is therefore necessary to ensure that it is robust and, in particular, that there are no anomalies between the different types of institutions that stand to benefit from the Bank's activities.
<P>
I shall come on to the extension of the cash ratio deposits in a moment. However, I want the Committee to understand how we arrived at the current position. The voluntary system has worked in the past, but it is not safe to assume that it will be reliable in the future. The Government must ensure that the Bank of England has a stable and certain source of income for the future.

<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> It would be helpful if the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central could explain whether he is referring to income or the funding of the Bank. Does he view cash ratio deposits as a means of providing income or as vital liquidity for the Bank? He earlier implied that since the Government came to power, confidence in our central banks may have waned so much that he could only force money to be lent, not rely on voluntary contributions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> I was not saying that at all, as the hon. Gentleman from the look on his face accepts. As I said, the cash ratio deposit scheme has worked perfectly well in the past. The Government do not intend to legislate on the Bank of England again in the near future. We are legislating to reform and modernise it now. Conservative Members would rightly be the first to criticise us if we provided no means of funding it. Under a voluntary system, banks could walk away from it if they chose. We cannot take that risk.
<P>
The Committee will be interested to know--it is no great secret--that we have discussed the matters with the British Bankers Association and the Building Societies Association, and, while no one likes paying money to anyone, it is recognised that the Bank must be funded securely.
<P>
The hon. Member for Guildford raised a slightly different matter; the question of what the money is for. He is right that the Bank needs an income to discharge its functions daily. Incidentally, and for the sake of completeness, the Committee may be interested to know that it receives income from a variety of sources, such as the Treasury, which makes payments in respect of agency services for various functions. There are also payments from other banks and financial institutions in respect of the settlement system. The Bank also has income from its capital and reserves as well as from cash ratio deposits. Of course, the Bank of England has a balance sheet, and has funds available to enable it to intervene, which it does from time to time. The Bank is entitled to intervene in support of its monetary policy objectives.
<P>
All the matters that I have mentioned are reported in the Bank's annual report. Sometimes delay occurs in relation to support operations. The Labour party in opposition accepted, just as, I am sure, the present Opposition will accept, that there are sometimes good reasons for not disclosing that the Bank has been operating in support of a particular institution.
<P>
It may be necessary to report that information after a time lag of a year or two, so as not to prejudice the operation.
<P>
The Bill would oblige the Government to undertake consultation before fixing the level and scope of the cash ratio deposits. I understand why Opposition Members raised questions about the matter. Of course they could not have known about it--other than by reading the Bill. The Government intend to release the consultation document at the beginning of next week. I shall ensure that all Committee members, as well as members of the Treasury Committee, receive a copy. Perhaps on Report, subject to the Speaker's decision, we shall be able to return to that matter.
<P>
The consultation document will set out the scheme and the Government's thinking, and invite banks, building societies and anyone else to submit views on the matters being canvassed. We have made it clear that we intend, with respect to the cash ratio deposits and the supervisory fees that will be payable to the Financial Services Authority, that the overall burden on the relevant sector should be no greater that it is today--preferably lower.
<P>
I want to make it abundantly clear to the institutions concerned, the Bank and the Financial Services Authority that the Government expect them to bear down on the costs. We said repeatedly in opposition and we continue to say in government, that we are conscious of the burden that supervision and regulation can impose. In many ways, financial institutions are happy to pay that price if the level of supervision, and its quality, are good for them and their business--because they are good for the reputation of the United Kingdom and its institutions that are regulated by the Bank or the Financial Services Authority. We are conscious of the cost, and the Governor and Howard Davies, the new chairman of the Financial Services Authority, are aware that the Government--and just about everyone--want to bear down on the costs. We want high-quality, efficient regulation. It will therefore be incumbent on the Bank and the Financial Services Authority to ensure that what they produce is produced efficiently, at the lowest possible cost commensurate with the need for good quality regulation.
<P>
Amendment No. 9 would delay the coming into force of schedule 2 until the Government had undertaken consultation. We are committed to consultation. At the risk of trying Opposition Members, I refer them to schedule 2, paragraphs 1(2) and 5. The orders cannot come into effect until the House has passed an affirmative resolution. Whether that is done in Committee or on the Floor of the House is a matter for the usual channels. Opposition Members accuse the Government of interference, doing things in the dark and not revealing what is going on, but all the matters that I am discussing are new. I am pretty sure that most people did not even know how the cash ratio deposit scheme worked. It was not immediately obvious to the world at large how the sum was fixed. We are ensuring absolute transparency. The Bank of England will be funded by the cash ratio deposit scheme on a statutory basis and the level, or any changes to it, will be considered by the House of Commons. That is a major step forward. It does not apply now, but it will if the Bill is enacted.
<P>
I would reject amendment No. 10 any time. I accept that it may be a probing amendment because the shadow Chief Secretary intended to get an assurance that the costs would not continue to increase. But, he is trying to do that by putting in statute an absolute limit. I am sure that he will agree, having been a Treasury Minister in the past, that it is unwise to put into the Bill something that is unnecessary and pretty inflexible. I can give the right hon. Gentleman the assurance that he wants and which the Committee expects, which is that we intend to bear down on costs because we are conscious of their impact.
<P>
One of the attractions of London and the United Kingdom as a place to do business is the world-wide recognition that our regulatory and supervisory regime is benign. We want to ensure that the costs of that are commensurate with the gain. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds said that he had breakfast with his former colleagues and other solicitors. I can confide that just the other evening, I was speaking to some American bankers whose bank had chosen to locate here precisely because of the UK's attractive financial regulatory regime. That is a great compliment to us. It is a compliment to those who work in the Bank, the Financial Services Authority and the bodies that it is taking over. The Government want to ensure that that regime and benign atmosphere continue. In a world where we are competing with other centres across the globe, it is important to have a robust system that is recognised as being so, and which creates a clean and orderly market for which the charges for regulation are reasonable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> The Opposition welcome much of what the right hon. Gentleman has said. City practitioners are concerned not so much about what the Government are doing but want to ensure that the consultation process is full and open. We all look forward to seeing the fruits of next week's consultation and I personally welcome the right hon. Gentleman's remarks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> I can assure the hon. Gentleman that the consultation process will be full and open. It will, I hope start on Monday, but if not, on Tuesday. We shall be happy to hear from anyone who wants to contribute.
<P>
I urge the Committee to reject the two amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Will the Chief Secretary address the concerns of the Building Societies Association?
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> Yes. We were conscious of two things when we decided to put the cash ratio deposit scheme on a statutory basis. First, it had to be coherent. It would have been impossible for us to confine the scheme to banks alone. That would have been open to challenge because it would be difficult to justify including them but excluding other institutions that operate in the same area. Secondly, we were conscious of the fact that building societies, especially the smaller ones, are in a rather different position from major national banks. That is why we introduced a banding system, thereby ensuring that the smaller building societies are not disproportionately disadvantaged.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and the building societies will see from the consultation paper that we canvassed the possibility of having two to three different bands, according to the size of the institution. The rate applied to each band will be considered, but we are anxious to ensure that the smaller building societies, in particular, who have had a tough time in the past couple of years, are not disadvantaged.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Economic Secretary announced a further measure last week that will help building societies. We want the building society sector to prosper and we want to encourage it because it plays an extremely useful part in the network of financial institutions in this country. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making that point, but the amendments are unnecessary. However, perhaps I can astonish the shadow Chief Secretary by saying that I am grateful to him for raising those points, because it has allowed the Committee to cover matters that are of great interest, especially to banks, building societies and other deposit takers. It is important that people understand the Government's intentions.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> We are making some progress. I am grateful to the Chief Secretary for some of his assurances. I know that the consultation paper will be published shortly. It is unfortunate that the document was not available for the debate, but I accept the Chief Secretary's tentative offer to return to the subject on Report. That is of course, in the gift of the Speaker. However, the Chief Secretary does not object to discussing again the method of distributing cash ratio deposits. The issues are complex. They have been mentioned in the context of building societies, which have legitimate anxieties.
<P>
In the light of the Chief Secretary's assurances, I shall not press amendment No. 9. However, an assurance that the measure cannot be effected until secondary legislation is in place always raises a few hackles. We too often delegate matters to secondary legislation, especially through negative resolution. It means that the relevant measures are passed without hon. Members taking much interest in them. In general, we should confine revenue-raising or quasi-taxation powers to primary legislation. Therefore, I shall press amendment No. 10 to a vote.
<P>
The FSA is to be funded separately by the institution that it regulates. Conditional costs are high, in addition to the underlying revenue costs. Although I ascertained that it was always the intention of the Government and the chairman of the FSA to try to run a lean organisation, there is a danger of over-regulation. We are not considering the FSA today, and I shall not attempt to do that.
<P>
However, the culture that we are moving towards is one of attempting to protect all creditors against all eventualities. There are signs of that tendency in the Bill as well as in the FSA. Until now, the Bank of England regarded one or two bank failures as no bad thing, because they test innovation and risk-taking capacity in the City. A regulatory regime that avoids all risks and tries to ensure the protection of all creditors and deposit holders is in danger of leading to a sclerotic system, which is the enemy of innovation and international competition. Therefore, we shall consider FSA charges later.
<P>
There may be a compensating reduction in CRDs, but we want to ensure that the overall burden of the City, banks and other financial institutions is no greater if one adds the FSA charges to the CRDs. That was the background to amendment No. 10, which has the more modest aim of ensuring that the overall burden grows no greater. In view of what the right hon. Gentleman said, it would be right to cap it in primary legislation by means of that amendment. I beg to ask leave to withdraw amendment No. 9.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 7, in page 3, line 30, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and to the Chairman of the Treasury Select Committee of the House of Commons'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following: New clause 1--Role of Treasury Committee in relation to directors of Bank--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `The Treasury Select Committee of the House of Commons shall, at least twice a year, take oral evidence from the directors of the Bank on the exercise of their functions under this Act.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Amendment No. 7 is self-explanatory. It would extend to the Chairman of the Treasury Committee the powers to receive the necessary documentation. We discussed in earlier debates the role of the Treasury Committee in the Bill and it is right and proper that the right given by the amendment should be extended to the Chairman of that Select Committee.
<P>
New clause 1 builds on an observation in the Treasury Committee's report that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it is unclear how the non-executive members of the Court will conduct their assessment of the Bank and the MPC and how the report which they are required to produce will relate to the Bank's annual report.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>It would be useful to give the Committee the right, as set out in the measure, to take oral evidence from the directors of the Bank on the exercise of their functions and to do so at least twice a year. The proposal would enhance the powers and functions of the Treasury Committee, of which this Committee is generally in favour.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> In opposing amendment No. 7, we nevertheless accept its point rather than its remit. The Chancellor and the Government are anxious that the Chairman of the Treasury Committee is given a proper place in the deliberations. Indeed, we will reflect further on the best way of guaranteeing that, which may involve a ministerial assurance on the Floor on the House. However, we feel that the amendment is too prescriptive.
<P>
I regret that we must ask the Committee to resist the new clause. The Treasury Committee has already said that it wants to call the non-executive members of the court before it to assess the Bank and the Monetary Policy Committee. It would be most unusual for legislation to presume to tell the Treasury Committee what it can and cannot do in relation to other bodies.
<P>
Having made those two brief points, I urge the Committee to resist both amendment No. 7 and new clause 1.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 7 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clauses 8 and 9 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
